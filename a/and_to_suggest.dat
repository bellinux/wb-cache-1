5|$|The United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also {{known as}} the McClellan Committee) was a select {{committee}} created by the United States Senate on January 30, 1957, and dissolved on March 31, 1960. The select committee was directed to study the extent of criminal or other improper practices {{in the field of}} labor-management relations or in groups of employees or employers, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> changes in the laws of the United States that would provide protection against such practices or activities. It conducted 253 active investigations, served 8,000 subpoenas for witnesses and documents, held 270 days of hearings, took testimony from 1,526 witnesses (343 of whom invoked the Fifth Amendment), and compiled almost 150,000 pages of testimony. At the peak of its activity in 1958, 104 persons worked for the committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant {{to lay out the}} current state of the Church, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Sadler went to Europe {{and studied}} {{psychiatry}} {{for a year}} under Sigmund Freud. Sometime between 1906 and 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient with an unusual sleep condition. While the patient was sleeping he spoke to Sadler and claimed to be an extraterrestrial. Sadler spent years observing the sleeping man {{in an effort to}} explain the phenomenon, and eventually decided the man had no mental illness and that his words were genuine. The man's identity was never publicized, but speculation has focused on Sadler's brother-in-law, Wilfred Kellogg. Over the course of several years, Sadler and his assistants visited the man while he slept, conversing with him about spirituality, history, and cosmology, and asking him questions. A larger number of interested people met at Sadler's home to discuss the man's responses <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> additional questions. The man's words were eventually published in The Urantia Book, and the Urantia Foundation was created to assist Sadler in spreading the book's message. It is not known who wrote and edited the book, but several commentators have speculated that Sadler played a guiding role in its publication. Although it never became the basis of an organized religion, the book attracted followers who devoted themselves to its study, and the movement continued after Sadler's death.|$|E

25|$|The {{first factor}} is {{compression}} of the navicular bone under the DDF tendon {{and the back}} of the small pastern bone. Repeated compression in this area can cause cartilage degeneration, with the cartilage flattening and gradually becoming less springy and shock-absorbing. It may also begin to erode. Cartilage degeneration is common in navicular horses, usually along the flexor surface. This finding, and the associated biochemical changes, have led some researchers to conclude that there are elements in navicular disease common to osteoarthritis, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> similar therapeutic regimes.|$|E

25|$|Charles William Woodworth (April 28, 1865 – November 19, 1940) was an American entomologist.

He intended to seek another position in the steel business. In the meantime {{he decided to take}} a long holiday and go on a three-month safari drive across the Sahara with his wife. Just as they were about to depart, John Davies telephoned to tell Adamson {{that he was about to}} leave his job as Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Adamson put his name forward. The Adamsons went on their holiday as arranged, leaving poste restante addresses in Algiers and Cairo, and it was at the latter where Adamson received the letter formally inviting him to take up the post.|$|E
25|$|Evictions in 1943 {{were also}} limited, as {{hundreds}} of Africans told to leave in the Blantyre District refused to leave as there was no land {{for them to go}} to, and the colonial authorities declined to use force. The Governor expected that more would take place in 1948 and also anticipated considerable trouble as in 1943. However, eviction notices were suspended because of the serious famine in 1949 until 1950. By September 1950, enough land had been obtained for resettlement and the evictions proceeded’ although they were resisted. The Governor of Nyasaland therefore set up a committee to review the 1928 ordinance <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> amendments. The committee proposed to end 5-yearly evictions and growing economic crops in lieu of rent, but to increase rents to an economic level, but with reductions for unmarried and other single women.|$|E
25|$|One approach, {{suggested}} by {{writers such as}} Stephen D.

Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously {{suggested by}} proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|Recognising {{the dire}} need of the gas victims, the Permanent Peoples' Tribunal met in 1992 and {{recommended}} that an international medical commission provide an in-depth independent assessment {{of the situation in}} Bhopal. In 1993, the Bhopal Group for Information and Action (BGIA) made a proposal. The International Medical Commission on Bhopal (IMCB) was thus constituted with 14 professionals from 12 countries who were chosen {{on the basis of their}} medical expertise and experience in environmental health, toxicology, neurology, immunology, respiratory medicine and family medicine. Drs. Rosalie Bertell and Gianni Tognoni served as the co-chairpersons of the IMCB. At the request of Carbide gas victim organisations, the IMCB conducted a humanitarian visit to India in January 1994 to contribute in any way possible to the relief of the victims <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> ways to in which such catastrophic accidents could be prevented in the future or their effects mitigated. During their stay, the IMCB met with government officials, various disaster experts, hospitals, research teams, local private physicians, biochemists, botanists, various survivor groups, environmental activists and veterinarians.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of Bonin's defense attorneys, William Charvet and Tracy Stewart, was {{to challenge the}} credibility of numerous prosecution witnesses, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that extremely significant mitigating factors as to {{the root causes of}} Bonin's behavior lay in the extensive physical, sexual, and emotional abuse he had endured throughout his childhood and adolescence. To support this contention, Bonin's defense attorneys summoned an expert on the developmental effects of violence and abuse on children named Dr. David Foster, to testify as to the conclusions of his psychological examinations upon Bonin. Dr. Foster opined that Bonin had, as a result of repeated abandonment, not received the nurturing, protection, and behavioral feedback as a child necessary for sufficient psychological development. This had been so consistent and prevalent, Foster stated, that Bonin held a confusion as to the differences between violence and love. In a direct rebuttal, the prosecution summoned a forensic psychiatrist and expert in both impulse disorders and sexual sadism named Dr. Park Dietz, who testified that the overall pattern of Bonin's behavior was inconsistent with an inability to control his impulses. Dr. Dietz further testified as to Bonin's actions being reflective of planning as opposed to impulsive behavior. In summary, Dr. Dietz concluded that Bonin was a sexual sadist, and that although Bonin suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, neither of these conditions had impaired his ability to control his actions.|$|E
