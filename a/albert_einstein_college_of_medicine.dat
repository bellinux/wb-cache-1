Don Johnson of the New York Society for Ethical Culture and Tom Haines the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Partnership for Responsible Drug Information introduced the moderator Kathy Rocklen. Judge Sweet of the Southern District of New York is joined by experts on drug policy from the medical and academic worlds, private foundations and other interested organizations, who will give their views on the impact of drug policy on the justice system and on human rights. Judge Sweet believes the current policy of criminalizing the use and the commerce of particular mind-altering substances has failed of its purposes, has weakened the justice system, and impinged upon human rights. Judge Sweet believes that criminal sanctions should be removed and our society should be educated about the use of drugs, all drugs, and that to the extent that drugs create a problem for the society, that problem be considered an issue of public health. Judge Sweet’s remarks are followed by a question and answer period in which panelists and the audience will participate, as well.

40|$|Proper {{resolution}} of stalled replication forks {{is essential for}} genome stability. Purification of FBH 1, a UvrD DNA helicase, identified a physical interaction with replication protein A (RPA), the major cellular singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) ?binding protein complex. Compared with control cells, FBH 1 -depleted cells responded to replication stress with considerably fewer double-strand breaks (DSBs), a dramatic reduction in the activation of ATM and DNA-PK and phosphorylation of RPA 2 and p 53, and a significantly increased rate of survival. A minor decrease in ssDNA levels was also observed. All these phenotypes were rescued by wild-type FBH 1, but not a FBH 1 mutant lacking helicase activity. FBH 1 depletion {{had no effect on}} other forms of genotoxic stress in which DSBs form by means that do not require ssDNA intermediates. In response to catastrophic genotoxic stress,  apoptosis prevents the persistence and propagation of DNA lesions. Our findings show that FBH 1 helicase activity is required for the efficient induction of DSBs and apoptosis specifically in response to DNA replication stress. Fil: Jeong, Yeon Tae.

There are reports of the steroid-sparing effect of anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab for ABPA in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), {{but there is little}} information on its efficacy against ABPA in patients with bronchial asthma without CF. Objective: To examine the effects of omalizumab, measured by asthma control, blood eosinophilia, total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), oral corticosteroid requirements, and forced expiratory volume spirometry in patients with ABPA and bronchial asthma. Methods: A retrospective review of charts from 2004 &ndash; 2006 of patients treated with omalizumab at an academic allergy and immunology practice in the Bronx, New York were examined for systemic steroid and rescue inhaler usage, serum immunoglobulin E levels, blood eosinophil counts, and asthma symptoms, as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Results: A total of 21 charts were screened for the diagnosis of ABPA and bronchial asthma. Four patients with ABPA were identified; two of these patients were male. The median monthly systemic corticosteroid use at 6 months and 12 months decreased from baseline usage. Total serum IgE decreased in all patients at 12 months of therapy. Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory vital capacity at one second (FEV 1) was variable at 1 year of treatment. There was an improvement in Asthma Control Test (ACT) symptom scores for both daytime and nighttime symptoms. Conclusions: Treatment with omalizumab creates a steroid-sparing effect, reduces systemic inflammatory markers, and results in improvement in ACT scores in patients with ABPA.

Crumbs 3 (CRB 3) is a component of epithelial junctions that has been implicated in apical-basal polarity, apical identity, apical stability, cell adhesion and cell growth. CRB 3 undergoes alternative splicing to yield two variants: CRB 3 a and CRB 3 b. Here, we describe novel data demonstrating that as with previous studies on CRB 3 a, CRB 3 b also promotes the formation of tight junctions. However, significantly we demonstrate that the 4. 1 -ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) binding motif (FBM) of CRB 3 b is required for CRB 3 b functionality and that ezrin binds to the FBM of CRB 3 b. Furthermore, we show that ezrin contributes to CRB 3 b functionality and the correct distribution of tight junction proteins. We demonstrate that both CRB 3 isoforms are required for the production of functionally mature tight junctions and also the localization of ezrin to the plasma membrane. Finally, we demonstrate that reduced CRB 3 b expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) correlates with cytoplasmic ezrin, a biomarker for aggressive disease, and show evidence that whilst CRB 3 a expression has no effect, low CRB 3 b and high cytoplasmic ezrin expression combined may be prognostic for HNSCC.

Gov'tAntibody {{diversification}} through {{somatic hypermutation}} (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) are similarly initiated in B cells with {{the generation of}} U:G mismatches by activation-induced cytidine deaminase but differ in their subsequent mutagenic consequences. Although SHM relies on the generation of nondeleterious point mutations, CSR depends on the production of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their adequate recombination through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). MLH 1, an ATPase member of the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery, is emerging as a likely regulator of whether a U:G mismatch progresses toward mutation or DSB formation. We conducted experiments on cancer modeled ATPase-deficient MLH 1 G 67 R knockin mice to determine the function that the ATPase domain of MLH 1 mediates in SHM and CSR. Mlh 1 (GR/GR) mice displayed {{a significant decrease in}} CSR, mainly attributed to a reduction in the generation of DSBs and diminished accumulation of 53 BP 1 at the immunoglobulin switch regions. However, SHM was normal in these mice, which distinguishes MLH 1 from upstream members of the MMR pathway and suggests a very specific role of its ATPase-dependent functions during CSR. In addition, we show that the residual switching events still taking place in Mlh 1 (GR/GR) mice display unique features, suggesting a role for the ATPase activity of MLH 1 beyond the activation of the endonuclease functions of its MMR partner PMS 2. A preference for switch junctions with longer microhomologies in Mlh 1 (GR/GR) mice suggests that through its ATPase activity, MLH 1 also has an impact in DNA end processing, favoring canonical NHEJ downstream of the DSB. Collectively, our study shows that the ATPase domain of MLH 1 is important to transmit the CSR signaling cascade both upstream and downstream of the generation of DSBs.

Anatomy and Structural Biology, <b>Albert</b> <b>Einstein</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Medicin, New York Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{is a new}} and innovative anticancer therapy utilizing cytotoxic ROS produced after irradiation of a photosensitizer with visible light, to kill the cancer cells. Light activation of the ER-associated photosensitizer hypericin results in the rapid loss of ER Ca 2 + homeostasis which leads to ER-stress and subsequent mitochondrial apoptosis. In this study we show that the generation of apoptotic doses of ROS by PDT results in the rapid shutdown of the Akt-mTOR pathway followed by the induction of macroautophagy. Pharmacological inhibition of macroautophagy with 3 -methyladenine or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Atg 5 in human cancer cells suppresses macroautophagy and increases the apoptotic fraction of PDT-treated cells, defining macroautophagy as a cell survival mechanism in this paradigm of oxidative stress. Intriguingly, chronic inhibition of macroautophagy by the knock-out of Atg 5 does not only inhibit macroautophagy but also hampers caspase activation in response to PDT in both normal or transformed MEFs. This cytoprotective effect {{could be attributed to}} an increased capacity of Atg 5 -deficient cells to remove oxidized proteins as compared to their wild type counterparts. We have identified chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) as the lysosomal pathway for the efficient clearance of oxidized and toxic proteins in PDT-treated cells, which is upregulated in cells chronically deprived of macroautophagy. CMA-deficient cells are extremely sensitized to PDT-induced cell death, thus suggesting that this pathway functions as a first line defence against ROS damage. This study further suggests that pharmacological inhibition of autophagy mechanisms in ROS-damaged cancer cells may becomes an attractive intervention to improve the clinical application of PDT and possibly other anticancer modalities utilizing ROS as primary damaging agents. status: accepte...|$|R
