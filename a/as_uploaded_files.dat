40|$|Abstract — File cloud {{provides}} file storages on the Internet {{and manages}} them {{for people to}} access and manipulate their contents like documents, pictures, and movies anywhere and anytime. There are various smart devices such as tablets, smart phones, and smart pads, which can utilize file cloud services. In this paper, we introduce a social file cloud system as one of tools for collaboration between people in the workplace. We extend basic file cloud service by adding social factors such as tags, score, and comments to a file into a social file cloud service, that is, “cocoBox”, which means a file box for communication and collaboration. CocoBox provides the basic functionalities of file cloud service such <b>as</b> <b>file</b> <b>upload</b> and <b>file</b> download. In addition, we focus on social factors of files to help collaboration among people who share same files. Whoever shares a specific file with others can add tags, give score, and add/remove his/her opinion on that file. Therefore, cocoBox enhances communication and collaboration among people with these social factors. Keywords-file cloud; REST; service component; score; tag; comment; collaboratio...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} bright fluorescence {{of nitrogen}} (NV) - and silicon-vacancy color centers in pyramidal, single crystal diamond tips which are commercially available as {{atomic force microscope}} probes. We coherently manipulate NV electronic spin ensembles with T_ 2 = 7. 7 (3) μs. Color center lifetimes in different tip heights indicate effective refractive index effects and quenching. Using numerical simulations, we verify enhanced photon rates from emitters close to the pyramid apex; a situation promising for scanning probe sensing.

40|$|Simple models, in {{information}} theoretic terms, are {{those with a}} small stochastic complexity. We study the stochastic complexity of spin models with interactions of arbitrary order. Invariance with respect to bijections within the space of operators allows us to classify models in complexity classes. This invariance also shows that simplicity {{is not related to}} the order of the interactions, but rather to their mutual arrangement. Models where statistical dependencies are localized on non-overlapping groups of few variables (and that afford predictions on independencies that are easy to falsify) are simple. On the contrary, fully connected pairwise models, which are often used in statistical learning, are highly complex because of their extended set of interactions.

This is because all the transactional information is stored in the data centers of the third party company that provides the invoicing web app. This proprietary information can be regulated by the customer in order to control how much transactional information the vendor is allowed to see.
