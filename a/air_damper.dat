In this study,pyrolysis of EFB and PKS were investigated by using a direct heated pyrolysis reactor. The comparison of the conversion bio-oil obtained from this two different type of sample were studied. Since,a good EFB samples are very limited, the study of effect on reactor temperature and heating rate to the conversion of bio-oil was investigated by using PKS sample. The reaction temperature examined in this study was varied in the range of 300 - 500 oC. Meanwhile, <b>air</b> <b>damper</b> setting in the range of 2. 0 - 4. 0 with a constant fuel setting at 19 mmbar were studied. In addition,the competiveness of the direct heated reactor also was investigated by making the comparison in term of percentage of bio-oil conversion with electric heated reactor used worldwide. For the conversion of bio-oil between EFB and PKS, PKS recorded higher yields of bio-oil compared to EFB.

An experimentally validated Monte Carlo simulation approach for the simulation of <b>air</b> <b>damping</b> is developed and employed for this study.

The strategy controls the outdoor air by only one damper while keeping the remaining dampers full open. The discharge or recirculation <b>air</b> <b>damper</b> is modulated to control the amount of outdoor air introduced into the system while keeping the two remaining dampers full open. Since at least two dampers are always kept fully open during the occupied times, the strategy can provide a minimum static pressure drop in economizer dampers and results in minimum energy use in return and supply fans.

Since building occupants may adapt to the symptoms of these faults, such as reduced room air temperature, and thus may not complain about them, the occurrence of such faults are not immediately apparent unless a FDD system is available.
