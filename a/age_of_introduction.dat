40|$|A {{total of}} 192 {{children}} who presented with coeliac disease to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children from 1960 - 85 were reviewed {{in order to}} investigate the frequency and the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> presentation. There was a clear peak {{in the number of}} children presenting from 1971 - 5, and although the numbers declined subsequently they have remained at a level similar to numbers found before 1971. There was no difference in the mode of presentation but there was a definite increase in the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> presentation over the time period reviewed. Breast fed babies presented later than bottle fed babies (14 compared with 9 months) despite a similar <b>age</b> <b>of</b> gluten <b>introduction.</b> Similarly bottle fed babies and breast fed babies presented later after 1975 (10. 5 compared with 7 months, and 18 compared with 9. 5 months, respectively).

40|$|Research {{investigating}} {{the association of}} infant dietary factors with later health outcomes often relies on maternal recall. It is unclear what the effect of recall bias is on {{the accuracy of the}} information obtained. The present study aimed {{to determine the extent of}} recall bias on the accuracy of infant feeding and food allergen data collected 10 years later. MethodsMothers were recruited from a prospective birth cohort from the Isle of Wight. When their child was 10 years of age (2011 / 2012), mothers were requested to complete a retrospective infant feeding questionnaire asking the same questions as those solicited in 2001 / 2002. ResultsIn total, 125 mothers participated. There was substantial agreement for recollection of any breastfeeding (κ = 0. 79) and the duration of breastfeeding from 10 years earlier (r = 0. 84). Some 94 % of mothers recalled accurately that their child had received formula milk. The exact age at which formula milk was first given was reliably answered (r = 0. 63). The brand of formula milk was poorly recalled. Recall of <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> of solid food was not reliable (r = 0. 16).

A alimentação complementar é influenciada por complexos fatores sociais, econômicos e culturais. OBJETIVO: Verificar a idade de introdução de alimentos complementares no primeiro ano de vida, e sua relação com variáveis demográficas e socioeconômicas. MÉTODOS: Estudou-se uma coorte de crianças nascidas em Hospital Universitário do Município de São Paulo. A verificação da idade de introdução de alimentos foi feita a partir de fichas preenchidas pela mãe, diariamente, onde constavam os alimentos oferecidos à criança a cada dia, até o final do seguimento. A introdução dos alimentos foi descrita utilizando-se a técnica de análise de sobrevida de Kaplan & Meier, e a análise de associação entre idade de introdução dos alimentos e as variáveis independentes foi feita pelo modelo de análise multivariável de Cox. RESULTADOS: As idades medianas de introdução de água ou chá, leite não materno, frutas, verduras e legumes, cereais e tubérculos foram menores de 6 meses. Foram verificadas associações estatisticamente significativas entre escolaridade materna, renda familiar, trabalho materno e introdução de alguns alimentos. CONCLUSÃO: Houve introdução precoce de água ou chá e de leite não materno. Além da renda e do trabalho materno, a escolaridade materna parece ser a variável que mais influencia a introdução de alimentos complementares. INTRODUCTION: Nutrition is {{an important}} aspect in the growth and development of infants {{in the first year}} of life. Complementary feeding is a complex process that is influenced by social, economic and cultural factors. OBJECTIVES: To verify the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> of complementary food {{in the first year of}} life, and its relation with demographic and socioeconomic variables. METHODS: A cohort of children born in a University Hospital in the Municipality of Sao Paulo was studied. The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> of foods to the infants was verified through a form that mothers filled out every day with the foods offered to their children, until the end of the follow-up. The introduction of foods was described using the Kaplan & Meier life table analysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE - To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that breast-feeding is a protective factor against IDDM and that early exposure to cow's milk is {{a risk factor for}} the disease. RESEARCH DESIGN and METHODS - A case-control study was conducted in São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 346 diabetic children, aged < 18 years, were identified in two institutions in the city of São Paulo. Duration of exclusive breast-feeding and <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> to cow's milk products in infant diet were compared with 346 sex-, age-, and neighborhood-matched control children. All comparisons between diabetic and control children were done using paired tests. RESULTS - Statistically significant differences were found for the duration of exclusive breast-feeding (P = 0. 007) and for the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> to cow's milk products (P = 0. 047).

In a population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life onward, information about duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding and timing <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid foods was obtained from delivery reports and questionnaires. Blood pressure, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), left atrial diameter (LAD), aortic root diameter (AOD), left ventricular (LV) mass, and fractional shortening (FS) were measured at a median <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 6. 0 y (95 % range: 5. 6 - 7. 4 y). Analyses were based on 5003 children. <b>Age</b> at <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid foods was negatively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 6 y. Compared with children who had ever been breast-fed, never-breast-fed children had a higher carotid-femoral PWV (β: 0. 13 m/s; 95 % CI: 0. 03, 0. 24 m/s), a smaller LAD (β: 20. 29 mm; 95 % CI: 20. 55, 20. 03 mm), and less LV mass (b: 21. 46 g; 95 % CI: 22. 41, 20. 52 g) at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 6 y.

40|$|Background: Early <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid {{food has}} been {{suspected}} to induce excessive infant energy intake and weight gain. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to test whether <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid foods influences energy intake or growth. Design: Healthy, formula-fed infants who were recruited in 5 European countries were eligible for study participation. Anthropometric measurements were taken at recruitment and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo. Time <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid foods and energy intake were determined by questionnaires and 3 -d weighed food records at monthly intervals. <b>Age</b> at <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid food was categorized into 4 groups: ≤ 13 wk, 14 - 17 wk, 18 - 21 wk, and ≥ 22 wk. Results: Of 1090 recruited infants, 830 (76 %) had data available for <b>age</b> at first <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid food, and 671 (61 %) completed the study until 24 mo <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> The median <b>age</b> at <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid food was 19 wk. The time <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solid foods was associated with country, sex, birth weight, parental education and marital status, and maternal smoking. Energy intake was higher in the first 8 mo of life in children with solid-food intake. Solid-food introduction did not predict anthropometric measures at 24 mo. Growth trajectories differed significantly: children with solid-food introduction in the first 12 wk experienced early catch-up growth, whereas those introduced to solid food at > 22 wk <b>of</b> <b>age</b> grew more slowly and stayed on lower trajectories.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the rates of exclusive breast feeding, the age of formula and solid food introduction and the maternal factors affecting these among neonates followed up in our Well-baby Clinic. Material and Method: Hundred children who were followed up in Well-baby Clinic between 7. 4. 2004 to 20. 11. 2006 were included in this prospective study. The duration of exclusive breast feeding and the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> of solid foods or formula were recorded. The inşuence of maternal educational level, age and parity on exclusively breast feeding in first six months was evaluated. Results: The rate of initiation of breast feding after birth was 98 %, at 4 th and 6 th months exclusive breast feeding rate was found to be 63 % and 46 % respectively. The mean duration of exclusive breast feeding and the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> of formula was found to be 4. 67 ± 1. 63 and 3. 7 ± 1. 6 months respectively. The solid foods were introduced at a mean age of 5. 37 ± 0. 8 months and the average breast feeding duration was found to be 12 months. When mothers were compared for exclusive breast feeding for six months and maximum duration of breast feeding regarding maternal educational level, age and parity, there was not a statistically significant difference for education and age. The rates of exclusive breast feeding and average breast feeding duration of mothers having three or more children were found to be statistically significantly higher than the other group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: We concluded that maternal age and education did not affect the duration of breast feeding and exclusive breast feeding for six months but as the parity increased the tendency for breast feeding increased.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This case-control study conducted on 60 infants with established congenital heart disease. They were subdivided into cyanotic and acyanotic groups, and each group includes 30 patients compared with thirty apparently healthy infants of matched age, sex, and social class. Serum antigliadin antibodies levels were measured using ELISA. RESULTS: The mean <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> of cereals in the diet and appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms were six months. On comparison with controls, patients showed highly significant higher serum levels of antigliadin antibodies (P < 0. 000).

In high HIV {{prevalence}} resource–constrained settings, exclusive breastfeeding {{with early}} cessation {{is one of}} the conceivable interventions aimed at the prevention of HIV through breast milk. Nevertheless, this intervention has potential adverse effects, such as the inappropriateness of complementary feeding to take over breast milk. The purpose of our study first was to describe the nature and the <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> complementary feeding among early weaned breastfed infants up to their first birthday and second was to assess the nutritional adequacy of these complementary foods by creating a child feeding index and to investigate its association with child nutritional status. METHODS. A prospective cohort study in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, was conducted in HIV-infected pregnant women who were willing to breastfeed and had received a perinatal antiretroviral prophylaxis. They were requested to practice exclusive breastfeeding and initiate early cessation of breastfeeding from the fourth month to reduce breast milk HIV transmission. Nature and <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> introductory complementary feeding were described in infants up to their first birthday by longitudinal compilation of 24 -hour and 7 -day recall histories. These recalls were done weekly until 6 weeks <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> monthly until 9 months <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> and then quarterly. We created an index to synthesize the nutritional adequacy of infant feeding practices (in terms of quality of the source of milk, dietary diversity, food, and meal frequencies) ranging from 0 to 12. The association of this feeding index with growth outcomes in children was investigated. RESULTS. Among the 262 breastfed children included, complete cessation of breastfeeding occurred in 77 % by their first birthday, with a median duration of 4 months. Most of the complementary foods were introduced within the seventh month of life, except for infant food and infant formula that were introduced at age 4 months. The feeding index was relatively low (5 <b>of</b> 12) at <b>age</b> 6 months, mainly as a result of insufficient dietary diversity, but was improved in the next 6 months (8. 5 of 12 at 12 months <b>of</b> <b>age).</b> Inadequate complementary feeding at age 6 months was associated with impaired growth during the next 12 months, with a 37 % increased probability of stunting. CONCLUSION. Adequate feeding practices around the weaning period are crucial to achieving optimal child growth. HIV-infected women should turn to early cessation of breastfeeding only when they are counseled properly to provide adequate complementary feeding to take over breast milk. Our child feeding index could contribute to the assessment of the nutritional adequacy of complementary feeding around the weaning period and therefore help to detect children who are at risk for malnutrition. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims. Food allergy (FA) is {{a common}} disease that is rapidly {{increasing}} in prevalence for reasons that remain unknown. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the clinical characteristics and anthropometric data of patients with food allergies followed in a tertiary centre of allergy and immunology. Methods. A retrospective study was performed that assessed the data records of patients with food allergy diagnosis, covering a period from February 2009 to February 2012. Results. 354 patients were evaluated in the period; 228 (69. 1 %) patients had a confirmed FA diagnosis. The z-scores for weight-for-age, height-for-age, and body mass indices-for-age showed lower significant values in the FA group compared with the non-FA group by Mann-Whitney test, with significance values of P= 0. 0005, P= 0. 0030, and P= 0. 0066, respectively. There were no statistical differences in sex, gestational age, birth type, breastfeeding period, and <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> of complementary formulas based on cow milk protein between groups. Conclusion. FA patients had a lower growth rate in comparison with patients without FA. The early recognition of food allergies with the establishment of protein-implicated diet exclusion, in association with an adequate nutrient replenishment, is important to reduce the nutritional impact of food allergies...|$|E

40|$|Food {{preferences}} {{have been}} identified as a key determinant of children’s food acceptance and consumption. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify factors that influence children’s liking for fruits, vegetables and non-core foods. Participants were Australian mothers (median age at delivery = 31 years, 18 – 46 years) and their two-year-old children (M = 24 months, SD = 1 month; 52 % female) allocated to the control group (N = 245) of the NOURISH RCT. The effects of repeated exposure to new foods, maternal food preferences and child food neophobia on toddlers’ liking of vegetables, fruits and non-core foods and the proportion never tried were examined via hierarchical regression models; adjusting for key maternal (age, BMI, education) and child covariates (birth weight Z-score, gender), duration of breastfeeding and <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> to solids. Maternal preferences corresponded with child preferences. Food neophobia among toddlers was associated with liking fewer vegetables and fruits, and trying fewer vegetables. Number of repeated exposures to new food was not significantly associated with food liking at this age. Results highlight the need to: (i) encourage parents to offer a wide range of foods, regardless of their own food preferences, and (ii) provide parents with guidance on managing food neophobia...|$|E

40|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and {{childhood}} brain tumors (CBT) are 2 {{of the most}} common forms of childhood cancer, but little is known of their etiology. In 2 nationwide case-control studies we investigated whether breastfeeding, <b>age</b> <b>of</b> food <b>introduction,</b> or early diet are associated with the risk of these cancers. Cases aged 0 - 14 years were identified from Australian pediatric oncology units between 2003 and 2007 (ALL) and 2005 and 2010 (CBT) and population-based controls through nationwide random-digit dialing.
