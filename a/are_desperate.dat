5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E
5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Lylat System, General Pepper {{contacts}} the Star Fox Team, asking them to investigate the invasion of the Dinosaur Planet. Since the team <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> for money and maintenance, Fox McCloud agrees to take a look, arriving unarmed at Pepper's request to avoid trouble with the locals. On the planet's surface, Fox obtains and wields the magic staff which Krystal lost it earlier. Fox learns from the Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that Scales stole four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples. To prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, Fox restores the stones to the temples, {{with the help of the}} Queen's son, Prince Tricky. As Fox retrieves the stones, he discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet and save Krystal. When Fox finds the last of the spirits, he discovers that it is guarded by Scales himself. However, just as Fox and Scales engage in combat, a mysterious voice orders Scales to surrender the spirit, to which he reluctantly agrees. Fox takes the spirit to the Krazoa Shrine and frees Krystal.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

25|$|The {{first human}} {{victory of the}} {{so-called}} Butlerian Jihad is the destruction of Earth and the Earth Omnius using atomics. Iblis (now Grand Patriarch of the Holy Jihad) and Serena (Priestess of the Jihad) are the religious leaders of the human rebellion, and Xavier and Vorian its two generals. The brutal Titans <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> to break free of their machine masters and wage their own techno-misanthropic war, and Omnius and Erasmus are determined to conquer and destroy all of humanity once and for all.|$|E
25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} set in the mid-1950s, shortly after Bergman's award win at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival for Smiles of a Summer Night. After his return to Stockholm, Bergman feels {{compelled}} to go to a cinema and watch a Hollywood blockbuster movie. As he exits the cinema, he inexplicably finds himself transported to Hollywood, where a limo driver is waiting to take him to a film studio. The studio's executives, who give Bergman a lavish welcome, <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> to entice him to stay in Hollywood and make movies for them, the American way: [...] "We're not hicks, but we must deliver kicks." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewing the {{divergent}} narratives on {{the identity}} of the self-immolation victims, historian David Ownby concluded that [...] "although the arguments of Falun Gong practitioners seem cogent, {{it is very difficult to}} arrive at a final judgment about the self-immolation.... there <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> people in China (and elsewhere) who will do anything for money (which would go to their families in this case, one supposes, unless the authorities had promised to rescue them before the flames could do harm). Or the entire event could have been staged. But it seems just as possible that those who set themselves on fire might have been new or unschooled Falun Gong practitioners, had discovered and practised Falun Gong on their own (and badly) in the post-suppression period, and, for whatever reason, decided to make the ultimate sacrifice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Katharine Birbalsingh {{has written}} of the {{problems}} she perceives in many community schools. She cites the impossibility of effective classroom management, bad teachers who cannot be dismissed, and government policies encouraging [...] "soft" [...] subjects. Birbalsingh has visited schools in Jamaica and India where pupils <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> to gain the kind of education to which pupils in her own school (and their parents) were indifferent. She was a deputy head teacher in south London until she spoke at a Conservative Party conference in 2010 and was quickly sacked. Frank Chalk, who taught at an inner-city school for ten years before resigning in frustration, makes similar claims.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the week}} prior to announcing his candidacy, Colbert {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} talk shows to promote his book I Am America (And So Can You). [...] During these interviews, he parodied potential candidates' standard approach to a White House run, giving broad and generally unprompted hints towards a campaign on shows like Larry King Live. [...] "A lot of people see this book as testing the waters for a run for political office," [...] he told King in an October 14, 2007 interview. On the same day, Colbert took over The New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd's column, which he used to engage in similar speculation: [...] "I know why you want me to run, and I hear your clamor...Nevertheless, I am not ready to announce yet â€“ even though it's clear that the voters <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> for a white, male, middle-aged, Jesus-trumpeting alternative." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album. It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that one thing you can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she was thinking about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E
2500|$|Smythe's {{place in}} Alexander Pope's The Dunciad comes {{primarily}} from this play. [...] In the second act, Smythe quoted eight lines of Pope's poetry. [...] It appears that Pope had given and then revoked permission {{for the use}} of the lines, but Smythe went ahead anyway. [...] This earned him Pope's wrath, and he was already despised by the other Tory wits. [...] In The Dunciad of 1727, Pope presents Moore as a [...] "phantom poet" [...] whom all the book sellers <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> to court. [...] This is partially because of the piracy (Moore does not indicate his source or credit Pope), but it is more because Thomas Lintot offered Moore Smythe the incredible sum of Â£105 for the publication rights to the play. [...] (In contrast, Leonard Welsted had had a much greater theatrical success in 1726 with The Dissembled Woman and had received only Â£30 for the publication rights.) [...] Lintot probably suspected that the controversy would mean sales and that Moore was a new Whig hero. [...] On the last score, at least, he would have been correct.|$|E

2500|$|An {{incident}} {{that took place}} on Golden State Freeway June 17, 1992, brought public attention {{to the existence of}} organized crime rings that stage auto accidents for insurance fraud. These schemes generally consist of three different levels. At the top, there are the professionalsâ€”doctors or lawyers who diagnose false injuries and/or file fraudulent claims and these earn the bulk of the profits from the fraud. Next are the [...] "capper (insurance fraud)s" [...] or [...] "runners", the middlemen who obtain the cars to crash, farm out the claims to the professionals at the top, and recruit participants. These participants at the bottom-rung of the scheme <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> people (poor immigrants or others in need of quick cash) who are paid around $1000 USD to place their bodies in the paths of cars and trucks, playing a kind of Russian roulette with their lives and those of unsuspecting motorists around them. According to investigators, cappers usually hire within their own ethnic groups. What makes busting these staged-accident crime rings difficult is how quickly they move into jurisdictions with lesser enforcement, after a crackdown in a particular region. As a result, in the US several levels of police and the insurance industry have cooperated in forming task forces and sharing databases to track claim histories.|$|E
2500|$|Penn and Teller {{often have}} skits and stunts {{performed}} {{with them on}} set or use stock footage to combine reasonable arguments with straightforward, entertaining ridicule. For example, the [...] "Sex, Sex, Sex" [...] episode may be satirizing the media's obsession with sex appeal by having the hosts constantly surrounded by naked actors and actresses. Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against whatever they are debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves {{would like to believe}} these things are true, and showing compassion to the people who do think the things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who <b>are</b> <b>desperate</b> for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this love to get money from people, and deliver false messages {{that have nothing to do}} with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
