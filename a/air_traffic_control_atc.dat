5|$|The game {{is set in}} a {{reproduction}} of 11,000 square miles of the San Francisco Bay Area. The player may land at or takeoff from the area's 46 airports. Weather conditions such as rain, wind and fog are simulated. Players share the game's airspace with up to 600 artificially intelligent (AI) planes, which fly and respond to the player in real-time. Real-time <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> (<b>ATC)</b> directs the player and the AI planes to prevent collisions. The player interacts with the ATC and with other planes by constructing radio messages with a menu. Three cockpit views are available: IFR (instrument flight rules), which allows the player to monitor and interact with all flight instruments; VFR (visual flight rules), which features a larger windshield area but fewer flight instruments; and Virtual Cockpit View, which allows free look but features no interactive flight instruments. External camera angles are also available, and the player may ride as a passenger in any AI plane.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} implementation of a novel Flight Management System (FMS) to ensure onboard passenger safety of commercial aircraft in the event of an emergency scenario where the pilot must relinquish control of the aircraft (e. g. hijacking or loss of cabin pressure). In such situations, the flight management system autonomously pilots the aircraft to a predefined destination whilst taking into account potential hazards such as terrain (in low altitude scenarios), aircraft dynamic constraints, and flight objectives with real-time constraints present. Furthermore, the FMS must ensure that the Human Decision Maker (HDM) (e. g. <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> or <b>ATC)</b> has sufficient time to intervene if they do not agree with automated onboard decisions. The proposed FMS shows that the inclusion of intelligent planning capabilities onboard commercial aircraft can assist in improving safety for the aircraft and onboard passengers in the event of emergencies by allowing the aircraft to continue operating autonomously in a management by exception paradigm. This approach has been demonstrated in this paper through simulation using a commercial aircraft model operating in low altitude partially known environments...|$|R

40|$|This short paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the approach developed within the MEFISTO project. An important element in the approach is the use of formal models and their integration with other, less formal, techniques. MEFISTO (Modelling, Evaluating and Formalising Interactive Systems using Tasks and interaction Objects) is a European Commission IVth Framework Reactive Long Term Research Esprit project. Its main goal is to investigate how the use of formal techniques can be introduced into the design of interactive safety-critical systems, such as <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> applications (<b>ATC).</b> Also important is the evaluation of the design notations, computer support tools and the developed ATC prototypes. This type of application engenders an integrated satisfaction of both usability and safety requirements, as in some circumstances a human error can threaten human life. This means that the design of the interactive ATC environments provided to controllers requires the use of rigorous techniques and systematic methods that allow designers to identify possible problematic situations in advance and help in providing support to the end users. In addition, the use of formal techniques can provide precise documentation and can support representations of design rationale. To make the use of formal models more affordable, in MEFISTO we have paid particular attention to the use of software tools in order to ease their development and analysis, so yielding useful information for the designers in various phases of the design process. However, we are aware that formal techniques cannot cover all the needs in the design cycle. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} what other informal techniques should be used and how their integration with formal approaches should be carried out...|$|R
40|$|Both {{perceived}} organizational {{support and}} job stresses have impact on employees’ work outcomes. Great progresses {{have been made}} in past researches. However, there are many disputes about the impact of perceived organizational support (POS) on job performance (especially, safety performance), the impact of job stresses on job performance (especially, safety performance) and job attitudes, as well as the interaction of subordinates’ POS and job stresses, and the impact of supervisor on subordinates’ POS et al [...] Thus, the aim of the study is to explore the impact of supervisors’ POS, leader-member exchange(LMX) on subordinates’ POS, the direct impact of subordinates’ POS and job stressors from task and rewards on work attitudes(job satisfaction, turnover intention) and safety behaviors(safety compliance and safety participation), and the interaction of subordinates’ POS and job stresses. Analyses are based on the data from interviewing of 20 staff, posts of a Chinese civil aviation Bulletin Board System (BBS) and surveys of 216 subordinates and 42 supervisors from two Chinese civil aviation <b>Air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> centers (<b>ATC).</b> The major findings are listed as follows: Firstly, the exchange relationship between supervisors and members has impact on subordinates’ POS by the fully mediating role of subordinates’ perceived supervisor support (PSS). But supervisors’ POS have no impact on subordinates’ POS. Secondly, subordinates’ POS has a direct and positive impact on their job satisfaction and safety behaviors, and a negative impact on turnover intention. Specifically, the higher the employees’ perceived organizational support, the higher job satisfaction and safety behaviors, as well as the lower turnover intention they have. Moreover, POS has stronger relationship with safety participation behaviors than that of safety compliance behaviors. Thirdly, task-related stressor has no significant impact on job satisfaction, turnover intention and safety behaviors. And compensation-related stressor has significant and positive impact on turnover intention and safety behaviors, which means that with the compensation-related stress increases, turnover intention increases, safety behaviors including safety compliance and safety participation also increases. Fourthly, POS and task-related stressor, POS and compensation-related stressor have significant interaction, respectively. Specifically, POS moderates the relationship between task-related stressor and job satisfaction, and between task-related stressor and turnover intention. Moreover, POS also moderates the relationship between compensation-related stressor and safety compliance behaviors. 员工知觉到的组织支持和工作压力都会对员工的工作结果产生影响。尽管目前有关的研究已经取得一定进展，但关于组织支持感对工作绩效的作用、工作压力对工作绩效和工作态度的作用、组织支持感与工作压力两者的交互作用、以及主管对下属的组织支持感的影响等问题还存在很多争议。因此，本研究通过三个研究，探讨了主管的组织支持感、领导-成员交换关系对下属的组织支持感的影响，分析了下属的组织支持感、工作任务、薪酬回报压力对工作态度变量（工作满意感、离职意向）和安全行为的预测作用，以及组织支持感调节薪酬回报压力、工作任务压力与工作结果变量的关系。研究通过对民航业从事管制工作的 20 名人员的访谈、民航专业网站信息的内容分析，以及 216 名普通管制员和 25 名主管的问卷调查，得出的主要结论如下： 第一，在下属组织支持感的影响因素方面，领导-成员交换关系通过下属的主管支持感的完全中介影响下属的组织支持感，而主管的组织支持感对下属的组织支持感没有显著影响。 第二，组织支持感对于工作满意感、离职意向、安全行为分别有显著的直接预测作用。组织支持感越高，工作满意感越高，而离职意向越低，安全遵守行为和安全参与行为也越多，且组织支持感对安全参与行为的预测作用大于对安全遵守行为的预测作用。 第三，工作任务压力对工作满意感、离职意向、安全行为均没有显著的直接作用。薪酬回报压力对离职意向、安全行为均有显著的正向预测作用，具体来说，薪酬回报的压力越大，离职意向越高，安全遵守行为和安全参与行为越多。 第四，组织支持感与工作任务压力、薪酬回报压力存在交互作用。具体来说，组织支持感调节工作任务压力与工作满意感的关系，以及工作任务压力与离职意向的关系；并且调节薪酬回报压力与安全遵守行为的关系...|$|R
40|$|At {{this moment}} the global human wealth {{is getting to}} the next level, which means a growing amount of people is able to travel by plane and these growth figures are seen in the latest global annual passenger’s flows. These latest {{developments}} demand building new airports and extending the existing airports heavily {{around the world in}} the nearby future (10 years), subsequently resulting in a higher demand of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> towers (<b>ATC</b> towers). <b>Air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> towers are very unique buildings. Most countries possess only one or a few towers and the specific knowledge of the technical and functional design of these towers are owned by a few consultants around the world. One of these consultants is Royal HaskoningDHV. However these (Dutch) designers do not possess knowledge about the entire global construction market and geological conditions, making it very difficult to design an optimal ATC tower in a certain country. From this specific design difficulty, the overall objective of this thesis research is to perform an international investigation regarding the main local influences in order to provide an economical optimal structural design methodology for ATC towers which can be used to design these towers anywhere around the globe. The main research question which follows from the research objective is: “What are the local influences on the structural design of an <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> tower and how do they relate with an economical optimal structural design?” First, an investigation has been performed in order to select a few representative countries that will cover the scope for this thesis research. Based on motivated reasons the chosen countries are: the Netherlands, Nigeria, Japan, China, Turkey and Indonesia. On basis of a literature study the main structural characteristics for high and tall building design are investigated. The lateral forces caused by wind and earthquake action are the most vital forces for structural design and the structures must provide enough structural reliability. Next, the local building codes of the chosen countries are compared and it has been examined that all the codes contain the same factors and approaches as the Eurocode (European building standard), which is used along the research. To be able to perform this complex international research, the elementary design process is chosen as a sequential guidance in order to obtain economical optimal structural concepts around the globe. By simulating these concepts (case studies) with designs and calculations, the behaviour can be qualified and relations can be made between the local influences and structural design. This process starts with a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental design principles of ATC towers. It is concluded that ATC towers are the most important buildings on the airport domain regarding the guidance and safety of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> in the proximity of an airport, providing all the facilities and utilities <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers need to operate. Even with advanced radar technical and camera technology this guidance is mainly done (and will be done in future) by visual observation and these towers give the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers the best view over active pavement. The towers consist of three basic components; the control cab, tower shaft and base building, each having their own primary function. Next, the fundamental requirements for ATC towers facilities are determined. They are drafted by the two major aviation authorities in the world, the FAA and ICAO. In addition to these requirements; desires, starting points and boundary conditions are determined for ATC tower design. The stated desires and starting points are applicable for every ATC design in a general manner, whereas the local boundary conditions have their own influence and importance on every individual ATC design. The following four local boundary conditions are found {{to be the most important}} to determine: 9 ̆ 5 Current and projected future air activity airport 9 ̆ 5 Wind climate 9 ̆ 5 Earthquake hazard 9 ̆ 5 Construction industry For each of the six countries these boundary conditions are determined, by examining literature and conducting interviews with experts in the Netherlands and in foreign countries. It is found that for each country different results are obtained. After the analysis, wherein all the necessary information in a diverging process was gathered in order to design an ATC tower, choices are made in order to achieve targeted optimal design solutions. This choice determination is done by applying a converge process with a self-developed methodology which is performed on basis of three main aspects; structural optimum solutions, labour optimum solutions and material optimum solutions. The input variables for this converge process are directly related with the specific boundary conditions found for each country, resulting in different possible optimal structural solutions as output of this converging process. Next, these optimal structural solutions are simulated to understand and to quality how the local boundary conditions relate with the structural design characteristics. E. g. how does an earthquake load compare with a wind load in certain countries, or how does a steel variant compare with a concrete variant. Unfortunately it is not possible to determine which structural design is the most economical solution, but this thesis research provides a design methodology which gives the designers a direction towards the most optimal solution when they take the specific cost aspects into account. The report closes with two kinds of recommendation: themes for follow-up research based upon the issue are which are not elaborated in detail in this report and some advices for using the design methodology as described.
