Dissimilarity is then measured in terms of the distance between the optimally trimmed distributions.

The proposed extension involves the design of subexperiments that include attributes plus summary evaluations of reamining constructs.

For all but the "embarrassingly parallel" problems, the performance depends upon the level of granularity that can be achieved on the computer platform. Our computational particle physics applications require machines that can support a wide range of granularities, but in general, compute-intensive state-of-the-art projects will require finely grained distributions. Of the different types of machines available for the task, we consider cluster computers. The use of clusters of commodity computers in high performance computing has many advantages including the raw price/performance ratio and the flexibility of machine configuration and upgrade. Here we focus on what is usually considered the weak point of cluster technology; the scaling behaviour when faced with a numerically intensive parallel computation. To this end we examine the scaling of our own applications from numerical quantum field theory on a cluster and infer conclusions about the more general case.
