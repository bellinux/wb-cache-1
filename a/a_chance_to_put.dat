25|$|Two plays {{after the}} turnover, Buffalo {{defensive}} back Mark Kelso intercepted a pass from Moon {{and returned it}} 28 yards to the Oilers 18-yard line, setting up Norwood's 27-yard field goal to increase their lead to 17–3. Buffalo's defense forced another turnover on Houston's ensuing drive when Derrick Burroughs recovered a fumble from receiver Haywood Jeffires on the Oilers 26-yard line. The Bills now had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away, but Norwood hit the uprights on a 36-yard field goal attempt.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the second half, Arsenal came out on top, {{constantly}} pressing for an equaliser. They were denied two penalties by referee Lee Probert before they finally got an equaliser in the 71st minute, with centre-back Laurent Koscielny bundling a header from Bacary Sagna over the line following a corner. Many believed that a goal kick should have been given instead of a corner as it appeared that substitute Yaya Sanogo got the last touch. In the 79th minute, Gibbs had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Arsenal in front when he had just goalkeeper Allan McGregor to beat, but he could not hit the target, shooting high of the goal. Arsenal had another chance for a winning goal in injury time, but Olivier Giroud's shot was saved by McGregor.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} {{play of the}} third quarter, Bledsoe's 39-yard {{completion}} to Glenn led to a 46-yard field goal from Vinatieri, cutting their deficit to 7-6. After a punt from each team, the Steelers had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away with a drive to the Patriots 1-yard line. On fourth down, coach Bill Cowher tried to ice {{the game with a}} conversion attempt, but Stewart was stuffed for no gain with 3:24 left in regulation. This gave New England one last chance to drive for a winning field goal and they managed to reach their own 42, but rookie linebacker Mike Vrabel stripped the ball from Bledsoe, and fellow linebacker Jason Gildon recovered it. The Patriots managed to get it back with 34 seconds left, but linebacker Levon Kirkland intercepted Bledsoe's Hail Mary pass on the game's final play.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the final}} quarter, the Raiders took a 14–12 lead {{at the end of}} an 80-yard drive {{highlighted}} by Chester's 27-yard catch. On the last play, van Eeghen scored his second 1-yard touchdown run of the day. Later on, the Raiders had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away when they recovered a fumble from Sipe on the Browns 24-yard line with 4:19 left in the game. But after moving to a third and 1 situation on the 15, van Eeghen was stuffed for no gain on two consecutive plays. On the second play after the turnover, Sipe completed a 29-yard pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome and later a 23-yarder to Greg Pruitt. Then Mike Pruitt ran the ball 14 yards to the Raiders 14-yard line. Pruitt gained another yard on the next play, and the team called a timeout from the 13 with 49 seconds left.|$|E
25|$|Exhibiting his {{trademark}} poise {{in front of}} an unfriendly crowd during a tough second-round game against Louisville, Law again provided a number of big shots. Hitting 13 of his 15 free-throw attempts, he ended the game with 26 points, including the final two points of the game. The Aggie's 72–69 victory earned them a berth in the Sweet 16 {{for the first time since}} 1980. In a show of good sportsmanship, Law spent time after the game consoling disappointed Louisville freshman Edgar Sosa, complimenting him on his performance. On March 22, however, Law and his teammates faced the #2 seed Memphis Tigers. The score was close throughout and Law had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> A up by three on a break away lay up that he missed with just a few seconds to play. The Aggies lost in a narrow contest 65–64, ending his collegiate career.|$|E

He was {{on good terms}} with the crown prince, Mohammed Baqir Mirza (born 1587; better known in the West as Safi Mirza). In 1614, however, during a campaign in Georgia, the shah heard rumours that the prince was conspiring against him with a leading Circassian, Farhad Beg Cherkes. Shortly after, Mohammed Baqir broke protocol during a hunt by killing a boar before the shah had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his spear in the animal. This seemed to confirm Abbas' suspicions and he sunk into melancholy; he no longer trusted any of his three sons. In 1615, he decided {{he had no choice}} but to have Mohammed killed. A Circassian named Behbud Beg executed the Shah's orders and the prince was murdered in a hammam in the city of Resht. The shah almost immediately regretted his action and was plunged into grief.|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E
500|$|With Schneider still injured, Luongo {{started the}} first game of the series. There was concern that Kesler would also be unable to play in Game 1. When asked about Kesler, Vigneault joked, [...] "We've got him locked in a back room. We're feeding him raw meat. The beast will be ready tonight." [...] Luongo started strong, holding the Sharks {{scoreless}} in the first period despite the Canucks being outshot 6–1 in the first 4:06 of the game. Vancouver took a 1–0 lead midway through the second, though San Jose tied the game shortly after and added two more goals in the third to win the game 3–1. Luongo finished with 25 saves, Kesler played over 21 minutes, registering only two shots and finishing as a –1. Leading up to Game 2, Kesler vowed to be better. It was also rumored he had the flu in Game 1. Schneider was still unable to play, and there were concerns he would not be traveling with the team to San Jose for Game 3. In Game 2, the Canucks trailed 1–0 after two periods of play. In the third period, Kesler scored a power play goal to tie the game and six minutes later, capitalized on a Sharks turnover to put Vancouver up 2–1. With Canucks leading late, San Jose pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. With the net empty, Jannik Hansen had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away but missed the net. Shortly after with the play in Vancouver's end, Henrik Sedin attempted to make a pass to the middle of the ice which resulted in a turnover. On the ensuing play, a Dan Boyle shot deflected off Alexander Edler and through the pads of Luongo. The puck stopped short of the goal line, but Patrick Marleau tapped the puck in to tie the game. In overtime, a blocked shot led to an odd man rush for the Sharks, resulting in Raffi Torres scoring the game-winning goal. The loss put the Canucks down 2–0 in the series. Vancouver had never won a series after losing the first two games.|$|E
500|$|The Crimson Tide finally {{responded with}} a 13-play, 75-yard drive, {{including}} a 4th-and-4 conversion with a 4-yard catch by Eddie Lacy, to score on a 2-yard touchdown run by T. J. Yeldon. A appeared primed to continue their scoring barrage, but turned the ball over on downs at the Alabama 32-yard line. Taking over at their own- 33, an 18-yard completion from McCarron to Christion Jones and an 18-yard run by Lacy moved {{the ball to the}} A -31. Six plays later, Lacy scored on a 2-yard touchdown run, trimming the deficit to 20-14 at halftime. [...] On their second possession of the second half, Alabama stormed {{all the way to the}} A 11-yard line, but had to settle for a 28-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal that made the score 20–17 as the teams entered the fourth quarter. In the fourth, finishing the drive following Shelley's field goal, Taylor Bertolet connected on a 29-yard field goal, extending their slim lead to 23-17. Following an Alabama three-and-out, A had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away, [...] but Bertolet missed one from 37 yards out. On the drive that ensued, McCarron connected with Amari Cooper for a 50-yard gain into A territory, but on the very next play Yeldon lost a fumble. Manziel completed a 42-yard pass to Swope and then a 24-yard touchdown pass to Malcome Kennedy for a 29–17 lead following a missed two-point conversion. Alabama responded on their next possession. Starting at their own- 6, Alabama reached their own -46, then a 54-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Cooper to cut the Aggies lead to 29–24. After the defense forced a punt, McCarron hit Kenny Bell for a 54-yard gain to the A 6-yard line. On 3rd-and-goal from the -5, a broken play turned into a 3-yard gain after a crazy McCarron scramble. However, on 4th-and-goal, McCarron threw an interception that gave A possession at the Aggies' four-yard line. On the possession that ensued, the Alabama defense forced an Aggies punt with 0:40 left in the game, but an offside call on Alabama gave the Aggies a first down and sealed their 29–24 victory. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Aggies to 3–2.|$|E

2500|$|Madame Nhu's brother-in-law, Ngo Dinh Diem, {{had been}} {{appointed}} Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by her mother's distant cousin, Emperor Bảo Đại, after the French had been defeated at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the south. After the French defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, the French wanted {{to hang on to}} a zone of influence in the south by keeping the Emperor Bảo Đại, while the Americans wanted to push the French out by having Diem create a republic [...] Diem in the words of an American diplomat had developed [...] "a blind hatred of the French" [...] and the Americans believed that South Vietnam needed an anti-Communist leader who was not tainted with any associations with the French, which led them to back Diem. Madame Nhu had lobbied Bao Dai to appoint her brother-in-law Prime Minister and believed that it was her influence that led to the appointment. She was deeply shocked to learn the real reason why Bao Dai had appointed Diem Prime Minister was out of the expectation that he would fail in order to neutralize him as the State of Vietnam was in a serious political and economic crisis by 1954 that almost nobody expected Diem to master, and she never forgave either the Emperor or the French for their plot to ruin Diem. In order to ensure American support for Diem, Madame Nhu befriended Americans working at the embassy in Saigon known to be CIA agents. For their part, the French backed General Nguyễn Văn Hinh as Prime Minister, and he in his turn had won the support of the Binh Xuyen crime syndicate that dominated the economic life of Saigon. Giving Madame Nhu an additional reason to intrigue against Hinh was his repeated boasting when he deposed Diem he would make Madame Nhu into another of his concubines. At a party, Madame Nhu confronted Hinh to tell him: [...] "You are never going to overthrow this government because you don't have the guts. And if you do overthrow the government, you will never have me because I will claw your throat out first!" [...] To win support for Diem, Madame Nhu hit upon the idea of enlisting support from the million or so refugees, many of them Catholics who fled to the south after the Geneva accords had partitioned Vietnam, organizing them for a massive pro-Diem demonstration on 21 September 1954. The rally in Saigon led a confrontation on the streets between Madame Nhu and Binh Xuyen gunmen, with Nhu daring the thugs to kill her right then and there, which caused them to demurr, and the rally went on. Emboldened by this triumph, Diem saw <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his puritanical Roman Catholic values into practice and to strike a blow at the Binh Xuyen at the same time by shutting down the brothels, gambling houses and opium dens of Saigon owned by the Binh Xuyen while having pornographic magazines burned on the streets (the Binh Xuyen were the largest producers and sellers of pornography in Vietnam).|$|E
