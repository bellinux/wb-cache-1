5|$|A ring Roxy {{inherited}} from Archie, which went missing at Christmas, is planted in Janine's flat. Marsden receives an anonymous tip-off and Janine is arrested after the ring {{is found in}} her teapot. She is interviewed, but is released {{due to lack of}} evidence. She realises that Peggy planted the ring in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> her. When Shirley thinks Phil is seeing another woman, she accuses him of only being interested in her for her alibi. He says it is not true, but she drunkenly threatens to withdraw the alibi, and walks to the police station.|$|E
5|$|His admissions {{were not}} {{produced}} by oppression or coercive conduct {{on the part}} of the Gardaí. Neither were the admissions produced as a result of anything in the nature of a bribe or inducement. There was no deliberate <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> Dean Lyons. However, Dean Lyons was able to provide accurate details of murders it is now accepted that he did not commit, due to the manner in which he was interviewed by gardaí. He wished to associate himself with the murders and readily agreed to leading questions which were asked by interviewing gardaí.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy {{to move her}} to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E
25|$|Christie's {{autobiography}} {{makes no}} reference to her disappearance. Two doctors diagnosed her as suffering from amnesia (see fugue state), yet opinion remains divided as to why she disappeared. Biographer Laura Thompson suggested that Christie let this out in the six novels that she wrote between 1930 and 1956 under the nom de plume Mary Westmacott, in a style quite different from her regular detective stories. She {{was known to be}} in a depressed state from literary overwork, her mother's death earlier that year, and her husband's infidelity. Public reaction at the time was largely negative, supposing a publicity stunt or <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> her husband for murder.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the {{disappearance}} of Keimes, Haarmann had returned to his Neue Straße apartment, having served six months in a labour camp for several acts of theft he had committed in August 1921. Upon his return, Haarmann discovered that Grans had stolen much of his personal property and fraudulently obtained and spent his military pension while he had been incarcerated. This resulted in a violent argument between the two men, culminating in Haarmann evicting Grans. Shortly thereafter, Grans and a criminal acquaintance named Hugo Wittkowski had returned to and further ransacked the apartment. It is likely Haarmann committed this murder in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> Grans in reprisal for the theft of his property and pension.|$|E

25|$|German {{newspaper}} publisher and political scientist Josef Joffe suggests five classic {{aspects of the}} phenomenon: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the United States responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit {{the influence of the}} United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one's society off from its polluting products and practices. Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti-Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous ideological current, comparable to anti-Semitism. Anti-Americanism has also been described as an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> the consequences of U.S. policy choices as evidence of a specifically U.S. moral failure, as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death he was a Cuban marxist revolutionary in Mexico trying to {{organize}} the overthrow of the Cuban government of General Gerardo Machado. This cause was an embarrassment to the Cuban Communist Party, which was trying to gain power by establishing a modus vivendi with Machado. What further disturbed the Cuban communists was that they felt he had fallen under Leon Trotsky's influence. Mella was assassinated on January 10, 1929, while walking home late at night with photographer Tina Modotti. The Mexican government tried to implicate Modotti in the murder, even releasing nude photographs of her by Edward Weston in an attempt to generate public opinion against her. Muralist Diego Rivera played a very active role in defending her and exposing the Mexican government's crude <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> her. It is unclear whether Mella was murdered by the dictatorial Cuban government; if his death had been brought about by Trotsky-Stalin Communist Party feuding; or by a combination of these mutual interests. It is widely speculated that he died by the notoriously bloody hand of Vittorio Vidali.|$|E
500|$|Simon Price from The Independent {{said that}} the tour [...] "is a triumph of hydraulics, bungee rope {{acrobatics}} and cutting-edge choreography." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} setlist consisting of mainly current songs implied that Madonna was doing [...] "a paranoid <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> herself as part of the present and not the past? The irony here is that, given the ever-decreasing spirals of pop revivalism, in order to be truly contemporary, rather than eschewing her past, Madonna would need to be ripping herself off circa 1984." [...] John McAlley from Entertainment Weekly commented that the music was [...] "loud, energetic, well-sung, and perhaps a little too often beside the point" [...] and that [...] " [...] struggle to rise above its [...] theatrics." [...] He added that one will be [...] "awed by Madonna's palpable life force and intelligence. [...] There are plenty of reasons to bow at this artist's feat." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that [...] "through the concert, Madonna made a display of arrogance, tossing off profanities, striking tough postures and glaring more often than she smiled. She represents self-love backed by plenty of gym time and a whole troupe of devoted flunkies, all laboring to delight an audience she only seems to disdain. Music makes the people come together, she sang in the finale– together, that is, if Madonna is clearly in charge." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian felt that [...] "with its perfect dance routines, special effects, devoted audience and hint of bullish arrogance, the Drowned World show befits the world's most famous woman." ...|$|E

500|$|Bart {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} fans of children's {{television}} host Krusty the Clown. He once declared, [...] "I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings," [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He has helped the clown on many occasions, for example, foiling Sideshow Bob's <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> Krusty for armed robbery in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (season one, 1990), reuniting Krusty with his estranged father in [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". and helping Krusty return to the air with a comeback special and reignite his career in [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". For his part, Krusty has remained largely ignorant of Bart's help and treats Bart with disinterest. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, which turned out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but is soon pushed over the edge, and finally decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart. One of the original ideas for the series was that Bart worshiped a television clown but had no respect for his father, although this was never directly explored. Because of this original plan, Krusty's design is basically Homer in clown make-up. When Bart foiled Sideshow Bob's plans in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted", it sparked a long-standing feud between the two. The writers decided to have Bob repeatedly return to get revenge on Bart. They took the idea of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner and depicted Bob as an intelligent person obsessed with catching a bratty boy. Bob has appeared in fourteen episodes, generally plotting various evil schemes which often have to do with getting revenge on Bart (and sometimes the entire Simpson family by proxy), but is always foiled in the end.|$|E

2500|$|Lynsey {{gets back}} into Silas's [...] "bad books" [...] {{when he finds}} her looking at his {{hospital}} records. Silas then tries to scare Lynsey off with a menacing warning. In August 2011, Rawle confirmed that Silas would start terrorising Lynsey. Rawle explained that Silas is intent on discrediting Lynsey as she knows he is a killer. He said [...] " [...] job {{over the next few}} weeks, it's like a war of attrition - [...] going to wear her down and send her mad." [...] Lynsey is determined to see Silas punished for his crimes as the investigation into India's murder gathers pace. Of this, Hassan told Inside Soap [...] "When Silas realises that Lynsey is on his case again, he basically tells her to bring it on." [...] Silas [...] "gets off" [...] on the idea that Lynsey is trying to stop him from killing again and Hassan said [...] "it makes the game a lot more interesting". Lynsey's suspicions are reconfirmed when she sees Silas among the press at a televised appeal about India's attacker. Lynsey frames Silas by planting India's necklace on him before ringing the police anonymously. Hassan said that Lynsey hopes Silas's [...] "web of lies" [...] will unravel. Lynsey's <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> him backfires.|$|E

60|$|The above <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> a stricter {{definition}} of the science than what are commonly received as such, may be thought to be of little use; or, at best, to be chiefly useful in a general survey and classification of the sciences, rather than as conducing to the more successful pursuit of the particular science in question. We think otherwise, and for this reason; that, with the consideration of the {{definition of}} a science, is inseparably connected that of the philosophic method of the science; the nature of the process by which its investigations are to be carried on, its truths to be arrived at.|$|E
6000|$|... § 3. It deserves {{particular}} notice, {{that the}} theorem or speculative truth is not ripe for {{being turned into}} a precept, until the whole, and not a part merely, of the operation which belongs to science, has been performed. Suppose that we have completed the scientific process only {{up to a certain}} point; have discovered that a particular cause will produce the desired effect, but have not ascertained all the negative conditions which are necessary, that is, all the circumstances which, if present, would prevent its production. If, in this imperfect state of the scientific theory, we <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> a rule of art, we perform that operation prematurely. Whenever any counteracting cause, overlooked by the theorem, takes place, the rule will be at fault; we shall employ the means and the end will not follow. No arguing from or about the rule itself will then help us through the difficulty; there is nothing for it but to turn back and finish the scientific process which should have preceded the formation of the rule. We must re-open the investigation to inquire into the remainder of the conditions on which the effect depends; and only after we have ascertained the whole of these are we prepared to transform the completed law of the effect into a precept, in which those circumstances or combinations of circumstances which the science exhibits as conditions are prescribed as means.|$|E
60|$|I am {{conscious}} that I shall be found still more faulty {{in the tone}} of keeping and costume, by those who may be disposed rigidly to examine my Tale, with reference to the manners of the exact period in which my actors flourished: It may be, that I have introduced little which can positively be termed modern; but, on the other hand, it is extremely probable that I may have confused the manners of two or three centuries, and introduced, during the reign of Richard the First, circumstances appropriated to a period either considerably earlier, or a good deal later than that era. It is my comfort, that errors of this kind will escape the general class of readers, and that I may share in the ill-deserved applause of those architects, who, in their modern Gothic, do not hesitate to introduce, without rule or method, ornaments proper to different styles and to different periods of the art. Those whose extensive researches have given them the means of judging my backslidings with more severity, will probably be lenient in proportion to their knowledge of the difficulty of my task. My honest and neglected friend, Ingulphus, has furnished me with many a valuable hint; but the light afforded by the Monk of Croydon, and Geoffrey de Vinsauff, is dimmed by such a conglomeration of uninteresting and unintelligible matter, that we gladly fly for relief to the delightful pages of the gallant Froissart, although he flourished at a period so much more remote from the date of my history. If, therefore, my dear friend, you have generosity enough to pardon the presumptuous <b>attempt,</b> <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> for myself a minstrel coronet, partly out of the pearls of pure antiquity, and partly from the Bristol stones and paste, with which I have endeavoured to imitate them, I am convinced your opinion of the difficulty of the task will reconcile you to the imperfect manner of its execution.|$|E
