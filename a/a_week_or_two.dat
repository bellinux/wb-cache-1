5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no more than <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

25|$|A leaflet called Settling Down on Civvy Street {{was issued}} to POWs {{after they had}} been back in Britain for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> This timing was {{intended}} to catch their attention when the initial excitement of repatriation had subsided and POWs might begin to experience some frustration or have questions.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation is {{heaviest}} {{in autumn}} and winter, with a marked {{reduction in the}} summer months, a microclimatic condition of the city center compared {{to the rest of}} the region.

25|$|Abu Ubaida {{ordered all}} the Muslim commanders to {{withdraw}} from all the conquered areas, return the tributes that they previously gathered, and move towards Yarmuk. Heraclius's army also moved towards Yarmuk. The Muslim armies reached it in July 636. <b>A</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later, around mid July, the Byzantine army arrived. Khalid's mobile guard defeated Christian Arab auxiliaries of the Roman army in a skirmish.|$|E

Even then, there would be a risk of the new line's being swept away. This was daunting, because money was short and he had no margin to provide against {{expensive}} accidents. When he took the contract he had trusted much to luck, and now his luck was bad.|$|R

25|$|Fake Patty's Day – Every Year, usually <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> before St. Patrick's Day, Aggieville {{becomes a}} scene of festivity, celebrating 'Fake Patty's Day'. The event {{has been around for}} many years, and was adopted by the {{licensed}} venues of Aggieville to avoid missing out on revenue garnered from St. Patrick's Day, which usually falls on the weekend before or during spring break.|$|E
25|$|On 17 August 2015, SCDF {{serviceman}} Pte Shek Salmin Bin Murad {{committed suicide}} at around 1am {{because of an}} alleged abuse of authority by his superior, and problems he was facing at home. Shek alleged that he was given four days’ detention for being late; and <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> after {{he was released from}} detention, he was charged for being late again, and was supposed to get charged on Monday 17 August, the date that he committed suicide. SCDF extended condolences.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the Minor Counties {{played a}} minimum of eight matches, until recent times of two days duration, and few of them played more than 12 matches. Usually the matches were fairly local, against {{neighbouring}} counties, rather than against distant teams, and matches were often played in batches so that amateur players could time their holidays from work {{to take part in}} several games over a period of <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> When they competed, the first-class county second elevens often played many more games.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation. It was rather {{expensive}} at first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker's bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> gruel. But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.|$|R
50|$|Other {{possible}} numeric indicators which convey specific meanings are 24/7 (twenty-four hours a day, {{seven days}} <b>a</b> <b>week)</b> <b>or</b> 2-4-1 (<b>two</b> {{for the price}} of one); the latter is used by 241 Pizza by advertising local number 241-0-241 or a variant.|$|R
60|$|It may {{perhaps be}} thought that, {{considering}} the not very elaborate {{structure of the}} following volumes, {{they might have been}} finished sooner. But it will be found, on reflection, that the ranges of inquiry engaged in demanded, even for their slight investigation, time and pains which are quite unrepresented in the result. It often required <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> hard walking to determine some geological problem, now dismissed in an unnoticed sentence; and it constantly needed examination and thought, prolonged during many days in the picture gallery, to form opinions which the reader may suppose to be dictated by caprice, and will hear only to dispute.|$|R
25|$|The most {{promising}} candidates {{are invited to}} return {{for a second or}} third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a test week, in which the performer plays with the orchestra for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.|$|E
25|$|The {{association}} employs ten full-time umpires, paired up {{into five}} two-man crews. These umpires service the league as a whole; {{there are not}} separate umpiring crews for each conference. Depending on the flexibility of all ten umpires, the leagues does its best to rotate the game and location assignments. There are also temporary umpires that float in and out in a reserve role. Some of these umpires come {{from the ranks of}} Minor League Baseball and college's Big XII Conference, joining the league for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> while passing through the St. Louis area.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people are}} managed through day surgery centers, {{and are able}} to return to work within <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> while intense {{activities}} are prohibited for a longer period. People who have their hernias repaired with mesh often recover in a number of days, though pain can last longer. Surgical complications include pain that lasts more than three months, surgical site infections, nerve and blood vessel injuries, injury to nearby organs, and hernia recurrence. Pain that lasts more than three months occurs in about 10% of people following hernia repair.|$|E
60|$|The Siwash {{prepared}} the meal and remained behind with Mr. Barclay {{when it was}} over, while the two boys went down stream with a rod he had lent them which Harry insisted Frank should take. There were, he urged, plenty of trout in the river near his father's ranch, though it was very seldom he had leisure to go after them. They wandered on some distance beside the water, which ran almost west toward the Pacific, and wherever the forest was a little thinner the slanting sunrays streaming between the serried trunks smote along it. Frank, who had, as it happened, once <b>or</b> twice got <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> fishing in the East, kept his eyes open, {{but it was only}} twice that he fancied he noticed the faint dimple made by a short-rising trout.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the worlds}} of {{business}} and development, the word [...] "facilitation" [...] or the expression [...] "to facilitate someone" [...] have fundamentally different meanings in Uganda from those in Europe or the US. In Uganda, it most often means paying them for something. It is often a payment in part to cover some expenses, but {{is expected to go}} beyond just the [...] "out-of-pocket" [...] costs the recipient has incurred. Sometimes it can amount to the equivalent of <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> wages just for attending a meeting for a day <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> In business in Europe or the US, it usually means to help organise progress amongst a group of people in some way and almost never involves paying them anything. This is rather about helping them by doing preparation and analysis; by chairing and minute-taking at meetings and by mobilising, coaching and advising.|$|R
25|$|Marlovians (as {{those who}} {{subscribe}} to the theory are usually called) base their argument on supposed anomalies surrounding Marlowe's reported death and on the significant influence which, according to most scholars, Marlowe's works had on those of Shakespeare. They also point out the coincidence that, despite their having been born only two months apart, {{the first time the}} name William Shakespeare is known to have been connected with any literary work whatsoever was with the publication of Venus and Adonis just <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> after the apparent death of Marlowe.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{suffered}} serious {{medical problems}} {{in his old}} age, specifically deafness and chronic diarrhea, which his physician blamed on his exposure to artillery fire and {{his time in the}} swamps along the Chickahominy River during his military service. He also suffered from constant pain in his right sciatic nerve, attributed to his old war wound suffered at Chancellorsville, as well as his wound in the gluteal region. Almost every spring and fall, he suffered from chills and fever lasting <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> and confined him to bed. He also had occasional episodes of jaundice for which he took calomel, citrus of magnesia and an unknown type of Indian medicine.|$|E
25|$|Salmon was the {{preferred}} food of the Stó:lō and {{was seen as}} superior to other types of meat. Meat and salmon were classified differently and salmon was said to give individuals energy while meat makes you feel heavy and lazy. In order to have salmon through the off seasons it was preserved through two different methods. In the summer salmon was wind dried with salt in the Fraser Canyon. In the fall salmon was smoked, this was traditionally done for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> but with modern refrigeration technology smoking is only done for a few days. Dried salmon was then either boiled or steamed before eating.|$|E

He had a stubble which was very noticeable, <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> growth. The moustache was much thicker than the stubble. He had dark hair, straight and to the shoulder. His hair was split at the middle {{in the front and}} brushed to each side. He had a long thin face. He had dark eyes and dark eyebrows. He was badly dressed as if the clothes did not suit him. He was dirty looking but not scruffy looking. He was wearing jeans that had a flare, blue in colour. He had dirty white runners on. He was wearing an anorak type coat which came down a few inches below the waist. The coat was zipped up and was a bright colour like a bright brown colour without a hood." ...|$|R
50|$|Laundry {{was usually}} done once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> with one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> {{people from the}} village being brought in {{especially}} for the extremely heavy work of boiling, washing, drying and ironing. Fine and delicate items would be laundered separately.|$|R
5|$|Pound {{returned}} from America in 1911 and resumed his visits to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused {{on the basis}} of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family drawing room once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> every <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, KGO-TV {{produced}} weekday talk/variety {{shows in}} the 9:00 to 10:00a.m. timeslot following Good Morning America. A.M. San Francisco ran from 1975 to 1987/1988, when it was replaced by Good Morning, Bay Area, hosted by Susan Sikora. Hosts of A.M. San Francisco included the husband-and-wife team of Fred LaCosse and Terry Lowry (other ABC owned-and-operated stations produced their own A.M. programs in the 1980s; for example, A.M. Chicago at WLS-TV evolved into The Oprah Winfrey Show, and Live with Kelly and Ryan evolved from a similar A.M. program on WABC).

25|$|The {{early days}} for fledged juveniles are more hazardous; {{during its first}} dives into water, about four days after leaving the nest, a fledgling may become {{waterlogged}} and drown. Many young will not have learned to fish {{by the time they}} are driven out of their parents' territory, and only about half survive more than <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> Most kingfishers die of cold or lack of food, and a severe winter can kill a high percentage of the birds. Summer floods can destroy nests or make fishing difficult, resulting in starvation of the brood. Only a quarter of the young survive to breed the following year, but this is enough to maintain the population. Likewise, only a quarter of adult birds survive from one breeding season to the next. Very few birds live longer than one breeding season. The oldest bird on record was 21 years.|$|E
6000|$|Henri, in the interim, has invaded {{from the}} West; seen Leitmeritz, Lobositz;--Prag Nobility all running, and I suppose Prayers to St. Titus going again,--and Loudon in alarm. Loudon, however, saved Prag [...] "by two masterly positions" [...] (not mentionable here); upon which Henri took camp at Niemes; Loudon, the weaker in this part, seizing the Iser as a bulwark, and ranking himself behind it, {{back-to-back}} of Lacy. Here {{for about five}} weeks sat Henri, nothing on hand but to eat the Country. Over the heads of Loudon and Lacy, as the crow flies, Henri's Camp may be about 70 miles from Jaromirtz, where the King is. Hussar Belling, our old Anti-Swede friend, a brilliant cutting man, broke over the Iser once, perhaps twice; and there was pretty fencing by him and the like of him: [...] "but Prince Henri did nothing," [...] says the King, [OEuvres de Frederic, vi. 154]--was, in fact, helping the King to do nothing.

A Single V will usually contain the promotional video for a single, an alternate shot of the video, like a dance shot version, or a close up version, and making of footage of the video or CD jacket photo shoot. Aya Matsuura's Single V for Kizuna contains the promotional video for the song, a close-up version of the video, and a making of clip.|$|R
