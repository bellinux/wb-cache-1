Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists <b>and</b> <b>shallow,</b> partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{stages of the}} First World War the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without submarines suitable {{to operate in the}} narrow <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> seas off Flanders. By 18 August 1914, two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium, the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> coastal waters worldwide. The {{greatest}} diversity is in the tropics {{although there are many}} species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and a few are pelagic.|$|E

5|$|Coral reefs <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> marine environments are threatened, {{not only}} by natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
5|$|Geologically the Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{was once}} {{part of a large}} <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> sea that covered most of southern California. As the San Joaquin Hills rose and river sediments were deposited, land gradually emerged to form the present-day Orange County coast. Sulphur Creek is located in a crumpled, hilly area {{in the southern part of}} this range, formed differently from the continuous mountain chain to the north. Historically, being south of Aliso Creek, the Sulphur Creek watershed was part of the territory of the semi-nomadic Acjachemen Indian group, conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the 17th and 18th centuries and renamed the Juaneño by them.|$|E

5|$|More than 330 {{species of}} birds were {{recorded}} in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Persian Gulf region {{in the winter and}} autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar islands.|$|E
5|$|Most cnidarians prey on organisms {{ranging in}} size from {{plankton}} to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|E
5|$|Nemegt sediments {{preserve}} large river {{channels and}} soil deposits that indicate {{a far more}} humid climate than those suggested by the underlying Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers. The rock facies of this formation suggest the presence of mudflats, <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Orangutans live {{in primary}} and old {{secondary}} forests, particularly dipterocarp forests and peat swamp forests. Both species {{can be found}} in mountainous and lowland swampy areas. Sumatran orangutans live at elevations as high as 1500m (4921ft), while Bornean orangutans live no higher than 1000m (3281ft). Other habitats used by orangutans include grasslands, cultivated fields, gardens, young secondary forest, <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> lakes. Orangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes, spending nearly all their time in the trees.|$|E
5|$|Out of 17 municipalities, 14 have Level III {{water supply}} systems serving 18,590 {{households}} or about 32.57 {{percent of the}} total provincial households. Level III has a reservoir with house-to-house connections. 5,252 households were serviced by Level II water systems and 24,700 households by Level I water system. Level I category is a common facility where the community members get their water supply from deep wells <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> wells, while Level II has a reservoir with communal faucet. Based on the report from the Provincial Health Office in 2007, a total of 48,542 households out of the 57,079 or 85.04 percent have access to safe drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II she {{participated in}} several cruises to Mediterranean ports. During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she {{was captured by}} Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor. Initially designated N1, her armament was changed and her conning tower modified. Due to her age <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> diving depth, when she was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy as Francesco Rismondo her service was limited to training and experimentation. She was scuttled off the island of Corsica by the Germans shortly after her capture in September 1943 following the Italian surrender.|$|E

50|$|Deep {{earthquakes}} {{originate in}} the subducted plate. Because the Pacific Plate is subducting under {{the eastern side of}} the North Island, there are frequent deep earthquakes east of a line from the Bay of Plenty to Nelson (the approximate edge of the subducted plate), with the earthquakes being deeper to the west, <b>and</b> <b>shallower</b> to the east. Because the Australian Plate is subducting under the Pacific Plate in Fiordland, there are frequent deep earthquakes near Fiordland, with the earthquakes being deeper to the east <b>and</b> <b>shallower</b> near the west. There are few deep earthquakes along the Southern Alps, because the two sides largely slide past each other.|$|R
5|$|The Shishugou Formation {{represents}} {{a variety of}} depositional environments, including alluvial fans and alluvial plains, streams, wetlands, <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> lakes. During the time when Limusaurus lived, the environment would have been consistently warm and dry, judging by the abundance of coal and carbon-rich deposits. The climate was probably highly seasonal due to monsoonal influences, with warm, wet summers and dry winters. The climate enabled {{the growth of a}} richly forested environment; the forest would have been dominated by Araucaria trees, with the undergrowth being occupied by Coniopteris tree ferns, Anglopteris and Osmunda ferns, Equisetites horsetails, and Elatocladus shrubs.|$|E
5|$|The Tomozuru Incident of 12 March 1934, {{in which}} a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to {{investigate}} the stability of all their ships, resulting {{in a number of}} design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. Ryūjō, already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast <b>and</b> <b>shallow</b> torpedo bulges to improve her stability. Her funnels were moved higher up the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.|$|E
5|$|The first volcanoes {{along the}} Juan de Fuca ridge, {{including}} Axial Seamount, were {{detected in the}} 1970s by satellite altimetry.
