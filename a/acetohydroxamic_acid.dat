40|$|Many {{types of}} tumor, {{including}} glioma, melanoma, non-small cell lung, esophageal, and {{head and neck}} cancer, among others, are intrinsically resistant to apoptosis induction and poorly responsive to current therapies with proapoptotic agents. In addition, tumors often develop multidrug resistance based on the cellular efflux of chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, novel anticancer agents capable of overcoming these intrinsic or developed tumor resistance mechanisms are urgently needed. We describe a series of 2 -aryl- 2 -(3 -indolyl) <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acids</b> that are active against apoptosis-and multidrug-resistant cancer cells as well as glioblastoma neurosphere stemlike cell cultures derived from patients.

40|$|Simple hydroxamic acids such as formo- and aceto-hydroxamic acids {{have been}} {{proposed}} as suitable reagents for the separation of either Pu and/or Np from U in modified or single cycle Purex based solvent extraction processes {{designed to meet the}} emerging requirements of advanced fuel cycles. The stability of these hydroxamic acids is dominated by their decomposition through acid hydrolysis. Kinetic studies of the acid hydrolysis of formo- and <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acids</b> are reported in the absence and the presence of Pu(IV) ions. The slow reduction of these plutonium(IV) hydroxamate complexes to Pu(III) aquo-ions has been characterised by spectrophotometry and cyclic voltammetry. The reductions of Pu(IV) in the presence of FHA and AHA are consistent with a mechanism in which free hydroxamic acid in solution is hydrolysed whilst Pu(IV) ions remain fully complexed to hydroxamate ligands; then at some point close to a 1 : 1 Pu(IV) : XHA ratio, some free Pu 4 + is released from the complex and reduction is initiated.

40|$|The {{separation}} of U from Np and Pu are major {{stages in the}} Purex process. Simple hydroxamic acids (XHA) are salt free, hydrophilic organic compounds, RCONHOH, with affinities for cations such as Fe 3 +, Np 4 + and Pu 4 +. They are also redox active, capable of reducing a range of metal ions e. g. Np(VI) to Np(V). These two properties have led to them being identified as useful reagents for the control of Pu and Np in an Advanced Purex process. The kinetics of the acid hydrolysis of free formo- (FHA) and <b>acetohydroxamic</b> (AHA) <b>acids</b> to hydroxylamine and the parent carboxylic acid are well known. Hydrolysis of hydroxamates bound to metal ions also occurs and preliminary {{studies have shown that}} the Pu(IV) -FHA and AHA complexes are slowly reduced to free Pu(III) ions. An understanding of these processes is vital if they are to be controlled within the design of an Advanced Purex process. To this end, we have used UV-visible & nIR spectrophotometry to study and theoretically model the kinetics of the hydrolysis of metal-HA systems in nitrate media – Fe 3 + / AHA (as a non-active analogue); Np 4 + / FHA, Np 4 +/AHA – wherein the metal ion complexes with, but does not oxidise the ligand...|$|R

It may be an effect of the ammonia produced by the bacterium near the antral epithelial surface. We have examined the effect on serum gastrin of inhibiting H pylori urease activity with <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> in six duodenal ulcer patients. On day 1 the fasted patients received placebo tablets at 8 am, a peptide meal at 10 am, and a 14 C urea breath test at 11. 30 am. The next day 750 mg <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> was administered orally {{in place of the}} placebo. The median (range) 30 minute breath test value (dose/mmol CO 2 X kg body wt X 100) was 152 (111 - 335) on day 1, but only 22 (14 - 95) the next day (p less than 0. 03). Further studies performed in one subject confirmed that <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> lowered the ammonium concentration and raised the urea concentration in gastric juice. The inhibition of urease activity and ammonia production did not result in a fall in the basal gastrin concentration or in the median integrated gastrin response to the peptide meal, which was 78 ng/ 1. h (range 21 - 222) on day 1 and 79 ng/ 1. h (33 - 207) the next day.

The research focuses on studying the structural and reactivity features of nickel complexes with biologically relevant substrates. The anion of <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> is a well-known inhibitor of urease enzymes, including those isolated from Klebsiella aerogenes and Bacillus pasteurii. A precursor to the acetohydroxamate coordination in ureases is proposed to be an interaction between Ni(II) and <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid.</b> By using a novel supporting chelate ligand capable of secondary hydrogen bonding interactions a novel pseudo-octahedral, Ni(II) <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> complex has been isolated and characterized. Detailed analysis of the structural features and acetohydroxamic displacement reactivity of this complex has provided fundamental chemical insight toward understanding of the inhibition mechanism in urease enzymes. Glyoxalase I (Glx I) catalyzes one step of the cellular detoxification pathway for α-ketoaldehydes (e. g. methylglyoxal) in humans and bacteria. The GlxI enzyme from E. coli is a Ni(II) -containing enzyme that catalyzes the isomerization of a hemithioacetal to produce a thioester. Of relevance to this enzyme, the first example of a Ni(II) complex that promotes a hemithioacetal isomerization is reported herein. In order to monitor this type of reaction a new approach involving a a deuterium-labeled hemithioacetal (PhC(O) CH(OH) SCD 3) and 2 H NMR was employed. Acireductone dioxygenases (ARDs) catalyze aliphatic oxidative C-C bond cleavage of an acireductone (1, 2 -dihydroxy- 3 -oxo- 5 -(methylthio) pent- 1 -ene) intermediate in the methionine salvage pathway. A unique aspect of these enzymes is that the regioselectivity of the dioxygenase reaction depends on the metal ion bound in the active site.

However, under transpassive dissolution conditions, AHA while in part electrochemically oxidised to acetic acid and nitroxyl/hydroxylamine, also complexes with Fe 3 +, inhibiting secondary passivation and driving transpassive dissolution of both steels...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> (AHA) is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of urease which prevents alkalinization of urine and stone formation in rats {{in the presence of}} infection caused by urease-producing bacteria. Because an antibacterial effect of AHA, and synergy between kanamycin and AHA have also been described, we studied the interaction between AHA and 12 antibiotics against 14 gram-negative bacteria. Synergy, sometimes to a striking degree, was found in 17 % of interactions; however, antagonism was detected in 5 %. Infecting organisms would need to be studied individually before the antibacterial effect of AHA and an antibiotic could be predicted...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the influence of substitution on biological properties of Schiff bases and their metal complexes, a series of differently substituted fluorine-containing Schiff bases starting from the drug isoniazid (isonicotinylhydrazide) were prepared and their structures were established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Also, four copper(II) complexes of these Schiff bases were synthesized. The prepared compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity and urease inhibition. Two of the Schiff bases exerted activity against C. albicans. All copper(II) complexes showed excellent inhibitory properties against jack bean urease, considerably better {{than that of the}} standard inhibitor <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|E
40|$|The urease {{inhibitor}} <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> (AHA) {{was assessed}} for its bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on Helicobacter pylori. For eight isolates of H pylori, the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) was either 200 mg/l or 400 mg/l. Interactions between AHA and antimicrobial drugs used to treat H pylori were also determined. For most isolates AHA reduced the MIC for colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), tetracycline, metronidazole, and amoxicillin. In a few isolates, however, AHA increased the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for these antimicrobial treatments. In vitro AHA is active against H pylori and it interacts with other agents directed against H pylori...|$|E
40|$|The system {{consisting}} of Ni(II) and β-AlaHA (β-alanyl-hydroxamic acid {{was investigated in}} order to verify the possible formation of metallacrowns, in aqueous solution. The system Ni(II) /AHA (<b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid)</b> was also studied, {{for the sake of}} comparison, The techniques used for this purpose were the following: potentiometry, which gives the speciation model consisting in the formation constants and stoichiometries of formed complexes; electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), in order to confirm the stoichiometry of the species; solution calorimetry, giving the complex-formation thermodynamic quantities ΔH° and ΔS°, useful to hypothesize complex structure in combination with UV-Vis spectra at different pH values...|$|E
40|$|Proteus mirabilis, {{a common}} agent of nosocomially {{acquired}} and catheter-associated urinary tract infection, {{is the most}} frequent cause of infection-induced bladder and kidney stones. Urease-catalyzed urea hydrolysis initiates stone formation in urine and can be inhibited by <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> and other structural analogs of urea. Since P. mirabilis urease is inducible with urea, {{there has been some}} concern that urease inhibitors actually induce urease during an active infection, thus compounding the problem of elevated enzyme activity. Quantitating induction by compounds that simultaneously inhibit urease activity has been difficult. Therefore, to study these problems, we constructed a fusion of ureA (a urease subunit gene) and lacZ (the beta-galactosidase gene) within plasmid pMID 1010, which encodes an inducible urease of P. mirabilis expressed in E. coli JM 103 (Lac-). The fusion protein, predicted to be 117 kDa, was induced by urea and detected on Western blots (immunoblots) with anti-beta-galactosidase antiserum. Peak beta-galactosidase activity of 9. 9 mumol of ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein, quantitated spectrophotometrically, was induced at 200 mM urea. The uninduced rate was 0. 2 mumol of ONPG hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein. Induction was specific for urea, as no structural analog of urea (including <b>acetohydroxamic</b> <b>acid,</b> hydroxyurea, thiourea, hippuric acid, flurofamide, or hydroxylamine) induced fusion protein activity. These data suggest that induction by inactivation of UreR, the urease repressor protein that governs regulation of the urease operon, is specific for urea and does not respond to closely related structural analogs...|$|E
