5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone <b>as</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
500|$|Betjeman characterised Heber's {{style as}} {{consciously}} literary, with careful choices of adjectives and vivid figures of speech: [...] "poetic imagery was {{as important as}} didactic truth". A more recent analysis by J. R. Watson draws attention to Heber's tendency to deliver what he terms [...] "a rather obvious sermon", and to his mixing of powerful description with [...] "a rather trite moralism". A handful of Heber's hymns have survived into popular use into the 21st century. One whose popularity has waned is the missionary hymn [...] "From Greenland's Icy Mountains", written in 1819 {{as part of a}} country-wide campaign on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Watson describes this as [...] "a conspicuous example of that fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field", and while widely sung until {{the second half of the}} 20th century, it was for instance omitted from the 1982 revision of the Episcopal Church hymnal. Betjeman felt that in the modern world, the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs, with references to [...] "...every prospect pleases and only man is vile", and to [...] "the heathen in his blindness [...] down to wood and stone". These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended Gandhi, who drew attention to them in a speech to the YMCA in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1925: [...] "My own experience in my travels throughout India has been to the contrary ... is not vile. He is as much a seeker after truth <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I are, possibly more so". Other Heber texts remain popular, and the Dictionary of North American Hymnology noted that most of his hymns remain in use.|$|E

Smith and the other leaders rode with Hinkle back to the Missouri militia encampment. [...] The militia promptly arrested Smith and the other leaders. [...] Smith believed that Hinkle had betrayed him, but Hinkle maintained his innocence and claimed that he was following Smith's orders. [...] To William Wines Phelps, a fellow Latter-day Saint and witness to the events, Hinkle wrote: [...] "When the facts were laid before Joseph, did he not say, 'I will go'; and did not the others go with him, and that, too, voluntarily, so far <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I were concerned?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Palin {{has since}} been {{critical}} of Obama's handling of the United States' military role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. On April 16, 2011, she said Obama [...] "willfully ignored {{the will of the}} American people... when you got us into a third war for fuzzy and inconsistent reasons, a third war that we cannot afford." [...] She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama [...] "step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand you pull out." [...] She continued, [...] "Simply put, what are we doing there? You’ve put us in a strategic no man’s land. If Gaddafi’s got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> your spokesmen suggest, we’re not to tell Libya what to do when it comes to that country’s leadership, and if you can’t explain to Americans why we’re willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria’s, Yemen’s, Bahrain’s, Egypt’s, Israel’s, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent." ...|$|E
2500|$|The matter {{became the}} object of student protest in 1922, when 6 banned black freshmen, led by a recent alumnus who was {{studying}} at the Business School, protested their exclusion. Lowell wrote this explanation to Roscoe Conkling Bruce, himself an African American Harvard alumnus {{and the father of}} an incoming freshman: [...] "We have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together." [...] Bruce’s lengthy reply underscored the irony of Lowell's position: [...] "The policy of compulsory residence in the Freshman Halls is costly indeed if it is the thing that constrains Harvard to enter open-eyed and brusque upon a policy of racial discrimination." [...] Lowell stood his ground: [...] "It is not a departure from the past to refuse to compel white and colored men to room in the same building. We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man; but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial." [...] He accused Bruce of insisting on a change of policy and employed an argument about minority presence provoking prejudice that he also used about the same time in the Jewish quota dispute. [...] "For the colored man to claim that he is entitled to have the white man compelled to live with him is a very unfortunate innovation which, far from doing him good, would increase a prejudice which, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I will thoroughly agree, is most unfortunate and probably growing." ...|$|E
