5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to <b>always</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} must {{fit their}} context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education {{contributed to their}} calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would <b>always</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with {{the rhythm of the}} phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.|$|E
500|$|The {{complexity}} of the script of the pilot episode and the show's concept was cited as a potential issue for the series. Salke evaluated that viewers will enjoy the [...] "clever mythology that overlap and affect each other in very interesting ways", despite the series' Sliding Doors-like script. Upon reading the script, Isaacs {{felt that it was}} [...] "incredibly hard" [...] and complicated to comprehend. [...] "Do you <b>always</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> reality you're in? [...] That's become a [...] It was hard but I quite like hard work." [...] Isaacs later suggested that it might be too brooding for mainstream American television, and that it could potentially be the [...] "U-bend of scripts". He stated that every pilot comes from people who have [...] "amazing prestige", and that there are lots of [...] "talented people, but the head of the network chooses only one." [...] Despite such concerns, Gordon asserted that the concept of Awake was a concept that you could understand if you sat down and paid attention to it properly.|$|E

2500|$|In France, pre-hospital care is {{performed}} either by first responders {{from the fire}} department (sapeurs-pompiers, in most emergency situations) or from a private ambulance company (relative emergency at home), or by a medical team that includes a physician, a nurse and an ambulance technician (called [...] "SMUR"). The intermediate scale, the firefighter nurse (infirmier sapeur-pompier, ISP), is only a recent evolution and {{is performed}} by nurses who have been specially trained acting with emergency protocols; these nurses are the French equivalent of paramedics. The arrival of first responders is thus the most common result of an emergency call. In addition, in France there exists a network of first responder associations, as French Red Cross (Croix-rouge française), civil protection (protection civile), FFSS (Fédération Française de Sauvetage et de Secourisme) or others. These CFR volunteers are allowed to supervise massive outside meetings, student gatherings, et cetera. These volunteers have followed the same special rescuer training as firefighters (PSE 1 & PSE 2, in all 70 hours of training), trainees <b>always</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they are going into, they would be given basic medical training then transferred to the Fire Department, they shall always show humanistic interaction, and shall assist and help people with their concerns.(( [...] firefighter))s ((PSE1-PSE2)) ...|$|E

I must say she didn't look it, {{any more than the}} Duke and Duchess of Orleans, and yet she's only a baroness.

I hoped you were feeling her quality, so that we should have it in the family, anyway, and <b>always</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it was like.
