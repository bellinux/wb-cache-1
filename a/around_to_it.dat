Eventually, the Poor Clares in Münster agreed to accept her, provided she would learn to play the organ. She went to the organist Söntgen in Coesfeld to study music and learn to play the organ, but she never got <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> because the poverty of the Söntgen family prompted her to work there to help them, and she sacrificed her small savings for that. Later, one of the Söntgen daughters entered the convent with her.|$|E

His last ODI century was the double hundred against the West Indies in December 2011. Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott had hinted that it might {{be the end of the}} road for Sehwag."I don't think he'll play again. I think it's because India have gone the right way.

While recording the track [...] "If It's Lovin' That You Want" [...] for her debut album, Rihanna received a visit from American singer Ne-Yo, in which they {{met for the first}} time, although they never got the chance to collaborate on Music of the Sun. When production started, she {{came up with the idea}} of working with Ne-Yo. When asked about collaborating with Ne-Yo, Rihanna stated: [...] "We never got <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> on the first album. So for the second album, I was like, 'You know what? I have to work with that guy Ne-Yo.' And it made it a lot easier because he's on the same label I am." [...] For the album, Rihanna also worked with Jamaican reggae and dancehall artist Sean Paul on the track [...] "Break It Off", which was recorded in Paul's hometown of Kingston, Jamaica.|$|E

So I decided to do that way back when, never got <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature." [...] In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in Desperado. [...] "So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, [...] "That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts."

2500|$|With Lawry's {{defensive}} leadership {{under heavy}} fire he was dropped {{along with three}} other players, becoming the first Australian captain to be dropped {{in the middle of}} a series. He was not informed privately by the Board and only found out after his axing was made public. The Australian selectors Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry at the end of the Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, I suppose we all have to get <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> some day". Two days earlier, after lengthy discussion, the ACB had voted 7–6 to acknowledge and respond to Lawry's letter following the South African tour, although their reply did not address Lawry's concerns. His successor Chappell condemned the Board's actions as [...] "unbelievable". Immediately after his appointment, the new leader told his wife [...] "The bastards won't get me the way they got Bill", and he later went out on his own terms. Victorian and Australian teammate Paul Sheahan said [...] "The fact that no-one had the courage to tell him he was to lose his job as Australian captain was disgraceful." [...] At the same time, Sheahan said that Lawry was [...] "a bit of an autocrat" [...] and [...] "not the sort of captain who stood alongside you and drew the best out of you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fully {{aware that}} they needed to win the last Test to retain the Ashes the Australian {{selectors}} axed Bill Lawry, the first Australian captain ever to be dropped mid-series. Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry {{at the end of the}} Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, I suppose we all have to get <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> some day". Although the appointment of the more aggressive Ian Chappell as captain (with Ian Redpath as his vice-captain) made sense, Lawry was still a redoubtable opening batsman who averaged 40.50 in the series and many thought that his services should have been retained. Instead the veteran Victorian opener Ken Eastwood was called up for his only Test after having made 177 against New South Wales. John Gleeson, Ashley Mallett and Ross Duncan were all dropped and replaced by debutant Tony Dell, a left-arm fast medium bowler, and the leg-spinners Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner. The selectors made another mistake in not recalling Garth McKenzie to partner his Western Australia team-mate Dennis Lillee after he had broken Geoff Boycott's arm on the same ground in a one-day match. McKenzie could have been a real handful for the England batsmen, and was only two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian Test record of 248 wickets (Benaud wrote 'Bring back McKenzie' in his newspaper column). This meant Australia's four man bowling attack had only 6 Test wickets to their name, the least since [...] in 1945–46 when seven players made their debut after the war. Boycott was, of course, unfit to play and Brian Luckhurst returned to open the innings, having missed the Sixth Test because of his bruised hands. John Snow had been suffering from an inflamed sacroiliac joint, which required traction and complete rest, but he was declared fit in time for the Test. This was Australian umpire Lou Rowan's last Test as he retired at the end of the season and the Australian selectors Don Bradman retired after 35 years, out of which Australian had held the Ashes for all but 6 years.|$|E

On the instant, the she- wolf's coyness and playfulness disappeared. With a snarl she sprang upon One Ear. He thrust her off with his shoulder, and, his retreat cut off and still intent on regaining the sled, he altered his course in an attempt to circle <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> More wolves were appearing every moment and joining in the chase. The she-wolf was one leap behind One Ear and holding her own.|$|E
6000|$|We of the North {{poke fun}} at the South for its fondness of titles--a fondness for titles pure and simple, {{regardless}} of whether they are genuine or pinchbeck. We forget that whatever a Southerner likes the rest of the human race likes, and that there is no law of predilection lodged in one people that is absent from another people. There is no variety in the human race. We are all children, all children of the one Adam, and we love toys. We can soon acquire that Southern disease if some one will give it a start. It already has a start, in fact. I have been personally acquainted with over eighty-four thousand persons who, {{at one time or another}} in their lives, have served for a year or two on the staffs of our multitudinous governors, and through that fatality have been generals temporarily, and colonels temporarily, and judge-advocates temporarily; but I have known only nine among them who could be hired to let the title go when it ceased to be legitimate. I know thousands and thousands of governors who ceased to be governors away back in the last century; but I am acquainted with only three who would answer your letter if you failed to call them [...] "Governor" [...] in it. I know acres and acres of men who have done time in a legislature in prehistoric days, but among them is not half an acre whose resentment you would not raise if you addressed them as [...] "Mr." [...] instead of [...] "Hon." [...] The first thing a legislature does is to convene in an impressive legislative attitude, and get itself photographed. Each member frames his copy and takes it to the woods and hangs it up in the most aggressively conspicuous place in his house; and if you visit the house and fail to inquire what that accumulation is, the conversation will be brought <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> by that aforetime legislator, and he will show you a figure in it which in the course of years he has almost obliterated with the smut of his finger-marks, and say with a solemn joy, [...] "It's me!" ...|$|E
