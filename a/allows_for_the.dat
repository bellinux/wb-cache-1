5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} use plumage {{to assess}} and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> identification of birds, particularly between species.|$|E
5|$|Clearing waste: CSF <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{removal of}} waste {{products}} from the brain, and is critical in the brain's lymphatic system. Metabolic waste products diffuse rapidly into the CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{behavior}} {{between males}} {{has been reported}} {{on a number of}} occasions, and is very similar in form to that seen in many other viperid species. An important factor in sexual selection, it <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> establishment and recognition of dominance as males compete for access to sexually active females.|$|E

50|$|Fabricius {{added two}} {{distinct}} areas to the classification system. He considers both artificial and natural characteristics. Artificial characteristics <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> determination of a species, and natural ones <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> relationship to other genera and varieties.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} buses ran on diesel fuel, but {{the system}} allows for buses that run on alternative energy sources. Biodiesel fuel and natural gas have been trialled, and 20% of the Adelaide bus fleet uses compressed natural gas, 48% B20 and 32% B5 biodiesel blends. The design of the O-Bahn <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> installation of overhead wires for trolleybuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{round window}} <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fluid within {{the inner ear}} to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear. The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15â€“20 times.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the gold-standard {{method of}} {{cellular}} localization is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. The sample {{is prepared for}} normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> localization of both ultrastructural details {{as well as the}} protein of interest.|$|E
5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E
5|$|Mills' {{troubles}} {{began in}} November 2005, with revelations of large losses on failed projects, a cash crunch and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting. The SEC inquiry was upgraded to a formal investigation in March 2006. The reclassification as a formal investigation <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of additional {{techniques such as}} subpoenas. On April 6, 2007 Simon Property Group, Inc. announced the joint acquisition of Mills Corporation along with Farallon Capital Management for $25.25 per share of common stock.|$|E

He also was the lead sponsor (in the 126th Legislature) on a bill to extend a trial program which <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exemption from tax on aircraft parts which spurred a number of developments in aviation services in Maine.|$|R
5|$|Most {{computers}} {{require the}} diver {{to specify the}} mixture before the dive, but some allow the choice of mixture to be changed during the dive, which <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of gas switching for accelerated decompression. A third category, mostly used by closed circuit rebreather divers, monitors the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing mix using a remote oxygen sensor, but requires diver intervention to specify the inert gas constituents and ratio of the mix in use.|$|E
5|$|Seven Halo soundtracks {{have been}} released. The Halo Original Soundtrack {{contains}} most of Combat Evolveds music. Due to the varying nature of gameplay, the music present {{was designed to}} use the game's dynamic audio playback engine. The engine <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mood, theme, and duration of music played to change according to gameplay. To afford a more enjoyable listening experience, O'Donnell rearranged portions of the music of Halo into standalone suites, which follow the narrative course of the game. The soundtrack also contains music not used in the game, including {{a variation on the}} Halo theme that was first played at Halos debut at Macworld 1999.|$|E
5|$|Short {{proteins}} {{can also}} be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield. Chemical synthesis <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> introduction of non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. Most chemical synthesis methods proceed from C-terminus to N-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.|$|E

The Constitution also <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> death penalty to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> integration of ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes {{the integration of the}} mitochondria, the product of an endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|The Watts Brothers Tool Works square {{drill bit}} has {{the shape of}} a Reuleaux triangle, {{modified}} with concavities to form cutting surfaces. When mounted in a special chuck which <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bit not having a fixed centre of rotation, it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal holes.|$|E

5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|Unlike ASL, BASL <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{frequent}} use of syntactic repetition. In {{a study conducted by}} McCaskill, of 26 signers (13 Black and 13 White), Black signers had 57 instances of repetition compared to 19 from White signers, and of those 19 instances, 18 were made by a single signer. The use of repetition by BASL signers is considered to be pragmatic rather than as a way to clarify meaning.|$|E
