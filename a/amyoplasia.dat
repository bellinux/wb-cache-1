50|$|Arthrogryposis ophthalmoplegia retinopathy, {{also known}} as Oculomelic <b>amyoplasia.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{characterized}} by the four limbs being involved, and by the replacement of skeletal muscle by dense fibrous and adipose tissue. Studies involving <b>amyoplasia</b> have revealed similar findings of the muscle tissue due to various causes including that seen in sacral agenesis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. So <b>amyoplasia</b> may also include an intermediate common pathway, rather than the primary cause of the contractors.|$|E
50|$|About 10% of {{children}} with <b>amyoplasia</b> have evidence of vascular compromise including Intestinal atresia, abdominal wall defects, and gastroschisis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amyoplasia</b> is a {{sporadic}} {{condition that}} occurs {{due to lack}} of fetal movement in the womb. There is no specific gene that is known to cause the disorder. It is thought to be multifactorial, meaning that numerous genes and environmental factors play a role in its development. The recurrence risk is minimal for siblings or children of affected individuals. There have been no reports of recurrent cases of <b>amyoplasia</b> in a family.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no single}} factor that is {{consistently}} found in the prenatal history of individuals affected with <b>amyoplasia</b> and, in some cases, there is no known cause of the disorder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amyoplasia</b> is a {{condition}} characterized by a generalized lack in the newborn of muscular development and growth, with contracture and deformity at most joints. It {{is the most common}} form of arthrogryposis.|$|E
50|$|Children with <b>amyoplasia</b> often {{suffer from}} {{internally}} rotated shoulders, extended elbows, ulnar flexed wrists. The type of {{displacement of the}} hips and knees is more variable, and they often have club feet. Most children have symmetrical limb involvement.|$|E
50|$|Overall {{prognosis}} {{for children with}} <b>amyoplasia</b> is good. Intensive therapies throughout developing years include physical therapy, occupational therapy and multiple orthopedic procedures. Most children require therapy for years, but almost 2/3 are eventually able to walk, with or without braces, and attend school.|$|E
5000|$|Arthrogryposis {{multiplex}} congenital (AMC), {{or simply}} arthrogryposes, describes congenital joint contracture {{in two or}} more areas of the body. It derives its name from Greek, literally meaning [...] "curving of joints" [...] ( [...] , [...] "joint"; , late Latin form of late Greek , [...] "hooking"). Children born {{with one or more}} joint contractures have abnormal fibrosis of the muscle tissue causing muscle shortening, and therefore are unable to perform active extension and flexion in the affected joint or joints. AMC has been divided into three groups: <b>amyoplasia,</b> distal arthrogryposis, and syndromic. <b>Amyoplasia</b> is characterized by severe joint contractures and muscle weakness. Distal arthrogryposis mainly involves the hands and feet. Types of arthrogryposis with a primary neurological or muscle disease belong to the syndromic group.|$|E
50|$|The fetal {{akinesia}} in <b>amyoplasia</b> {{is thought}} to be caused by various maternal and fetal abnormalities. In some cases, the mother's uterus does not allow for adequate fetal movement {{because of a lack of}} amniotic fluid, known as oligohydramnios, or an abnormal shape to the uterus, called a bicornuate uterus.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{the most}} common form of arthrogryposis {{multiplex}} congenita (AMC), where multiple joint contractures are present at birth. Arthrogryposis is derived from the Greek word meaning [...] "with crooking of joints." [...] It occurs in about one out of every 3,000 live births. There are more than 150 types of AMC. <b>Amyoplasia</b> accounts for 40% of AMC cases.|$|E
5000|$|Almost every {{joint in}} a patient with arthrogryposis is often affected; in 84% all limbs are involved, in 11% only the legs, and in 4% only the arms are involved. Every joint in the body has typical signs and {{symptoms}} like the shoulder (internal rotation), wrist (volar and ulnar), hand (fingers in fixed flexion and thumb in palm), hip (flexed, abducted and externally rotated, frequently dislocated), elbow (extension and pronation) and foot (clubfoot). [...] The range of motion capability can be different between joints because of the different deviations. Some types of arthrogryposis like <b>amyoplasia</b> have a symmetrical joint/limb involvement, with normal sensations. The contractures in the joints are sometimes resulting in a reduced walking development in the first 5 years.The intelligence is normal to above normal in children with <b>amyoplasia.</b> But it is unknown {{how many of these}} children have an above normal intelligence and there is no literature available about the cause of this syndrome. There are a few syndromes like the Freeman-Sheldon and Gordon syndrome, which have craniofacial involvement. The <b>amyoplasia</b> form of arthrogryposis is sometimes accompanied with a midline facial hemangioma.Arthrogryposis is not a diagnosis but a clinical finding. So this disease is often accompanied with other syndromes or diseases. These other diagnoses can be found in every single organ {{in a patient}}. There are a few slightly more common diagnoses such as pulmonary hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, congenital heart defects, tracheoesophageal fistulas, inguinal hernias, cleft palate, and eye abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|There {{may also}} be a myogenic cause to the fetal akinesia, meaning that fetal muscles do not develop {{properly}} due to a muscle disease (for example, a congenital muscular dystrophy). Similarly, connective tissue tendon and skeletal defects may contribute to the fetal akinesia and be the primary cause of <b>amyoplasia.</b> Additionally, malformations may occur in the central nervous system and/or spinal cord that can lead to a lack of fetal movement in utero. This neurogenic cause is often accompanied by a wide range of other conditions. Other causes of fetal akinesia may include a maternal fever during pregnancy or a virus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amyoplasia</b> {{results when}} a fetus {{is unable to}} move {{sufficiently}} in the womb. Mothers of children with the disorder often report that their baby was abnormally still during the pregnancy. The lack of movement in utero (also known as fetal akinesia) allows extra connective tissue to form around the joints and, therefore, the joints become fixed. This extra connective tissue replaces muscle tissue, leading to weakness and giving a wasting appearance to the muscles. Additionally, {{due to the lack}} of fetal movement, the tendons that connect the muscles to bone are not able to stretch to their normal length and this contributes to the lack of joint mobility as well.|$|E

50|$|Children {{with the}} <b>amyoplasia</b> type of arthrogryposis usually have flexed and ulnarly {{deviated}} wrists. Dorsal carpal wedge osteotomy is indicated for wrists with excessive flexion contracture deformity when non-surgical interventions such as occupational therapy and splinting {{have failed to}} improve function.On the dorsal side, {{at the level of}} the midcarpus, a wedge osteotomy is made. Sufficient bone is resected to at least be able to put the wrist in a neutral position. If the wrist is also ulnarly deviated, more bone can be taken from the radial side to correct this abnormality. This position is held into place with two cross K-wires. In addition, a tendon transfer of the extensor carpi ulnaris to the extensor carpi radialis brevis may be performed to correct ulnar deviation or wrist extension weakness, or both. This tendon transfer is only used if the extensor carpi ulnaris appears to be functional enough.|$|E
30|$|The {{most common}} form of arthrogryposis is <b>amyoplasia,</b> which {{accounts}} for approximately one-third of all cases [1]. The word “amyoplasia” means no muscle formation. <b>Amyoplasia</b> occurs sporadically. Pathogenesis is unknown but thought to be impaired blood circulation to the fetus early in pregnancy, with hypotension and hypoxia damaging the anterior horn cells and resulting in lack of or underdevelopment of muscle tissue with fatty or connective tissue replacement [1, 32]. Clinically, the common morphologic features suggest a genetic syndrome, but occurrence is sporadic and individuals with <b>amyoplasia</b> have unaffected children [1]. <b>Amyoplasia</b> occurs in increased frequency in one of monozygotic twins [1].|$|E
40|$|<b>Amyoplasia</b> congenita is a {{diagnostic}} subgroup {{of children with}} arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). AMC is a relatively rare syndrome characterized by multiple joint contractures at birth. <b>Amyoplasia</b> congenita {{is the most common}} type of this syndrome with an occurrence rate of 1 in 10, 000 live births, and mainly refers to the disorders with limb involvement. In this report, the author presents a premature baby with <b>amyoplasia</b> congenita, whose hips showed flexion, abduction, and external rotation contractures. The knees showed fixed extension contractures, so that his lower extremities were cylindrical with absent skin creases at birth. Key Words: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, <b>amyoplasia</b> congenit...|$|E
30|$|As a group, {{patients}} with <b>amyoplasia</b> have more severe muscle weakness and joint contractures than DA patients. Consequently, motor function is more compromised in <b>amyoplasia.</b> In DA syndromes, DA 2 A is {{more severe than}} DA 2 B, and DA 1 is milder than DA 2 B.|$|E
40|$|Arthrogryposis or Arthrogrypsosis Multiplex Congenita (AMC) are terms used to {{describe}} the clinical finding of multiple congenital contractures. There are more than 300 distinct disorders associated with arthrogryposis. <b>Amyoplasia</b> is {{the most common type of}} arthrogryposis and is often referred to as the “classic” type. There is no known cause of <b>amyoplasia</b> and no risk factors have been identified. Moreover, there is no established diagnostic criteria, which has led to inconsistency and confusion in the medical literature. The purpose of this study was {{to describe}} the natural history of <b>amyoplasia,</b> to determine if there are any identifiable risk factors and develop a list of diagnostic criteria. A retrospective chart review of 59 children with arthrogryposis ascertained at the Shriners Hospitals for Children in Houston, Texas was performed and included the following information: prenatal, birth, and family histories, and phenotypic descriptions. Forty-four children were identified with <b>amyoplasia</b> and 15 children with other multiple congenital contractures and other anomalies (MCC) were used as a comparison group. With the exception of abnormal amniotic fluid levels during pregnancy, there were no significant demographic or prenatal risk factors identified. However, we found common features that discriminate <b>amyoplasia</b> from other types of arthrogryposis and developed a diagnostic checklist. This checklist can be used as diagnostic criteria for discriminating <b>amyoplasia</b> from isolated and multiple contracture conditions...|$|E
30|$|A knee {{contracture}} {{can have}} various causes, e.g., <b>amyoplasia,</b> distal arthrogryposis, pterygium, and other malformations. Contractures in <b>amyoplasia</b> are very resistant to treatment. Contractures in distal arthrogryposis often improve {{during the first}} months of life. After birth, manipulations and orthotics or serial casting can be performed. If the child also has club feet, Ponseti manipulations require the knee to be flexed so that abduction of the foot can be controlled.|$|E
40|$|<b>Amyoplasia</b> is a rare, {{sporadic}} condition {{characterized by}} {{different degrees of}} maldevelopment of the skeletal muscles, which are replaced by fibrous and fatty tissue. In this report, we present a case of generalized <b>amyoplasia</b> presenting at 19 weeks 2 ̆ 7 gestation. The most striking finding was the absence of fetal movements, resulting in severe multiple congenital contractures, hydrops, and polyhydramnios. At autopsy, histological examination of the skeletal muscle showed small groups of poorly developed fibres within areas of fat. This report suggests that generalized <b>amyoplasia</b> could be a common cause of severe forms of multiple congenital contractures, but is probably underdiagnosed at post-mortem because of inadequate examination of muscles. Definitive diagnosis is important in determining the risks of recurrence in these cases...|$|E
30|$|Hip {{dislocation}} is seen {{in approximately}} 30  % of children with <b>amyoplasia</b> and approximately 50  % of these will be bilateral.|$|E
30|$|Risk of re-occurrence varies greatly: <b>amyoplasia</b> occurs sporadically, {{while several}} forms of DA have {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance with a recurrence rate of 50  %.|$|E
30|$|Contractures in {{children}} with <b>amyoplasia</b> are at their maximum at birth. To increase the joint range of motion (ROM) and to obtain a functional position of the joint, a combination of stretching, splinting, and orthopedic surgery is often necessary [34, 35, 36]. Early physical therapy is very important, both to mobilize joints and to stimulate muscle growth and to prevent further muscular atrophy [31]. In <b>amyoplasia,</b> the joint contractures can be severe and {{have a tendency to}} recur after correction [36].|$|E
30|$|<b>Amyoplasia</b> or “classic arthrogryposis” {{belongs to}} the first group, as do several {{camptodactyly}} syndromes, DA type 1, popliteal pterygium syndrome, several symphalangism syndromes, and others.|$|E
30|$|<b>Amyoplasia</b> was {{diagnosed}} in 48 (37  %) patients; DA {{was found in}} 27 (21  %) index patients; 22 (17  %) children {{were found to have}} arthrogryposis with CNS involvement.|$|E
30|$|A {{classification}} of the investigated patients with arthrogryposis into different specific diagnoses identified the three largest groups, in decreasing order, as <b>amyoplasia,</b> DA syndromes, and arthrogryposis with CNS involvement.|$|E
30|$|The MAOR {{can be used}} in {{children}} with <b>amyoplasia</b> from 3  months of age onwards, and it is possible to combine this surgery with surgery to the knee and feet.|$|E
30|$|The aim in arthrogryposis {{should always}} be to {{maximise}} {{the potential of the}} child. In the child with <b>amyoplasia</b> there may be significant limb deformities and muscle weakness and it is sometimes difficult initially to determine whether the child has walking potential. However, whether the child is ultimately going to be a walker or to rely on a wheelchair, it is beneficial to have a level pelvis to aid sitting and standing. It is generally agreed that unilateral dislocations in children with <b>amyoplasia</b> should be reduced. There remains some debate, however, with regards to the management of children with bilaterally dislocated hips.|$|E
30|$|Thirty-five {{patients}} with <b>amyoplasia</b> were studied separately [44]. Involvement {{of only the}} upper limbs was seen in four, only the lower limbs in six, and both {{the upper and lower}} limbs in 25 patients.|$|E
30|$|Arthrogryposis {{multiplex}} congenita (AMC) is {{a heterogeneous}} condition defined as multiple congenital joint contractures {{in two or}} more body areas. The common pathogenesis is impaired fetal movements. <b>Amyoplasia,</b> the most frequent form, is a sporadically occurring condition with hypoplastic muscles and joint contractures. Distal arthrogryposis (DA) syndromes are often hereditary, and joint involvement is predominantly in the hands and feet. In a Swedish study, 131 patients with arthrogryposis were investigated. The most frequent diagnoses were <b>amyoplasia</b> and DA. In <b>amyoplasia,</b> muscle strength {{was found to be}} more important than joint range of motion (ROM) for motor function. In DA, muscle weakness was present in 44  % of investigated patients. The clinical findings were found to be highly variable between families and also within families with DA. Fetal myopathy due to sarcomeric protein dysfunction can cause DA. An early multidisciplinary team evaluation of the child with arthrogryposis for specific diagnosis and planning of treatment is recommended. Attention should be directed at the development of muscle strength with early stimulation of active movements. Immobilization should be minimized.|$|E
30|$|The most {{frequently}} occurring form of arthrogryposis is <b>amyoplasia</b> [1], a sporadically occurring condition {{sometimes referred to}} as “classical arthrogryposis”. The second most common form is probably distal arthrogryposis (DA) [2, 3], a group of syndromes with mainly distal joint contractures [1, 4].|$|E
30|$|Hip {{dislocation}} in <b>amyoplasia</b> is congenital and teratologic. Although reduction may in {{some cases}} be possible by closed means, in the majority this is impossible and an open reduction is required. At surgery, one finds a shortened iliopsoas tendon and a contracted joint capsule.|$|E
30|$|The {{surgical}} technique for reduction can be via an anterior approach or a medial approach open reduction (MAOR). The MAOR was first popularised for the hip in <b>amyoplasia</b> by Staheli, {{and in his}} 1987 paper [4] he compared the results of using the MAOR with an anterolateral approach.|$|E
40|$|Arthrogryposis Causes, Consequences and Clinical Course in <b>Amyoplasia</b> and Distal Arthrogryposis Background. Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita, AMC, is a {{heterogeneous}} condition defined as multiple congenital joint contractures {{in two or}} more body areas. The pathogenesis is impaired fetal movements. <b>Amyoplasia,</b> the most fre- quent form, is a sporadically occurring condition with hypoplastic muscles and joint contractures. Distal arthrogryposis (DA) syndromes are often hereditary, and joint involvement is predominantly in hands and feet. Arhrogryposis with CNS involvement includes chromosomal and other syndromes. Aims. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate patients with arthrogrypo- sis, to classify the different occurring forms, and to investigate causes, muscle and joint involvement, motor function, treatment and outcome. Methods. Patients were identified via pediatric rehabilitation centers. Family and case history including perinatal findings were recorded. Physical investiga- tion included joint range of motion, muscle strength and motor function. In patients with DA molecular genetic and, in selected cases, muscle morphologic investigations were carried out. Results. 131 patients with arthrogryposis were investigated. The most frequent diagnoses were <b>amyoplasia</b> and DA. In <b>amyoplasia,</b> community ambulators had the best muscle strength, household ambulators had severe contractures in legs but good muscle strength in arms, and non-ambulators had the most severe contractures and muscle weakness. Muscle strength was found to be more im- portant than joint range of motion for motor function. In DA, muscle weakness was present in 44 % of investigated patients. Mutations in sarcomeric muscle protein genes were found in seven families with autosomal dominant and in one child with sporadic DA. In one family with a mutation in TNNI 2 there were mild myopathic findings, in one family with mutation in TPM 2 no obvious myopathy, and in patients from three families with MYH 3 mutations mild myopathic findings. Clinical findings were found to be highly variable between families and also within families with DA. Conclusions. Different forms of arthrogryposis were identified. In amyopla- sia, attention should be directed at development of muscle strength with early stimulation of active movements. Immobilisation should be minimized. DA syndromes are clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions. Fetal my- opathy due to sarcomeric protein dysfunction can cause DA. An early multi- disciplinary team evaluation for specific diagnosis and planning of treatment is recommended. Key words.
