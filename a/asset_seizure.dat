25|$|In 2003, the ten double eagles {{were stored}} at the United States Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, Kentucky. They {{were shown to}} jurors in Philadelphia during the July 2011 trial, but were then {{returned}} to Fort Knox, where they were to remain until {{a decision was made}} regarding their disposition. In April 2015, a United States federal appeals court ordered the coins returned to the Langbord family because the original <b>asset</b> <b>seizure</b> was conducted improperly, as the government failed to file a judicial civil forfeiture complaint within 90 days of the family's seized asset claim. This order was reversed on July 28, 2015, and in October 2015, an en banc session was held with 13 judges from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where they heard oral arguments in the ongoing appeal. On August 1, 2016, the judges reversed the previous ruling, finding the coins to be property of the United States government. The Langbords appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on April 17, 2017 denied certiorari.|$|E

5000|$|Asset {{forfeiture}} or <b>asset</b> <b>seizure</b> {{is a form}} of confiscation {{of assets}} by the state. It typically applies to the alleged proceeds or instruments of crime. This applies, but is not limited, to terrorist activities, drug related crimes, and other criminal and even civil offenses. Some jurisdictions specifically use the term [...] "confiscation" [...] instead of forfeiture. The alleged purpose of asset forfeiture is to disrupt criminal activity by confiscating assets that potentially could have been beneficial to the individual or organization.|$|E
50|$|On January 27, 2014, {{during the}} demonstrations {{leading up to}} the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Freeland wrote an op-ed for The Globe and Mail, in which she excoriated the {{government}} of Viktor Yanukovich. She is a proponent of personal <b>asset</b> <b>seizures</b> and travel bans as part of programmes of economic sanctions. Later, at the beginning of March, Freeland visited Ukraine on behalf of the Liberal Party, and tweeted her progress in meeting community leaders and members of the government in Kyiv. She lunched with the chief rabbi of Kyiv, met with Mustafa Dzhemilev, leader of the Crimean Tatars and an MP, and with Vitaly Klitchko, who is leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party, and with Ukrainian MP Petro Poroshenko, who was subsequently elected President of Ukraine in May 2014, Ukrainian presidential elections.|$|R
50|$|Johnny again {{reached out}} to Tony for help, this time with his {{financial}} situation. Johnny elected to use his brother-in-law Anthony as a go-between instead of Phil. Johnny knew he faced <b>asset</b> <b>seizures</b> and wanted to secure some capital for his family, planning to sell his share as a silent partner in a heavy equipment firm in New Orleans. Johnny had received the share {{when one of the}} owners, Paul Calviac, got into thousands of dollars of gambling debt with him. The deal was not without difficulties. Calviac was embittered and unwilling to sell any of the company, facing huge profits following Hurricane Katrina, Anthony had trouble communicating in code with Johnny and Tony wanted more than the 7% of the sale that Johnny suggested. Johnny eventually let Tony's brother-in-law, Bobby Baccalieri, buy his home at half price to ensure that Tony would enforce the sale.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{issue of}} {{contention}} {{has been the}} [...] "Law for the Management and Protection of the Assets of the Refugees and the Absentees" [...] passed in September 2015 by the Jazira legislative council, which, in effect, authorises the confiscation of all assets {{of people who have}} left the region. Representatives of Christian Assyrians in the council refused to vote on the text, and {{the community as a whole}} perceived themselves targeted by the measure. While the law does not explicitly single out any ethnic group, the number of Christians who fled the region is much higher than other groups, so they would be more affected by <b>asset</b> <b>seizures</b> than other communities. In a bid to appease the Christian community, but also probably to avoid a backlash with foreign backers, the PYD eventually backtracked and agreed to hand over any assets seized from Christians to the church.|$|R
50|$|The third Commission was {{installed}} in March 1988 under the presidency of PCI senator Gerardo Chiaromonte.

5000|$|Both {{demand and}} supply {{reduction}} are important. [...] "the consuming countries {{need to get}} serious about curbing drug addiction. If there was less demand for heroin, the bottom really would fall out of the opium market." [...] Farmers economically dependent on opium must have viable alternatives that give sustainable income. On the supply side, identifying the most-wanted traffickers and subjecting them to international arrest warrants with extradition, <b>asset</b> <b>seizure,</b> and travel bans could help. While {{it is not easy to}} destroy opium storage and heroin production laboratories, it is far easier to destroy drugs at the source than in transit.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} factor in sovereign default {{is the presence of}} significant debts owed to foreign investors such as banks who are unable to obtain timely payment via political support from governments, supranational courts or negotiation; the enforcement of creditor's rights against sovereign states is frequently difficult. Such willful defaults (the equivalent of strategic bankruptcy by a company or strategic default by a mortgager, except without the possibility of the exercise of normal creditor's rights such as <b>asset</b> <b>seizure</b> and sale) can be considered a variety of sovereign theft; this is similar to expropriation (including inadequate repayment for the exercise of eminent domain). Some also believe that sovereign default is a dark side of globalization and capitalism.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. Department of Justice began {{moves to}} recover more than US$1 billion from {{people close to}} Najib and 1MDB.

[...] "Malaysian Official 1" [...] was alleged to have received around 681 million USD (2.797 billion MYR) of stolen money from 1MDB while returning most of it. In September 2016, Najib was identified as [...] "Malaysian Official 1" [...] by Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department and the Barisan Nasional strategic communications director.

40|$|The {{currently}} pending Megaupload case highlights {{that in the}} United States jurisdiction {{there is}} {{the urgent need for}} additional third-party protections in cloud <b>assets</b> <b>seizure.</b> Using the case as a point of departure, this thesis plans to investigate if a similar need is also required among the European countries. In this light, I am interested to know: What is the current state of third party protection of digital <b>assets</b> in cloud <b>seizures?</b> Connected to this, the following questions need to be answered: • Under European law, is seizing a domain name and copying data classified as a seizure? • Does cloud data constitutes property under European law? • Does storing data into the cloud means losing the ownership rights over it? • Should search-and-seizure procedure happen without notifying the users? To the extent that the research finds that the protection of third parties is deficient or weak, I will delve further in the analysis on how it ought to be strengthened. One potential way could be by implementing a template for guidelines on actions of different stakeholders that could be applied on a global basis. Additionally, the thesis argues that the protections and safeguards of physical assets should also expand to digital assets "renting" space in the cloud. I believe that, although there must be a balance between protecting third parties and allowing the government to continue to use asset confiscation as a deterrent against criminal activity in the digital sphere, that balance needs to be heavily weighted towards protecting innocent third parties...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{models have}} {{suggested}} that sanctions may be important for enforcing sovereign debt contracts (Bulow and Rogoff, 1989 a, 1989 b). This paper examines the role of sanctions in promoting debt repayment during the classical gold standard period. We analyze {{a wide range of}} sanctions including gunboat diplomacy, external fiscal control over a country's finances, <b>asset</b> <b>seizures</b> by private creditors, and trade sanctions. We find that "supersanctions," instances where military pressure or political control were applied in response to default, were an important and commonly used enforcement mechanism from 1870 - 1913. Following the implementation of supersanctions, on average, ex ante default probabilities on new debt issues fell by more than 60 percent, yield spreads declined approximately 800 basis points, and defaulting countries experienced almost a 100 percent reduction of time spent in default. We also find that debt defaulters that surrendered their fiscal sovereignty {{for an extended period of}} time were able to issue large amounts of new debt on international capital markets. Consistent with policies advocated by Caballero and Dornbusch (2002) for Argentina, our results suggest that third-party enforcement mechanisms, with the authority to enact financial and fiscal reforms, may be beneficial for resuscitating the capital market reputation of sovereign defaulters. ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{financial}} area, new measures against money laundering were announcedin October 2001. A new office within the Ministry of the Interior {{was charged with}} collecting and analyzing information contained in financial disclosures. Procedures were set up to better enforce <b>asset</b> <b>seizure</b> and forfeiture laws. German authorities were given wider latitude in accessing financial data of terrorist groups. Steps were taken to curb international money laundering and improve bank customer screening procedures. The Federal Criminal Police Office set up an independent unit responsible for the surveillance of suspicious financial flows. Measures to preventmoney laundering now include the checking of electronic databases to ensure thatbanks are properly screening their clients’ business relationships and that they aremeeting the requirement to set up internal monitoring systems.In seeking to dry up the sources of terrorist financing, recent regulations aim tostrengthen Germany’s own capabilities, as well as German cooperation withinternational efforts.|$|E

50|$|Johnny's {{efforts to}} {{maintain}} control of his family ultimately proved futile. His lawyer, Ron Perse, floated the possibility of cooperating with the FBI, but John was quick to dismiss this. However, as the trial neared, Ron arranged {{a deal with the}} government. Facing a massive <b>asset</b> <b>seizure</b> that would have left both him and his wife destitute and a case he could not possibly beat, Johnny pleaded guilty to 47 RICO predicates in exchange for a reduced sentence of 15 years and a fine of $4.1 million — effectively ending his position as boss (but still leaving Ginny enough money to live comfortably). As part of the deal, he was also required to give an allocution admitting his involvement in organized crime (although he did not reveal the names of any associates). Members of both the Soprano and Lupertazzi families were angered by his allocution, believing that John should have stood trial before admitting anything regarding La Cosa Nostra. Johnny was now serving 15 years in federal prison, and was considered persona non grata among his former associates.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on some recent cases {{involving}} attempts by private creditors to enforce judgments against state assets.

5000|$|Infobae {{described}} the judicial {{resolution in the}} following terms:In the resolution, the judge reiterated that the determining factors allowing the accident to occur were [...] "the lack of effective control and subsequently taking measures by the responsible persons of the firm LAPA S.A. at the decision-making level, {{with respect to the}} aspects relevant to flight security."In this way he placed responsibility on the airline directors for having completed [...] "in a negligent manner" [...] the responsibilities of their posts, including contracting the pilot Gustavo Weigel, allowing the development of his career path at the business.The judge highlighted [...] "the constant and permanent contact and direct participation that Deutsch and Boyd had in the politics of advancement in the business" [...] and he reproached them for [...] "the lack of effective control that might have made it possible for the pilots to overcome the errors committed."The accused face million-dollar <b>asset</b> <b>seizures</b> and charges that have accrued to them from the commercial court that conducted the public examination of the airline.As for the members of the Air Force, they will be tried for neglecting to observe the law pertaining to content control of the Operations Manual of the airline industry and the norms for training airplane pilots.Accordingly, the judge reiterated that Lentino was accused of not having completed his principal duty adequately, namely running control checks on the psychophysiological fitness of pilots.The crime of which the ex-officials stand accused carries a penalty of up to two years of prison, and special incarceration can double the time when the offense is committed while in public office.The final judgement of the case was delayed by motions filed by the defense of several accused in order to slow the jury trial process, all of which were finally rejected weeks later by the Federal Court in Buenos Aires.|$|R

[...] This complicates, of course, the complex US relations with Pakistan and Iran.|$|E
40|$|This diploma work {{focuses on}} the issue of debt {{collection}} via deductions from pension payments. The theoretical part analyses the legal conditions for this type of debt collection and defines the terms related to it. The first chapters generally focus on financial literacy among the population. The subsequent chapters map the act of deducting amounts from pension payments, the method of calculating the deduction amounts and the process of making deductions when receivables overlap and when the payer of income changes. The other sections of the work focus on insolvency and the recipient payer's responsibility in the event of deductions. The practical part compares and analyses data about the development of numbers of pensions affected by ordered <b>asset</b> <b>seizure</b> and details regarding the amount of income earned during working life and during retirement. Based on the author's own observation, the final part of the document contains suggestions of possible solutions that would reduce the number of pensions affected by <b>asset</b> <b>seizure...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{outcomes}} of 128 cases from a labor court in Mexico in which a judge awarded money to a plaintiff {{who claimed to have}} been fired by a firm without cause. The judgment was enforced in only 44 % of the cases. A plaintiff may try to enforce a judgment by petitioning the court to seize the firm’s assets when the firm refuses to pay. Half of the enforced judgments required at least one seizure attempt. We estimate the parameters of post judgment games in which the worker does not know if a seizure attempt would ultimately succeed and show that these models explain the data well. We then simulate the effects of a policy that reduces worker costs of a seizure attempt. We find that this policy would increase the probability of enforcement, either by increasing the probability that the worker attempts an <b>asset</b> <b>seizure</b> or by inducing firms to pay voluntarily to avoid such seizure attempts. However, reducing worker costs of seizure attempts can only have a modest effect on enforcement probabilities because seizure attempts are often unsuccessful...|$|E
40|$|According to the National Council and Crime and Delinquency (NCCD), prison populations will {{increase}} by 35 {{percent over the}} next five years under the current criminal justice policies. This rate of growth is significantly lower than NCCD's 1989 estimates of a 60 percent increase over five years. The principal reason for the lower growth rate is a 20 percent reduction in drug arrests, which in turn is reducing projected jail and prison admissions. The declining number of drug arrests are related to the fiscal crisis of state and local governments, drug <b>asset</b> and <b>seizure</b> laws, and lower drug use. However, prison populations will continue to grow despite reductions in admissions due to the passage of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and lengthier prison terms for certain crimes. Assuming that the 16 states researched are representative of trends that are on-going in other states and the Federal Prison System, the nation's prison population will reach 1 million inmates by 1994...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the federal}} {{government}} has vastly increased its use of <b>asset</b> forfeiture, the <b>seizure</b> of property connected to illegal activities. As authorized under federal law, the government is also able to restrain assets prior to trial when the government belives those assets will ultimately be found to be forfeitable. This pretrial restraint potentially implicates the constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel for criminal defendants. In the upcoming Supreme Court case of Luis v. United States, the Court will address the question of whether a pretrial restraint of assets which are not traceable to any illegal activity is permissible when those assets are needed to hire defense counsel. In this Commentary, the Author argues that the right to counsel of one’s own choosing is not unlimited and that pretrial restraint is necessary to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes...|$|R
40|$|My aim in {{this article}} is to provide a first pass at {{thinking}} the social effects of this credit expansion which I do via credit as a form of public security. In {{the first part of this}} article, I chart the expansion of personal credit as a form of financial corporativism during PT governments in Brazil since 2003. As well, I trace some of the principle cultural mediations of credit and the role of Rio de Janeiro as the site of the production of these mediations, in particular the form of financial mestizagem elaborated in the 2012 novela Cheias de Charme. In the second part, I turn my attention to the kind of subjects that credit expansion has produced. Here I argue that credit expansion has produced a form of the subject as a pass-thru where the state is less concerned with subjects’ interiority and more with facilitating the <b>seizure</b> of <b>assets.</b> This <b>seizure</b> requires a concomitant expansion of militarization and the threat of state violence which further hollows out the subject. I conclude by returning to Rio de Janeiro to apply these insights to the post-UPP political environment. My overall argument is that credit has functioned as a form of public security in two ways: first, state-linked discourse and cultural productions concerning credit-based consumption have produced new figures of national belonging, while, second, the legal environment required for credit expansion produces subjects increasingly exposed to the threat of state violenc...|$|R
