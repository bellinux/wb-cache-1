Visions for a future where autism has been eradicated, Sinclair believes, is the desire to end the autistic culture.|$|E

25|$|In {{defiance}} of the common complaint that anti-cure advocates' ability to articulate complex opinions in writing—which some critics see as being impossible for autistic people—autistic adults such as Amanda Baggs use their own writing and videos to demonstrate {{that it is possible}} for severely disabled autistics to be autism rights advocates. She says that when the critics assume that intelligent and articulate autistic people do not have difficulties like self-injurious behavior and difficulty with self-care, they affect the opinions of policy makers and {{make it more difficult for}} intelligent and articulate autistic people to get services.

40|$|The article {{sets out}} to {{describe}} {{the results of the}} author’s own study based on the cognitive autism theory and carried out to prepare the following Internet platforms: KrainaOza. org and KrainaOza. pl. As it attempts to shed light on the educational and professional training needs in <b>autistic</b> <b>persons,</b> the study presented in the article takes account of the fact that autism, on the one hand, {{is an important part of}} an autistic person’s identity, and on the other, a concealed form of his or her disability. The study presented in the article used qualitative study methods and was carried out on a group of 20 autistic adults with either a moderate or a high recognised level of disability. It utilised both one-to-one and panel interviews, which overall amounted to around 40 hours of interviews and were carried out with the participants in the Project PI-PWP Edu – Autyzm nr WND-POKL. 07. 02. 02 - 12 - 022 / 11 following the recruitment process conducted by the Wspólnota Nadziei Foundation. The conclusions from the study were used as a basis for an Internet platform which is presented in detail in the latter part of the article. The platform is intended to provide educational support to highly functional <b>autistic</b> <b>persons,</b> employers, teachers (academic teachers included) and students. It is also designed to provide easy access to a wide range of information on autism and to serve as a database with employment opportunities for <b>autistic</b> <b>persons.</b> It also presents more detail about their work and their functioning as well as advice on how to communicate with <b>autistic</b> <b>persons.</b> The content presented by the platform is designed for <b>autistic</b> <b>persons</b> and has been translated into pictograms Sclera, which guarantees optimum communication with <b>autistic</b> <b>persons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Autism is a {{communication}} disorder that mandates early and continuous educational interventions on various levels like the everyday social, communication and reasoning skills. Computer-aided education {{has recently been}} considered as a likely intervention method for such cases, and therefore different systems have been proposed and developed worldwide. In more recent years, affective computing applications for the aforementioned interventions have also been proposed {{to shed light on}} this problem. In this paper, we examine the technological and educational needs of affective interventions for <b>autistic</b> <b>persons.</b> Enabling affective technologies are visited and a number of possible exploitation scenarios are illustrated. Emphasis is placed in covering the continuous and long term needs of <b>autistic</b> <b>persons</b> by unobtrusive and ubiquitous technologies with the engagement of an affective speaking avatar. A personalised prototype system facilitating these scenarios is described. In addition the feedback from educators for <b>autistic</b> <b>persons</b> is provided for the system in terms of its usefulness, efficiency and the envisaged reaction of the <b>autistic</b> <b>persons,</b> collected by means of an anonymous questionnaire.

2500|$|Treatment is expensive; {{indirect}} costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a U.S. study estimated an average discounted lifetime cost of $ ( [...] dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% medical care, 30% extra {{education and other}} care, and 60% lost economic productivity.

Legal rights to treatment are complex, vary with location and age, and require advocacy by caregivers. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 U.S. study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment. After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and estate planning.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: To date, {{few studies}} have focused on the {{viewpoints}} of <b>autistic</b> <b>persons</b> themselves despite an increasing number of published autobiographies. The aim {{of this study is to}} highlight their personal experiences, and to compare them to scientific and medical knowledge and representations. Method: Adopting an anthropological approach, we analyzed 16 autobiographical writings and 5 interviews with <b>autistic</b> <b>persons.</b> We systematically screened this material and explored the writers' sociodemographic characteristics, cognitive skills and interests with a focus on their sensoryperceptual experiences and their representations of autism. Results: The authors' ages (22 - 67 years), their countries (n = 8) and backgrounds were varied, and most of them were high-functioning individuals with autism or Asperger syndrome. The most striking observations were that all of them pointed out that unusual perceptions and information processing, as well as impairments in emotional regulation, were the core symptoms of autism, whereas the current classifications do not mention them. Conclusions: Our results suggest that what has been selected as major signs by psychiatric nosography is regarded as manifestations induced by perceptive peculiarities and strong emotional reactions by the <b>autistic</b> <b>persons</b> who expressed themselves. These considerations deserve to be taken into account by professionals to better understand the behavior and needs of <b>autistic</b> <b>persons.</b> We propose to include this point in the reflection on the next psychiatric classifications...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{individuals}} {{classified as}} autistic have severe difficulty assigning mental states to others, {{and they seem}} to lack theory of mind capabilities. Researchers who study the relationship between autism and theory of mind attempt to explain the connection in a variety of ways. One account assumes that theory of mind plays a role in the attribution of mental states to others and in childhood pretend play. According to Leslie, theory of mind is the capacity to mentally represent thoughts, beliefs, and desires, {{regardless of whether or not}} the circumstances involved are real. This might explain why some autistic individuals show extreme deficits in both theory of mind and pretend play. However, Hobson proposes a social-affective justification, which suggests that with an <b>autistic</b> <b>person,</b> deficits in theory of mind result from a distortion in understanding and responding to emotions. [...] He suggests that typically developing human beings, unlike autistic individuals, are born with a set of skills (such as social referencing ability) that later lets them comprehend and react to other people's feelings. [...] Other scholars emphasize that autism involves a specific developmental delay, so that autistic children vary in their deficiencies, because they experience difficulty in different stages of growth. Very early setbacks can alter proper advancement of joint-attention behaviors, which may lead to a failure to form a full theory of mind.|$|E

Another important factor is creating a low arousal space. Environments with {{the least amount of}} disruption will help autistic people remain calm. It is important to speak in quiet, non-disruptive tones and to use a physical space that has a low level of disruption.

On the other hand, naturalistic research suggests that children with high-functioning autism are 'noticeably deficient' in their ability to talk about cognitive mental states at home (Tager-Flusberg 1992).
