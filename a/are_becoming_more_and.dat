25|$|Historically, unions of Protestant {{churches were}} {{enforced}} by the state, usually {{in order to have}} a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern Christian ecumenism progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Some of the recent major examples are the United Protestant Church of France (2013) and the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (2004). As mainline Protestantism shrinks in Europe and North America due to the rise of secularism, Reformed and Lutheran denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations. The phenomenon is much less common among evangelical, nondenominational and charismatic churches as new ones arise and plenty of them remain independent of each other.|$|E

2500|$|Livestock {{and poultry}} are raised on animal feed, {{much of which}} is {{composed}} of the leftovers from processing crops, including GM crops.

The high-protein defatted and toasted soy meal becomes livestock feed and dog food. 98% of the US soybean crop goes for livestock feed.
