5|$|In the Outer Hebrides {{all of the}} {{inhabited}} {{islands are}} now connected {{to at least one}} other island by a land transport route, but only four Inner Hebridean islands are connected by road, all to the mainland. The Clachan Bridge from Argyll to Seil was designed by Thomas Telford and dates from 1792. Skye has been connected to Kyle of Lochalsh by the Skye Bridge since 1995. Danna is also connected to the Tayvallich peninsula in Argyll by a stone causeway; and tiny Eilean Donan, dominated by its castle, has had a connection to the mainland perhaps from as early as the 13th century. The <b>arched</b> <b>bridge</b> in use today was constructed in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road {{known today as}} the Sag Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line opened in the 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton {{took control of the}} now dilapidated road and removed the toll gates. NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an <b>arched</b> <b>bridge</b> that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with a girder bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and is in the same location.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Arch</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} bridge types in China. More than 150 {{concrete}} <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> and more than 130 CFST <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> with a span over 100 m have been built. Great developments of <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> have been taking place since 1990. The three main kind <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> with world span records were built in this period, i. e., 550 m Lu Pu <b>Bridge</b> for steel <b>arch</b> <b>bridge,</b> 420 m Wanxian Yangtze River Bridge for reinforced concrete <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> and 460 m Wu-shan Yangtze River Bridge for concrete filled steel tubular <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>bridge</b> is still developing.

25|$|This type of <b>bridge</b> {{comprises}} an <b>arch</b> {{where the}} deck is completely above the arch. The {{area between the}} arch and the deck {{is known as the}} spandrel. If the spandrel is solid, usually the case in a masonry or stone <b>arch</b> <b>bridge,</b> the bridge is called a closed-spandrel deck <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b> If the deck is supported by a number of vertical columns rising from the <b>arch,</b> the <b>bridge</b> is known as an open-spandrel deck <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b> The Alexander Hamilton Bridge is an example of an open-spandrel <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b> Finally, if the arch supports the deck only {{at the top of the}} <b>arch,</b> the <b>bridge</b> is called a cathedral <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R

5|$|This {{section is}} crossed by King Street, which follows {{the course of}} a Roman road. Where it crosses the Maxey Cut, to the south of the {{original}} channels, there are a series of 14 arches which comprise Lolham Bridges. They are grouped into five structures to cross the channels in the area, and were funded by the County of Northamptonshire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The longest span is , and the cutwaters carry inscribed stones recording the County's involvement. To the north, an early nineteenth century stone rubble <b>arched</b> <b>bridge</b> carries the road over a drainage ditch near Lolham Mill, while an eighteenth-century bridge, probably rebuilt in the following century, crosses the mill stream. Another pair of early nineteenth-century bridges, built of coursed limestone with ashlar dressings, carry the road over the northernmost channel.|$|E

25|$|The river Derwent ran {{parallel}} to City Road and formed {{one of the}} boundaries. A large wooden structured boathouse was built almost {{right up to the}} boundary of the Great Northern Railway line in 1877 (later known as the LNER railway) which ran on a brick arched viaduct. A metal <b>arched</b> <b>bridge</b> built by Handyside of Derby Andrew Handyside and Company allowed this railway line to cross the river Derwent. Boats and oars were stored on the ground floor, and the changing and locker rooms were up an outside a wooden staircase. This boathouse was also the headquarters of the Derby Rowing Club and also the Derby School Rowing Club premises. Derby School boat club began in 1862 and was closed down in 1889.

The lock is a grade II listed structure, dating from {{the building of the}} canal, although a dated kerbstone indicates that it was modified in 1899. The adjacent lock keepers cottage, which is built of hammer-dressed stone, with two storeys and a stone slate roof, dates from the early or mid 19th century, and is also a listed structure. The canal turns to the south west to run parallel to the River Colne, and passes under a railway bridge to reach the Clone Bridge Lock. Just above it is a hammer-dressed stone warehouse, dating from the 18th century, followed by an <b>arched</b> <b>bridge</b> which carries Colne Bridge Road over the canal.

40|$|<b>Arch</b> <b>bridges</b> {{are one of}} the popular, {{oldest and}} graceful bridges which are being built in zones of the city and out of the city. However arches becomes {{especially}} sensitive to their buckling response due to dominated compressive force in the arch. In order to ensure stability conditions of the individual <b>arch</b> and <b>arch</b> <b>bridges,</b> it is estimated not just geometrical factor of arch, residual stress, work conditions, geometric imperfections but geometrical nonlinearity too. Geometric nonlinearity especially dominates in many times static indeterminable systems such as network <b>arch</b> <b>bridges.</b> However there are a few represents of estimation of geometric nonlinearity of the new construction form of the <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> created in a middle of 20 th century.

2500|$|In total, {{the bridge}} {{would have a}} length of 153 m. [...] The plans were audacious for that day and age; at 84.65 m, the central span {{was to be the}} largest stone arch in existence. [...] The roadway was {{constructed}} of reinforced concrete, a material that had only recently come into use, the weight of which was carried on the columns of the smaller arches, thereby saving the heavy infilling used in a conventional <b>arched</b> <b>bridge.</b> [...] The arches and columns were constructed from sandstone, quarried locally at Ernzen, Dillingen, Gilsdorf, and Verlorenkost.

Belknap, under influence from the Keokuk Packet steamliner company, was opposed to its completion. He desired the bridge torn down, so steamers would not have to lower their smoke stacks to go under the bridge. [...] Belknap created a commission to either destroy and rebuild the bridge to allow steamers to go under, or to build a canal around the bridge for steamers to pass. [...] Eads, who was friends with Grant, visited Washington D.C. in November 1873 before Belknap submitted the report to Congress, and asked that Grant rescue the bridge from destruction.
