40|$|Muck {{conveyors}} are {{a potential}} source of airborne dust. Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the <b>conveyor,</b> <b>dries</b> out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays. Scraper and spray wash will wash return belts and idlers. 7. 5. 11 Airways, Haulage Ways, Mine Cars and Dumping Stations a) Airways and rail haulage ways Cleaning the walls and floors of airways and rail haulage ways, by periodically washing down or vacuuming, will remove many potential dust sources. Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) Mine cars Keeping the muck in the mine cars wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing mine cars regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking a loaded mine car for a long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of mine cars should not be along primary intake airways. c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck car dumping stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust. Local dust scrubbers located at the dumps will clean dusty air that escapes from the dump station enclosures. Choice of location and equipment for dump stations must prioritize dust control. 7. 5. 12 Leakage and Recirculation of Contaminated Air from Exhaust Ducts Leakage from exhaust ducts containing contaminated air and subsequent recirculation of the leakage contributes to dust problems.

40|$|Refractance Window 1 (RW) {{system is}} a novel drying method for {{converting}} liquid foods and other related biomaterials into pow-ders, flakes, or sheets with added value. In this system, purees or juices prepared from fruits, vegetables, or herbs dry in short times, typically 3 – 5 min, resulting in products with excellent color, vitamin, and antioxidant retention. The RW drying systems are simple and relatively inexpensive when compared with freeze drying, which usually needs large installations to be economical. In RW drying systems thermal energy is transferred from hot water to a film of puree or juice spread thinly on a plastic <b>conveyor</b> belt.

5000|$|A {{cold front}} {{is defined as}} the leading edge of a cooler mass of air, {{replacing}} at ground level a warmer mass of air, which lies within a fairly sharp surface trough of low pressure. It forms in the wake of an extratropical cyclone, at the leading edge of its cold air advection pattern, which is also known as the cyclone's <b>dry</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt circulation. Temperature changes across the boundary can exceed [...] [...] When enough moisture is present, rain can occur along the boundary. If there is significant instability along the boundary, a narrow line of thunderstorms can form along the frontal zone. If instability is less, a broad shield of rain can move in behind the front, which increases the temperature difference across the boundary. Cold fronts are stronger in the fall and spring transition seasons and weakest during the summer. When a cold front catches up with the preceding warm front, the portion of the boundary that does so is then known as an occluded front.|$|R
40|$|The coal {{handling}} process involves {{a number of}} activities from loading and unloading to stockpile. This procedure {{can be carried out}} by coal conveying system which includes a large number of mechanical equipment. The important activities under {{coal handling}} include loading/unloading, dumping, transporting etc. which are done with the help of various mechanical equipment. Every organization wants to profit as much as possible and increases their production rate by using maximum effort for care and maintain. And it is possible if the equipment is running in good condition with zero breakdowns, zero accident, and zero wastage. This research work presents a practical analysis for monitoring the operational performance of equipment, which shows the two additional objectives: the first one is the identification of major causes of production losses which are born from malfunctions, breakdowns, and bad operating programme. And the second one is the implementation of a suitable and appropriate methodology for improvement of coal handling systems, which handling the coal from bunker to stockyard within an industry. The data are analyzed and compared with World class to Obtained OEE. During the operation, many reasons are there, which affect the production rate called six big losses. To minimize the six big losses and improve productivity, an accurate effective estimation of equipment is necessary and offers a suitable methodology. For the purpose of the study, a case study methodology is applied in order to analyze in the depth of maintenance in a real context. The primary focus of this research work is to monitor the equipment performance in coal handling plants and its contribution to the company for overall operation. The OEE data are recorded through tables and compared to world class OEE considering the operational losses and also performance reports are briefly analyzed through figures in terms of equipment failures in different locations, idle time for materials, operators and speed loss time for minor stoppages like sensor blocked, cleaning/checking or component jamming. For minimizing the downtime and promote productivity, a suitable methodology is developed through tables for determining the status of coal handling equipment viz. Tippler, Side arm charger, Reversible <b>apron</b> feeder, Belt <b>conveyor</b> system, Stacker, Reclaimer. This research work deals with the quantitative measurement of equipment performance in coal handling plant, which defines losses for many reasons. As a result, valuable information is provided concerning the performance monitoring of production equipment and implementing a suitable methodology for improvement of coal handling machinery operations viz tippler, side arm charger, reversible <b>apron</b> feeder, belt <b>conveyor,</b> stacker, reclaimer. Introduce the estimation and evaluation of OEE procedure which is highly valid and accurate performance indicator and has become very popular in all the industries starting from mining area for excavation of material to harbour area for material handling. OEE shows a right metrics to analyze the ordinary issue and improving the whole process. There are many formulas, systems and metrics being used to improve the whole production process, but one and only OEE reduces complex problem into easy. The biggest advantage of OEE allows companies to have separate business functions by applying a single easy to understand the formula. OEE {{is by far the most}} effective benchmarking tool in making sound management and maintenance decisions.

40|$|Extratropical cyclone lifecycles {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} {{with the aim of}} understanding the dynamical mechanisms involved in their development. Previous work has often been based on subjective analysis of individual case studies. Such case studies have contributed heavily to the generation of conceptual models of extratropical cyclones that provide a framework for understanding the dynamical evolution of cyclones. These conceptual models are widely used in educational meteorology courses throughout the world to illustrate the basic structure and evolution of extratropical cyclones. This article presents a database of extratropical cyclone composites which highlight the average structure and evolution of 20 years of extratropical cyclones, as opposed to individual case studies. The composite fields are achieved by combining a database containing cyclone tracks from the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1989 - 2009, 6 hourly) with the full 3 D ERA-Interim reanalysis fields. Vertical and horizontal composites of cyclone structure for cyclones generated in the Atlantic and Pacific regions identifying features such as the relative positions of cold, warm and occluded fronts and their associated wind and cloud patterns are shown. In addition the evolution of cyclonic flows such as the warm and cold <b>conveyor</b> belts and <b>dry</b> intrusion are illustrated. A webpage containing an archive of the composited data is freely available for educational purposes. ...|$|R
40|$|Intense, cyclone-like shaped {{plumes of}} tropospheric bromine {{monoxide}} (BrO) are regularly observed by GOME- 2 {{on board the}} MetOp-A satellite over Arctic sea ice in polar spring. These plumes are often transported by high-latitude cyclones, sometimes over several days despite the short atmospheric lifetime of BrO. However, only few {{studies have focused on}} the role of polar weather systems in the development, duration and transport of tropospheric BrO plumes during bromine explosion events. The latter are caused by an autocatalytic chemical chain reaction associated with tropospheric ozone depletion and initiated by the release of bromine from cold brine-covered ice or snow to the atmosphere. In this manuscript, a case study investigating a comma-shaped BrO plume which developed over the Beaufort Sea and was observed by GOME- 2 for several days is presented. By making combined use of satellite data and numerical models, it is shown that the occurrence of the plume was closely linked to frontal lifting in a polar cyclone and that it most likely resided in the lowest 3  km of the troposphere. In contrast to previous case studies, we demonstrate that the <b>dry</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt, a potentially bromine-rich stratospheric air stream which can complicate interpretation of satellite retrieved tropospheric BrO, is spatially separated from the observed BrO plume. It is concluded that weather conditions associated with the polar cyclone favoured the bromine activation cycle and blowing snow production, which may have acted as a bromine source during the bromine explosion event...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} and analyzes the three-dimensional dynamical structure of intense Mediterranean cyclones. The analysis {{is based on}} a composite approach of the 200 most intense cyclones during the period 1989 - 2008 that have been identified and tracked using the output of a coupled ocean-atmosphere regional simulation with 20 km horizontal grid spacing and 3 -hourly output. It is shown that the most intense Mediterranean cyclones have a common baroclinic life cycle with a potential vorticity (PV) streamer associated with an upper-level cyclonic Rossby wave breaking, which precedes cyclogenesis in the region and triggers baroclinic instability. It is argued that this common baroclinic life cycle is due to the strongly horizontally sheared environment in the Mediterranean basin, on the poleward flank of the quasi-persistent subtropical jet. The composite life cycle of the cyclones is further analyzed considering the evolution of key atmospheric elements as potential temperature and PV, as well as the cyclones' thermodynamic profiles and rainfall. It is shown that most intense Mediterranean cyclones are associated with warm <b>conveyor</b> belts and <b>dry</b> air intrusions, similar to those of other strong extratropical cyclones, but of rather small scale. Before cyclones reach their mature stage, the streamer's role is crucial to advect moist and warm air towards the cyclones center. These dynamical characteristics, typical for very intense extratropical cyclones in the main storm track regions, are also valid for these Mediterranean cases that have features that are visually similar to tropical cyclones...|$|R
40|$|Composites of wind speeds, {{equivalent}} potential temperature, mean {{sea level}} pressure, vertical velocity, and relative humidity have been produced for the 100 most intense extratropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere winter for the 40 -yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) and the high resolution global environment model (HiGEM). Features of conceptual models of cyclone structure—the warm conveyor belt, cold <b>conveyor</b> belt, and <b>dry</b> intrusion—have been identified in the composites from ERA- 40 and compared to HiGEM. Such features can be identified in the composite fields despite the smoothing that occurs in the compositing process. The surface features and the three-dimensional structure of the cyclones in HiGEM compare very well with those from ERA- 40. The warm conveyor belt is identified in the temperature and wind fields as a mass of warm air undergoing moist isentropic uplift and is very similar in ERA- 40 and HiGEM. The rate of ascent is lower in HiGEM, associated with a shallower slope of the moist isentropes in the warm sector. There are also differences in the relative humidity fields in the warm conveyor belt. In ERA- 40, the high values of relative humidity are strongly associated with the moist isentropic uplift, whereas in HiGEM these are not so strongly associated. The cold conveyor belt is identified as rearward flowing air that undercuts the warm conveyor belt and produces a low-level jet, and is very similar in HiGEM and ERA- 40. The dry intrusion is identified in the 500 -hPa vertical velocity and relative humidity. The structure of the dry intrusion compares well between HiGEM and ERA- 40 but the descent is weaker in HiGEM because of weaker along-isentrope flow behind the composite cyclone. HiGEM’s ability to represent the key features of extratropical cyclone structure can give confidence in future predictions from this model. ...|$|R
40|$|At Philips Components in Roermond ceramic {{capacitors}} and actuators {{are produced}} with a multilayer technology. One o f {{the first steps}} in the production process is foil casting. This research is concemed with the heat transfer processes in the tunnel dryer of a foil casting machine. Although a lot o f development work {{has been carried out}} on the production process, the tunnel dryer is still a black box and the existence of non-homogeneous drying is difficult to explain. The objective of this research project was to get insight in the transversal uniformity o f the airflow and the heat transfer toward the foil in a cross-section of the tunnel. The ceramic foil, carried by a metal <b>conveyor</b> belt, <b>dries</b> on its way through the tunnel by radiation from heating coils and by a forced convective air flow. Due to the hot side walls of the rectangular duct buoyancy forces may create natural convection that may have an influence on the heat transfer. An analysis with dimensionless correlations has shown that radiation is the most important mechanism for heat transfer, although the effect o f natural convection can not be neglected indeed. Both mechanisms have been examined independently with experiments and numerical simulations. The flow through the duct has been modelled with the Computational Fluid Dynamics package Fluent. This makes it possible to analyse the influence of the hot tunnel walls on the airflow and the contribution of this flow to the heat flux toward the belt. Fluent simulations have demonstrated the existence of buoyancy rolls and their positive effect on the uniformity of the convective heat transfer. The transversal velocities are {{in the beginning of the}} tunnel about 25 percent o f the axial velocities but they slowly decrease further downstream. The radiative heat transfer in a cross-section has been simulated with the finite element program Ansys. These simulations have shown that the heat radiation toward the middle of the belt is about 20 percent larger than to the edges. Further it has been tried with the Ansys simulations to find a way to make the radiation from the heating coil and the tunnel walls toward the belt more uniform. Experiments in a tunnel dryer has been performed to verify the simulations and to demonstrate the non-uniform transversal heat transfer that causes the non-homogeneous drying front o f the foil. A suitable method has been developed to measure lateral temperature differences at the belt or in the air above during their way through the tunnel. However after translating the temperature differences into radiative heat flux differences, it has been concluded that this method is quantitatively not comparable with the Ansys simulations. On the ground of the performed simulations and experiments, suggestions have been made for an improved tunnel design. The temperature control system can be improved by connecting the control thermocouple to the heating coil rather than to the side wall. Making the flow more turbulent results in a faster development of the velocity profiles and a more uniform convective heat exchange. A uniform radiative heat flux can be achieved by developing a heating coil that gives the top and side walls equal temperatures. These modifications may improve the heat transport in the tunnel dryer; leading to a more homogeneous drying front. Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische TechnologieApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput saw gins. The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a micronaire value of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the feed and discharge of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform vertical feed results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each feed hopper is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a nip point allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} feed hopper. Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand <b>apron,</b> modifying the <b>conveyor</b> distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the feed hopper motor. Eliminating the uneven lateral feed has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|R
