50|$|Unlike the Volkswagen <b>alloy</b> <b>case</b> used by Hewland, the Traction Avant {{case could}} not be used up side down, as the input shaft height was much higher in {{relation}} to the output shaft axis so that the oil level needed to lubricate the gears would exceed the then-unreliable input shaft oil seal height if used upside down. So the engine needed to sit high above the ground with the oil sump space below, which was not needed by dry-sump racing engines. But the French transaxle was used by several racing car constructors in the late 1950s to 60s with various levels of success.|$|E

50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber {{consists of an}} ablative-lined titanium <b>alloy</b> <b>case</b> to the 16:1 area ratio. Fabrication of the 6Al4V alloy titanium case was accomplished by machining the chamber portion and the exit cone portion from forgings and welding them into one unit at the throat centerline. The ablative liner is fabricated in two segments and installed from either end. The shape of the nozzle extension is such that the ablative liner is retained in the exit cone during transportation, launch and boost. During engine firing, thrust loads force the exit cone liner against the case. The titanium head end assembly which contains the Pintle Injector and propellant valve subcomponents is attached with thirty-six A-286 steel ¼ inch bolts.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} is {{proposed for the}} description of diffusion-induced grain boundary migration (DIGM). The crucial difference between our approach and the previous investigations is that our analysis includes diffusion not only along the grain boundary but also along free surfaces which are {{in contact with the}} grain boundary. The well-posed mathematical problem is formulated by matching the diffusional fields at the triple junction. We take into account the elastic effects which arise due to the sharp concentration jump in front of the moving grain boundary. By means of several simplifications we derive the closed equation for the steady-state velocity of DIGM {{as a function of the}} supersaturation and the system parameters. We find that mass transport at the free surface plays a very important role in the DIGM phenomena. The solution shows asymmetry between the <b>cases</b> of <b>alloying</b> and dealloying. In the <b>alloying</b> <b>case</b> a solution exists even without elastic effects while in the case of dealloying the elastic effects are necessary for DIGM. We also discuss DIGM in the systems consisting of isotopes and show that DIGM does not exist in such systems. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc...|$|R

5000|$|The XJ-S was {{launched}} on 10 September 1975. The {{development of the}} car had begun in the late 1960s as project XJ27, with an initial shape set by Malcolm Sayer, but {{after his death in}} 1970 it was completed by the in-house Jaguar design team, headed by Doug Thorpe. Power came from the Jaguar V12 petrol engine with a choice of a manual or automatic transmission, but the manual was soon dropped as they were left over from V12 E Type production. V12 automobiles were unusual at the time; Italian luxury sports car makers Lamborghini and Ferrari produced such models. The specifications of the XJ-S compared well with both Italian cars; it was able to accelerate to 60 mi/h km/h in 7.6 seconds (automatic) and had a top speed of 143 mi/h km/h. The first series of XJ-S cars had a Borg-Warner Model 12 transmission with a cast-iron case and a bolt-on bell-housing. In 1977 GM Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmissions were fitted.
