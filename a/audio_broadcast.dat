Although {{there are currently}} 73 licensed digital audio broadcasters in Canada, not many consumers yet own digital radios, and the existing digital <b>audio</b> <b>broadcast</b> signals duplicate AM or FM broadcasts. No Canadian radio broadcaster currently offers an exclusively DAB signal.|$|E

500|$|For years, {{the belief}} {{was that the}} final 46seconds of the game were not played after Chamberlain scored his 100th point due to the celebration on the court; Chamberlain himself was quoted as having made that claim. However, {{recordings}} from the WCAU radio broadcast include announcer Bill Campbell resuming his play-by-play call after Chamberlain's 100th point and calling the game to its conclusion. By Gary M. Pomerantz |publisher=Crown Publishing Group (Random House)}} [...] (The web page's interactive <b>audio</b> <b>broadcast</b> of the game uses Adobe Flash Player.) A copy of the radio broadcast of the game was only uncovered in 1988. WCAU's original game tape had been recorded over by one of its engineers, a standard practice in those days. However, a Philadelphian had recorded with a Dictaphone part of Campbell's coverage in the fourth quarter, but only the Warriors possessions. Two years later, a reel-to-reel tape of Campbell's entire fourth quarter call surfaced; Jim Trelease, then a college student at the University of Massachusetts, had recorded a 3am re-broadcast of {{the fourth quarter of}} the game. The NBA merged the reel-to-reel with the Dictaphone tape, which also included a short postgame show. German sports journalist Gunter Bork specified that the interruption resulting from Chamberlain's 100th point lasted for nine minutes, after which play continued.|$|E

Digital cable also typically includes a range of <b>audio</b> <b>broadcast</b> services such as Galaxie and Max Trax. In some markets, digital cable service may also include local radio stations; where this is offered, it has largely replaced the availability of cable FM service. Digital cable, however, is provided only if a customer chooses to subscribe to that package. As of 2016, cable companies are also now required to offer a [...] "skinny basic" [...] option, whereby a small selection of channels — typically the main over-the-air networks, along with [...] "public service" [...] channels such as The Weather Network and CPAC — are packaged for a maximum fee of $25 with additional channels available on a pick and pay basis at the subcriber's discretion. Although this package has had some popularity, the traditional larger and more expensive cable packages remain the dominant subscription mode.|$|E
