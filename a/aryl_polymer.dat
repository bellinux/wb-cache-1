In case of PFCH <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers,</b> Mn ranged from 9, 400 to 15, 600 [28]. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed excellent thermal stability of these polymers. The degradation temperature at 5  % weight loss (Td 5  %) varied from 432 to 483  °C and 383 to 444  °C for PFCP <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> and PFCH <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers,</b> respectively. Thermal analysis via {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) showed variable glass transition temperature (Tg) ranging from 432 to 483  °C and 90 to 132  °C for PFCP <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> and PFCH <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers,</b> respectively. Interestingly, both PFCA <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> synthesized from Bisphenol-AF also showed melting peaks in their respective DSC thermogram. This anomalous crystalline nature was attributed to a higher fluorine content, as found with −C(CF 3) 2 moiety of the bisphenol-AF group [33].|$|R

30|$|We have {{developed}} a step-growth polymerization of bisphenols with PFCA towards synthesis of {{a new class of}} PFCA <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> from commercial feedstock. PFCA aryl ether polymers can be easily modified and functionalized using bisphenols with different spacer functional groups. PFCA <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> exhibited very interesting thermal properties with variable Tg depending upon the chosen bisphenol. These polymers were obtained in good yields and show high thermal stabilities under nitrogen atmosphere. Successful conversion of the newly synthesized TAA enchained PFCP <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> via formylation and EAS demonstrated the synthetic versatility of TAA moiety and provides an excellent option for application specific post polymerization reactions.|$|R
30|$|PFCB <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> {{are first}} {{synthesized}} and investigated by The Dow Chemical Company {{in the early}} 1990 s as potential dielectric materials for integrated circuits applications [20]. PFCB <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> are prepared via [2  +  2] thermo-cyclodimerization reaction of TFVE monomers at reaction temperature of 150 – 200  °C (Scheme  1 a). The cycloaddition results in stereo-random PFCB rings in primarily 1, 2 fashion (i.e., head-to-head). These uniquely amorphous polymers demonstrate excellent solution processability, modular utility, comparable properties with the highly-market fluoropolymers and high performance {{in a variety of}} applications including electro-optics, fuel cell membranes, etc. [21, 25].|$|R

30|$|Post-polymerization {{functionalization}} [e.g. chromophorization- synthesizing an electro-optic (EO) chromophore on an inert polymer backbone] is {{an excellent}} tool to make a polymer system application specific. Here, we have post-functionalized PFCP <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymer</b> with enchained TAA moieties via formylation and electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) (Scheme  6). Successful conversion of the TAA enchained PFCP polymers via formylation and EAS demonstrated the synthetic versatility of TAA moiety. All these reported reactions resulted in high yields. The incorporated aldehyde (P 4) can be further modified into a range of application-specific molecules, including extension into an EO chromophore, hole-transport and photovoltaic materials [29, 34, 36, 37]. EAS reaction on these PFCP <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers</b> demonstrates the accessibility of these TAA moieties for further post polymerization modifications, which extends the overall versatility of this polymeric system.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic ion {{exchange}} resins came into use in the Soviet Union in the 1950 `s, and domestic an{{ion exchange}} resins based on quaternary amine groups have long {{been used in the}} Russian nuclear industry. These resins are similar to resins used in the West, and include pyridine-based resins, as well as the more conventional <b>aryl</b> <b>polymers</b> with substituted methyl amines. (Slide 1) The sensitivity of these amines to reaction with nitric acid and other oxidants has been a concern in Russia as in the West, and numerous laboratory studies have been conducted on the reactions involved. Several incidents involving pressure or temperature excursions have provided incentives for such studies. (Slide 2) This report briefly summarizes this work. A report by the Russian authors of this paper providing greater detail is to be issued as a U. S. Dept. of Energy document. Additionally, a second report by these authors, describing new studies on anion exchange resin safety, will also be issued as a DOE report. The separation of plutonium, neptunium, etc. from other materials by ion exchange requires rather strong nitric acid (6 - 8 M). In some systems, such as the processing of {sup 238 }Pu, intense ionizing radiation may also be present during ion exchange separation. As a result, it is necessary to consider not only thermal hydrolysis and oxidation and their effects on the resin, but also radiolysis. All of these were investigated in the Russian studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{durability}} of adhesively bonded aluminum using poly <b>aryl</b> phosphine-oxide polyimide <b>polymers</b> as adhesives has been investigated. The aluminum surface {{was prepared for}} bonding via reaction in acid and base solutions and by a neutralization process. The wedge geometry test was adopted for the durability studies. Crack propagation was followed for the bonded samples {{in order to determine}} the timeto- failure of the bond. The failure rate as a function of surface treatment varied in the manner: acid > base > neutral. The failure mode was determined by surface analytical spectroscopic methods including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy/energy despersive x-ray analysis (SEM/EDX), and the mode of failure was found to be independent of the surface treatment. The mode of failure for all samples was found to be primarily cohesive with some adhesive failure near the edges of the samples.

The different PANI forms were electrochemically synthesized using cyclic voltammetry. They were dedoped by stirring for 24 h in ammoniacal solutions. Leucoemeraldine and emeraldine pyrograms presented differences in the relative intensity of their fragment signals. Emeraldine pyrograms presented a higher relative intensity of the signals associated to oxidized fragments (i. e. quinone imine) than leucoemeraldine pyrograms. On the other hand, polymer samples synthesized under different anodic potentials showed small differences, consistent with a higher degree of crosslinking at higher anodic potentials.

This conclusion is modulated by the polymer dispersity which also plays an important role: a low dispersity value being synonymous of higher photostability. The reasons why the side chain structure and dispersity value drive the polymer photostability are discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Three {{different}} supercritical fluids (SCF), CO 2, {{dimethyl ether}} (DME), and propane, are investigated as potential solvents for processing two lactide-based ter-polymers and two perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) <b>aryl</b> ether <b>polymers.</b> The repeat {{unit of the}} lactide-based terpolymers consists of a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio of l-lactide, diglycidyl ether of bis-phenol A (DGEBA), and, in one case, 4, 4 -hexafluoroiso-propylidenediphenol (6 F-Bis-A) and, in the other case, 4, 4 -isopropylidenediphenol (6 H-Bis-A). The PFCB-based polymers are synthesized from 1, 1 -bis[4 -[(trifluoroviny-l) oxy]phenyl]hexafluoroisopropylidene (6 FVE) and from bis(trifluorovinyloxy) biphenyl (BPVE). For both classes of polymer the steric effect of the hexafluoroisopropylidene (6 F) group reduces chain–chain interactions, disrupts elec-tronic resonance between adjacent aromatic groups, and improves solubility. The two lactide-based terpolymers do not dissolve in CO 2 or propane, but dissolve in DME. At room temperature the poly(lactide 6 F-BisA DGEBA) ter-polymer dissolves at 700 bar lower pressure in DME com-pared to the poly(lactide 6 H-Bis-A DGEBA) terpolymer. Although the 6 FVE polymer dissolves in all three SCF sol-vents, pressures in excess of 800 bar are needed to dissolve this polymer in CO 2 and propane while 6 FVE dissolves in DME at pressure below 150 bar. The other PFCB-based polymer (BPVE) only dissolves in DME, again at low pres-sure, although BPVE drops out of solution as the system temperature is raised above 40 °C, whereas 6 FVE remains in solution in DME for temperatures up to 90 °C. © 2005 Wile...|$|R
