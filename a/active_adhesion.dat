While {{it is known that}} NEDD 9 is subject to extensive phosphorylation modification, the molecules that determine NEDD 9 phosphorylation to stimulate adhesion turnover and mesenchymal cell morphologies are currently unknown. Earlier studies have suggested that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP 2 A regulates interconversion between a low molecular mass NEDD 9 phosphoform and higher molecular mass phosphoforms. However, previous studies have used chemical inhibitors to block PP 2 A activity. In the present study we therefore aimed to specifically inhibit PP 2 A activity via siRNA and dominant negative approaches to investigate the effect of PP 2 A on interconversion between 115 kDa and 105 kDa NEDD 9 and determine the functional consequence of PP 2 A activity for NEDD 9 function. Strikingly, we find that while the phosphatase inhibitor Calyculin A indeed abrogates detachment-induced dephosphorylation of the 115 kDa NEDD 9 phosphoform, PP 2 A depletion does not inhibit 115 kDa to 105 kDa interconversion. Our data suggest instead that PP 2 A targets discrete NEDD 9 phosphorylation modifications separate to the events that mediate interconversion between the two forms. Functionally, PP 2 A depletion increases NEDD 9 mediated cell spreading and mutation of S 369 in the serine-rich region of NEDD 9 to aspartate mimics this effect. Importantly, mutation of S 369 to alanine abrogates the ability of dominant negative PP 2 A to increase NEDD 9 -mediated cell spreading. Collectively, our data reveal that the tumour suppressor PP 2 A may act via S 369 to regulated NEDD 9 -mediated cell spreading...|$|E

They inherit enormous technological potential to harness photosynthesis for the sustainable production of biofuels, proteins, and food components. In aqueous environments, microalgal surface colonization and biofouling cause severe implications on anthropogenic structures. Despite the fundamental interest in understanding microalgal adhesion, the biological mechanisms that trigger microalgal adhesion to surfaces and the surface forces that govern their adhesion remain unknown. In this work, the flagella-mediated adhesion to surfaces of soil-dwelling, green microalgae is studied quantitatively on a single-cell level. Micropipette-based force spectroscopy experiments are performed to quantify microalgal adhesion to model substrates in various experimental configurations and environmental conditions. In vivo force measurements show that the adhesion of microalgae to surfaces can be reversibly switched on and off within seconds by tailoring the light conditions. The light-switchable adhesion appears to be based on a relocalization of the adhesion-mediating protein. An <b>active</b> <b>adhesion</b> process, termed auto-adhesion, enables the alga to establish adhesive contact to surfaces once a small part of one flagellum adhered to the surface. Experiments with other species of the family Chlamydomonadaceae suggest that the light-switchable flagellar adhesiveness might be a generic trait of soil-dwelling microalgae. Force spectroscopy experiments on model substrates with tailored intermolecular interactions with the Chlamydomonas flagella demonstrate that Chlamydomonas inherits an universal adhesion mechanisms that allows the algae to adhere to virtually all types of substrates. In conjunction with light-directed motility, the ability to adhere to any surfaces that provide optimal light exposure might have evolved as an adaptation of photosynthetic organisms to heterogeneous light conditions in their natural habitats.

Herein, we identified leupaxin in a screen for focal adhesion kinase binding partners in aortic smooth muscle, and we show that leupaxin is enriched in human and mouse vascular smooth muscle and that leupaxin expression is dynamically regulated during development. In addition, our studies reveal that leupaxin can undergo cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling and functions as an serum response factor cofactor in the nucleus. We found that leupaxin forms a complex with serum response factor and associates with CArG-containing regions of smooth muscle promoters and that ectopic expression of leupaxin induces smooth muscle marker gene expression in both 10 T 1 / 2 cells and rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Subsequent studies indicated that enhanced focal adhesion kinase activity (induced by fibronectin or expression of constitutively <b>active</b> focal <b>adhesion</b> kinase) attenuates the nuclear accumulation of leupaxin and limits the ability of leupaxin to enhance serum response factor–dependent gene transcription.

Hybridization data analysis revealed background expression in untreated cells and the up-regulation of three sequences coding for VCAM- 1, as described by the SCOP (Structural Classification Of Proteins) database. The authors further studied its regulation, confirming and validating their mRNA increase by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The presence of the 100 -kDa VCAM- 1 protein in mock- and TMEV-infected cells was demonstrated in the cell membrane by a specific cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in addition to flow cytometry and confocal immunohistochemistry. Further, Western blots were used to quantify the amount of VCAM- 1 molecules in cell extracts. All these data demonstrated a mean 75 % increase in {{the expression of}} VCAM- 1 on the surface of TMEV-infected cells. Three inflammatory cytokines, interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and specially tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), some of which are also induced by TMEV in astrocytes (IL- 1 α and TNF-α), were potent inducers of VCAM- 1 expression. To demonstrate whether the VCAM- 1 molecules were biologically <b>active,</b> mediating <b>adhesion</b> to other cells as the integrin α 4 -expressing CD 4 T lymphocytes, the authors used a cell adhesion test. It was also demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that in vivo VCAM- 1 expression is enhanced after TMEV intracraneal infection. The present data show a small but statistically significant overexpression of VCAM- 1 after astrocyte infection with TMEV that could {{play a significant role in}} vivo. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

40|$|The C-terminal repeating {{sequences}} of Clostridium difficile toxin A (designated ARU) are homologous to the carbohydrate-binding domain of streptococcal glucosyltransferases (GTFs) that were recently identified as potent modulins. To test {{the hypothesis that}} ARU might exert a similar biological activity on endothelial cells, recombinant ARU (rARU), which was noncytotoxic to cell cultures, was analyzed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The rARU could bind directly to endothelial cells in a serum- and calcium-dependent manner and induce the production of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 in a dose-dependent manner. An oligosaccharide binding assay indicated that rARU, but not GTFC, binds preferentially to Lewis antigens and 3 ′HSO 3 -containing oligosaccharides. Binding of rARU to human endothelial or intestinal cells correlated directly with the expression of Lewis Y antigen. Bound rARU directly activated mitogen-activated protein kinases and the NF-κB signaling pathway in endothelial cells to release biologically <b>active</b> chemokines and <b>adhesion</b> molecules that promoted migration in a transwell assay and the adherence of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells to the endothelial cells. These results suggest that ARU may bind to multiple carbohydrate motifs to exert its biological activity on human endothelial cells...|$|R
40|$|As {{a central}} {{component}} of innate immunity, complement activation {{is a critical}} mechanism of containment and clearance of microbial pathogens {{in advance of the}} development of acquired immunity. Several pathogens restrict complement activation through the acquisition of host proteins that regulate complement activation or through the production of their own complement regulatory molecules (M. K. Liszewski, M. K. Leung, R. Hauhart, R. M. Buller, P. Bertram, X. Wang, A. M. Rosengard, G. J. Kotwal, and J. P. Atkinson, J. Immunol. 176 : 3725 - 3734, 2006; J. Lubinski, L. Wang, D. Mastellos, A. Sahu, J. D. Lambris, and H. M. Friedman, J. Exp. Med. 190 : 1637 - 1646, 1999). The infectious stage of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi produces a surface-anchored complement regulatory protein (CRP) that functions to inhibit alternative and classical pathway complement activation (K. A. Norris, B. Bradt, N. R. Cooper, and M. So, J. Immunol. 147 : 2240 - 2247, 1991). This study addresses the genomic complexity of the T. cruzi CRP and its relationship to the T. cruzi supergene family comprising active trans-sialidase (TS) and TS-like proteins. The TS superfamily consists of several functionally distinct subfamilies that share a characteristic sialidase domain at their amino termini. These TS families include <b>active</b> TS, <b>adhesions,</b> CRPs, and proteins of unknown functions (G. A. Cross and G. B. Takle, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 47 : 385 - 411, 1993). A sequence comparison search of GenBank using BLASTP revealed several full-length paralogs of CRP. These proteins share significant homology at their amino termini and a strong spatial conservation of cysteine residues. Alternative pathway complement regulation was confirmed for CRP paralogs with 58 % (low) and 83 % (high) identity to AAB 49414. CRPs are functionally similar to the microbial and mammalian proteins that regulate complement activation. Sequence alignment of mammalian complement control proteins to CRP showed that these sequences are distinct, supporting a convergent evolutionary pathway. Finally, we show that a clonal line of T. cruzi expresses multiple unique copies of CRP that are differentially recognized by patient sera...|$|R
40|$|Laminin- 1, a heterotrimer of α 1, β 1, and γ 1 chains {{specific}} to basement membrane, promotes cell adhesion and migration, proteinase secretion and metastases of tumour cells. Several active {{sites on the}} α 1 chain {{have been found to}} promote B 16 –F 10 melanoma lung colonisation and here we have determined whether additional tumour promoting sites exist on the β 1 and γ 1 chains. Recently, we have identified novel cell adhesive peptides derived from laminin β 1 and γ 1 chains by systematic screening of synthetic peptides. Nine β 1 peptides and seven γ 1 peptides <b>active</b> for cell <b>adhesion</b> were tested for their effects on experimental pulmonary metastases of B 16 –F 10 mouse melanoma cells in vivo. The most active adhesive peptide derived from the γ 1 chain globular domain, C- 16 (KAFDITYVRLKF), significantly enhanced pulmonary metastases of B 16 –F 10 cells, whereas no other peptides showed enhancement. C- 16 also stimulated migration of B 16 –F 10 cells in the Boyden chamber assay in vitro. Furthermore, C- 16 significantly induced the production of MMP- 9 from B 16 –F 10 cells. These results suggest that this specific laminin γ 1 chain peptide has a metastasis-promoting activity and might be a new molecular target of anti-cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRe-entry {{into the}} cell cycle from {{quiescence}} requires the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) family [1, 2]. The relationship between ERK and cell-cycle control is, however, complex, as ERK activation {{can also lead to}} terminal differentiation [3] or a senescence-like growth arrest [4]. Here, we report that reversible cell-cycle exit induced by serum withdrawal in primary avian fibroblasts is associated with rapid deactivation of ERK, but ERK activity is subsequently regenerated and sustained at high levels in fully quiescent (G 0) cells. As in proliferating cells, ERK activation during G 0 required the MAPkinase kinase MEK and was partially dependent on cell <b>adhesion.</b> <b>Active,</b> phosphorylated ERK was concentrated in the nucleus in cycling cells, but was largely confined to the cytoplasm during G 0. This was unexpected, as activatory phosphorylation mediated by MEK is thought {{to play an important role}} in promoting nuclear translocation [5, 6]. These results indicate that transient deactivation of ERK signalling can be sufficient for stable cell-cycle exit, and that MEK-mediated phosphorylation is not sufficient for nuclear translocation of active ERK in G 0. Cytoplasmic sequestration may prevent active ERK from accessing critical nuclear cell-cycle targets, thus allowing quiescent or post-mitotic cells to retain ERK activity for other physiological functions...|$|R
