5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms <b>as</b> <b>donors</b> are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a {{link between}} letter names and {{donations}} has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, Katrina, Rita and Mitch). They {{found that people who}} shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented <b>as</b> <b>donors.</b> They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.|$|E

With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion became more substantial in the United States. Transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.|$|E

25|$|While {{presidential campaigns}} have {{traditionally}} obtained finance by tapping wealthy, established political donors, Dean's funds came largely in small donations over the Internet; the average overall donation was just under $80. This method of fundraising offered several important advantages over traditional fundraising, {{in addition to}} the inherent media interest in what was then a novelty. First, raising money on the Internet was relatively inexpensive, compared to conventional methods such as events, telemarketing, and direct mail campaigns. Secondly, <b>as</b> <b>donors</b> on average contributed far less than the legal limit ($2,000 per person), the campaign could continue to resolicit them throughout the election season.|$|E
25|$|These {{services}} {{facilitate the}} transaction and redistribution of unwanted, yet perfectly usable, {{materials and equipment}} from one entity to another. The entities that benefit from either side of this service (<b>as</b> <b>donors,</b> sellers, recipients, or buyers) can be businesses, nonprofits, schools, community groups, and individuals. Some maintain a physical space (a reuse center), and others act as a matching service (a virtual exchange). Reuse centers generally maintain both warehouses and trucks. They take possession of the donated materials and make them available for redistribution or sale. Virtual exchanges do not have physical space or trucks, but instead allow users to post listings of materials available and wanted (for free or at low cost) on an online materials exchange website. Staff will help facilitate the exchange of these materials without ever taking possession of the materials.|$|E

2500|$|Food {{distribution}} {{plays an}} important role in a colony. This behaviour varies in colonies, with small workers receiving more food than larger workers if a small colony is seriously deprived of food. In larger colonies, however, the larger workers receive more food. Workers can donate sugar water efficiently to other nestmates, with some acting <b>as</b> <b>donors.</b> These [...] "donors" [...] distribute their food sources to recipients, which may also act <b>as</b> <b>donors.</b> Workers may also share a greater portion of their food with other nestmates. In colonies that are not going through starvation, food is still distributed among the workers and larvae. One study shows that honey and soybean oil were fed to the larvae after 12 to 24 hours of being retained by the workers. The ratio distribution of these food sources was 40% towards the larvae and 60% towards the worker for honey, and for soybean oil this figure was around 30 and 70%, respectively. Red imported fire ants also stockpile specific food sources such as insect pieces rather than consuming them immediately. These pieces are usually transported below the mound surface and in the driest and warmest locations.|$|E

2500|$|Large {{coordination}} {{numbers are}} the rule: thorium nitrate pentahydrate {{was the first}} known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the [...] anion in the calcium and magnesium salts is 12-coordinate. Due to the large size of the Th4+ cation, thorium salts have a weaker tendency to hydrolyse than that of many multiply charged ions such as Fe3+, but hydrolysis happens more readily at pH above 4, forming various polymers of unknown nature, culminating {{in the formation of}} the gelatinous hydroxide: this behaviour is similar to that of protactinium, which also hydrolyses readily in water to form colloidal precipitates. The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents. As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms <b>as</b> <b>donors</b> are less stable.|$|E

2500|$|Opt-out consent, {{otherwise}} known as [...] "deemed" [...] consent, support refers {{to the notion that}} the majority of people support organ donation, but {{only a small percentage of}} the population are actually registered, because they fail to go through the actual step of registration, even if they want to donate their organs at the time of death. This could be resolved with an opt-out system, where many more people would be registered <b>as</b> <b>donors</b> when only those who object consent to donation have to register to be on the non-donation list. For this reasons, countries, such as Wales, have adopted a [...] "soft opt-out" [...] consent, meaning if a citizen has not clearly made a decision to register, then they will be treated as a registered citizen and participate in the organ donation process. Likewise, opt-in consent refers to the consent process of only those who are registered to participate in organ donation. Currently, the United States has an opt-in system, but studies show that countries with an opt-out system save more lives due to more availability of donated organs. The current opt-in consent policy assumes that individuals are not willing to become organ donors at the time of their death, unless they have documented otherwise through organ donation registration. Registering to become an organ donor heavily depends on the attitude of the individual; those with a positive outlook might feel a sense of altruism towards organ donation, while others may have a more negative perspective, such as not trusting doctors to work as hard to save the lives of registered organ donors. Some common concerns regarding a presumed consent ("opt-out") system are sociologic fears of a new system, moral objection, sentimentality, and worries of the management of the objection registry for those who do decide to opt-out of donation. Additional concerns exist with views of compromising the freedom of choice to donate [...] and conflicts with religious beliefs which exist. Even though concerns exist, the United States still has a 95 percent organ donation approval rate. This level of nationwide acceptance may foster an environment where moving to a policy of presumed consent may help solve some of the organ shortage problem, where individuals are assumed to be willing organ donors unless they document a desire to [...] "opt-out", which must be respected.|$|E

Thus, hydrophilic anthocyanin molecules can be formed and stabilized by glycosylation and acylation. Two types of glycosyltransferase (GT) and acyltransferase (AT) have been identified, namely cytoplasmic GT and AT and vacuolar GT and AT. Cytoplasmic GT and AT utilize UDP-sugar and acyl-CoA <b>as</b> <b>donor</b> molecules, respectively, whereas both vacuolar GT and AT use acyl-glucoses <b>as</b> <b>donor</b> molecules.
