Previous {{studies have shown that}} the actin cytoskeletal protein flightless I (Flii) impairs wound healing associated with EB. Using a mouse model of EB acquisita (EBA), the effect of ‘‘mopping up’’ Flii using Flii-neutralizing antibodies (FnAbs) before, during, and after blister formation was determined. FnAbs, incorporated into a cream vehicle and applied topically to the skin, penetrated into the basal epidermis and upper papillary dermis but were not detected in serum or other organs and did not alter neutrophil or macrophage infiltration into the blistered skin. Histological assessment of blister severity showed that treatment of early-stage blisters with FnAb cream reduced their severity and improved their rate of healing. Treatment of established blisters with FnAb cream also improved healing and restored the skin’s tensile strength toward that of normal skin. Repeated application of FnAbs to EBA skin before the onset of blistering reduced the severity of skin blistering. Independent of when the FnAbs were <b>applied,</b> <b>skin</b> barrier function and wound healing were improved and skin fragility was reduced, suggesting that FnAbs could potentially improve healing of patients with EB.

40|$|Introduction. Femoral neck {{fractures}} {{in children and}} adolescents are rare. However, their complications are frequent - avascular necrosis, femoral neck pseudoarthrosis, premature physeal closure with consequent growth disturbance and coxa vara deformity. Case Outline. A 9. 5 ­year­old boy was injured in a car accident, and femoral neck fracture was diagnosed. Prior to admission at our hospital he was surgically treated several times. He was admitted at our hospital eight months following the accident. On the X­ray transcervical pseudoarthrosis of the femoral neck was found, as well as coxa vara deformity and metaphyseal avascular necrosis. He was operated at our hospital; all previously placed ostefixation material was removed, valgus osteotomy of 30 degrees was done as well as additional local osteoplasty using the commercial osteoindactive agent (Osteovit®). Postoperatively, we <b>applied</b> <b>skin</b> traction, bed rest and physical therapy. At the final follow­up, the patient was recovered completely. He is now painless, the legs are of equal length, range of movements in the left hip is full, life activity is normal. The X­ray shows that the femoral neck pseudoarthrosis is fully healed. Conclusion. This case is presented in order to encourage other colleagues to challenge the problematic situation such as this one. Also, we would like to remind them what one should think about and what should be taken into consideration in the primary treatment of femoral neck {{fractures in}} children. Valgus femoral osteotomy, {{as a part of the}} primary treatment of femoral neck fracture in children (identically as in the adults) can prevent the occurrence of femoral neck pseudoarthrosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Oxygen-dependent {{quenching}} of luminescence using transparent planar sensor foils {{was shown}} to overcome {{the limitations of the}} polarographic electrode technique in an animal model. This method was then transferred to a clinical setting to measure the transcutaneous pO 2 (ptcO 2). Methods: In six healthy subjects, a cuff on the upper arm was occluded up to 20 mmHg above systolic pressure and released after 8 min. PtcO 2 was measured at the lower arm every 30 s before, during, and up to 20 min after cuff occlusion (40 °C <b>applied</b> <b>skin</b> temperature) using luminescence lifetime imaging (LLI) of platinum(II) -octaethyl-porphyrin immobilized in a polystyrene matrix. For validation, the polarographic Clark electrode technique was applied in close proximity, and measurements were conducted simultaneously. Results: PtcO 2 measurements before (70. 8 ± 19. 1 vs. 66. 2 ± 7. 7 mmHg) {{and at the end of}} ischemic (2. 7 ± 1. 2 vs. 3. 6 ± 1. 7 mmHg) and reperfusion phases (72. 2 ± 3. 6 vs. 68. 4 ± 8. 9 mmHg) did not differ significantly using the Clark electrode vs. LLI. At both the initial ischemic and the reperfusion phases, the Clark electrode measured a faster decrease or increase, respectively, in ptcO 2 because of the oxygen consumption occurring in this method. Conclusion: The presented method provides accurate and reproducible ptcO 2 values under changing microcirculatory conditions. The lack of oxygen consumption during measurement allows both a more realistic estimation of ptcO 2 than compared with the gold standard and permanent use in regions with critical oxygen supply...|$|E

Gunshot injuries represent a special challenge for surgeon because of specific anatomical relations and biomechanical function {{of the foot}}. We have decided to present a patient with a complex foot injury caused by hunting firearm in self-inflicted accident. A 45 -year-old male presented with 12 -gauge shotgun wound to his left foot. We found a complicated fracture with bone defect of 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th metatarsals and wide soft tissue injury with skin and subcutaneous defect of the dorsal and lateral side of the foot. The wound was contaminated with numerous metal fragments, particles of rocks and ground. Surgical treatment was performed three hours after trauma and included extensive debridement of damaged soft tissue, removing of the non-viable bone and metal fragments, rocks and other foreign bodies. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) was applicated in the operating table. The starting therapy was continuously – 125 mm Hg of vacuum.

40|$|Transcutaneous drug {{delivery}} from planar skin patches is effective for small-molecule drugs and skin-permeable vaccine adjuvants. However, to achieve efficient delivery of vaccines and other macromolecular therapeutics into the skin, {{penetration of the}} stratum corneum is needed. Topically <b>applied</b> <b>skin</b> patches with micron-scale projections ('microneedles') pierce the upper layers of the skin and enable vaccines that are coated on or encapsulated within the microneedles to be dispersed into the skin. Although millimeter-scale syringes have shown promise for vaccine delivery in humans and technologies, such as the Dermaroller (Dermaroller, Wolfenbüttel, Germany), exist for creating microscale punctures in the skin for delivery of solutions of therapeutics, solid microprojection microneedles coated with dry vaccine formulations offer a number of valuable features for vaccination, including reduced risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission or needle-stick injury, the potential for vaccine administration by minimally trained personnel or even self administration {{and the use of}} solid-state vaccine formulations that may reduce or eliminate cold-chain requirements in vaccine distribution. Recent studies in mice have demonstrated the ability of microneedles to effectively deliver vaccines to the skin, eliciting protective immunity to influenza, hepatitis C and West Nile virus.

40|$|Neurophysiological {{evidence}} that afferent information from skin receptors {{is important for}} proprioception has been gathered mainly in experiments relating to the human hand and finger joints. To investigate if proprioceptive information is also provided by skin mechanoreceptor afferents from skin areas related to large joints of postural importance, microneurography recordings were obtained in humans from skin afferents in the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve to study their responses to knee joint movements. Data were collected from 60 sequentially recorded afferents from slowly (n= 23) and fast (n= 6) adapting low-threshold mechanoreceptors, hair follicle receptors (n= 24), field receptors (n= 1) and C mechanoreceptors (n= 6). Fascicular recordings showed that the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve supplies extensive areas of the thigh: from 5 – 10 cm below the inguinal ligament down to below and lateral to the knee joint; accordingly, the afferents originated in receptors located in wide areas of the human thigh. All afferents from fast and slowly adapting low-threshold mechanoreceptors, as well as C mechanoreceptors, responded to manually <b>applied</b> <b>skin</b> stretch. In contrast, the same stimulus elicited, at most, feeble responses in hair follicle receptors. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the responses of a subset of afferents revealed that in particular slowly adapting afferents effectively encode both static and dynamic aspects of passively imposed knee joint movements. It was concluded that receptors in the hairy skin of humans can provide high-fidelity information about knee joint movements. A previously undefined type of slowly adapting receptor (SA III) seemed particularly suited for this task whereas this {{does not seem to}} be the case for either hair follicle receptors or C mechanoreceptors...|$|E

In addition, the demonstration of their in vivo effects might be a step forwards to widen their uses in chicken chigger disease. Materials and methods: plant materials were collected from Vietnam. Extracted essential oils were diluted in ethanol 40 % at concentrations of 1 %, 2 %, 3 % and 4 % to test with chiggers infested on pastured chicken in Vietnam. Treatment efficacy was evaluated after 5 d of oil application. Our study tested with pastured chicken because the infection of chiggers on this type of domestic chicken is significantly high in Vietnam. Result and discussion: All of essential oils from medicine plants showed effects on chicken chiggers at different levels. Garlic oil showed the best effect, because the application of this essential oil at concentration of 1 % had exterminated chigger infection, while oils of other plants at this concentration still showed no effect. However, at the concentration of 3 %, garlic oil exerted the side-effect as the <b>applied</b> <b>skin</b> areas became congested. The application of essential oils from other medicinal plants, such as lemon grass, fortune bogorchid and cinnamon, could not eliminate the chigger infection on chicken.

Conclusion: The present study demonstrated the anti-parasitic effects of garlic, lemon grass, fortune bogorchid and cinnamon on chicken chiggers, and therefore gives pharmacological basis for their therapeutic uses for the treatment of external parasites in traditional medicine. Among our tested materials, garlic showed the best effect and serve as the most promissory candidate to treat this disease...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) 1 light (280 - 340 nm) {{irradiation}} of mice {{results in}} immunologic alterations that {{are dependent on}} the dose and time course of the radiation. Acute UV irradiation regimens (less than- 14 daily exposures) are associated with tolerance to topically <b>applied</b> <b>skin</b> contact sensitizers (1 - 8). If the acute UV regimen is performed with low-dose radiation (~ 0. 01 - 0. 35 J/cm 2 per exposure), the tolerance is "site specific " {{in that it is}} manifest only if the antigen is introduced through UV-irradiated skin (1, 2, 5). However, if high,dose UV radiation is employed (greater than- 0. 5 J/cm 2 per exposure), systemic tolerance results (4, 5, 7), and the specific contact sensitizing antigen can be applied to unirradiated skin sites and no delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction is elicited upon subsequent challenge. If UV exposures are administered chronically (4 - 8 wk), the capacity to manifest DTH through UV-irradiated skin reappears (3). Our interest in immunological aberrations associated with UV irradiation stems from our studies in UV-induced susceptibility to skin tumors. It is reasonable that the immunological dysfunctions associated with acute UV irradiation, measured in terms of DTH unresponsiveness (1 - 8), diminished antigen presentation capacity (9 - 15), altered cell distributions (15), and elevated acute phase reactants (16), might {{play a role in the}} subsequent development of the tumorsusceptible state. The data to be presented in this report address another facet of early immunologic changes associated with acute low-dose UV irradiation. We have investigated the role of UV exposure in the induction of humoral tolerance to soluble protein antigens. Our results suggest that UV irradiation can inhibit antibody responses initiated by skin-priming with antigen (17). We have termed this phenomenon "phototolerance " (PT). Our rationale for selecting soluble protein antigens was the possible clinical relevance of such protocols where tolerance to a variety of soluble antigens might be inducd. Example...|$|E
