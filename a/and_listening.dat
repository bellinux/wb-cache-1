5|$|Although he was {{a proponent}} of secular politics, Nasser was an observant Muslim who made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1954 and 1965. He {{was known to be}} {{personally}} incorruptible, a characteristic which further enhanced his reputation among the citizens of Egypt and the Arab world. Nasser's personal hobbies included playing chess, American films, reading Arabic, English, and French magazines, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> to classical music.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{studies the}} English imperatives look <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> used as {{discourse}} markers. The study focuses on two aspects: firstly, {{to identify the}} factors indicating the primary function {{as opposed to the}} discourse function of look <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> in English, <b>and</b> secondly, to analyse the Czech counterparts of these verbs used as discourse markers. The paper is comprised of two main parts. The first, theoretical background, describes the grammatical form of the English imperative with focus on look <b>and</b> <b>listen,</b> the concept of discourse markers, the cross-linguistic studies focusing specifically on look <b>and</b> <b>listen,</b> the correspondence between English and Czech imperative, and the potential Czech counterparts. The second, empirical part analyses two hundred and three examples of the imperatives look <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> their Czech counterparts from the parallel translation corpus InterCorp. Key words: imperative, look, listen, discourse markers, primary function, Czech counterpar...|$|R

5|$|In August 1996, Radiohead toured as {{the opening}} act for Alanis Morissette. They resumed {{recording}} {{not at a}} studio but at St. Catherine's Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath. The sessions were relaxed, with the band playing {{at all hours of}} the day, recording in different rooms, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> to the Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration.|$|E

The painting was used by a variety of music related companies including The Gramophone Company, EMI, and RCA. Today it remains in use incorporated into the logo for HMV in UK and Europe.|$|E
5|$|St. Elmo Sylvester Hope (June 27, 1923 – May 19, 1967) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger, chiefly in the bebop {{and hard}} bop genres.

5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E

5|$|Cross Days is {{a visual}} novel. These are {{essentially}} played by watching <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> to episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, clickable actions or responses {{when they are}} presented to the player. These choices are intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing {{the direction of the}} story as each is made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. Unique to the game are yaoi routes, in which the protagonist crossdresses as a maid and engages in homosexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Inside, the Hatfield Library {{contains}} a 24-hour study area, private study rooms, a classroom, the university's archives, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> rooms. On {{the main floor}} is the circulation desk, reference section, and work stations, among others. The building also holds a formal reception area, the Mark O. Hatfield Room, and the Hatfield archives that contain the former Senator's papers, both located on the second floor. Interior space was left mainly open to allow for flexibility with the evolving needs and technology of the library. Artist Dean Larson painted the portrait of Hatfield that hangs in the library.|$|E
5|$|Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was {{the main}} focus of the Insomniac Team during development. The team of around 115 people were aiming to create a new Ratchet and Clank game that would differ {{significantly}} from its predecessors and almost end up being two games in one. Insomniac believed that one of the key processes in the development process was the rigorous testing. Working closely with Sony <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> to fans of the Ratchet and Clank series, they gathered feedback and made improvements to the game. They felt that they had created a game that would appeal to a number of genres with the inclusion of elements of platform, action and side-scrolling gameplay.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E
5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that he began to feel his potential as a composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> {{to a wide variety of}} musical genres.|$|E

5|$|Promoting the album, a major online {{campaign}} was launched, his blog site, SeeFurtherThanIAm.com, on which Songz streams live chats and behind-the-scenes videos. He also released a track on his Twitter every Monday, {{some of which}} was from his mixtape Anticipation, which preceded the album's release. Songz embarked on a promo tour on July 25, 2009, with stops in Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Dallas and the Carolinas, where he attended radio events <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> sessions. He also toured the House of Blues in September, {{as well as a}} college tour that fall. In addition to co-headlining the 106 & Live! tour with Mario, also featuring Day26 and Sean Garrett, which toured from September 29, 2009 to October 31, 2009, Songz served as a supporting act in 2010 for Jay-Z's The Blueprint 3 Tour, along with Young Jeezy.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
