40|$|Given a textual query in {{traditional}} text-based image retrieval (TBIR), relevant images {{are to be}} reranked using visual features after the initial text-based search. In this paper, we propose a new bag-based reranking framework for large-scale TBIR. Specifically, we first cluster relevant images using both textual and visual features. By treating each cluster as a “bag ” and the images in the bag as “instances, ” we formulate this problem as a multi-instance (MI) learning problem. MI learning methods such as mi-SVM can be readily incorporated into our bag-based reranking framework. Observing that at least a certain portion of a positive bag is of positive instances while a negative bag might also contain positive instances, we further use a more suitable generalized MI (GMI) setting for this application. To address the ambiguities on the instance labels in {{the positive and negative}} bags under this GMI setting, we develop a new method referred to as GMI-SVM to enhance retrieval performance by propagating the labels from the bag level to the instance level. To acquire bag annotations for (G) MI learning, we propose a bag ranking method to rank all the bags according to the defined bag ranking score. The top ranked bags are used as pseudopositive training bags, while pseudonegative training bags can be obtained by randomly sampling a few irrelevant images that are not associated with the textual query. Comprehensive experiments on the challenging real-world data set NUS-WIDE demonstrate our framework with <b>automatic</b> <b>bag</b> annotation can achieve the best performances compared with existing image reranking methods. Our experiments also demonstrate that GMI-SVM can achieve better performances when using the manually labeled training bags obtained from relevance feedback...|$|E

40|$|We {{submitted}} {{three runs}} of the Instance Search task. They {{are listed as}} follows: • UCSB UCR VCG 1 : This <b>automatic</b> run uses <b>Bag</b> of visual word with MSER+SIFT and Dense sift using svm classifier on chi-sq kernel. • UCSB UCR VCG 2 : This <b>automatic</b> run uses <b>Bag</b> of visual word with MSER+SIFT and dense Color-sift based based SVM classifier on chi-sq kernel • UCSB UCR VCG 3 : This <b>automatic</b> run uses <b>Bag</b> of visual word with MSER+SIFT and based svm classifier on histogram intersection kernel. Discriminative reranking using a SVM classifier signifi-cantly improved the results. Compared to Histogram Intersec-tion, Chi-square distance metric performed well {{on some of the}} queries. Bag of visual word model was effective in retrieving loca-tion based topics. However, with discriminative reranking(an offline query expansion) approach significantly improved the results. The discriminative classifiers learned from the internet images did not scale well on the test dataset. This poses a question on how to transfer model from one domain to another domain...|$|R

50|$|On 25 September 2007, eight Guineans Naval {{officers}} were {{arrested by the}} Sierra Leone Navy for an act of piracy against locally licensed fishermen inside Sierra Leonean waters. British-trained Sierra Leone naval officers interrupted the high-seas hold-up by armed men in two launches on Sunday, 18 nmi km off the capital Freetown inside the country's 200-mile (320-km) economic exclusion zone. One of the attacking speedboats escaped north towards Guinea, while the other was seized. The eight men arrested were found with AK-47 <b>automatic</b> rifles and <b>bags</b> of fish, including high-value snapper, taken off the Sierra Leone-licensed vessels.|$|R
40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) relates to {{cardiovascular}} diseases. This study evaluated oxygenation and the ventilatory responses to hypercapnea in OSA in whom cardiac output is elevated. Sleep studies were conducted using CASE system. From an arterial line, {{blood pressure was}} monitored directly by blood pressure transducer and blood samples were drawn from the same arterial line for arterial blood gases (ABG) analysis. Cardiac output was calculated by the indirect Ficks` method. Gas exchange measures were determined using <b>automatic</b> Douglas <b>Bag</b> System in which expired gases were analyzed online using mass spectrometer (Perkin Elmer- 1100). Ventilation was recorded continuously by mass flow meter (TSI). Results of sleep studies indicated that the average obstructive apnea index was 74 %. During wake state, the average cardiac output was 9. 86 LPM, alveolo-arterial PO 2 differences (A-a PO 2) was 18. 82 Torr and normalized VE was 3 X for each level of CO 2. At maximum respiratory response PaCO 2 was elevated reflecting increased capacity for CO 2 stores leading to increased CO 2 load on the lungs. Present data indicated that significant obstructive sleep apnea occurs in adult in whom cardiac output, heart rate and blood pressure were elevated during day time. Based {{on the results of}} the present study it can be concluded that OSA is considered a risk factor for heart diseases...|$|R
40|$|It is {{concerned}} that current designs in airport terminals need to be adaptable {{in terms of time}} and cost increasing their capacity to be able to meet demand. The terminal functionality is limited for some issues in the system’s performance as queues or delays, affecting the quality perceived by the passengers about the provided service. According to current research, the check-in area is considered the bottleneck in the facilities of the terminal. Consequently, the system needs to be reconfigured to improve its operation. Passengers can chose the traditional manual check-in at the counter or self-service <b>automatic</b> kiosk and <b>bag</b> drop. In this project, real-time information system will be provided using passenger throughput information to create flow path simulation for the domestic terminal in the Brisbane Airport. By building the simulation model, the system’s structure will be explored and the behaviour tested under a variety of conditions to play and compare scenarios to optimize the procedure. Ultimately, renovations will be made to the facility with the aim to minimize average dwell time and improve overall customer satisfaction. The ability to react quickly to the increasing passenger fluctuations with rapid and inexpensive changes in the check-in configuration would be the major contribution of the thesis. The strategy presented as a solution for a real world problem supports the adaptation of check-in facilities to the different dynamic environments in other airports...|$|R

40|$|Sentence Selection {{consists}} of identifying the sentences {{relevant to a}} particular topic, task, user or linguistic structure. This is a prerequisite step in many document-processing tasks, such as Information Extraction and Text Summarization. Researchers in these areas have typically borrowed ideas and tools from the Automatic Text Categorization (ATC) domain and applied them to their Sentence Selection problems. This {{is the case with}} the standard Bag of Words text representation and the machine learning algorithms used. Even though Sentence Selection and ATC are related, not all their characteristics are the same. Because of their differences, some variations to the standard representations and techniques usually used for ATC might be beneficial for Sentence Selection. Consequently, the main contribution of this thesis is the exploration of the benefits of a syntactically and semantically enriched text representation for the Sentence Selection task on technical domains. We further take advantage of the syntactic and semantic relations between words by moving from the propositional learners to a relational model. In particular, we experiment on three documents datasets, two in the Genetics domain and one in the Legal domain. In the first two domains we incorporate semantic knowledge by means of hierarchical dictionaries, while in the third one we use Named Entity Recognition for the same purpose. The syntactic knowledge is obtained from <b>automatic</b> parsing. <b>Bags</b> of words, enriched with the syntactic and semantic features, are given as input to different classifiers induction algorithms. Sentences to be selected constitute the positive class, while the remaining sentences of a document constitute the negative class. We present results with {{the state of the art}} algorithms Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, as well as the relational learner Aleph. We evaluate the learning performance by comparing on several runs of N-fold cross-validation and time based training/testing splits, and we study the implications of the classification threshold when appropriate. We show the gains of enriching the representation in a syntactic or semantic way, we analyze the cases in which each one is more beneficial, and we explain the particular contributions of each of them...|$|R
