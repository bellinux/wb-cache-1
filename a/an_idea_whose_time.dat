The digitally cross-linked world postulates all-encompassing, ubiquitous, and unobtrusive future services. In the concomitant, increasingly competitive market, retailers are starting to lay the foundation for omnichannel, meeting the expectations of a digitally cunning audience wanting their shopping experience to be as seamless and uncomplicated as possible. Nevertheless, recent researches show that there are still enough avenues for further research on omnichannel. Until now, the performance of companies was solely considered by experts from a suppliers’ point of view. It would be rather interesting to find out whether the desire to meet the increased cus-tomer expectations is also recognized by the customers themselves. This paper seeks to answering how the purchasing behavior has changed and what customers demand. In addition, it elaborates the opportunities that are promoted by omni-channel. Searching out all the effects, the paper will get to a final step, where it can be attested how the omnichannel performance of fashion and lifestyle retailers can be measured from a consumers’ perspective by developing an exclusive index. The study is confined to four fashion and lifestyle retailers: Hugo Boss AG, Levi Strauss & Co, Pull and Bear as well as COS. Using the scientific method of mystery shopping and a multi-item checklist including 54 key performance indicators, the paper aims to examine to which extend the four selected retailers provide a seamless customer journey, according to the five decision-making phases. ...|$|R

40|$|Whether trees {{will grow}} {{successfully}} on the Great Plains {{has been a}} perplexing question {{since the early days}} of settlement, and forestry and tree-planting attempts were numerous before President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed what in 1934 became the Prairie States Forestry Project, or more commonly the Shelterbelt Project. What was unique about the Roosevelt plan was its size, both in number of trees and in area involved. The project ultimately covered a zone about 100 miles wide by 1, 150 miles long and stretched from North Dakota to Texas. Trees, Prairies, and People is a history of this New Deal program. Wilmon H. Droze has two background chapters in which he traces tree-planting hopes, successes, and failures in the prairie and plains states prior to the 1930 s. Building from these chapters, he concentrates on the genesis of the Shelter belt Project and on the political, economic, and scientific problems encountered. Although tree planting on the plains was a constant concern to people in the region, the national government had only occasionally demonstrated enthusiasm, most particularly in the period from 1890 to 1905. As a result, by the 1930 s little systematic knowledge was available about the shelterbelt zone, a zone that was at best a high-risk region for the growth of trees. The effort of scientists to provide this necessary information constitutes a major part of the study. The author thoroughly covers such topics as soil classification, seed collection and processing, techniques of planting, and rodent and disease control. Although Droze discusses the concerns and roles of politicians, farmers, nurserymen, and taxpayers, the primary perspective represented in the study is that of the Forest Service. Detail is provided on the interest, capabilities, and limitations of scientific forestry to cope adequately with the Shelterbelt Project. Of particular interest is the account of the dispute among professional foresters both within and outside the Forest Service over the feasibility of the project. To opponents, the project was a highrisk program in which failure would damage an already precarious professional status. The study is an excellent account of the problems of applied science, particularly when the national government is involved. Members of the Forest Service started the Shelterbelt Project with ambitions of applying the best of their scientific knowledge to an area greatly in need of their services, and they foresaw a project that would bring all conservation agencies together in a unified effort to restore vitality to the dusty and dreary Great Plains. Starting from the premise of governmentowned land covered with numerous, broad shelterbelts, the author skillfully describes how the end result fell far short of these lofty ideals. Although the Shelterbelt Project never obtained congressional support or funds, it operated on the basis of executive order and was financed largely by WP A funds. The government did not own the land and therefore had little control over the belts once planted. As a result, the foresters applied their scientific knowledge in establishing the planting zone, based primarily on rainfall and soil type, but here scientific ideals encountered political and economic realities. Thus, Droze ably illustrates the immensity of the technical and practical problems encountered in the Shelterbelt Project. The difficulties involved much more than the decision to plant trees, itself a major issue. Despite the numerous problems and shortcomings, Droze concludes that the Shelterbelt Project was a success, and for his conclusion he relies largely on the criterion used by the Forest Service, that is, the survival rate of the trees planted. More than a history of shelterbelts, this study is also a call for new efforts to bring trees to the Great Plains. With the end of the Shelterbelt Project and the shifting of government tree planting on the plains to the Soil Conservation Service, shelterbelts for the protection of fields gave way largely to smaller farmstead belts, and there was a major decrease in the number of trees planted. Droze ends with the appeal that the shelterbelt plan 2 ̆ 2 is <b>a</b> successful <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> has come again 2 ̆ 2 (p. 248). Overall, this is a good study of an important subject. There is some repetition but in general the book is presented in a ckar and incisive style.

40|$|LL. D. This study aims to {{investigate}} the {{different ways in which}} the position of people with disabilities can be addressed. Antidiscrimination legislation can play a very important role. Efforts to create equal opportunities must, however, not be limited to legislative initiatives and policy declarations. There is an urgent need for education and training of this minority group. 7 Systematic efforts to heighten public awareness of civil rights and in particular the recognition of the rights of the disabled community are imperative. This study aims to bring home the truth that "disability rights are <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> and ideal <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> has come.,, When addressing the issue of disability discrimination (or for that matter any kind of discrimination) several principles need to be addressed, the most important being the following: The meaning of the concept of "equality" needs to be established. The fact that all people are equal, {{does not necessarily mean that}} all people must be treated the same. When speaking about disability discrimination one must know who forms part of the protected class. For that reason the first issue that must be addressed is the definition of "disability": This leads to the next question, namely which individuals should be protected by anti-discrimination laws and should they benefit from affirmative action measures? What is meant by the term "discrimination"? Is it at all permissible to distinguish between groups of people and, if so, when and which standards are to be applied? What role can anti-discrimination legislation fulfil in the struggle for equality? When dealing with anti-discrimination legislation, what is required in order to prove discrimination and what remedies must be available to an aggrieved party? Normally, in case of criminal action proof is required beyond reasonable doubt and in case of civil action on the balance of probabilities. 10 Civil action offers more effective remedies, but should it be punitive in nature (by awarding damages to the aggrieved party) or non-punitive (by putting the aggrieved party in his/her "rightful place") ? What sort of enforcement mechanism is needed? Is it a task for the ordinary tribunals or rather a special body created for that purpose? What defences should be available to an employer accused of discriminatory practices? Who should benefit from enforcement? Only the individual victim or all members of that group? Is anti-discrimination legislation sufficient or is something in addition called for? If positive measures are required, what form must these measures take? This study will address these questions specifically with relation to people with disabilities. The "equality principle" will first be studied. Thereafter the concept of "disability" will be defined. There is a movement away from a medical model of disability towards a social model that takes account of the disabling effects of attitudes and structural barriers on the position of disabled people. Then the concept of "discrimination" will be addressed. Discrimination has many different forms and can take place in different contexts In the following chapter possible solutions to the problem of disability discrimination will be raised. Thereafter follows an important comparative analysis of different jurisdictions on international, supra-national and national level. Different jurisdictions have reached different stages in addressing this problem. The factual analysis of each jurisdiction will include the existence of any anti-discrimination legislative measures, the scope of the protected class, applicable employment provisions, defences available to employers, and the success achieved in addressing the problem. The contentious issue of affirmative action measures will also be addressed. By drawing inferences from the comparative study, suggestions will be made for future developments in South Africa. The conclusion is reached that it is imperative for South Africa to draft disability anti-discrimination legislation that takes account of the needs of this minority group. Legislative initiatives, however, are not enough and must be supported by various programmes aimed at the disabled themselves and the community that they live in. Only then can human rights become a reality also for people with disabilities...|$|R
