The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated {{as one of the}} most {{intelligent}} dogs ranked by obedience command trainability.

5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> well done.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{football}} career {{continued to}} soar as several Victorian Football League clubs sought to recruit Laurie and Robert Junior.

5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but they were afraid that if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people who worked in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1938 season, the Victorian Football Association (VFA), the second-tier senior {{football}} {{competition in}} the state, made an ambitious break from tradition in what was ultimately a successful ploy to improve its popularity: it legalised throwing the ball in general play and made a few other rule changes to create a distinct and faster variation of Australian rules football, and ended the legal framework which required players to obtain a clearance when switching from the VFL to the VFA (or vice versa). On March 31, Nash caused a sensation when {{he became the first}} VFL player to defect under this schism, transferring from South Melbourne to Camberwell without a clearance. Nash was already one of the highest paid players in the VFL, but accepted an offer of £8/week to captain-coach the Camberwell Football Club, £3/week to captain-coach the sub-district Camberwell Cricket Club <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as a Camberwell Council official.|$|E
