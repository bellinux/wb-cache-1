5|$|Mercedes {{hit back}} in the second session on Friday night, with Nico Rosberg leading his {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton by about a tenth of a second. The Ferraris were about half a second behind, with Räikkönen again the faster of the two. It was another dismal session for Jenson Button who had to park his car halfway through the session, though he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for a couple of laps {{towards the end of the}} session. A late red flag came out when Vettel, braking slowly into turn one, was clipped by the Force India of Sergio Pérez, taking off part of his front wing endplate.|$|E
25|$|The Lakers {{came out}} of the locker room {{aggressive}} and outscored the Magic 30–14 in the 3rd quarter, led by Trevor Ariza, who scored 13 points in the quarter, including two 3-pointers. Down by 6 in the opening minutes of the 4th quarter, the Magic were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to take a 76–75 lead halfway through the quarter, but unable to increase the lead due to poor free-throw shooting, specifically from Hedo Türkoğlu and Dwight Howard.|$|E
25|$|Aerts {{knocked out}} Markus Fuckner of Germany on February 20, 1994 in Amsterdam {{to retain the}} WMTA Heavyweight Muay Thai title before heading out to Japan {{to take part in}} the K-1 Grand Prix '94 which was held in Tokyo on April 30, 1994. In the quarter-finals, Aerts was drawn against Rob van Esdonk whom he had {{defeated}} in the Netherlands six months earlier. Van Esdonk knocked Aerts down in round one but Aerts was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and KO him with a right high kick. In the semis, he faced Patrick Smith, an American with a wild, aggressive style. Aerts was still able to handle him, however, and KO'd him just over one minute into the first round. Progressing into the final, he came up against Masaaki Satake for the second time. Aerts simply landed more powerful and a larger amount of strikes on Satake en route to a unanimous decision (27-25, 30-25, 30-29) victory. This made him the 1994 K-1 World Grand Prix Champion.|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{relatively}} large inflows from some EaP {{countries in the}} mid- 2000 s highlighted in Figures  1 and 2, {{the relatively}} small estimated populations from EaP countries in the UK suggest that {{a high proportion of}} the migrant workers have subsequently left. This is certainly likely to be true of workers who were employed on the SAWS and SBS. There are only a few studies on return migration from the UK. Dustmann and Weiss (2007) use the LFS to examine return migration for a composite group of immigrants to the UK but their sample only covers the period 1992 - 2002. Pollard et al. (2008) estimate that perhaps half of post-enlargement EUA 8 migrants had returned to their home countries between 2004 and 2007. This may provide some indication of the propensity for return migration amongst people from EaP countries, although EUA 8 migrants are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> to the UK to work without restriction, which is not the case for migrants from EaP countries.|$|R
50|$|As {{a member}} of the Philadelphia Phillies, Byrd was {{selected}} for the 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Byrd's career was revived in 2002, when he won 17 games, despite pitching for a Kansas City Royals team that lost 100 games. Byrd parlayed his 2002 season into a two-year free agent contract with the Atlanta Braves. On July 1, 2003, Byrd underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from the operation and pitch in his first postseason appearance for the Braves during the 2004 National League Division Series.|$|R
25|$|Roche {{was only}} 39 seconds behind Delgado {{in the general}} classification. Roche could still win the Tour, but it {{depended}} on if he could recover {{in time for the}} 22nd stage. That stage included the last serious climb of the Tour, so Delgado had his final opportunity to gain time on Roche, and he attacked. However, Roche was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to Delgado twice. Then, Roche attacked, and Delgado could not keep up. Roche won back 18 seconds on Delgado, so he had reduced his margin to 21 seconds. Being a talented time-trialist, he knew that he could easily make up for it on the penultimate stage (an individual time trial at Dijon). Indeed, Roche won almost a minute on Delgado, and this was enough to secure the overall win. This time trial was won by Jean-François Bernard, who finished the Tour in third place; if Bernard had not lost four minutes after the flat tire in the nineteenth stage, he would have won the Tour.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{the regular}} season brought in-state rival Oklahoma State to Norman. This rivalry, {{referred}} to as Bedlam, encompasses all sports with football being at the top. The rivalry is the most lopsided series in the nation featuring two teams from the same state with Oklahoma leading the series 78–16–7 going into the game. Oklahoma had won 94% of the matches when ranked higher than Oklahoma State. However, the games had a tendency to remain close. Under Bob Stoops, four of the seven games had been decided by six points or less and Oklahoma State was the only Big 12 team to had beaten Oklahoma at home under Stoops. Both teams in this matchup were missing key players. Oklahoma running back DeMarco Murray was injured in the previous game and was out for the season. Oklahoma State's top receiver Adarius Bowman also suffered a knee injury in an earlier game and would also miss the Bedlam match. However, Oklahoma QB Sam Bradford was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> after sustaining a concussion in the previous game.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{had made}} it back to the National Championship {{for the second year in}} a row after losing their best player and {{eventual}} NBA star Gordon Hayward of the Utah Jazz. They were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> into the post season trying to play the cinderella team that they were the previous year. They were seeded as the #8 spot when in fact they had played and won in some very important games that impressed the college basketball sports world. The Butler basketball team was able to pull off upset after upset, game winning shot after game winning shot. Matt Howard made the game winning free throw against The University Pittsburgh after they were losing by one and Matt was fouled 86 feet away from the basket. That wouldn’t be the final of their close calls for this tournament, nor was it their first. Their first game they won by two points, then the close call with Pittsburgh, followed up by an exciting game which led to overtime against Florida in which Butler was able to come out victorious with the win.|$|E

25|$|His {{debut in}} the Octagon was a third fight with Heath Herring at UFC 73, {{promoted}} under various combinations of his name and nickname, but was officially introduced to the audience under his full name and nickname. Nogueira once again defeated Herring, via unanimous decision. During the first round, Herring landed a head kick that sent Nogueira to the canvas, in which unofficial judge Eddie Bravo thought the fight could have been stopped. Herring let Nogueira get back to his feet, and Nogueira was then <b>able</b> <b>to</b> recover and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> with a dominant decision victory.|$|R
25|$|Murray {{went into}} the US Open as the eighth seed, his lowest seeding at a major since Wimbledon 2008. In the first round he faced Robin Haase where he looked to be heading for a routine {{straight}} sets victory. However, early in the third set, Murray suffered a bout of cramp and Haase was able to claw his {{way back into the}} match. It looked to be going all the way to a deciding set but Murray was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from a break down to take the match in four. In the second round Murray defeated qualifier Matthias Bachinger in straight sets to set up a first meeting with Andrey Kuznetsov in the third round. He came through that encounter in four sets to set up a third meeting of the season with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Murray won in straight sets to record his first win over a top 10 player since his 2013 Wimbledon final victory over Novak Djokovic. It was Djokovic who he faced at the quarter-final stage of the tournament. In their 21st meeting the Serb proved to be too much for Murray, taking the win in four sets in a late match that lasted over three and a half hours.|$|E

Porsche was able to repair the No. 14 car enough to {{return it to the}} track for the final lap, settling for eleventh place overall. The battle in LMP2 continued into the last hour, as the Jota Zytek was able to overhaul the TDS Ligier and hold on for the class win and fifth place overall. The win was the first for Jota Sport and its drivers Dolan, Turvey, and Tincknell. Nissan powered the top five finishers in the class. In the LMGTE Pro category, the No. 73 Corvette was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> against the No. 92 Porsche to claim second in class, but no one was able to challenge the lead of the AF Corse Ferrari {{for the remainder of the}} race. The No. 95 Aston Martin, which had been Allan Simonsen's entry when he was killed in an accident at Le Mans the previous year, was undaunted in LMGTE Am and maintained the first-place position it had held for 205 consecutive laps. Proton Competition came in second in the class, two laps adrift of the Aston Martin. There were eight lead changes in the race; four cars reached the front of the field.

Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over. For Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will no longer be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from. In [...] "Vortex", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was—evil. As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the [...] "monster" [...] that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma—he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not—and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions—using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.|$|E
