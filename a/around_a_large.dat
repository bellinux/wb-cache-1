5|$|Advertising for the {{permanent}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> digital-media push headed by its new advertising firm David. However, unlike the 2014 promotion {{that was almost}} exclusively digitally-oriented, the 2015 promotion was accompanied with a sizable television and media tie-in to the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to visitors. A series of advertisements for the product and the company's 2 for $5 sandwich promotion ran during the tournament featuring the hash tag WatchLikeaKing, along {{with a series of}} NCAA co-branded kid's meals.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi, and uses HΛL's remix version. The video opens with Hamasaki signing the track {{in front of an}} audience, whilst dancing <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> black platform accompanied by her background band. Several scenes portray the video being projected on a large television screen, with the ending chorus having a clone of Hamasaki walking into the club and observing herself performing on stage. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album, A Best.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott {{is built}} <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs {{northeast}} {{through the city}} centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas {{in the north and}} the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.|$|E

5|$|Rodmarton Manor is {{a country}} house built between 1909 and 1929, built from local materials, worked by local craftsmen. It was built as three wings, viewed in plan as three sides of an octagon, <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{circular}} courtyard, covered in grass {{which is designed to}} be reminiscent of a village green. The majority of the building is two storeys high and made of coursed cut stone, the plinth is offset and the quoins are flush. The roof is made of stone slate, with grouped chimneystacks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{very large}} events known as fests (short for festival) have {{hundreds}} or thousands of participants who are usually split into competing character factions camped separately <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> venue. There are relatively few fests in the world, all based in Europe and Canada; however, their size means that they have a significant influence on local LARP culture and design. At {{the other end of the}} size scale, some small events known as linear or line-course LARPs feature a small group of PCs facing a series of challenges from NPCs and are often more tightly planned and controlled by GMs than other styles of LARP.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} laid out <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> central hall {{connecting}} the mansion's two gabled end-pieces, which was used for dining. The other major rooms {{on the ground floor}} are the withdrawing room {{to the right of the}} hall, and the buttery and kitchen to the left; there is also a small entrance porch at the main Hospital Street entrance. The first floor has five main rooms: the upper hall (never open to the roof) and four solars (private upper rooms, some of which would have contained beds), as well as a small chapel. The attic is divided into five rooms and provided servants' accommodation.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless GPUs {{are built}} <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> number of longer latency, slower threads, and {{designed}} around texture and framebuffer data paths, and poor branching performance; this distinguishes them from PPUs and the Cell as being less well optimized for taking over game world simulation tasks.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} plan for Luigi's Mansion involved a game where the levels revolved <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> mansion or complex. Tests were later done with Mario characters in dollhouses and such. Once it was transitioned into a GameCube project, Luigi {{was selected as}} the main character {{in order to keep the}} game original and new. The other gameplay ideas, such as ghosts and the ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner, were added later. Older concepts, such as a role-playing game-like system which made real-time changes to rooms, as well as an underground cave area located under the mansion, were also scrapped due to the inclusion of the new ideas.|$|E
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, {{and the land}} falls away toward the river Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near Cape Verde on September16. On September21, the Hurricane Hunters observed a circulation, which indicated a tropical depression had formed {{east of the}} northern Leeward Islands. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Helene on September23. The next day Helene became a hurricane, aided by an anticyclone aloft. It moved <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> ridge, bringing its center toward the southeastern United States. As the hurricane approached the Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified as the eye became visible on radar, and Helene reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) {{on the morning of}} September27. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the northeast, and Helene came within 10mi (15km) of the coast of North Carolina. It slowly weakened, {{and at the same time}} its size expanded. On September29, Helene became extratropical as it was moving over Newfoundland. The remnants continued to the northeast, later turning to the southeast and dissipating on October4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E

50|$|Wire {{wrapping}} {{comes from}} the tradition of rope splicing. Early wire wrapping was performed manually; a slow and careful process. Wire wrapping was used for splices and for finishing cable ends in suspension bridge wires and other wire rope rigging, usually with a smaller diameter wire wrapped <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> wire or bundle of wires. Such techniques were purely mechanical, to add strength or prevent fraying.|$|R

5|$|From {{a handful}} of company designs, Saville {{selected}} Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, {{to lay out the}} desired strategy of the weapons system and to describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville. The Falcon was used successfully for more than a decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around a weapons system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> autocannon, but he further refined the concept and made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.|$|E
5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{takes place}} on several worlds {{centered}} <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: the World of Continent at the base, the World of Ocean on the 5th floor, the World of Sky on the 10th, and the World of Ruins on the 16th. Time does not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically advanced than others. Various monsters come forth from the tower into each world; many are hostile, {{but some of them}} are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot of the human race (named mutants) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans and the World of Continent's older races.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Leon–Eline {{were from a}} low {{pressure}} area that developed within the monsoon trough on February1 in the eastern Indian Ocean, about 250km (155mi) south of the Indonesian island of Bali. The low formed due to a surge of energy within the monsoon that had crossed the equator from the northwest. Associated convection, or thunderstorms, was initially sparse. Over the subsequent few days the system tracked west-southwestward without much development, moving <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> ridge over northwestern Australia. There was initially moderate wind shear in the region. However, a developing anticyclone allowed the convection to persist over the center and develop outflow. At 22:00UTC on February3, the Perth Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (PTCWC) upgraded the tropical low to a Category1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale, estimating 10‑minute sustained winds of 65km/h (40mph). At 04:00UTC the next day, the PTCWC named the storm Tropical Cyclone Leon. On the same day at 03:00UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 11S. Around that time, the storm was located about 215km (130mi) south-southeast of Christmas Island.|$|E

5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E
