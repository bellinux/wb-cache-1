Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's <b>actions</b> <b>to</b> continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite behind their candidate gave Democrat James B.
