There is a description what is the noise, how it is formed, its resources and what are the methods of measuring. The following are the various noise reduction measures such <b>as</b> <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and low noise pavements. The main attention is devoted to the noise generated at the tire / road that is reduced by these pavements. The practical part describes the implemented measurements on individual sections at various locations in our country. The measurement was carried by slightly modified method CPX with reference tire directly at the vehicle. The main aim was to evaluate the measurement data, make comparison of different low-noise surfaces {{with each other and with}} the commonly used surfaces. Then quantification of the rate reduction of the noise emission for a given section and verification of input data for noise modeling. In conclusion, the obtained results are summarized and based on them were confirmed very good acoustic properties with the recommendation to continue with measurements in the future...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{modelling}} {{and measurements}} {{are used for}} studying the reduced performance of a noise barrier, caused by a turbulent atmosphere. The turbulence scatters the sound, which leads to an increased noise level in the acoustic shadow region behind the barrier. For the numerical studies, a parabolic equation method (PE) is extended to model situations with a thin screen in a turbulent atmosphere. A scattering cross-section method is also extended {{to take into account}} source and receiver positions above a ground surface, and scaling properties are used to generate an efficient prediction scheme. A substitute-sources method (SSM) is developed, which is numerically faster than the PE. Both two and three-dimensional implementations are studied, from which it is concluded that the sound level can be well predicted for a large variety of situations using a two-dimensional model. The effect of turbulence increases with frequency and with enlarged geometry. The study concentrates on road traffic noise situations, where screens or buildings are used <b>as</b> <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> The results show that the increase in sound pressure level caused by turbulence can be large at higher frequencies and significant as an A-weighted level...|$|E
40|$|Increasing noise {{pollution}} has severally effected {{the urban areas}} where noise generated by traffic is considered <b>as</b> the major <b>noise</b> polluter. As {{a solution to the}} noise problem using <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> is an approach proven to be effective but due to land scarcity and social needs in urban areas applying <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> solution is challenging. Using a natural <b>barrier</b> <b>as</b> a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is a promising approach. Natural barriers are large or small closely grown tree belts, vegetation walls, natural stone structures, tree fences etc. Natural barriers, have emerged as the new trend to address problems in urban areas and has developed into vertical gardening, green roofs and hybrid natural barriers presently. The use of natural barriers as a solution is highly dependent on the human perception. The research was carried out to identify the human perception and human acceptance of natural barriers in Sri Lankan context and find out the level of acoustic disturbance people are facing. Focusing urban and suburb areas a quantitative approach was adopted via a questionnaire survey and actual sound measurements were taken in the western province of Sri Lanka. Secondly field testing was carried out to evaluate the performance of existing natural barriers to identify their acoustic performance. Closely grown tree belts which assumes a cuboid shape were used as test barriers. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were used to evaluate the performance of natural barriers. Cuboid shape natural barrier with 85 % of green cover or more and overall height closer to 2 meters or more has proven to be an effective acoustic barrier for urban areas...|$|R

Half of the embankment is constructed on an area improved with prefabricated vertical drains, while the other half is constructed on the natural deposit without any ground improvement. The construction and consolidation of the embankment is analyzed with the finite-element method using three different constitutive models to represent the soft clay. Two recently proposed constitutive models, namely S-CLAY 1 which accounts for initial and plastic strain induced anisotropy, and its extension, called S-CLAY 1 S which accounts, additionally, for interparticle bonding and degradation of bonds, were used in the analysis. For comparison, the problem is also analyzed with the isotropic modified cam clay model. The results of the numerical analyses are compared with the field measurements.

40|$|Attitude as {{communication}} barrier (“noise”) in {{preaching the}} Word: basis-theoretical perspectives from {{the parable of}} the sower (Luke 8 : 4 - 15) Hearers’ attitudes in listening to a sermon still represent a very topical field of homiletical research. Within this extensive field the problem of communication barriers (“noise”) in the process of listening to a sermon is scrutinised in this article. At the outset three important concepts are defined: preaching, attitude and noise. The discussion of these aspects is followed by focusing on {{the parable of the}} sower. Outlined in particular {{is the way in which}} noise and attitude are expressed meta- phorically in this parable. As first step in the process of discussing the parable, Luke 8 : 4 - 15 is positioned within the macrostructure of Luke, and also within the microstructure of Luke 8. This specific positioning is followed by a closer exegetical delimitation of what hearers’ attitude as (possible source of) noise can imply. Negative aspects functioning <b>as</b> <b>noise</b> (<b>barriers</b> in receiving the message) are highlighted, including the evil presence of Satan in the listening process. Attention is also devoted to positive factors like spirituality in which the sower sows the seed of the Word in fertile soil. In conclusion basis-theoretical perspectives are formulated on hearers’ attitudes functioning as communication barrier (“noise”) in listening to a sermon...|$|E
40|$|In urban environments {{road traffic}} volumes are {{increasing}} and {{the density of}} living is becoming higher. As a consequence the urban community is being exposed to increasing levels of road traffic noise. It is also evident that the noise reduction potential of within-the-road-reserve treatments such <b>as</b> <b>noise</b> <b>barriers,</b> mounding and pavement surfacing has been exhausted. This paper presents a strategy that involves the comparison of noise ameliorative treatments {{both within and outside}} the road reserve. The noise reduction resulting from the within-the-road-reserve component of treatments has been evaluated using a leading application of the CoRTN Model, developed by the UK Department of Transport 1988 [1], and the outside road reserve treatment has been evaluated in accordance with the Australian Standard 3671, Acoustics - Road traffic noise intrusion - Building sitting and construction [5]. The evaluation of noise treatments has been undertaken using a decision support tool (DST) currently being developed under the research program conducted at RMIT University and Department of Main Roads, Queensland. The case study has been based on data from a real project in Queensland, Australia.

40|$|Polystal [2]) was {{developed}} using glass fibres pultruded with resin {{to form a}} round rod. Much research was carried out to determine the system’s proper-ties, including quantification of the stress-rupture phenomenon. An an-chorage {{was developed}} using a resin cast around bundles of pultrusions in-side a steel tube. This steel tube pro-vided confinement and {{could be used as}} a mechanical fastening. A number of bridges were built using these tendons: a simple footbridge was followed by a two-span continuous structure with internal tendons, both in Düsseldorf. Both are believed to have had considerable amounts of unten-sioned reinforcement and were de-signed as partially prestressed. These examples were followed by a bridge in Berlin with external tendons, and by others elsewhere in Germany and in Austria. Despite the technical success of the system it has not proved a com-mercial success, and production of the tendons has been discontinued. Aramid Rods for Prestressing In the early 1980 s research began in the Netherlands into the use of aramid fib-res for prestressing in the form of pul-trusions, both as flat strips and as round bars, under the name Arapree [3]. The surface of the bars can be indent-ed or coated with sand to improve the bond. As with the Polystal tendons, it is difficult to provide long-term an-chorages for permanent loads, since the force has to be transferred through the resin, which is susceptible to creep and temperature effects. However, an-choring systems have been developed that are adequate for short-term load-ings. These rods are ideally suited for use as pretensioning tendons in pre-cast concrete. The system has been used to build a variety of structures in Europe and Japan. These range from non-structur-al components, such <b>as</b> <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and fish-weir planks, to housing com-ponents and principal elements of quayside developments. The system has also been used in cantilever sup-port brackets on a highway scheme in Barcelona. During early trials, some problems were noted with the transverse expan-sion of the tendons due to thermal ef-fects [4]. Cracking of the concrete along the line of the tendon was noted when the tendons were close to the surface. This was overcome by coating the tendon with a resin that contains microscopic air bubbles...|$|E

In noise control, the double-leaf also serves <b>as</b> an effective <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b> Unfortunately at low frequency, the sound transmission loss reduces significantly due to the coupling between the panels and the air between them. This paper studies the effect of a microperforated panel (MPP) inserted inside a double-leaf partition on the sound transmission loss performance of the system. The MPP insertion is proposed to provide a hygienic double-leaf noise insulator replacing the classical abrasive porous materials between the panels. It is found that the transmission loss improves at the troublesome mass-air-mass resonant frequency if the MPP is located closer to the solid panel. The mathematical model is derived for normal incidence of acoustic loading...|$|R
