50|$|In a {{cold and}} humid environment, {{sublimation}} of ice may occur on the sensor head, {{whether it is a}} hair, dew cell, mirror, capacitance sensing element, or dry-bulb thermometer of an <b>aspiration</b> <b>psychrometer.</b> The ice on the probe matches the reading to the saturation humidity with respect to ice at that temperature, i.e. the frost point. However, a conventional hygrometer is unable to measure properly above the frost point, {{and the only way to}} go around this fundamental problem is to use a heated humidity probe.|$|E
40|$|A {{meteorological}} observation of indoor air-temperatures and humidities of Omotegura (Dozo style old treasury) and Kyozo (wooden old treasury) in Koyasan {{was made by}} the aid of thermohygrographs and an Assman's <b>aspiration</b> <b>psychrometer</b> for the period extending from 1972 to 1974. The data show that Omotegura has the annual mean values of 9. 5 ゜C in temperature and 8 O% in humidity, and Kyozo has those of 9. 2 ゜C and 84 %. And these two treasuries have also the values of about 22 ゜C and 11 % in annual ranges of air-temperature and humidity...|$|E
5000|$|In 1867, when he {{came back}} from the world {{exhibition}} in Paris and brought the first chromic acid cell with him, he also met the astronomer Wilhelm Klinkerfues. Klinkerfues had developed a bifilar-hygrometer which was widely used but did not prove in laymen's hands. After that Lambrecht built a hair hygrometer, [...] "Model Klinkerfues". In 1873, after separation from Klinkerfues, Lambrecht started to build new meteorological instruments such as polymeters, dew point monitors, and <b>aspiration</b> <b>psychrometers.</b> His weather telegraphs, weather columns and combinations of different meteorological instruments were in use at several bigger cities and foreign health resorts before World War I. Lambrecht also built medical thermometers. At the same time he developed the so-called minimum thermometer with a narrowing of the lumen of the capillary which is placed above the mercury container. His precision instruments are well-known all over the world.|$|R
40|$|The Yakushiji and Toshodaiji {{are very}} old temples {{situated}} south-west of Nara city. The author {{carried out the}} meteorological observations in these temples from June, 1956 to Oct., 1958. Main meteorological instruments used are weekly thermographs, weekly hygrographs, an Assmann's <b>aspiration</b> <b>psychrometer,</b> thermo-junctions, and a Kata-thermometer. This report shows {{the results of these}} observations. (1) Continual observations on temperature and humidity in the Yakushiji-kondo (Y 1), Yakushiji-kodo (Y 2), Yakushiii-toindo (Y 3), Toshodaiji-kondo (T 1), Tosyodaiji kodo(T 2) and outdoors (T 3).
