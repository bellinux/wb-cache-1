5000|$|Selene setapinnis (<b>Atlantic</b> <b>moonfish)</b> is a West Atlantic fish {{belonging}} to the family Carangidae.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>moonfish</b> can {{be found}} in schools at the bottoms of inshore waters. Juveniles {{can be found}} on muddy bottoms of {{brackish}} waters. Their depth range is 0-55m and they prefer subtropical regions.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{lookdown}} {{is similar}} to the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>moonfish,</b> it can be distinguished by its dorsal and anal fins, the second ray on each fin being many times longer than the surrounding rays. This gives the dorsal and anal fins a noticeably scythe-like shape. Also, the dorsal fin of the lookdown has 9 spines and 23 rays, while the anal fin has only 3 spines and 18 rays. Like the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>moonfish,</b> it has a deep, rhombus-shaped, laterally-compressed body. The head has the mouth set low and the eyes high. The overall profile of the head is [...] The caudal fin is forked, as in the pompanos, while the pectoral fin is scythe-like and reaches the middle of the second dorsal fin.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>moonfish</b> is a slender, deep bodied {{fish that}} is {{extremely}} compressed. It has a dorsal fin with 8 spines, and an anal fin with 2 spines. They also have 21 dorsal soft rays and 17 anal soft rays. The upper jaw {{is short and}} lower jaw is protruding, extending longer than the upper jaw. They have a sloped, bent forehead and rather large eyes. They have a forked caudal fin that {{is attached to a}} large and hard caudal peduncle. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>moonfish</b> have a faint spot on the base of their pectoral fins. They have a silvery or metallic blue color with a yellowish caudal fin. The dorsal and caudal peduncle regions are lined with a dark edging.|$|E
40|$|Between February and August, 2012, thirty {{specimens}} of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>moonfish,</b> Selene setapinnis, were purchased in local markets in Niter√≥i, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, {{with the aim}} of analyzing the presence of anisakid nematodes, establishing their rates of parasitism and infection sites, due to importance in the sanitary inspection. A total of sixty nematode larvae, belonging to at least two species were found: nine larvae of Terranova sp., Anisakidae, with prevalence (P) of 13. 3 %, mean intensity (MI) of 2. 25, mean abundance (MA) of 0. 30 and range of infection intensity (RI) from 1 to 6; and 51 larvae of Hysterothylaciumfortalezae, Raphidascarididae, with P = 26. 7 %, MI = 6. 40, MA = 1. 70, and RI = 1 - 17. The infection sites for Terranova sp. were the mesentery and liver serosa; and for H. fortalezae, the infection sites were the mesentery, abdominal cavity and liver serosa. New morphological data from scanning electron microscopy, on the external structures of H. fortalezae (mainly at the posterior end), are presented. This is the first report of H. fortalezae parasitizing S. setapinnis...|$|E
