5|$|Throughout {{the opera}} Monteverdi makes {{innovative}} use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond the conventions which composers normally observed in fidelity to Palestrina. He combines {{elements of the}} traditional 16th-century madrigal with the new monodic style where the text dominates the music and sinfonias <b>and</b> <b>instrumental</b> ritornellos illustrate the action.|$|E
5|$|Gojira play a {{technical}} and rhythmic style of heavy metal with precision drumming along with blast beats, unusual rhythm patterns, and start-and-stop riffs. Gojira {{have also been}} known to incorporate textured atmospheric elements <b>and</b> <b>instrumental</b> songs into their music. Gojira songs have progressive and uncommon song structures, rarely using the standard verse-chorus songwriting. The vocal style is varied, using the screamed style often employed in extreme metal, with the death growl style predominantly used in death metal, in addition to clean vocals and higher screams. At times, death metal growls and clean vocals are mixed to create an aggressive but melodic effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, he left Podolia {{and moved to the}} Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where he became a teacher of vocal <b>and</b> <b>instrumental</b> music in a school for {{railroad}} workers' children. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Leontovych organized a choir of workers that performed in meetings. These works included arrangements of Ukrainian, Jewish, Armenian, Russian, and Polish folk songs. Leontovych's activity caught the attention of local authorities, and in {{the spring of}} 1908 he was forced to move back to his native Podolia region to the city of Tulchyn.|$|E

5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical epochs. It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century {{with those of the}} emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias <b>and</b> <b>instrumental</b> ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily to the words. The singers are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{followed}} the musical ideals espoused by The Five. He employed Orthodox liturgical {{themes in the}} Russian Easter Festival Overture, folk song in Capriccio Espagnol and orientalism in Scheherazade, possibly his best known work. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral work {{up to and including}} his Third Symphony—some, like Antar and Sadko, more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing <b>and</b> <b>instrumental</b> detail to wholesale transposition and complete recomposition.|$|E

5|$|Although {{generally}} {{a slow and}} perfectionist composer, Walton was capable of working quickly when necessary. Some of his stage and screen music was written to tight deadlines. He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced. Of his ballets for Sadler's Wells, The Wise Virgins (1940) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral <b>and</b> <b>instrumental</b> music by Bach. The Quest (1943), written in great haste, is, according to Grove, oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams. Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire, unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of Façade, the music for which was expanded for full orchestra, still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original. Music from The Quest and {{the whole of the}} Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler's Wells ballet, O.W., in 1972.|$|E
