5|$|Following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the RLI became {{widely known}} for its {{counter-insurgency}} operations during the Rhodesian Bush War against incursions by ZAPU and ZANU's respective military wings, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The Regiment acquitted itself well in several such operations, with some of its soldiers winning decorations for their actions. Some operations, such as Operations Flotilla <b>and</b> <b>Excess</b> in 1968, involved cooperation with the Portuguese Armed Forces in Mozambique.|$|E

Other Np(IV) coordination compounds are known, some involving other metals such as cobalt (·8H2O, formed at 400K) and copper (·6H2O, formed at 600K). Complex nitrate compounds are also known: the experimenters who produced them in 1986 and 1987 produced single crystals by slow evaporation of the Np(IV) solution at ambient temperature in concentrated nitric acid <b>and</b> <b>excess</b> 2,2′-pyrimidine.|$|E
5|$|Potassium ions are {{necessary}} for the function of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency <b>and</b> <b>excess</b> can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} potassium excretion by the kidneys.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} IgE soluble immune complex (SIC) and IgG SIC on {{neutrophil}} chemotaxis was investigated.

This inhibitory activity of IgE SIC on neutrophil chemotaxis was cell directed and concentration-dependent. IgE immune complex also inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis when immune complex {{was formed in}} the neutrophil chemotaxis...|$|R
5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells <b>and</b> <b>excess</b> mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).|$|E
5|$|Gulfton {{residents}} are zoned to Margaret Long Wisdom High School (formerly Robert E. Lee High School), {{which opened in}} 1962 to relieve Lamar High School, with Lamar and Westside high schools as options. Most Gulfton high school-aged residents attend Wisdom High School. When it opened, Wisdom High School had mainly affluent white students; its demographics shifted to a mostly Hispanic and immigrant student body. In September 1991 Wisdom was one of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments, <b>and</b> <b>excess</b> students had to attend other schools. When Westside opened in 2000, residents of the Wisdom attendance boundary gained the option to attend Westside instead of Wisdom, with no free transportation provided.

Phan and Cao Thang fought on in the mountainous areas of Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa. Another 15 bases were built along the mountain to complement the headquarters at Vu Quang. Each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men. The operations were funded by local villagers, who were levied with a land tax in silver and rice. Local bases were supported by nearby villages <b>and</b> <b>excess</b> funds were sent to Vu Quang.

5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth <b>and</b> <b>excess</b> of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children.

5|$|One might {{believe that}} sodium or {{potassium}} hydride {{would be the}} ideal base for deprotonating these precursor salts. The hydride should react irreversibly {{with the loss of}} hydrogen to give the desired carbene, with the inorganic by-products <b>and</b> <b>excess</b> hydride being removed by filtration. In practice this reaction is often too slow, requiring the addition of DMSO or t-BuOH. These reagents generate soluble catalysts, which increase the rate of reaction of this heterogeneous system, via the generation of tert-butoxide or dimsyl anion. However, these catalysts have proved ineffective for the preparation of non-imidazolium adducts as they tend to act as nucleophiles towards the precursor salts and in so doing are destroyed. The presence of hydroxide ions as an impurity in the metal hydride could also destroy non-aromatic salts.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} successes in film in the 1930s and the pride of MGM at the time, it was {{acclaimed}} as the greatest musical biography {{to be made in}} Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making.
