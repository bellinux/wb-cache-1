50|$|Aventurescence (or aventurization) is a {{reflectance}} effect {{like that}} of glitter. It arises from minute, preferentially oriented mineral platelets within the material. These platelets are so numerous that they also influence the material's body colour. In <b>aventurine</b> <b>quartz,</b> chrome-bearing fuchsite makes for a green stone and various iron oxides make for a red stone.|$|E
