500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} reviews was by Francesca Dinglasan of Boxoffice Magazine. Dinglasan, who gave Drum 2.5 out of 5 stars, was unimpressed by the [...] "unoriginal plotting techniques to convey the story of an investigative journalist attempting to expose racial injustices in a society coming to grips with the newly introduced edicts of apartheid." [...] Although Diggs's acting was [...] "engaging", according to her the film [...] "depends on just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> big-screen cliches and predictable plot turns." [...] The [...] "richly designed sets and costumes" [...] were not able to overcome the less-than-satisfactory" [...] Drum.|$|E
500|$|Abeel praised how, by [...] "voiding the docu-style {{string of}} anecdotes of many fact-based films, {{it offers the}} {{shapeliness}} and irony of classic drama". Hammond commended Madsen as the film [...] "achieves a sense of psychological complexity– and a pervasive atmosphere of fear and confusion– without sacrificing the rhythm and dramatic tension necessary to a war film". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised its combination of [...] "sharp scenes of moral inquiry with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> functional, oldfangled espionage twists". Fuchs applauded the interpolation of emotional relations as they [...] "help to make Flame & Citrons taut action even more effective. Beautifully choreographed and filmed in deep shadows that cut the violence into shadowy, brutal fragments, Flame and Citron's jobs are at once thrilling and disconcerting". Kate Taylor from The Globe and Mail, however, said the romantic relationship, [...] "predictable in a James Bond kind of way, is the weakest link in the script".|$|E
500|$|Both {{the concert}} and the U2 Live at Red Rocks video {{received}} positive reviews from critics. In {{a review of}} the show, G. Brown of The Denver Post wrote, [...] "A lot of things had to go so wrong for U2's show at Red Rocks Amphitheater...to come off so right." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised the film, saying, [...] "The setting lent even more urgency to U2's hypercharged songs about apocalypse, pacifism and existential terror". Pareles said, [...] "Although there are <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> exaggerated camera angles, the tape captures U2's earnest intensity." [...] A review in the Philadelphia Daily News described the camerawork as [...] "artful" [...] and praised the visuals of the concert and the natural surroundings. Perry Seibert of Allmovie gave the film four-and-a-half stars, praising the band's performance and the venue's role in the concert, saying, [...] "the historic Red Rocks venue provides a stirring backdrop for the band's sweeping sound".|$|E

He added <b>a</b> <b>few</b> clues <b>too</b> <b>many</b> when he framed Natalie. Monk also reveals that Natalie's relationship with Joe Cochran {{was one of the}} little surprises Ludlow likes to discover when he commits these seemingly random killings.|$|R

We must not be so nice. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> characters <b>too</b> <b>many</b> must not frighten us. We must double them. We must descend a little. If a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of it. From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you chuse to give me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition for nothing more." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the film's detractors, The New York Times's Nathan Lee said Friday the 13th managed to [...] "reboot the concept" [...] of the original films with style. Lee said the film takes pleasure in killing off each of its characters, {{that there is a}} desire among cinemagoers for this type of material, and that Friday the 13th satisfies that desire. Adam Graham from The Detroit News said the film is the most effective and scary film in the Friday the 13th series; he praised its choice of allowing Jason to run after his victimsas opposed to slowly walking behind them, as became prominent in later sequelsbecause it made him more menacing. Graham also said the film does not [...] "soften" [...] Jason's scariness by providing a sympathetic backstory. Entertainment Weeklys Clark Collis said director Nispel made a competent film that performs better as a whole than the previously released remakes of Prom Night (2008) and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), although it does provide <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> unbelievable character moments.|$|E
500|$|A melancholy love song, its lyrics {{depict a}} woman torn between love and ambition. [...] "West Coast" [...] {{also serves as}} a {{dedication}} to Del Rey's California hometown, and elicits imagery from its titular location. In the song, she sings about leaving a lover for the Californian promise of fame, and emphasizes on a gulf between a sweetly uncomplicated romance and a boozily dysfunctional relationship. Similarly to her previous works, the lyrics are both specific and vague, and complement the track's [...] "dreamlike" [...] sonics. [...] "West Coast" [...] sets up a disunity between form and content, and though a love song, its sound is more reminiscent to that of a breakup song. It was also noted that the lyrics depict a vivid picture of teenage summer memories and forgotten romance. Comparing the track's lyrical content to that of Sonic Youth's [...] "Superstar" [...] (1994), Grantland's Molly Lambert analyzed: [...] "While Born to Die–era Lana often displayed a preening 'please notice me, Mr. Producer!' energy, the Lana of 'West Coast' sounds like a starlet struggling not to become disaffected with show business after feeling her way through <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> casting-couch sessions, still hoping that big break might be on the horizon." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough to make up for it. Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, {{but it could have been}} so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure." [...] The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Londonderry was {{a celebrated}} host and {{practical}} joker, reportedly once decorating the Christmas tree at Wynyard with condoms to startle a visiting cleric. He was an attentive husband and devoted father, entertaining his family with stories and tales. Also regarded as slightly eccentric, {{on one occasion}} Lord Londonderry had taken to his bed after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drinks <b>too</b> <b>many,</b> when Ruth Graham, {{the wife of the}} American evangelist Billy Graham, came to call. Although informed that His Lordship was [...] "indisposed", Mrs Graham insisted upon admission to his bedroom, having [...] "come all the way on Billy's account". She was duly announced. Lord Londonderry threw aside the bed-sheets and shouted, [...] "Get in." ...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-six {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis which was poorly controlled despite high dose D-penicillamine were studied. Compliance {{was assessed by}} standard methods (return tablet count and interview). In addition low-dose phenobarbitone {{was included in the}} penicillamine formulation as a pharmacological indicator of compliance. Using these techniques incomplete compliance was apparent in 11 patients (42 %). All such patients were identified by the pharmacological marker. Only one admitted poor compliance at interview and only six returned more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tablets <b>too</b> <b>many.</b> The reason for the high incidence of poor compliance in this selected group is not apparent but it may represent a significant cause of failure with D-penicillamine therapy. The use of low-dose phenobarbitone may have wider applications in the investigation of {{patients with}} other conditions who fail to respond adequately to treatment...|$|R
50|$|Much to his dismay, Danny!s first {{encounter}} {{on the road}} is marred by racism ("Strange Fruit") as an unscrupulous hotel manager who learns of Danny!s skin color prevents him and his friends from checking into a room he had previously reserved. On top of that, {{the mother of his}} child has been accusing Danny! of having let the fame go to his head ("What Now"), an accusation that Danny! vehemently denies. Hoping to temporarily forget his troubles, a good friend invites him out to a club ("Move Somethin") in the area. However, after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drinks <b>too</b> <b>many,</b> Danny! is whisked away by his manager to a venue in which he had been scheduled to perform (but presumably forgot about due to his excessive drinking at the club).|$|R

2500|$|Eurogamer's Jim Rossignol {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 6 out of 10, writing [...] "True Crime trips over its own {{inflated}} Nikes with just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> moments of lamentable emptiness." [...] He {{was critical of}} the AI; [...] "The perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'." [...] He also compared the game unfavorably to [...] "while artistically more accomplished, New York City lacks {{the personality of the}} big daddy.

500|$|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has {{garnered}} {{criticism for}} allegedly allowing the nomination process {{to be controlled}} by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> individuals, nominating <b>too</b> <b>many</b> artists in <b>too</b> <b>many</b> genres that are not entirely rock, ignoring entire rock genres, and using technicalities to induct groups who may not have been among the top vote getters.

6000|$|Charles had not {{over-estimated}} Philip's {{readiness of}} self adaptation. Charlotte {{had been very}} happy with him, talking over the [...] "Lady of the Lake", which she had just read, and being enlightened, partly to her satisfaction, partly to her disappointment, {{as to how much}} was historical. He listened good-naturedly to a fit of rapture, and threw in <b>a</b> <b>few,</b> not <b>too</b> <b>many,</b> discreet words of guidance to the true principles of taste; and next told her about an island, in a pond at Stylehurst, which had been by turns Ellen's isle and Robinson Crusoe's. It was {{at this point in the}} conversation that Guy came in sight, riding slowly, his reins on his horse's neck, whistling a slow, melancholy tune, his eyes fixed on the sky, and so lost in musings, that he did not perceive them till Philip arrested him by calling out, 'That is a very bad plan. No horse is to be trusted in that way, especially such a spirited one.' ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Frequent pattern mining is a {{basic problem}} in data mining and {{knowledge}} discovery. The discovered patterns {{can be used as}} the input for analyzing association rules, mining sequential patterns, recognizing clusters, and so on.

Specifically, in market basket analysis problem to find out association rules, whether or not the frequent patterns discovered represent exactly the needs of all customers. Or, these frequent patterns were only created by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> customers with <b>too</b> <b>many</b> purchases.

2500|$|David Chapman, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} the Newsquest Media Group Newspapers, concluded, [...] "This is a decidedly funny memoir that includes the scrapes and japes of nob culture." [...] Lorne Jackson of the Sunday Mercury was totally dismissive {{of what he called}} [...] "a dull memoir", stating: [...] "This could have all been explained in one page, possibly two if the type was particularly large." [...] The Sunday Times commented that, [...] "Annabel comes across as a decent woman ... but her writing is flat, with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> clumsy constructions, and her story lacks drama, even when terrible things happen to her." [...] Biographer Selena Hastings called it [...] "a well-ordered, decently written book," [...] while the Evening Standard wrote, [...] "Goldsmith herself comes across as fun and warm, a good sport, if sometimes strangely submissive and a little overfond of her own breasts." [...] Annabel became a No.1 London best-seller for non-fiction. Nationally, the memoirs reached the top ten non-fiction best-sellers in England, fluctuating from No. 7 to No. 4 and then No. 6.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927, {{along with}} other {{prominent}} Pathé and Perfect vocal artists (Willard Robison, Annette Hanshaw, Cliff Edwards), Morse moved to the Columbia label. From 1927 to 1932, {{she was one of}} the label's most popular female performers, second only to Ruth Etting. Morse continued to do vaudeville and other stage work during this time, landing a role in Ziegfeld's Simple Simon that may have made her an even bigger star. Unfortunately, Morse's drinking problem left her unable to perform on the show's February 18, 1930 debut. According to Lorenz Hart biographer Gary Marmorstein: [...] ", Wynn, the bicycle-piano and Lee Morse made their entrance and were greeted with applause. Everything would have been fine except that Miss Morse had had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> and couldn't remember the words or the music." [...] Minus their star, the producers asked Ruth Etting to step up in the eleventh hour to fill Morse's shoes. As a result, the show's memorable [...] "Ten Cents a Dance" [...] became Etting's signature while Morse's once promising Broadway career abruptly ended.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Thierry Nguyen {{scored the}} PC version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "well-meaning but {{ultimately}} flawed." [...] He too disliked Billy's levels, especially the platforming sections. He concluded [...] "Call of Juarez {{is a game}} we wanted to like, as it has most of the requisite elements that we {{look for in a}} Western. It's just that the really sloppy platforming and box-moving, which take up a good chunk of the game, puts a big damper on any joy that we might find in shooting up bandits and cowboys." [...] Sterling McGarvey also scored the Xbox 360 version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "yet another Tex-Mex shooter that seems to have been made by a bunch of guys who've watched <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> Westerns but haven't figured out how to get the ambience and authenticity of the historical period down." [...] He praised the shooting mechanics, but concluded [...] "For the most part, Call of Juarez has taken two core ideas and melded them into a game. [...] There will be inevitable comparisons to Neversoft's GUN, but CoJ feels much more a next-gen version of the lackluster Dead Man's Hand than anything else." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a one year experiment in which class discussions were held on-line, by exchanging electronic mail messages. This experiment was conducted for the computer ethics portion of a two semester software engineering course. The experiment was motivated by the question of whether class discussion could be effectively moved to an on-line format and how the dynamics would change with such a move. It was hoped that the on-line format could alleviate some of the problems of open-ended in-class discussions, such as domination by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> members and <b>too</b> <b>many</b> silent class members. It was found that there are several advantages to on-line discussions, making email a useful tool for enhancing class material. Furthermore, the experiment indicated that inclass discussions can be moved to the on-line format for small classes (ten students or less) of motivated students. The evidence did not support moving large classes to the on-line format. It also did not support moving [...] ...|$|R
