25|$|Leicestershire fell to {{yet another}} innings defeat in their game against mid-table Gloucestershire, the match being {{completed}} within three days. Victory for Essex against their rivals Worcestershire kept the former side in contention for promotion, while the latter county's chances were essentially eliminated by the result. Kent joined Glamorgan on two Championship wins by defeating the Welsh county inside three days at Cardiff. The match between Hampshire and Northamptonshire ended in a draw, although it could technically have been called off and restarted <b>at</b> <b>another</b> <b>time,</b> {{as a result of}} the absence of Hampshire's scorer on the final day, due to illness. Lancashire, who drew their match against Leicestershire, were assured of promotion when Essex failed to beat Kent. Worcestershire, resigned to remaining in Division Two in 2014, also drew in their game against Hampshire. Leicestershire lost their final match of the season against Hampshire without picking up a single bonus point; they failed to win a single Championship match all season for the first time in their history. Draws in the matches between Essex and Glamorgan, and Northamptonshire and Kent, left Northamptonshire as firm favourites for the second promotion spot, while Lancashire clinched the Division Two title after drawing their game against Gloucestershire. Although Northamptonshire were defeated by Worcestershire, they still secured promotion by virtue of the fact that Essex also lost in their match against Hampshire. Glamorgan ended their season with an eight-wicket win against Gloucestershire, while Division Two champions Lancashire fell to their first, and only, defeat of the season in their game against Kent, who were set 418 to win. Lancashire finished 36 points clear of Northamptonshire, whose advantage over third-placed Essex was 20 points. Hampshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire were split by just four points, while there were only two points between Kent and Glamorgan.

Because large numbers of blacks were moving to the West during World War II to look for work there, Russell's father moved the family out of Louisiana when Russell was eight years old and settled them in Oakland, California.

The fundraiser was called [...] "Cry of the Streets: An Evening for Freedom" [...] and raised money for Servants Anonymous Facilitates Exit, a women's shelter for those seeking to leave the sex industry. At the fundraiser, Falle advocated adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which decriminalized the selling of sex and criminalized pimping and the purchasing of sex. Falle argued in support of modelling prostitution law in Canada after Sweden's laws because she believes that prostitution cannot be regulated. <b>At</b> <b>another</b> <b>time,</b> she had said that [...] "it's not Canada's laws that make prostitution unsafe, it's the johns who are raping and abusing the women and their pimps." [...] Also in 2013, Falle said that the average age at which girls get involved in prostitution in Canada is 14, and that their emotional intelligence does not develop while in prostitution, preventing many of them from leaving. She also said that prostitution has grown significantly in Canada since she left the sex industry, and that most human trafficking victims in Canada were born and raised in Canada.|$|E

My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, <b>at</b> <b>another</b> <b>time,</b> the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued.

500|$|Between 1996 and 2000, {{the lead}} monster and child went through radical changes {{as the story}} evolved. As the story {{continued}} to develop, the child varied in age and gender.

After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and <b>at</b> <b>another</b> <b>time</b> being an African-American character. Originally the character of the little girl, known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old who has been toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers. In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing is on the way. He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the company's top performer. Through various drafts, Johnson's occupation went back-and-forth from being a scarer and from working in another area of the company such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc. Throughout development Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him. Docter would later describe that the team [...] "bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters [...] " [...] while still solving the problem, A key moment came when the team decided [...] "Okay, he’s the BEST scarer there. He’s the star quarterback" [...] with Docter noting that before that moment [...] "design after design, we really didn’t know what he was about." [...] Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to [...] "look like a guy in a suit." [...] To this end Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles. Mary's age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of 3.
