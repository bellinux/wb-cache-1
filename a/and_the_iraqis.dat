5|$|The {{failure of}} Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt {{led to the}} {{tightening}} of Umayyad control over Iraq. Al-Hajjaj founded a permanent garrison for the Syrian troops at Wasit, situated between Basra and Kufa, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis,</b> regardless of social status, were deprived of any real power in the governance of the region. This was coupled with a reform of the salary (ʿaṭāʾ) system by al-Hajjaj: whereas hitherto the salary had been calculated based {{on the role of}} one's ancestors in the early Muslim conquests, it now became limited to those actively participating in campaigns. As most of the army was now composed of Syrians, this measure gravely injured the interests of the Iraqis, who regarded this as another impious attack on hallowed institutions. In addition, extensive land reclamation and irrigation works were undertaken in lower Iraq (the Sawad), but this was limited mostly to around Wasit, and the proceeds went to the Umayyads and their clients, not the Iraqi nobility. As a result, the political power of the once mighty Kufan élites was soon broken.|$|E

In the end, the British were able to march on Baghdad and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani fled.|$|E

An Iraqi envoy was sent to demand that no movements, either ground or air, were to take place from the base.

25|$|In August 1921, the British {{installed}} Hashemite King Faisal I as {{the client}} {{ruler of the}} British Mandate of Iraq. Faisal had been forced out as the King of Syria by the French.

2500|$|Public {{perception}} is that the Iraqis were confrontational and blocking {{the work of the}} inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, [...] "Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq." [...] So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> called it 'sensitive,' we go in with four people.|$|E
2500|$|Because the Achaemenid Empire or [...] "First Persian Empire" [...] was the {{successor}} {{state to the}} empires of Assyria and Babylonia based in Iraq, and because Elam is part of Iran, the ancient people of Iran were ruled by ancient Mesopotamians, which explains the close proximity between the people of south western Iran <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> even in modern days, in fact, the people of that part of Iran speak Mesopotamian Arabic and were put {{under the rule of}} modern Iran by the British. The ancient Persians adopted the Babylonian cuneiform script and modified it to write their language, along with adopting many other facets of ancient Iraqi culture, including the Aramaic language which became the official language of the Persian Empire.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{routes and}} {{terminal}} locations on the Mediterranean coast were {{sought by the}} French, who favored a northern route through Syria and Lebanon terminating at the city of Tripoli on the Lebanese coast, and the British <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> who preferred a southern route, terminating at Haifa, in what then was Palestine. The issue was settled by a compromise which provided {{for the construction of}} two pipelines, each with a throughput capacity of 2,000,000 tons a year. The length of the Northern line would be , that of the Southern line (Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline) [...] In 1934, the pipelines were completed from Kirkuk to Al Hadithah, and from there, to both Tripoli and Haifa; the Kirkuk field was brought online the same year. Only in 1938, nine years after the discovery, did IPC begin to export oil in significant quantities.|$|E

The {{false sense of security}} provided by the device had catastrophic effects for many Iraqi people, hundreds of whom were killed in bombings that the ADE 651 failed to prevent. The victim of one such bombing, 21-year-old Haneen Alwan, told the BBC that her life had been destroyed after she was caught in a bomb attack which caused injuries that killed her unborn child and prompted her husband to divorce her because of her extensive burns, which have so far required her to undergo 59 operations. She said: [...] "When people passed through checkpoints using these devices, they thought they would be safe. But they are useless. The man who sold them has no conscience. He is morally bankrupt.
