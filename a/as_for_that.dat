2500|$|If a {{son died}} before marriage, his parents {{arranged}} a ghost marriage to {{provide him with}} progeny to continue the lineage and give him his own descendants. [...] "A man in China does not marry so much for his own benefit <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> of the family: to continue the family name; to provide descendants {{to keep up the}} ancestral worship; and to give a daughter-in-law to his mother to wait on her and be, in general, a daughter to her." [...] Occasionally, a live woman is taken as a wife for a dead man, but this is rare. The ceremony itself took on characteristics of both a marriage and a funeral, with the spirit of the deceased bride being [...] "led" [...] by a medium or priest, while her body is transferred from her grave to be laid next to her husband.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{enthusiasm for}} Nikolai Gogol's work became {{reflected}} in both her husband's compositions {{and those of}} his friends. On the day of their betrothal, she and Rimsky-Korsakov read Gogol's short story [...] "May Night" [...] together. Afterwards, {{she told him that}} he should write an opera based on it. A week or two later she wrote him, I've been reading yet another of Gogol's stories today, [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi." [...] This is good, too, and would even be suitable for an opera, but not for you; in any case, it's not like 'May Night.' <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> it's so stuck in my head that nothing will drive it out. Either she or her sister Alexandra then suggested [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi" [...] to Mussorgsky. He did not act on it at the time, but a couple of years later, he reconsidered.|$|E

2500|$|Mitchell and Webb {{were taught}} basic magical skills for the film, with them each {{receiving}} [...] "welcome pack of DVDs telling {{the history of}} magic". Andrew O'Connor {{was a member of}} The Magic Circle but was thrown out for revealing secrets, so he and Scott Penrose taught Mitchell and Webb magical skills. Webb spent two weeks [...] "trying to roll a coin across [...] fingers and [...] still couldn't do it", with Mitchell admitting that [...] "magic proved far more problematic than we anticipated". Webb stated that the worst part that he had to film [...] "was being buried up to the neck in sand. It's not the most comfortable place to be. I'd be buried for 30 minutes at a time, which doesn't sound that long, but {{it was the middle of}} summer and there were a lot of wasps around." [...] Mitchell had to kiss Jessica Hynes in the film, but admitted that he would have preferred to have kissed Robert Webb as he had done in Peep Show, which he claimed to have been easier, <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> scene he had to [...] "look absolutely rigid at the time". On the subject of the scene with Hynes, he stated that [...] "the scene went surprisingly well considering we had to do it in front of 700 extras, but if I'd had a single moment more to think about it I'd have been mortified with embarrassment." [...] Whilst filming in Nottingham, unit signs being used in the film were repeatedly being stolen by teenagers as they had the word [...] "magic" [...] on them. Multiple signs had to be ordered, at £3 each. The magic shield competition takes place in Jersey, but the filming for these was done in Skegness.|$|E
