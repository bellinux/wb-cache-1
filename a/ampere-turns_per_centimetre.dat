5000|$|The {{magnetic}} field H {{is given in}} SI units of <b>ampere-turns</b> <b>per</b> meter (A-turn/m).

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Measurements {{were made}} of the energy loss in a superconducting wire coil {{subjected}} to an axial magnetic field consisting of a ripple field superimposed on a steady field. The loss was measured calorimetrically using a sonic thermometer consisting of a resonance tube filled with helium gas in thermal contact with the superconducting wire under test. An adiabatic calorimeter and an almost isothermal calorimeter were constructed to measure the losses and their respective results were compared. The critical state theory of Kim, Hempstead and Strnad predicts the experimentally determined loss characteristics. The loss-vs-steady field characteristic was measured for Niobium, 25 wt percent Zirconium, 10 MIL wire. General agreement with Kim's theory was found with a maximum loss occurring at 254, 000 <b>ampere-turns</b> <b>per</b> meter, such loss falling to a lower and constant value at fields above 795, 000 <b>ampere-turns</b> <b>per</b> meter...|$|R

In fact for a given strength the required <b>Ampere-turns</b> <b>per</b> pole are proportional to the cube of its distance from the centre. The low-carbon steel core was 396 mm long, the strength 28 T/m.

5000|$|This is a {{nonlinear}} equation, {{because the}} permeability of the core, μ, {{varies with the}} magnetic field B. For an exact solution, the value of μ at the B value used must {{be obtained from the}} core material hysteresis curve. [...] If B is unknown, the equation must be solved by numerical methods. However, if the magnetomotive force is well above saturation, so the core material is in saturation, the magnetic field will be approximately the saturation value Bsat for the material, and won't vary much with changes in NI. For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap) most core materials saturate at a magnetomotive force of roughly 800 <b>ampere-turns</b> <b>per</b> meter of flux path.|$|R

5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kV <b>per</b> <b>centimetre.</b> Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV <b>per</b> <b>centimetre.</b> The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|R

5000|$|The {{practical}} {{cgs system}} is a hybrid system that uses the volt and the ampere as the unit of voltage and current respectively. Doing this avoids the inconveniently large and small quantities that arise for electromagnetic units in the esu and emu systems. This system was at one time widely used by electrical engineers because the volt and amp had been adopted as international standard units by the International Electrical Congress of 1881. [...] As well as the volt and amp, the farad (capacitance), ohm (resistance), coulomb (electric charge), and henry are consequently also used in the practical system and {{are the same as}} the SI units. However, intensive properties (that is, anything that is per unit length, area, or volume) will not be the same as SI since the cgs unit of distance is the centimetre. For instance electric field strength is in units of volts <b>per</b> <b>centimetre,</b> magnetic field strength is in amps <b>per</b> <b>centimetre,</b> and resistivity is in ohm-cm.|$|R
