5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin <b>and</b> <b>Child.</b> Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> with St. Anne.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his famous}} {{drawings}} are the Vitruvian Man, {{a study of}} the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E
5|$|At school, Brinkley was {{introduced}} to the study of glandular extracts and their effects on the human system. He determined that this new field would help move his career forward. After two years of studies, and ever-deeper debts, Brinkley doubled his summer workload by taking two shifts at Western Union, but came home one day to find his wife and daughter gone. Sally filed for divorce <b>and</b> <b>child</b> support, but after two months of payments, Brinkley kidnapped his daughter and fled with her to Canada. Sally Brinkley, unable to obtain an extradition order from Canada, dismissed her suit for alimony <b>and</b> <b>child</b> support, allowing Brinkley to return to Chicago with the child. The couple reunited in their rocky marriage.|$|E

The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E

2500|$|Smith {{had ordered}} his {{officers}} {{to put the}} [...] "women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> in <b>and</b> lower away". However, Murdoch and Lightoller both interpreted the evacuation order differently; Murdoch interpreted it as women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> first, while Lightoller interpreted it as women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were not any women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> waiting to board, while Murdoch only allowed {{a limited number of}} men to board if all the nearby women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> had already embarked. This had a significant effect on the survival rates of the men aboard Titanic, whose chances of survival came to depend on which side of the ship they tried to find lifeboat seats.|$|R

[...] The First (Officer Murdoch) and Second (Officer Lightoller) officers interpreted the evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> first, while Lightoller took it to mean women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> only. Second Officer Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats {{if there were no}} women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> waiting to board, while First Officer Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> had embarked. [...] As a consequence, 74% of the women and 52% of the children on board were saved, but only 20% of the men. [...] Some officers on the Titanic misinterpreted the order from Captain Smith, and tried to prevent men from boarding the lifeboats. It was intended that women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> would board first, with any remaining free spaces for men. Because not all women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> were saved on the Titanic, the few men who survived, like White Star official J. Bruce Ismay, were initially branded as cowards.|$|R
