50|$|The {{main gear}} {{had to be}} {{redesigned}} to place the wheels behind the aircraft's center of gravity. The main gear was moved behind the front spar, and when retracted filled most of {{the space between the}} spars. This caused a major redesign of the fuel tanks and reduced their capacity to just 680 liters (150 gallons). This necessitated the addition of two 200 L drop tanks, which hung under the tip of each wing. The addition of the tip tanks required a redesign {{of the structure of the}} wing so that the aircraft could still maintain <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> of 12g. The vertical stabilizer was enlarged and a periscope was also added above the windscreen on most series aircraft. Armament, systems, and equipment were virtually unchanged.|$|E
50|$|Most {{construction}} projects {{require the use}} of hundreds of different materials. These range from concrete of all different specifications, structural steel of different specifications, clay, mortar, ceramics, wood, etc. In terms of <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structural frame, they will generally consist of structural steel, concrete, masonry, and/or wood, using a suitable combination of each to produce an efficient structure. Most commercial and industrial structures are primarily constructed using either structural steel or reinforced concrete. When designing a structure, an engineer must decide which, if not both, material is most suitable for the design. There are many factors considered when choosing a construction material. Cost is commonly the controlling element; however, other considerations such as weight, strength, constructability, availability, sustainability, and fire resistance will be taken into account before a final decision is made.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from the}} TV lift systems, {{there are also}} the related {{projector}} lift systems. These projector lift systems may be distinguished into two equipment groups. On the one hand there is the projector ceiling light, which vertically lowers the projector downwards from a suspended ceiling, and there are projector lifts for integration into tables or furniture. The latter moves the projector vertically upwards, out of the furniture or table. Both systems are mostly made from ultra light aluminium. Stable equipment guiding is achieved in most cases using scissors or special guides. A projector lift system is often driven by a tubular motor, or another electromotor, which moves a shaft accordingly. Then the lower platform which the projector stands on, can be lowered via special belts or chains. Projector ceiling lift systems are available as ultra flat versions right up to stage projector lift devices with a lift of 5m and more, and <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of several 100 kg.|$|E

40|$|Load paths can be mapped from vector {{plots of}} 2 ̆ 7 {{pointing}} stress vectors 2 ̆ 7. They define a path along which a load remains constant as it traverses the solution domain. This definition and a procedure for plotting the paths {{have been presented}} elsewhere. An iterative algorithm that assigns high modulus to the elements {{on the path to}} define <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> topology has also been presented. In this paper properties of the plots are identified. They enable a designer to interpret the structural behaviour. Simple structural components for each type of load transfer are defined. Using these properties and components, a procedure to sketch the topology from the paths is proposed. The procedure is expected to be useful at the conceptual phase of the design process. The topologies sketched are compared with topologies defined by the iterative algorithm. Application to a bolted joint, a racing car body and a yacht hull demonstrate the usefulness of the paths to first interpret the structural behaviour and then define <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> topology...|$|E
