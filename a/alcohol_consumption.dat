5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> had no protective effect.|$|E

5|$|During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was {{a hotbed}} of bootlegging and illicit <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption.</b> Several factors fed into {{resistance}} to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption. The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.|$|E

5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils and spinach) are not associated with gout.

5|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{effects of}} the menstrual cycle on <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> have found mixed evidence.

5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E

5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary {{breakdown}} metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} 237 {{instances of}} policy changes related to <b>alcohol</b> sales and <b>consumption</b> enacted in Texas communities between 1975 and 1996 {{to determine their}} effect on the incidence of alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents. These policies are categorized by location where the alcohol is consumed after sale (on the premises or off) {{and the type of}} <b>alcohol</b> available for <b>consumption</b> (beer and wine or hard liquor). After controlling for both county and year fixed effects, we find evidence that (i) the sale of <b>alcohol</b> for <b>consumption</b> on the premises (in bars and restaurants) is associated with a sizeable increase in alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents, (ii) the sale of alcohol (in liquor stores) for consumption off the premises may actually decrease expected accidents, and (iii) the sale of higher proof alcohol (hard liquor) presents greater risk to highway safety. ...|$|R

5|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of beer is alcohol, and therefore, {{the health effects}} of alcohol apply to beer. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and diabetes mellitus. The long term health effects of continuous, moderate or heavy <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> include the risk of developing alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When <b>alcohol</b> <b>consumption</b> is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E

Three hundred patients of non-ulcer dyspepsia were included in the study.   Each case was matched with community control of same age and sex.
