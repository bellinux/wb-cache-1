5|$|The first {{evidence}} {{that something was}} wrong at Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio contact with the posts, <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement {{was the result of}} an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 1931, two weeks before his 50th birthday, Sitton {{borrowed}} a car from a Valdosta native <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lowndes County Fairgrounds. There, parked near the baseball diamond, he {{shot himself in the}} head. No motive for his suicide was found.|$|E
50|$|After the Roadblock, teams {{choose a}} marked Toyota Land Cruiser <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> {{themselves}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pit Stop at Borj Nord.|$|R
25|$|Starkweather <b>and</b> Fugate <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bennet, Nebraska, {{farmhouse}} of seventy-year-old August Meyer, {{a family}} friend. Starkweather killed {{him with a}} shotgun blast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head. He also killed Meyer's dog.|$|R
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} {{skill and}} gallantry. When flying a single-seater scout, he dived on to five hostile machines, which were flying at about 2,500 feet, <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground as a wreck. On many other occasions {{he has shown}} great determination when fighting enemy machines.|$|R
25|$|The Eagles {{took the}} second half kickoff <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Panthers 18-yard line before Manning ended the drive with his second interception. Then after a punt, Manning {{recorded}} his third interception and returned it 13 yards to the Eagles 37-yard line. Four plays later, DeShaun Foster's 1-yard touchdown run increased Carolina's lead to 14–3.|$|E
25|$|The Seahawks {{took the}} opening kickoff <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Redskins 11-yard line, but then Alexander lost a fumble without being touched, and linebacker Lemar Marshall {{recovered}} it. After that, {{the two teams}} were forced to punt on all their possessions in the first quarter, and with 5:28 remaining, Alexander was knocked out of the game.|$|E
25|$|Tampa Bay {{took the}} second half kickoff, <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Packers 17-yard line. A play later, however, Griese's pass was bobbled by Michael Clayton at the 5, and intercepted by Tramon Williams. After trading possessions, midway through the third quarter, Green Bay was at their own 40-yard line. Ryan Grant fumbled, and Jermaine Phillips {{recovered}} for a 38-yard Buccaneer touchdown.|$|E
50|$|Charles Leclerc won {{a thrilling}} sprint race, despite pitting for fresh tyres {{earlier in the}} race. The Monegasque driver started from sixth on <b>the</b> grid <b>and</b> {{promptly}} <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front <b>to</b> grab an early lead. Despite the early lead, Prema decided to adopt a one-stop strategy seeing as how tyre management was an issue for both Prema drivers.|$|R
50|$|Back in {{the streets}} Vukwana hijacked a passing Golf, forced the driver and three {{passengers}} out at gunpoint <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shebeen, where {{he arrived at the}} same time as Lulamile Phantsi and his wife, who were called for help. The gunman immediately shot at Mr. Phantsi in his Isuzu, hitting him fatally in the neck.|$|R
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and skill. He dived on to {{an enemy}} machine in the enemy's lines <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, where it was smashed, and then circled round and fired at the pilot and observer as they ran for shelter. Although forced to land through his engine stopping he contrived to restart it and got back under heavy fire.|$|R
25|$|Tolsdorff's {{unit was}} then {{transferred}} to the Rhineland {{as part of the}} army reserve. He participated in the Battle of France. His unit fought in Belgium <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Flanders pocket, then south past Paris to the Saumur area. His injury sustained in the Polish campaign forced him to seek further medical attention in August 1940. He was transferred to a hospital in Wuppertal and was released in October.|$|E
25|$|The Titans {{took the}} ensuing kickoff <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Patriots 33-yard line. But two penalties, a 10-yard {{intentional}} grounding call and a holding penalty, pushed them back 20 yards. McNair threw an 11-yard completion {{on the next}} play, but after that, Drew Bennett had the ball knocked {{out of his hands}} on fourth down and 12, and the Titans turned the ball over on downs with 1:38 left.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} innovation {{produced by}} the revivals was the camp meeting. The revivals were organized by Presbyterian ministers who modeled them after the extended outdoor communion seasons, used by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, which frequently produced emotional, demonstrative displays of religious conviction. In Kentucky, the pioneers loaded their families and provisions into their wagons <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Presbyterian meetings, where they pitched tents and settled in for several days.|$|E
50|$|Cannon did {{not qualify}} for the 1977 Indianapolis 500, but did compete as a relief driver. In the final ten laps, Cannon took over the car of John Mahler, <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finish. He prided himself as being {{one of only a}} handful of drivers <b>to</b> be on <b>the</b> track at the moment A. J. Foyt won his record fourth Indy 500.|$|R
50|$|Hill's first {{encounter}} with arson occurred when the Rebel Cab Company cabstand opened {{just around the corner}} from Vario's business. The competing company's owner was from Alabama, new to New York City. Sometime after midnight, Tuddy <b>and</b> Hill <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rival cabstand with a drum full of gasoline {{in the back seat of}} Tuddy's car. Hill smashed the cab windows and filled them with gasoline-soaked newspapers, then tossed in lit match books.|$|R
50|$|During {{the reign}} of Shelun and his {{successor}} Datan, the Rouran pushed {{as far as the}} Issyk Kul, where they defeated <b>the</b> Wusun <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. In the east they raided the Northern Wei before they were defeated on June 16, 429. Afterwards, as many as 1.5 million Gaoche were said to be captured and settled to areas adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital Pingcheng in the south.|$|R
25|$|Alabama {{received}} the opening kickoff <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Auburn 34-yard line, but missed a 44-yard field goal. Auburn's opening drive netted 20 yards and no points. Alabama was then held to seven yards, going three-and-out. Auburn then capped off a seven-play, 66-yard drive with a 45-yard touchdown run by Nick Marshall. It was the Tigers' first offensive touchdown against Alabama since 2010. The quarter ended with Auburn leading 7–0.|$|E
25|$|Jacksonville {{took the}} second half kickoff <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New England 31-yard line, only to lose the ball when quarterback Mark Brunell was stuffed for no gain on fourth and 1. Three plays later, Bledsoe lost a fumble while being tackled by Kevin Hardy, which linebacker Eddie Robinson {{recovered}} for Jacksonville on the Pats 37 {{to set up a}} 28-yard Hollis field goal that cut the score to 13–6.|$|E
25|$|Like Latour, Riesch's {{troops had}} to contend with terrible roads and snow squalls. They fell far behind Kollowrat, {{reaching}} Albaching only at 9:30am. Consequently, Richepanse's division passed in front of Riesch. Near the village of St. Christoph, the two Austrian grenadier battalions sent by Kollowrat stumbled upon Richepanse's marching column, cutting his division in half. With single-minded determination, the Frenchman left his rear brigade under General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Drouet to fight it out <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north with his leading brigade.|$|E
25|$|During the 2011 Gilad Shalit {{prisoner}} exchange, {{relatives of}} the victims of the bombing vehemently protested the release of Ahlam Tamimi, who chose the Sbarro restaurant as a target <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>the</b> bomber <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location.|$|R
50|$|Crossing the Roer on 25 February 1945 the 5th {{spearheaded the}} XIII Corps drive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rhine, {{crossing}} the Rhine at Wesel, 30 March. The Division reached {{the banks of}} the Elbe at Tangermunde, 12 April—45 miles from Berlin. On 16 April, <b>the</b> 5th moved <b>to</b> Klotze <b>to</b> wipe out <b>the</b> Von Clausewitz Panzer Division <b>and</b> again <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elbe, this time in the vicinity of Dannenberg. The division mopped up in the Ninth Army sector until VE-day.|$|R
50|$|Conklin later {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, {{purchasing the}} vast Rosemary Farm in Huntington, New York. He {{served as president}} of the Chicago Motorbus Company. In the 1910s, he provided the capital for the Alma Mater at the University of Illinois, designed by classmate Lorado Taft. In 1915, Conklin designed a motorhome <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. NATC was merged into the Chase Manhattan Bank.|$|R
25|$|The Raiders got {{the first}} scoring {{opportunity}} of the game when quarterback Jeff Hostetler's first pass of the game was complete to Tyrone Montgomery for a 19-yard gain to the Bills 29-yard line. But a third down sack by Buffalo lineman Bruce Smith halted the drive and Jeff Jaeger missed a field goal attempt from 47 yards. Buffalo then took over <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Raiders 30-yard line, but also came up empty when Jim Kelly threw an incomplete pass on a fourth and 1 conversion attempt.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 150 {{friends and}} {{relatives}} attended a brief service in Cornelia, Georgia, <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cobb family mausoleum in Royston for the burial. Baseball's only representatives at his funeral were three old-time players, Ray Schalk, Mickey Cochrane and Nap Rucker, along with Sid Keener, {{the director of the}} Baseball Hall of Fame, but messages of condolences numbered in the hundreds. Family in attendance included Cobb's former wife Charlie, his two daughters, his surviving son Jimmy, his two sons-in-law, his daughter-in-law Mary Dunn Cobb and her two children.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers {{responded with}} a long 15-play drive to retake the lead on Gary Anderson's 30-yard field goal, making the score 10–7. After a punt, Pittsburgh {{drove back to the}} Chiefs 35-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs. Kansas City then took over <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Steelers 42, but on fourth down and 1, {{defensive}} end Gerald Williams sacked Montana for a 7-yard loss, giving his team the ball on their own 49 with under a minute left. The Steelers made the most of their opportunity, scoring on O'Donnell's 26-yard touchdown completion to Ernie Mills that increased their lead to 17–7 {{at the end of the}} half.|$|E
50|$|He {{met with}} Hedström at a {{prearranged}} place, {{picked him up}} and continued to a shaft at Sala silver mine, where {{the two men had}} already made an opening into the shaft. After dragging the body there, however, they realized that someone had fixed the hole that they had prepared, and they returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> car with the body. The two men loaded the body back into <b>the</b> car <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Sörbobäcken (<b>the</b> Sörbo brook), where they stopped and threw the body into the rivulet.|$|R
50|$|Crowland is nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{outskirts}} of Peterborough than Spalding, and (similar to other settlements of the Welland) {{is less than}} 1 mi north of the boundary with the City of Peterborough. The main road is the A16, which provides connections with Spalding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and Peterborough <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south (via the A47). The east-west B1166 connects with Deeping St. James, {{the north side of}} <b>the</b> Welland <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west <b>and</b> Holbeach <b>Drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, <b>and</b> Thorney is accessed via <b>the</b> B1040 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-east.|$|R
50|$|Blumkin <b>and</b> Andreev <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} of a Cheka detachment {{under the command of}} Left SR D. I. Popov, where at the time the Central Committee of the Left SR party was in session. At about 5:00 p.m., Dzerzhinsky, who had been given responsibility for investigating the assassination, followed a lead as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> murderers' likely whereabouts and went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building in order to arrest Blumkin and those who concealed him. But instead of arresting Blumkin, Dzerzhinsky himself was arrested by Popov.|$|R
25|$|Cleveland {{took the}} opening kickoff <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Raiders 14-yard line. But in {{what turned out}} to be the crucial play of the game, running back Charles White lost a fumble that was {{recovered}} by linebacker Jeff Barnes. After the turnover, LA drove 89 yards and increased their lead to 20–10 on Allen's 3-yard touchdown run. Cleveland would never mount a serious scoring threat for the rest of the game. In the fourth quarter, Los Angeles essentially put it out of reach with a 65-yard drive, including Plunkett's completions to Malcolm Barnwell for 26 yards and Branch for 15, that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Frank Hawkins, making the final score 27–10.|$|E
25|$|Graham Sutherland, who {{had just}} been shot at in his car, {{reversed}} back up the road <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> service station close by, where he tried to inform people what was happening. Bryant drove up to the service station and cut off a white Toyota Corolla that was attempting to exit onto the highway. Glenn Pears was driving, with girlfriend Zoe Hall in the passenger seat. Bryant quickly exited the car with his rifle in hand and tried to pull Hall from the car. Pears {{got out of the car}} and approached Bryant. Bryant pointed the gun at Pears and pushed him backwards, eventually directing him into the now open boot of the BMW, locking Pears inside.|$|E
25|$|Houston {{took the}} opening kickoff <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Steelers 40-yard line, but were stopped there and Tony Zendejas missed a 55-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, Steelers rookie Jerry Olsavsky blocked a punt from Greg Montgomery and Pittsburgh {{recovered}} on the Oilers 23. Eventually facing fourth and 1 on the Houston 9-yard line, Steelers coach Chuck Noll {{decided to go}} for the first down. This paid off as running back Tim Worley took a pitch and ran {{all the way to the}} end zone, evading linebacker Robert Lyles and plowing right through safety Bubba McDowell on the way to a 7–0 Steelers lead with 2:36 left in the first quarter.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of April 5, 1950, Binaggio and his underboss, Charles [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Gargotta (a notorious {{enforcer}} within the Kansas City family), were called to meet some unknown persons at the First Ward Democratic Club near downtown Kansas City. Binaggio left his driver/bodyguard, Nick Penna, at the Last Chance saloon, at a tavern owned by the mob, saying that he would return in a few minutes. Binaggio and Gargotta then borrowed a car <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Club.|$|R
25|$|On May 18, 2008, Weigman <b>and</b> others <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{residence}} of the Verizon investigator who was investigating Weigman’s activity, and attempted to intimidate and frighten him. Weigman had {{admitted that he had}} already placed intimidating and harassing messages and calls <b>to</b> <b>the</b> investigator. When Weigman's phone line was disconnected by Verizon because the phone line he was using was illegitimate, he infiltrated the Verizon phone system and used this information <b>to</b> harass <b>the</b> employee and <b>to</b> gain information about the status of the investigation that Verizon was conducting.|$|R
500|$|Aubame {{was unaware}} of the coup until <b>the</b> French {{ambassador}} <b>to</b> Gabon, Paul Cousseran, called him on the telephone roughly a half hour after sunrise. Cousseran, meanwhile, was awoken by the noisy streets and checked to see what was happening. Aubame replied that he was to find out why there was [...] "no government", as Cousseran never directly mentioned a coup. However, about midway through the morning an automobile carrying the revolutionary committee arrived at Aubame's residence <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> governmental offices, where he had been named president.|$|R
