5|$|First Class : This {{advancement}} badge is {{the first}} advancement badge that places the Scout {{in a position of}} leadership and organisation. A Scout is required to plan and run a wide game for their Patrol, a Patrol camp, an overnight Patrol hike for which a log book must be written, a programme to teach younger Scouts in their Patrol about pioneering, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> assist in the planning of a Scouts' Own.|$|E
5|$|Coronation Street aired {{a special}} live episode to {{celebrate}} the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Kylie's sister-in-law Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie walks in on the struggle and hits Callum {{over the head with}} a wrench. Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her kitchen floor. The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> move quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the manhole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover up the manhole with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E

It is possible for filter graphs to change over time as new filters are installed on the computer.|$|E

30|$|Obstruction of {{the left}} main {{bronchus}} is a rare but life-threatening complication of PDA closure with surgical clips. Harris et al. [1] reported that the PDA clip had been placed across the left main bronchus and caused the left main bronchus obstruction. A significant compression {{of the left}} main bronchus by a surrounding fibrous mass was noted, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> remove the mass and skeletonize the left main bronchus 2  months after the PDA surgery. Bhat et al. [2] reported that a single PDA clip was applied to both the PDA and the left main bronchus, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> repair the left main bronchus injury 5  days after the PDA surgery. In these cases, chest computed tomography showed the clip applied across the left main bronchus.|$|R
25|$|C {{recognizes the}} fact that there are {{individuals}} in high-risk circumstances who either by choice or by coercion are going to find themselves unable to follow A and B, and therefore they need to have access to condoms, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> understand the correct and consistent use of condoms. I think more and more of the experts, the people who really understand the prevention requirements with HIV/AIDS, have come to endorse ABC in a very balanced way as the appropriate prevention centerpiece.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} flexing and the {{material}} constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an overall}} underpricing of formal water and {{sanitation}} services in Sub-Saharan Africa. A first consequence is an insufficient cost recovery, leading to dependency on foreign aid and governmental support, and to insufficient investments. Second, underpricing is socially unfair. Since the poorest social groups are less connected to water networks and sewerage, they need to turn to alternatives, and they pay in some cases a multiple of the formal tariff. Hence, the poorest are hit twice: they have less access to improved water supply and sanitation, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> pay more.|$|E

25|$|Storer, Holmen and Pedersen {{describes}} a netchain {{built around a}} food processor. The food processor uses the output of a meat and a vegetable processor and sells food to restaurants. The meat and vegetable processors are using the output of primary producers, whereas the restaurants serve consumers and {{are connected to the}} vegetable processor and the meat processor as well. Moreover, primary producers also share information with the food processor. The main purpose of the entire food chain/network is to serve consumer needs <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> cooperate to achieve this. As a result, a strongly connected system is formed, which can be described as a netchain.|$|E
25|$|The {{ticketing}} system uses RFID contactless technology with round tokens issued for single trips and a contactless stored value card, the MRT Plus card, for frequent travellers. It is planned that a joint {{ticketing system}} will be set up so that passengers can use a single ticket on the MRT {{as well as on}} the Skytrain. Multi-storey park & ride facilities are provided at Lat Phrao and Thailand Cultural Centre. Motorists who park their cars at these premises will be issued with additional contactless smartcards <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have them electronically stamped at their destination station. The turnstiles accept cards or tokens, both available from a manned booth or automated ticket machines.|$|E
500|$|Harper {{remained}} {{active in}} constitutional issues. He {{was a prominent}} opponent of the Calgary Declaration on national unity in late 1997, describing it as an [...] "appeasement strategy" [...] against Quebec nationalism. He called for federalist politicians to reject this strategy, and approach future constitutional talks from the position that [...] "Quebec separatists are the problem <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be fixed". In late 1999, Harper called {{for the federal government}} to establish clear rules for any future Quebec referendum on sovereignty. Some have identified Harper's views as an influence on the Chrétien government's Clarity Act.|$|E

Woodburne told Annette Dasey of Inside Soap that Karl knows Martin is taking Susan to dinner and he does not think she would be capable of any [...] "misconduct" [...] with him. The actress explained [...] "Susan is very attracted to Martin, but she wouldn't be aware of it if her marriage was more solid and she wasn't feeling so unloved." [...] Woodburne stated that Susan is tempted to have a fling, but she ultimately decides that she wants to save her marriage. Despite Karl's affair, she still loves him <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> work through their problems. Woodburne was good friends with Tucker as they previously worked together on Cop Shop.|$|E
500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk {{of victimization}} by human traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less than {{a dollar a day}} and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled with a lack of social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to modern slavery. [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope for better <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> survive. Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E

Sigurjón covered most of the cost, even paying for Matthías Þórðarson, {{the director of the}} National Museum, to oversee the excavation. The process was a lengthy one, because a father and son had been buried on top of Jónas in 1875, and another couple in 1900, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be excavated first.|$|R

2500|$|Sanders gives four {{reasons why}} {{he does not believe}} that inclusivism deprives Christians of the {{motivation}} to evangelize. [...] First, Jesus wants us to do so.

Third, there are those who do not believe in God <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be lovingly challenged.

2500|$|The term [...] "chronic {{cerebrospinal}} venous insufficiency" [...] {{was coined}} in 2008 by Paolo Zamboni, who described it {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis. Instead of intracranial venous problems he described extracranial blockages, and he stated that the location of those obstructions seemed to influence the clinical course of the disease. According to Zamboni, CCSVI had a high sensitivity and specificity differentiating healthy individuals from those with multiple sclerosis.
