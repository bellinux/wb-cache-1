A theoretical (mathematical) description of the two-step electrode process at the carbon anode in KF-AlF 3 -Al 2 O 3 melts under stationary and non-stationary conditions is suggested. The charge of the electric double-layer, {{the formation of an}} intermediate CO ads adsorption product at the anode surface, the limitations of the current transfer, which include the charge transfer through the electrode/electrolyte interface, and the diffusion and chemical interaction of the electroactive ions in the melt near the anode surface were taken onto account. Alterations of the basic parameters of the process were monitored and analysed. Estimates of <b>anode</b> <b>process</b> kinetics parameters (e. g., exchange current densities and the degree of the anode surface coverage by the intermediate product CO ads) for different experimental conditions were made by a comparison of the modelled and experimental polarisation curves. The electrochemical desorption of the intermediate product CO ads from the anode surface (the second step) was shown to be relatively slower than the charge transfer process (the first step).

40|$|Zirconium alloys {{are widely}} used in nuclear power plants as {{cladding}} material to contain the fission fuel in the reactor cores. A limiting factor for fuel longevity is the corrosion property of the zirconium alloys. The main corrodent in the reactor core is water. Ideally, the oxidation process of zirconium alloys with water should be accompanied by molecular hydrogen release into the surrounding, but {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen is absorbed into the alloy. This process is called hydrogen pick-up, and is along with the oxidation rate decisive to the longevity of the fuel. The mechanisms controlling the hydrogen pick-up are to a large extent unknown. In this study, density functional theory, DFT, was used to gain insights into the mechanism for water induced corrosion of zirconium. The steady state process whereby Zr is oxidized by means of oxide ions at the metal/oxide interface comprises the <b>anode</b> <b>process.</b> This implies release of two electrons of the oxide ion. A sink for these electrons is offered by H+ ions, whereby H 2 is formed or hydrogen picked up in the metal. These comprise the cathode processes. A detailed mechanism for electro-catalytic hydrogen evolution was explored. The mechanism comprises formation of a TM-H-Zr three-center hydride ion, followed by a hydride-proton recombination step forming H 2. The efficiency of the system to utilize the overpotential for hydrogen evolution was found to be decisive for the fraction of hydrogen that is absorbed in the alloy. The ability of the <b>anode</b> <b>process</b> to sustain the cathode process was investigated, both by addressing the anode potential and its variations with respect to oxygen distribution. Diffusion barriers for redistribution of oxygen atoms in the α-Zr matrix were quantified, and the finding was taken to suggest the possible roles of meta-stable oxygen distributions to the change in hydrogen pick-up fraction.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Three {{aspects of}} glow {{discharges}} have been studied: glow discharge oscillations, sputtering, and coupling between cathode and anode regions {{the two most}} important regions in a glow discharge. Cathode and <b>anode</b> <b>processes</b> are tightly coupled by electron and ion coupling effects. Both electron and ion coupling effects were observed by studying excited Ar atoms in the cathode and anode regions and observing laser-induced space charge variations and the optogalvanic effect. Laser-induced space charge variations in the glow discharge were observed by the change in potential of an electrical probe. This signal, called the optopotential signal, provides useful information about the cathode and <b>anode</b> <b>processes,</b> and may become another useful spectroscopic detection method. Glow discharge oscillations are old phenomena but our mechanistic understanding of the processes involved continues to grow. A mechanism study is important especially now since a new type of sensitive GC detector is being developed based on this phenomenon. A SPAN model of glow discharge oscillation is proposed: source formation, propagation, accumulation, and neutralization of space charges. Electrode coupling couples the neutralization and source formation processes thus completing the feedback loop necessary for some of the observed oscillations to occur. Four modes of oscillations were found. Emission, space potential and current monitoring, and forced oscillations were used to monitor and identify the mechanisms. Studies of cathodic sputtering with gas flow rates up to 2. 13 L/min/jet were carried out in an Atomsource sputtering atomizer with Ar as the jet gas and Cu as the cathode sample. These flow rates are 20 -fold greater than those normally used and were found to increase net sputtering yield significantly.

The concept {{is characterized by}} the optimization of ionic transport in the anode and ionic uptake in the cathode. The ionic transport in the anode can be enhanced by reducing the tube length and wall thickness of the ATNTs. The ionic transport and uptake at the cathode is significantly improved by the combination of ordered mesopores and high specific surface area in the OMC. Remarkably, these hybrid electrochemical energy storage cells are capable of delivering a high energy density of 25 W h kg(- 1) and a high power density of 3000 W kg(- 1) at a short current-draining time of 30 s, more than two times higher than in previously reported hybrid cells. Another advantage of these hybrid cells is that they are safe and stable for long periods of operation owing to the absence of dendrite lithium metal and a solid electrolyte interphase.

Although the latter cannot yet replace all existing energy sources, they can supplement power generated by utilities and increase the diversity of our energy supply. Since years an immerse reserve of energy is lying under seas, an inexhaustible fuel essentially composed of organic matter. The bacteria present either in sediments or in seawater could oxidise organic matter as well as reduce oxygen dissolved in subsurface seawater. These different reactions result in a voltage drop between sediments and water surface, thus generating current. In 2002, a US team 1 has demonstrated that bacteria isolated from marine sediments, Geobacter sulfurreducens, could transfer electrons directly to electrode, without the contribution of soluble electron mediator 2. This new way of electron transfer promises high yields of current production and enables facilities such as microbial fuel cells to be implemented easily. Concurrently, French researchers 3 have demonstrated that a stainless steel cathode covered by a biofilm formed in seawater reveals extraordinarily high catalytic properties for the electrochemical reduction of dissolved oxygen. In this context, an installation was implemented in Genova harbour, simply composed of two stainless steel electrodes: one dipped in sea mud, and another immersed in surface seawater.

Materials and methods. The study was performed at an aluminum primary production plant located in Central Greece. Thirty-two actively employed male workers (mean age: 47 ± 7 years, range: 31 - 58 years) voluntarily participated in the study. Twenty-three of them were working in the anode production section, while the remaining nine belonged to a pot relining crew. Biological monitoring was conducted by taking a single urine sample from each worker {{after the end of the}} 8 -hour shift of at least the third consecutive day of work. An environmental exposure study was conducted as well: personal breathing zone air samples were collected from 15 workers (10 of whom had participated in the biological monitoring study). All subjects completed a questionnaire which investigated factors that could influence excretion of 1 -hydroxypyrene, such as dermal exposure, use of protective equipment, dietary habits, smoking history and medications. Determination of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene was carried out with high-performance liquid chromatography whereas air samples were analyzed for 17 PAHs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was carried out on SPSS® 10. 0 statistical software. Both parametric and non-parametric tests were used, depending on the normality or not of data distributions. Results considered significant for p-values < 0, 05 (two-tailed). Results. Median urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene concentration of exposed workers was 0, 26 μmol/mol creatinine (range: 0, 02 - 1, 93). 1 -hydroxypyrene values were substantially higher among smokers (median= 0. 33 μmol/mol creatinine, n= 15), but the difference between smokers and non-smokers (median= 0. 14 μmol/mol creatinine, n= 17) was not statistically significant (t-test for log-transformed values: t= 0. 93, p= 0. 36). Total PAH concentration in air samples varied from 2. 8 to 4071. 6 μg/m 3 (median= 30 μg/m 3, n= 15), whereas benzo(a) pyrene values ranged from 0. 05 to 9. 8 μg/m 3 (median= 0, 29 μg/m 3, n= 15). A multiple regression analysis was conducted in order to evaluate how well a number of factors theoretically related to PAH intake could predict 1 -hydroxypyrene concentration in urine (dependent variable). Approximately 58 % of variance of the dependent variable can be accounted for by the independent variables. Worksite (raw production), number of cigarettes smoked per day, hours of daily occupational exposure to PAH and dermal occupational exposure to PAH were found important for better prediction. Conclusions. There was a low level occupational exposure to PAH at a prebake anode aluminum plant located in Greece. Urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene is a suitable biomarker of occupational exposure to PAH at this specific environment, as long as workers smoking habits are considered. ...|$|E

Once fuel is injected into a fuel cell, generally oxidation of fuel takes place at a cathode, while oxygen reduction takes place at an <b>anode.</b> During this <b>process,</b> when a...|$|R

Inhibitive effect {{shows up in}} the deceleration of both <b>anode</b> and cathode <b>processes.</b> It is assumed that its appearance is related to the formation of a surface layer of slightly dissolutive complex compounds which appear {{as a result of the}} reaction of triphenylphosphineoxide with cations of the dissolving metal...|$|R
40|$|Known {{processes}} are {{not suitable for}} obtaining very high coating rates under intensive plasma action. The spectrum of the depositable materials should be very large, also for insulating layers. The efficiency of the process should be high. According to the invention, vapour deposition material is deposited from at least two vaporization vessels by electron beams. An electric voltage {{is applied to the}} vaporization vessel {{in such a way that}} the vapour-emitting areas act as electrodes for an electrical discharge. The vapour deposition material acts as a cathode or an <b>anode.</b> The <b>process</b> and the device are preferably for the reactive coating of large surfaces and for the reactive coating of components, tools and steel strip...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports, for {{the first}} time, the online {{monitoring}} to the electrochemical degradation of the paracetamol using a biomimetic sensor coupled to a Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) system. The electrochemical degradation of the drug {{was carried out in}} aqueous medium using a flow-by reactor with a DSA <b>anode.</b> The <b>process</b> efficiency was monitored at real time by the biomimetic sensor constructed by modifying a glassy carbon electrode with a Nafion membrane doped with iron tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (FeTPyPz). Simultaneously, we carried out off-line analysis by liquid chromatography (HPLC) during the experiments in order to validate the proposed system. In addition, to investigate the degradation products of the paracetamol electrolysis, we used the techniques of UPLC/MS and GC/MS...|$|R
