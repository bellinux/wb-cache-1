5|$|Active for millennia, Mount Redoubt has erupted {{four times}} {{since it was}} first observed: in 1902, 1966, 1989 and 2009, with two {{questionable}} eruptions in 1881 and 1933. The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of 45,000ft (14,000m). It caught KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747 aircraft, in its plume. After the plane descended 13,000 feet, the pilots restarted the engines and landed the plane safely at Anchorage. The ash blanketed an area of about 7,700sqmi (20,000km2). The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long-period seismic events developed by Swiss/American volcanologist Bernard Chouet. As of August 2015, the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation <b>Alert</b> <b>Level</b> Green and Volcano <b>Alert</b> <b>Level</b> Normal.|$|E
5|$|Exports {{from the}} Hovensa oil {{refinery}} in St. Croix, with a daily production of roughly , were canceled as ports across the island were closed. All businesses {{were shut down}} in Dominica on September3 due to the storm. In Antigua and Barbuda, all schools and the local airport were closed as a precautionary measure. Two cruise ships, the Carnival Glory and a Royal Caribbean ship postponed their docking dates and stayed at sea for a few additional days. The islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy were placed under an orange alert, the second-lowest <b>alert</b> <b>level,</b> and Guadeloupe was placed under a yellow alert, the lowest <b>alert</b> <b>level.</b> In Puerto Rico, officials closed schools and government offices on September4 and opened 433 shelters across the island. Officials in the Dominican Republic placed nine provinces under warnings as a precautionary measure. Nearby Haiti was also alerted {{of the possibility of}} heavy rains.|$|E

50|$|Also on 1 July, Michael Chertoff, United States Secretary of Homeland Security, {{announced}} that the United States <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> would remain unchanged at orange for airports (the second highest), and at yellow nationally (the third highest).|$|R
40|$|International audienceCyanobacteria {{and their}} toxins {{are known as}} a health hazard in recreative and {{distributed}} waters. Monitoring data from 2004 to 2011 were collected at regional scale to characterize exposition parameters to microcystins in Brittany (Western France). The data show that cyanobacteria populations are experiencing a composition shift leading to a longer duration of cell densities higher than WHO <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> 2 and 3. Microcystins however {{appear to be more}} frequently detected with subacute concentrations in low cell density samples than in high cell density samples or during bloom episodes. Positive relations are described between microcystin concentrations, detection frequencies and cyanobacteria biovolumes, allowing for a novel definition of <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> and decision framework following WHO recommendation...|$|R
5|$|In the Mexican city of Matamoros, located {{south of}} Brownsville, Texas, Captain Manuel Leon Lopez warned {{residents}} about the approaching hurricane through radio messages. Many people were seen leaving coastal villages and heading further inland. Mexican officials raised the <b>alert</b> <b>level</b> to stage three {{due to the}} threat of Barry.|$|E
5|$|During September and October 2010, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual {{increases}} in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at Nevado del Ruiz prompted an <b>alert</b> <b>level</b> of Yellow on October 1. Chemical {{analysis of the}} volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months a smattering of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight {{times as many as}} had been recorded from 2009–2010. 2010 marked the beginning of {{increases in}} sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a dramatic increase in earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Mount Tambora has {{remained}} active {{since the end}} of the 1815 eruption sequence. Minor lava domes and flows were extruded on the caldera floor during the 19th and 20th centuries. Sometime between 1850 and 1910, Tambora erupted again but only inside the caldera. Small lava flows and lava dome extrusions were formed. This eruption (VEI-2) created the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone inside the caldera. A very small (VEI-0) and non-explosive eruption occurred in 1967; Another very small eruption was reported in 2011. In August 2011, the <b>alert</b> <b>level</b> for the volcano was raised from level I to level II after increasing activity was reported in the caldera, including earthquakes and smoke emissions.|$|E
50|$|The film {{focuses on}} a number of Cold War themes, {{including}} brinksmanship, political loyalty and the mutual distrust of both sides as they attempt to resolve the issue diplomatically while escalating their military <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> to force the other side to back down.|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that the spatial and temporal incidence of harmful algal blooms is increasing in freshwater basins. In {{the framework of a}} national program supported by the Italian Ministry of Health, a research group has been constituted to develop safety plans and <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> framework for the control of drinking water in Italy...|$|R
50|$|<b>Alerting,</b> {{the first}} <b>level,</b> {{does nothing to}} {{distinguish}} human from animal. At the <b>alerting</b> <b>level</b> one merely picks up on certain environmental sound cues. While discussing this level, Barthes mentions the idea of territory being demarcated by sounds. This is best explained using the example of one's home. One's home, for instance, has certain sounds associated with it that make it familiar and comfortable. An intrusion sound (e.g. a squeaking door or floorboard, a breaking window) alerts the dweller of the home to the potential danger.|$|R
5|$|Officials in Oaxaca {{shut down}} beaches and warned {{people not to}} venture out into the water. Residents were advised of {{potentially}} heavy rainfall. Along coastal areas of Mexico, specifically around Acapulco, officials closed ports to small crafts due to rough seas. Residents around the city were also warned {{about the possibility of}} mudslides from heavy rain associated with the cyclone's outer bands. Upon Rick's intensification to a Category4 hurricane, officials in Mexico raised the <b>alert</b> <b>level</b> in Guerrero, Jalisco and Michoacán to severe. In Sonora, the local government placed 14 municipalities under a blue alert, the pre-storm phase; the alert was upgraded to a yellow alert for the municipalities of Álamos, Benito Juárez, Navojoa, Etchojoa and Huatabampo on October 18.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{forecasts}} {{from the}} JMA and Korea Meteorological Administration indicated that Bolaven would strike {{the country at}} an intensity {{greater than that of}} the nation's worst typhoon disaster in decades: Typhoon Rusa in 2002. On August27, nearly all of South Korea was placed under a typhoon warning as the storm approached. The state disaster relief board went to its highest <b>alert</b> <b>level</b> prior to the storm's arrival. More than 400 flights were canceled across the country, including 109 international flights from Incheon International Airport. The majority of cancellations were domestic flights, mainly from Ningbo to Jeju Island. Local authorities conducted safety inspections of areas prone to landslides and closed off beaches and seawalls. Residents in flood-prone areas were encouraged to evacuate for their own safety as well. Along the coast, hundreds of ships sought refuge from rough seas in various harbors and ports. Numerous ports banned sea travel and shut down activities by August27, and 68 of the nation's 87 ferry routes were canceled. In Busan, all ships were not allowed access to the docks until the typhoon's passage.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} no threat to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would remain high for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the <b>alert</b> <b>level</b> to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be cautious about venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E

50|$|The Beijing {{government}} revised their four-color {{alert system}} {{at the start of}} 2016, increasing the levels of pollution required to trigger orange and red alerts. The change was introduced to standardize the <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> across four cities including Tianjin and four cities in Hebei, and perhaps in direct response to the red alerts issues the previous December.|$|R
50|$|Iliamna has {{not been}} {{recently}} active. Like Redoubt, it stands on Jurassic granite basement rock, but has been significantly altered by glacial activity that has cut away the slopes on the southern and eastern sides. The mountain has experienced seismic activity {{from time to time}} that has raised <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> while the earthquake flurries have persisted. The peak has active fumaroles that occasionally produce visible vapor plumes.|$|R
25|$|On July 10, 2009, PHIVOLCS {{raised the}} status from <b>Alert</b> <b>Level</b> 1 (low level unrest) to <b>Alert</b> <b>Level</b> 2 (moderate unrest) {{because the number}} of {{recorded}} low frequency volcanic earthquakes rose to the same level as those prior to the 2008 phreatic explosion.|$|E
25|$|On January 13, 2010, PHIVOLCS {{reduced the}} <b>Alert</b> <b>Level</b> from 3 to 2 {{due to a}} further {{reduction}} in the likelihood of hazardous eruption.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 2010, PHIVOLCS {{lowered the}} <b>alert</b> <b>level</b> {{of the volcano}} from level 4 to level 3, citing {{decreasing}} activity observed over the prior four days. The state agency noted the absence of ash ejections and relative weakness of steam emissions and the gradual decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions from a maximum of 8,993 tonnes per day to 2,621 tonnes per day. 7,218 families within the 7–8km danger zones returned to their homes, while 2,728 families residing in the 4–6km danger zone remained in the evacuation centers pending a decision to further lower the <b>alert</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mount Slamet erupted again Wednesday (18th) {{after four}} days of {{remaining}} quiet. The volcano, dormant since 2009, began erupting again in late August prompting authorities to raise <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> in the area. While the eruption was {{not considered to be}} a large one, a nearby forest was razed and authorities have blocked off a 2.5 mile radius in case of increased activity. Residents have otherwise remained calm in the region.|$|R

25|$|Following the {{declaration}} of <b>alert</b> <b>level</b> 3 for the volcano, the United States issued an advisory cautioning its nationals from traveling to Mayon. Canada and the United Kingdom also posted advisories discouraging their nationals from visiting the volcano.|$|E
25|$|A nearly six-month {{period of}} {{relative}} quiet at the volcano ended on December 27, 2009, with renewed earthquake swarms. The AVO subsequently raised the <b>alert</b> <b>level,</b> and again {{warned of the}} possibility of a more vigorous eruption due to dome collapse.|$|E
25|$|After {{many days}} of {{deliberation}} the WHO {{declared that the}} current influenza had become a true pandemic, raising the Pandemic <b>Alert</b> <b>level</b> to Phase 6, the highest on the WHO scale and congruent with U.S. Federal Government Response Stages 3–6.|$|E

30|$|Since the 2001 unrest, the {{municipal}} government {{has begun to}} create a hazard map for volcanic activity. After a 2 -year discussion involving a panel including academic experts, a hazard map was created and distributed to the residents and business operators in the town {{in the spring of}} 2003. At that time, JMA was simply expected to describe the status of volcanic activity based on pure natural science; however, in 2008, the Meteorological Service Act was revised and JMA was obliged to announce volcano <b>alert</b> <b>levels</b> (VALs) when volcanic unrest or eruptions took place.|$|R
