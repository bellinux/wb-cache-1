5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that Andalusians {{experience}} ischaemic (reduced blood flow) diseases of the small intestine at a rate significantly higher than other breeds; and stallions had higher numbers of inguinal hernias, with risk for occurrence 30 times greater than other breeds. At the same time, they <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> a lower incidence of large intestinal obstruction. In {{the course of the}} study, Andalusians <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> the highest risk of laminitis as a medical complication related to the intestinal issues.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} {{geometric}} mean urine mercury concentration identified a previously unrecognized source of exposure (skin care products) to inorganic mercury among New York City residents. Population-based biomonitoring <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> that mercury concentration levels are higher in consumers of seafood and fish meals.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{represented}} {{in the form of}} a flag, the No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force uses the Saltire surmounted by a lion rampant as the device shown on the squadron crest. The station crest of the former RAF Leuchars, Fife, <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> the Saltire, in this case surmounted by a sword. The crest of the former RAF East Fortune, East Lothian, <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> a sword surmounting the Saltire, however unlike Leuchars this sword was shown inverted, and the station crest of the former RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, showed a Saltire surmounted by an eagle's head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron crest features a Saltire surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions rampant.|$|E
5|$|Cantor {{developed}} important {{concepts in}} topology and {{their relation to}} cardinality. For example, he showed that the Cantor set is nowhere dense, but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the rationals are everywhere dense, but countable. He <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> that all countable dense linear orders without end points are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers.|$|E

5|$|He <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> a {{good eye}} at the plate. Of 15 Rangers who {{had at least}} 100 at bats, his rate of only one strikeout per 8.31 at-bats was the best on the team. Similarly, he made contact on 87% of his swings, the best contact rate on the team.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, it was {{suggested}} that the brolga, sarus crane (Antigone antigone) and white-naped crane (Antigone vipio) formed a natural group on the basis of similarities in their calls. This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane than it is to the morphologically more similar sarus crane.|$|E

5|$|In May 1967, her {{performance}} at the Mount Brandon Hotel in Tralee, Ireland, was canceled because Catholic clergy condemned it. She wanted to marry Cimber in a Catholic ceremony, {{but was unable to}} find a priest who would perform the ceremony. While involved with Brody, she <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> interest in Judaism.|$|E
5|$|Lazio's bid was {{handicapped}} by {{the weak}} performance of George W. Bush in New York in the 2000 election, {{but it was}} also clear Hillary Clinton had made substantial inroads in upstate New York prior to Lazio's entry into the race. Exit polls <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> a large gender gap with Clinton running stronger than expected among moderate women and unaffiliated women.|$|E
5|$|Study of {{the wreck}} <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> that {{restarting}} the engines to provide power increased the stresses {{placed on the}} hull, adding to the flooding. Once power was then lost, {{it was impossible to}} prevent the ship from sinking — her fate was more the result of design flaws than of the actions of her captain.|$|E

5|$|A behind-the-scenes {{footage from}} the video shoot showed Derulo wearing {{different}} outfits, including a dark pinstripe {{suit with a}} pair of sunglasses, a rose-colored button-down shirt and white pants. The footage <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> Derulo and Sumpter shooting a scene in a silver corvette, as well as a kissing scene between the two. A 37-second preview of the video was released on August 12, 2011. The completed video premiered online on August 15.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal cloud band on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida. Dean was first identified {{on the afternoon}} of September 26 as a subtropical storm. An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent to Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. This data <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> that the storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean {{on the afternoon of}} September 27.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's army {{crossed the}} Hellespont in 334BC with {{approximately}} 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and {{a fleet of}} 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000, drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace, Paionia, and Illyria. He showed his intent to conquer {{the entirety of the}} Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.|$|E
