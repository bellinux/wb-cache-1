5|$|David Darts {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in {{an article}} for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over {{time in the history}} of censorship. He observed that the rationale for justifying censorship of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely <b>anxiety</b> <b>that</b> youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and <b>anxiety</b> <b>that</b> caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E

25|$|In England, {{the first}} modern police force was {{established}} in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel as the Metropolitan Police of London. From the start, the force occasionally employed plainclothes undercover detectives, but there was much public <b>anxiety</b> <b>that</b> these powers were being used {{for the purpose of}} political repression. In part due to these concerns, the 1845 official Police Orders required all undercover operations to be specifically authorized by the superintendent. It was only in 1869 that Police commissioner Edmund Henderson established a formal plainclothes detective division.|$|E

25|$|Paradoxical {{intention}} is a cognitive reframing technique where the insomniac, instead {{of attempting to}} fall asleep at night, makes every effort to stay awake (i.e. essentially stops trying to fall asleep). One theory that may explain {{the effectiveness of this}} method is that by not voluntarily making oneself go to sleep, it relieves the performance <b>anxiety</b> <b>that</b> arises from the need or requirement to fall asleep, which is meant to be a passive act. This technique has been shown to reduce sleep effort and performance anxiety and also lower subjective assessment of sleep-onset latency and overestimation of the sleep deficit (a quality found in many insomniacs).|$|E
25|$|Contrasting {{research}} {{finds that}} strategies to regulate and control emotions, {{in order to}} enhance resilience, allows for better outcomes in the event of mental illness. While initial studies of resilience originated with developmental scientists studying children in high-risk environments, a study on 230 adults diagnosed with depression and <b>anxiety</b> <b>that</b> emphasized emotional regulation, showed that it contributed to resilience in patients. These strategies focused on planning, positively reappraising events, and reducing rumination helped in maintaining a healthy continuity. Patients with improved resilience were found to yield better treatment outcomes than patients with non-resilience focused treatment plans, providing potential information for supporting evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions that may better handle mental disorders by focusing on the aspect of psychological resilience.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no {{complete}} cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the <b>anxiety</b> <b>that</b> is often elicited {{as a result of}} stuttering, and consequently exacerbates stuttering symptoms. This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life. Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably {{feel they have}} to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the <b>anxiety</b> <b>that</b> stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled {{to follow through with}} them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E
25|$|Contextual {{factors that}} are thought to {{contribute}} to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and <b>anxiety.</b> <b>That</b> is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, {{with higher levels of}} anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.|$|E
25|$|In November 1657 Henry {{himself was}} made lord-deputy; but before {{this time he}} had refused a gift of {{property}} worth £1500 a year, basing his refusal {{on the grounds of}} the poverty of the country, a poverty which was not the least of his troubles.

25|$|In The Concept of Anxiety, Haufniensis {{focuses on}} the first anxiety {{experienced}} by man: Adam's choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts {{of good and evil}} did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed original sin, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety {{comes from the fact that}} God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is <b>anxiety</b> <b>that</b> leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.|$|E
25|$|Some {{effects may}} include a general {{alteration}} of conscious perception, euphoria, feelings of well-being, relaxation or stress reduction, increased {{appreciation of the}} arts, including humor and music (especially discerning its various components/instruments), joviality, metacognition and introspection, enhanced recollection (episodic memory), increased sensuality, increased awareness of sensation, increased libido, and creativity. Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical. Anxiety is the most commonly reported side effect of smoking marijuana. Between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis, however, some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time. Inexperience and use in an unfamiliar environment are major contributing factors to this anxiety. Cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts, {{has been shown to}} ameliorate the adverse effects of THC, including <b>anxiety,</b> <b>that</b> some consumers experience.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 the Reading Works' {{work force}} stood at 2,450 {{including}} AT Microelectronics and Bell Labs as {{it made the}} transition from AT into Lucent Technologies.
