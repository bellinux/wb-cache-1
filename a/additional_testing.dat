5|$|Although the VB-13 {{project had}} not reached the testing stage {{by the end}} of World War II, it avoided being cancelled, {{proceeding}} as a low-priority project. Limited testing was conducted during 1948 and 1949; <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> at Alamogordo, New Mexico in 1950 led to the Tarzon being approved for operational service in the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|Following the Monaco Grand Prix on 4 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 6–8 June {{to prepare for}} the Canadian Grand Prix. Barrichello set the first day's fastest times, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Testing was halted when Nick Heidfeld and Luciano Burti both experienced engine and electronic failures respectively. Häkkinen was fastest on the second day. BAR's Ricardo Zonta lost control of his car and crashed into the barriers at the Parabolica corner, limiting his testing time as repairs were made to his car. Jenson Button for Williams was quickest on the third day. Ferrari undertook <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> at their private facility, the Fiorano Circuit, with their test driver Luca Badoer who performed practice pit stops and starts, utilising different car set-ups, testing new car components and ran on an artificially wet track.|$|E

5|$|The {{first six}} {{production}} aircraft were {{delivered to the}} 6th Fighter Regiment of the VVKJ, based at Zemun, in early 1939. The pilots subjected them to considerable <b>additional</b> <b>testing,</b> before they entered normal service around mid-year. The remaining six entered service during the remainder of 1939. The aircraft were delivered without radios or armament, which were fitted in VVKJ workshops. In October 1939, the IK-2s were transferred to the 4th Fighter Regiment in Zagreb until licence-built Hawker Hurricanes were delivered from Zemun, after which the IK-2s were {{to be transferred to}} the 5th Fighter Regiment in Niš. By the end of 1940, all the production IK-2s were concentrated in the 107th Fighter Squadron of the 34th Fighter Group, which consisted solely of IK-2s. This was only an interim allocation, as the other squadron of the group was equipped with Hurricanes, {{and as soon as the}} 107th Fighter Squadron could be equipped with Hurricanes, the IK-2s were to move to the 5th Fighter Regiment. The threat of war overtook this planned deployment, and on 13 March 1941, the IK-2s of the 107th Fighter Squadron were moved to Bosanski Aleksandrovac near Banja Luka, under the command of Kapetan Zarko Vukajlović.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, the United States {{began to}} suspect that SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories and several other medical {{laboratories}} in the United States had adopted a scheme {{that allowed them to}} bill the federal government for unauthorized and unnecessary laboratory tests. The laboratories had “bundled” a standard grouping of blood <b>tests</b> with some <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> and had then marketed this grouping to doctors by leading them to believe that the <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> would not increase costs to Medicare and other government-sponsored health programs. After the ordering of tests, the laboratories “unbundled” the <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> from the standard grouping for purposes of billing. In many cases, treating physicians had made no determination that the <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> were medically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of patients;  rather the physicians had preferred to order the tests solely because they were sold as a package with other tests that they had deemed necessary. As a result, the laboratories submitted bills-and received payment-for tests that were medically unnecessary.|$|R

25|$|After each stage, four riders are tested: {{the overall}} leader, the stage winner, and two riders at random. In addition, every rider is tested {{before the first}} day's stage, {{normally}} a short time-trial. Most teams are tested in their entirety {{at some point during}} the three-week race. <b>Additional</b> <b>testing</b> may take place during the off-season, and riders are expected to keep their national cycling federation informed of their whereabouts so they can be located.|$|E
30|$|A {{recently}} developed novel technique utilizes a high throughput analysis of body composition characteristics (body morphomics analysis) to assess patient frailty. This innovative CT-based approach offers convenience for the patients and limits <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> as most patients with cancer undergo routine imaging with CT {{before and after}} chemoradiation. Furthermore, body morphomics offers significant cost saving implications by reducing <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> and supports patient-centered individualized cancer care planning.|$|R

25|$|Also in the U.S., {{problems}} {{arose in}} trailers again provided by FEMA to residents {{displaced by the}} Iowa floods of 2008. Several months after moving to the trailers, occupants reported violent coughing, headaches, as well as asthma, bronchitis, and other problems. Tests showed that in some trailers, levels of formaldehyde exceeded the limits recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and American Lung Association. The associated publicity has resulted in <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> to begin in November.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to treat is usually made after {{a combination of}} physical exam and laboratory diagnosis, with <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> including audiometry, tympanogram, temporal bone CT and MRI. Decongestants, glucocorticoids, and topical antibiotics are generally not effective as treatment for non-infectious, or serous, causes of mastoid effusion. In less severe cases or those without significant hearing impairment, the effusion can resolve spontaneously or with more conservative measures such as autoinflation. In more severe cases, tympanostomy tubes can be inserted, possibly with adjuvant adenoidectomy.|$|E
25|$|Escort fighter version. The F-82E {{followed}} the F-82B, which it so closely resembled. They were equipped with two counter-rotating Allison liquid-cooled engines, V-1710-143 and V-1710-145. The first four F-82Es were redesignated as F-82As and were allocated for engine testing. After production delays by engine problems and <b>additional</b> <b>testing,</b> F-82Es entered operational service in May 1948. The Air Force accepted 72 F-82Es {{in fiscal year}} 1948 (between January and June 1948), and 24 in fiscal year 1949 (22 in July 1948, one in October, and one in December).|$|E

25|$|In late September it was {{announced}} that several Tour de France riders were to have their blood samples retested for traces of EPO. Pierre Bordry, the head of AFLD, claimed the testing involved riders who were already under scrutiny for suspicious urine samples. AFLD had suspicion that there was MIRCERA in some samples but the laboratory could not say definitively. The urine tests were somewhat unreliable at giving definitive results, so the AFLD decided to order the blood samples taken before and during the Tour for <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> with a newly developed CERA blood test.|$|E
25|$|While {{visual field}} and acuity test results {{combined}} with retinal imagery support {{the diagnosis of}} Retinitis Pigmentosa, <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> is necessary to confirm other pathological features of this disease. Electroretinography (ERG) confirms the RP diagnosis by evaluating functional aspects associated with photoreceptor degeneration, and can detect physiological abnormalities before the initial manifestation of symptoms. An electrode lens {{is applied to the}} eye as photoreceptor response to varying degrees of quick light pulses is measured. Patients exhibiting the Retinitis Pigmentosa phenotype would show decreased or delayed electrical response in the rod photoreceptors, as well as possibly compromised cone photoreceptor cell response.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} have expressed concerns about growing costs and schedule delays for the Webb telescope, which competes for scant astronomy budgets and thus threatens funding for other space science programs. A review of NASA budget records and status reports {{noted that the}} JWST is plagued {{by many of the}} same problems that have affected other major NASA projects. Repairs and <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> included underestimates of the telescope's cost that failed to budget for expected technical glitches, missed budget projections, and evaluation of components to estimate extreme launch conditions, thus extending the schedule and increasing costs further.|$|E

40|$|Some authors {{recommend}} {{the use of}} an <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> for detecting increases in the spread, when using a control chart for individual observations. We examine this recommendation both in a practical situation and theoretically. Both studies show that the <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> gives somewhat more power for detecting a 25 % increase of the process variation. For nearly all other deviations from the in-control state the test is more likely to cause confusion. From a practical viewpoint we therefore advise against its use. ...|$|R
