50|$|For frozen carbonated {{beverage}} manufacturing, {{a mixture of}} flavored syrup, carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and filtered water are used. Typically, the initial temperature of the mixture is 12-18 °C. The carbonated mixture is fed into the evaporator of the apparatus, then freezes on the inner surface of the cylindrical evaporator and is scraped off by the blades—mixers rotating at 60 to 200 rpm. In the internal volume of the crystallizer, a slight positive pressure (up to 3 bar) is maintained to improve the dissolution of gas into the liquid. In modern frozen {{carbonated beverage}} devices, there is a conventional refrigeration circuit with a capillary tube or thermostatic expansion valve and, usually, an <b>air</b> <b>condenser.</b> Refrigerant is fed either directly into the cavity of a two-wall evaporator or into the spiral evaporator wound on the outer surface of the crystallizer. The evaporator wall is made of stainless steel grade SS316L, approved for contact with food according to requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration. The evaporator temperature is −32 to −20 °C. Manufacturers do not reveal the hourly capacity of frozen carbonated beverages machines, but the energy expenditure to produce 10.0 kg of frozen carbonated beverages can be 1.5-2.0 kWh.|$|E

In succession to the adapter, two cold traps are placed, thefirst cooled at −75 °C, and the second at liquid nitrogen temperature.The main vessel is charged with NaHCO3 (1.5 g) and Na2H2EDTA (0.5 g) dissolved in 15 mL of bidistilled water, and cooled at 2-5 °C. To this20 g (0.179 mol) of 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanone is added, andmechanical stirring is initiated.

40|$|In {{power plant}} {{locations}} with adequate supply of cooling water the steam from the steam turbine is condensed {{in a water}} cooled condenser. In most instances circulating water from the cooling tower is used to condense the turbine exhaust steam. In other instances once through cooling is deployed wherein water from a lake, river or sea is used to condense the turbine exhaust steam. In water challenged locations or locations where wet cooling cannot be deployed due to permitting or regulatory issues, the steam from the steam turbine is <b>condensed</b> in an <b>air</b> cooled <b>condenser</b> (ACC) wherein ambient air is used to cool and condense the turbine exhaust steam. In a combined cycle plant, during normal operation, the water or <b>air</b> cooled <b>condenser</b> condenses the turbine exhaust steam. During bypass operation, when the steam turbine is out of service, the high-pressure steam from the HRSG is attemperated in a pressure reducing/desuperheating (PRD) valve and then admitted into the water cooled or <b>air</b> cooled <b>condenser.</b> The bypass steam flow is substantially higher than the design turbine exhaust steam flow and the duration of bypass operation can vary from {{a few hours to}} several weeks.
