40|$|Occasionally certain {{tasks in}} an {{assembly}} line balancing problem are required to be kept together due to some specific reasons. These tasks <b>are</b> <b>attained</b> <b>to</b> the same work stations. Such problems are called as 'Assembly Line Balancing Problem with Task Related Constraints (ALBTRC) '. Certain situations like awkward product construction, simultaneous operations or specific requirements leading to zoning and positional constraints like utilization of common resources as tools, jigs and fixtures are implemented thanks to these supplementary constraints. Additionally, materials handling and tooling costs, distances, set-up and lead times are also reduced. Literature on ALBTRC seems quite rare compared to Classical Line Balancing papers, although ALBTRC {{is one of the}} common real life balancing problems. This study aimed to develop and implement a novel line balancing method for a manufacturing concern where known methods are impractical to employ due to some specific positional constraints. 'Largest Candidate Method' known as a simple but effective tool is modified for this purpose first. Then a thorough 'method and time study' is conducted to get the necessary data to utilize that method. As a result, more efficient alternatives are generated and presented to decision maker...|$|E

Prior {{research has demonstrated that}} obsessive passion typically brings several negative consequences. The present study nuances the picture by showing that there are indeed conditions when obsessive passion can be beneficial and that it has an important role for project management. It develops and tests hypotheses on the role of project leaders' obsessive passion for project goals. Results support that challenging goals <b>are</b> <b>attained</b> <b>to</b> a greater extent if the project leader scores high on obsessive passion. Such obsessive passion, in turn, {{is a result of the}} project leader's competence (positive relationship) and the team's competence (inverted U-shaped relationship). These results have important implications for theory and future research on passion, goal theory, and competence in projects.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a generic error {{resilient}} video coding (ERVC) scheme using embedded Wyner–Ziv (WZ) description. At the encoder side, a joint source-channel R-D optimized mode selection (JSC-RDO-MS) algorithm with WZ-coded anchor frames is statistically studied and developed. Given a stationary first-order Markov Gaussian source, the proposed mode optimization is justified by {{an analysis of}} the RD impact on the WZ bit-rate. JSC-RDO-MS involves in the estimation of expected rate and distortion of WZ coding with the unavailable side information, and the WZ bit-rate of each coding mode is determined based on the error correction capability of the specific WZ codec. At the decoder side, an online correlation noise model between the source and the side-information is proposed with a mixture of Laplacians whose parameters <b>are</b> <b>attained</b> <b>to</b> reflect the coherence of the motion field of successive frames and the energy of prediction residual. Each mixture component represents the statistical distribution of prediction residuals, and the mixing coefficients represent the amount of errors in motion compensation. The proposed scheme achieves the so-called classification gain by exploiting the spatially non-stationary characteristics of the motion field and texture. Extensive ex-perimental results show that the proposed WZ-ERVC scheme achieves a better overall RD performance than existing ERVC schemes, and the proposed modeling algorithm also significantly outperforms the conventional Laplacian model by up to 2 dB.

40|$|Decision {{support systems}} are {{a class of}} {{computer}} based systems that assist in some or all levels of decision making within an organisation. Recently, the growth of data captured that is useful or even critical to the successful running or conclusion of projects in science and industry has been remarkable. Thus, the development of decision support systems that are scalable {{in terms of the}} size of data processed. the number of stakeholders, and their geographical span has become of the essence. This thesis identifies the issues in developing distributed decision support systems. Building on that. an architectural style for the development of scalable and extensible software systems is introduced. Subsequently, a framework for the design of distributed decision support systems is developed. This new architectural style is the Resource Oriented Services Architecture (ROSA). It builds on Representational State Transfer (REST), an architectural style that describes the venerable design of the world wide web. An architectural design based on REST revolves around resources, representations, and hyperlinks. it lacks is a standardised way to represent computations as resources in a scalable and extensible manner. For systems that cannot be adequately described as a web of documents, this is a shortcoming. ROSA overcomes this by defining a means of representing executable resources {{in a manner that is}} consistent with the statelessness and cacheability constraints of REST. The resulting architecture enables the scalability of the system. Additionally, desirable features such as dynamic discovery of resources and extensibility and loose coupling <b>are</b> <b>attained.</b> <b>To</b> illustrate this framework, two new learning algorithms are introduced and implemented as services. The first is a data structure suitable for proximity queries over large datasets of low intrinsic dimension. The other uses a random projection to carry out novelty detection over high dimensional datasets. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The active components of the RNAi are 21 nucleotides long dsRNAs containing a 2 nucleotide overhang at the 3 end, carrying 5 -phosphate and 3 -hydroxyl groups (siRNAs). Structural analysis revealed that the siRNA is functionally bound at both ends to RISC. Terminal modifications are considered with interest as the introduction of chemical moieties interferes with the 3 overhang recognition by the PAZ domain and the 5 -phosphate recognition by the MID and PIWI domains of RISC. Herein, we report the synthesis of modified siRNAs containing terminal amide linkages by introducing hydroxyethylglycine PNA (hegPNA) moieties at 5, and at 3 positions and on both terminals.
