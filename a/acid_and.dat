5|$|Ibotenic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> {{muscimol}} are structurally {{related to}} each other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> GABA respectively. Ibotenic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E

40|$|A direct, sensitive, {{simple and}} {{practical}} method for simultaneous determination of amino <b>acids</b> <b>and</b> carbohydrates by anion-exchange chromatography with integrated pulsed amperometric detection was developed. The retention behavior of amino <b>acids</b> <b>and</b> carbohydrates on the anion-exchange column and {{the detection of}} amino <b>acids</b> <b>and</b> carbohydrates at different integrated pulsed amperometric detection waveforms were investigated. The optimized gradient eluent conditions for analysis of 17 amino <b>acids</b> <b>and</b> nine carbohydrates were obtained. Separation time was 100 min. Detection limits for amino <b>acids</b> <b>and</b> carbohydrates were 5. 2 - 207. 1 nM under injection volume of 25 mul. The RSDs of peak area were 1. 2 - 3. 3 %. The calibration graphs of peak area for the analytes were linear over about three orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9950 - 0. 9999.

5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic <b>acid,</b> <b>and</b> acetic <b>acid)</b> <b>and</b> the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells.
