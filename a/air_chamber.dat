5|$|Jauréguiberry {{was ordered}} on 8 April 1891 and laid down that November at Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne-sur-Mer. She was {{launched}} on 27 October 1893 and was complete enough to begin her trials on 30 January 1896. A tube {{in one of}} her boilers burst on 10 June during a 24-hour engine trial, killing six and wounding three. Two months later she suffered an accident during firing trials of her main armament. She was finally commissioned on 16 February 1897, although the explosion of a torpedo's <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> on 30 March delayed her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet until 17 May.|$|E
5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Copa Libertadores is the Total 90 Ascente Libertadores, {{manufactured}} by Nike. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> improves acceleration.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1902 the <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> {{of another}} torpedo exploded, killing one sailor and {{wounding}} three. In September she transported the Minister of the Navy to Bizerte. Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to}} the Northern Squadron in 1904 and arrived at Brest on 25 March. She was lightly damaged when she touched a rock while entering Brest in fog on 18 July and in another incident her steering compartment was flooded when a torpedo air flask burst between her screws during a torpedo-launching exercise on 18 May 1905. While visiting Portsmouth on 14 August Jauréguiberry ran aground for a short time in the outer harbour. She returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1907 where she was assigned to the Reserve Division, and the following year was reassigned to the Third Division. In 1909 the 3rd and 4th Divisions were reformed into the 2nd Independent Squadron and transferred to the Atlantic in 1910. Beginning on 29 September 1910 her boiler tubes were renewed at Cherbourg. In October 1912 the Squadron was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and a year later, in October 1913, Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to the}} Training Division of which she became the flagship in April 1914.|$|E

5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Recopa Sudamericana, {{manufactured}} by Nike, is named the Total 90 Omni CSF. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> improves acceleration. Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
25|$|Milk is {{extracted}} from the cow's udder by flexible rubber sheaths known as liners or inflations that are surrounded by a rigid <b>air</b> <b>chamber.</b> A pulsating flow of ambient air and vacuum {{is applied to the}} inflation's <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> during the milking process. When ambient air is allowed to enter the chamber, the vacuum inside the inflation causes the inflation to collapse around the cow's teat, squeezing the milk out of teat in a similar fashion as a baby calf's mouth massaging the teat. When the vacuum is reapplied in the chamber the flexible rubber inflation relaxes and opens up, preparing for the next squeezing cycle.|$|E
25|$|Today these <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> vests are {{commonly}} referred to as 'inflatable life jackets or vests' and are available not only for commercial applications but also for those engaged in recreational boating, fishing, sailing, kayaking and canoeing.

40|$|A {{self-leveling}} load {{table is}} described which is automatically maintained level by selectively {{opening and closing}} solenoid valves for inserting and removing <b>air</b> from <b>chambers</b> under the table. The table is floated in a fluid by nine <b>air</b> <b>chambers</b> beneath {{the top of the}} table. These chambers are open at the bottom and four oppositely located chambers are used for leveling the table by having the air increased or decreased by means of a flexible hose. Air bearing pendulums are used for selectively energizing solenoid valves which either apply pressurized <b>air</b> to the <b>chamber</b> or evacuate <b>air</b> from the <b>chamber</b> by means of a vacuum source...|$|R
50|$|Air {{mattresses}} use {{one or more}} <b>air</b> <b>chambers</b> {{instead of}} springs to provide support. Quality and price can range from inexpensive ones used occasionally for camping, to high-end luxury beds. Air mattresses designed for typical bedroom use cost {{about the same as}} inner-spring mattresses with comparable features. Air bladder construction varies from a simple polyethylene bag to internally baffled, multiple chambers of latex (vulcanized rubber) or vinyl with bonded cotton exteriors. Mattresses may have a layer of foam above the <b>air</b> <b>chambers</b> for added cushioning, and may be enclosed in a cover. Some such beds are termed soft-sided air beds.|$|R
25|$|Short pasta pieces {{fall on the}} shaker {{conveyor}} and powerful hot air is blown to them immediately after the extrusion. This reduces the moisture content by 5% and prevents the pieces from sticking and flattening. Shaker then carries the product through tiers with dry hot air and buckets collect the pasta and spread them on the upper tier of the multi-tier drying unit. This unit has four areas which periods of intense moisture extraction alternately followed by periods of rest occur at eight drying/stabilizing cycle in total. Process ends in cold <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> for stabilizing.|$|E
25|$|The {{breakdown}} of dioxin requires {{exposure of the}} molecular ring to a sufficiently high temperature so as to trigger thermal {{breakdown of}} the strong molecular bonds holding it together. Small pieces of fly ash may be somewhat thick, and too brief an exposure to high temperature may only degrade dioxin {{on the surface of}} the ash. For a large volume <b>air</b> <b>chamber,</b> too brief an exposure may also result in only some of the exhaust gases reaching the full breakdown temperature. For this reason there is also a time element to the temperature exposure to ensure heating completely through the thickness of the fly ash and the volume of waste gases.|$|E
25|$|While Leonardo {{was working}} in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early diving suit, {{to be used in}} the {{destruction}} of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> when submerged.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the design}} of a varnish plant at Crocodile Matchet Limited, Tema, Ghana was {{considered}} and modification made to eliminate blooming and rusting of its product at the final processing plant when there is high moisture content in the atmosphere. The proposed design included pipelines or ductsand hot <b>air</b> receiving <b>chambers</b> for the Varnish Plant. Heat from the exhaust gas which would have otherwise, gone wasted, was utilised by redesigning the varnish plant and this yielded 6. 74 kW of heat energy which was transferred into the <b>air</b> <b>chambers</b> to aid the drying ofmatchets at the hardening plant. Consequently, the absorption of the moisture on the steel and the dryness of the product were improved. Further studies were done to ensure constant supply of hot air into the <b>air</b> <b>chambers...</b>|$|R

25|$|Full-term chicks of most {{bird species}} {{have a small}} sharp, calcified {{projection}} on their beak, which they use to chip {{their way out of}} their egg. Commonly known as an egg tooth, this white spike is generally near the tip of the upper mandible, though some species have one near the tip of their lower mandible instead, and a few species have one on each mandible. Despite its name, the projection is not an actual tooth, as the similarly-named projections of some reptiles are; instead, {{it is part of the}} integumentary system, as are claws and scales. The hatching chick first uses its egg tooth to break the membrane around an <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> at the wide end of the egg. Then it pecks at the eggshell while turning slowly within the egg, eventually (over a period of hours or days) creating a series of small circular fractures in the shell. Once it has breached the egg's surface, the chick continues to chip at it until it has made a large hole. The weakened egg eventually shatters under the pressure of the bird's movements. The egg tooth is so critical to a successful escape from the egg that chicks of most species will perish unhatched if they fail to develop one. However, there are a few species which do not have egg teeth. Megapode chicks have an egg tooth while still in the egg but lose it before hatching, while kiwi chicks never develop one; chicks of both families escape their eggs by kicking their way out. Most chicks lose their egg teeth within a few days of hatching, though petrels keep theirs for nearly three weeks and marbled murrelets have theirs for up to a month. Generally, the egg tooth drops off, though in songbirds it is reabsorbed.|$|E
500|$|Hines {{discovered}} {{a way to}} escape from the Ohio Penitentiary. He had been reading the novel Les Misérables and was said to be inspired by Jean Valjean and Valjean's escapes through the passages underneath Paris, France. Hines noticed how dry the lower prison cells felt and how they were lacking in mold, even though sunlight never shined there. This caused him to believe that escape by tunneling down was possible. [...] After discovering an <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> underneath them, which he had deduced, Hines begun the tunneling effort. The tunnel was only eighteen inches wide, which was just large enough for him to enter the four foot by four foot <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> that was surrounded by heavy masonry. As Hines and the six others who accompanied Hines and John Hunt Morgan worked on the tunnel, a thin crust of dirt was used to hide the tunneling from the prison officials. They tunneled for six weeks, with the tunnel's exit coming between the inner and the [...] outer prison walls, near a coal pile. On the day of escape, November 26, 1863, Morgan switched cells with his brother, Colonel Richard Morgan. The day was chosen as a new Union military commander was coming to Columbus, and Morgan knew that the prison cells would be inspected at that time. Together, after the daily midnight inspection, Hines, John Hunt Morgan and five captains under Morgan's command used the tunnel to escape. Aided {{by the fact that the}} prison sentries sought shelter from the raging storm occurring at the time, the Confederate officers climbed the [...] wall effortlessly, using metal hooks to effect their escape.|$|E

2500|$|The Native American flute is {{the only}} flute in the world {{constructed}} with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes.

There is a hole {{at the bottom of the}} [...] "slow" [...] <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or [...] "bird") with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or [...] "window"). Some more modern flutes use an undercut either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "traditional" [...] Native American flute was {{constructed}} using measurements {{based on the}} body - {{the length of the}} flute would be the distance from armpit to wrist, the length of the top <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> would be one fist-width, the distance from the whistle to the first hole also a fist-width, the distance between holes would be one thumb-width, and the distance from the last hole to the end would generally be one fist-width. Unlike Western music, traditional American Indian music had no standard pitch reference such as A440, so flutes were not standardized for pitch.|$|E

2500|$|The air {{chambers}} {{are always}} located over the breast, across {{the shoulders and}} encircle {{the back of the}} head. They may be inflated by either self-contained carbon dioxide cartridges activated by pulling a cord, or blow tubes with a one-way valve for inflation by exhalation. Some inflatable life jackets also react with salt or fresh water, which causes them to self-inflate. The latest generation of self-triggering inflation devices responds to water pressure when submerged and incorporates an actuator known as a 'hydrostatic release'.
