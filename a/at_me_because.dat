500|$|Actor John Noble {{called the}} {{beginning}} scene with Olivia and Walter naked [...] "the funniest thing" [...] yet, explaining [...] "The writers keep throwing challenges <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I never say no. They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adele {{performed}} [...] "Someone like You" [...] for {{the first}} time in November 2010 on the BBC music show. Later, with Jools Holland before the release of the album. As the performance finished, there was a notable stunned silence from the audience, before bursting into applause. Adele has since described this performance as a career defining moment. [...] Later, she performed the song at the 2011 BRIT Awards held at The O2 Arena in London on 15 February 2011. She appeared on stage backed just by her pianist while [...] "special effects were limited to a shower of glitter and Adele's own tears, as she almost broke down delivering her lovelorn plea to an ex-boyfriend" [...] as stated by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph. Speaking on the ITV2 after show, Adele explained why she had cried at the end of the performance saying, [...] "I was really emotional by the end because I'm quite overwhelmed by everything anyway, and then I had a vision of my ex, of him watching me at home and he's going to be laughing <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> he knows I'm crying because of him, with him thinking, 'Yep, she's still wrapped around my finger'. Then everyone stood up, so I was overwhelmed." [...] A writer of Daily Mirror said that [...] "Adele stole the show [...] with her praised performance of Someone Like You." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph chose the song as a highlight on the show saying that Adele knocked [...] "everyone for six with no bells and whistles, just a piano, her gorgeous voice and a monster song, Someone Like You." [...] Later, the song was performed during a VH1 special called [...] "Unplugged". Adele also performed the song at Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 24 February 2011. The same day she performed [...] "Someone like You" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.|$|E

2500|$|The band's {{name was}} {{originally}} {{based on a}} misunderstanding. Employees at the Planet Roc recording studios in Berlin repeatedly addressed notes for them to [...] "Jennifer Rostock".

[...] This working title was eventually embraced by the band and became their official name.|$|R

Who could have thought of a man laying his plots so deeply,--arranging for twenty years past the frauds which he has now executed? For thirty years, or nearly, his mind has been busy on these schemes, and on others, no doubt, which he has not thought it necessary to execute, and has used me in them simply as a machine. It is impossible that I should forgive him." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Fall Dog Bombs the Moon" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} David Bowie in 2003 for his album Reality. According to Bowie himself {{at the time of}} the album release, [...] "It came from reading an article about Kellogg Brown & Root, a {{subsidiary}} of Halliburton, the company that Dick Cheney used to run. Basically, Kellogg Brown & Root got the job of cleaning up Iraq. What tends to happen is that a thing like an issue or a policy manifests itself as a guide. It becomes a character of some kind, like the one in Fall Dog. There's this guy saying, 'I'm goddamn rich'. You know, 'Throw anything you like <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> baby, <b>because</b> I'm goddamn rich. It doesn't bother me.' It's an ugly song sung by an ugly man. So it was definitely about corporate and military power." ...|$|R

500|$|... "I {{just wanted}} to create and do {{something}} different and branch out. At {{the heart of it}} I know it's still Evanescence and it's still me, but structurally it's a lot more fun. We went {{a lot of different ways}} with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. <b>At</b> least for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|R
