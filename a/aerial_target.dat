The Wright Air Development Center requested the designation XQ-11 for the target design; the request was denied due to the early stage of development, and the F-108 program was cancelled before further work was undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesian {{air traffic}} was not seriously {{threatened}} until about 1977, {{in the latter}} stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an <b>aerial</b> <b>target.</b> The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the Strela-2 shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile launcher, supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s {{as part of the}} Warsaw Pact's materiel support. By September 1978, there had been 20reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War.|$|E

25|$|The 53 WG is {{headquartered}} at Eglin {{and serves}} as the Air Force’s focal point for operational test and evaluation of armament and avionics, aircrew training devices, chemical defense, aerial reconnaissance improvements, electronic warfare systems, and {{is responsible for the}} QF-4 Phantom II Full Scale <b>Aerial</b> <b>Target</b> (FSAT) program and subscale drone programs (located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida). The wing tests every fighter, bomber, unmanned aerial vehicle, and associated weapon system in the Air Force inventory. The wing reports to the USAF Air Warfare Center at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, a Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) to Headquarters, Air Combat Command (ACC).|$|E
25|$|Between 1 June 1983 and 1 August 1988 the Delta Darts were {{incrementally}} {{retired and}} sent to the Military Storage and Disposition Center in Arizona. When the need for a high performance Full Scaled <b>Aerial</b> <b>Target</b> Drone was required the USAF began withdrawing Delta Darts from storage. Starting in 1986, 194 of the surviving surplus aircraft were converted into target drones and these were designated QF-106As and used for target practice vehicles under the Pacer Six Program by the Aerial Targets Squadron. The last was destroyed in January 1998. The drones were still capable of being flown as manned aircraft, such as for ferrying to a test; during the test they were flown unmanned. The QF-106 replaced the QF-100 Super Sabre drone; the last shoot down of a QF-106 (57-2524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997 after which the QF-106 was superseded by the QF-4S and QF-4E Phantom II drone.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, ADCOM {{began the}} phaseout of the F-101 and F-102 interceptors from active duty units, with both types mostly being {{transferred}} to the Air National Guard. The F-101 would remain in a limited role on active duty until 1982, serving in such roles as towed target carrier aircraft and simulated enemy radar contacts for Airborne Weapons Controller students training for duties aboard the E-3 Sentry AWACS. The F-102 would see service until the mid-1980s as the PQM-102 <b>aerial</b> <b>target</b> drone. The F-106 Delta Dart, considered by many the finest all-weather interceptor ever built, was the primary air defense interceptor aircraft for the US Air Force during the 1970s and early 1980s. It was also the last dedicated interceptor in U.S. Air Force service to date. It was gradually retired during the 1980s, though the QF-106 drone conversions of the aircraft were used until 1998 as aerial targets under the FSAT program.|$|E
500|$|The /54 cal gun turrets {{were similar}} to the /38 cal gun mounts in that they were equally adept in an {{anti-aircraft}} role and for damaging smaller ships, but differed in that they weighed more, fired heavier rounds of ammunition, and resulted in faster crew fatigue than the /38 cal guns. The ammunition storage for the /54 cal gun was 500 rounds per turret, and the guns could fire at targets nearly [...] away at a 45° angle. At an 85° angle, the guns could hit an <b>aerial</b> <b>target</b> at over [...]|$|E
500|$|The Su-35 {{employs the}} {{powerful}} N035 Irbis-E ("Snow Leopard") passive electronically-scanned array (PESA) radar, {{which is a}} further development of the N011M radar that had been evaluated on Su-27M test-beds and constitutes {{the core of the}} Su-35's weapons-control system. It is capable of detecting an <b>aerial</b> <b>target</b> up to [...] away, and can track thirty airborne targets and engage eight of them simultaneously; in addition, the multi-function radar is capable of providing high-resolution images of the ground using synthetic aperture mode. The aircraft is equipped with an OLS-35 optoelectronic targeting system ahead of the cockpit to provide other forms of tracking including infra-red search and track. For defences against enemy tracking, the Su-35 is equipped with the L175M Khibiny-M electronic countermeasure system, while engineers have applied radar-absorbent materials to the engine inlets and front stages of the engine compressor to halve the Su-35's frontal radar cross-section and minimise the detection range of enemy radars. The multi-role Su-35 can deploy air-to-air missiles of up to [...] range, and can carry the heavy Oniks anti-ship cruise missile, as well as the multitude of air-to-ground weaponry.|$|E

500|$|Like the Navy, the Air Force has {{operated}} QF-4 target drones, serving with the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. It {{was expected that}} the F-4 would remain in the target role with the 82d ATRS until at least 2015, when they would be replaced by early versions of the F-16 Fighting Falcon converted to a QF-16 configuration. Several QF-4s also retain capability as manned aircraft and are maintained in historical color schemes, being displayed as part of Air Combat Command's Heritage Flight at air shows, base open houses, and other events while serving as non-expendable target aircraft during the week. On 19 November 2013, BAE Systems delivered the last QF-4 <b>aerial</b> <b>target</b> to the Air Force. The example had been in storage for over 20 years before being converted. Over 16 years, BAE had converted 314 F-4 and RF-4 Phantom IIs into QF-4s and QRF-4s, with each aircraft taking six months to adapt. As of December 2013, QF-4 and QRF-4 aircraft had flown over 16,000 manned and 600 unmanned training sorties, with 250 unmanned aircraft being shot down in firing exercises. The remaining QF-4s and QRF-4s held their training role until the first of 126 QF-16s were delivered by Boeing. The final flight of an Air Force QF-4 from Tyndall AFB took place on 27 May 2015 to Holloman AFB. After Tyndall AFB ceased operations, the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group at Holloman became the fleet of 22 QF-4s' last remaining operator. [...] The base continued using them to fly manned test and unmanned live fire test support and Foreign Military Sales testing, with the final unmanned flight taking place in August 2016. The type was officially retired from US military service with a four ship flight at Holloman during an event on December 21, 2016. In January 2017, the remaining airframes were to be demilitarized.|$|E
