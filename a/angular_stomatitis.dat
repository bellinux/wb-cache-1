500|$|An aphtha (plural aphthae) is a non {{specific}} term {{that refers to}} an ulcer of the mouth. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek word aphtha meaning [...] "eruption" [...] or [...] "ulcer". The lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as aphthae, including Bednar's aphthae (infected, traumatic ulcers on the hard palate in infants), oral candidiasis, and foot-and-mouth disease. When used without qualification, aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Since the word aphtha is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer, {{it has been suggested that}} the term [...] "aphthous ulcer" [...] is redundant, but it remains in common use. Stomatitis is also a non-specific term referring to any inflammatory process in the mouth, with or without oral ulceration. It may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Acareful {{evaluation}} of the clinical fea-tures of an oral mucosal lesion is important in directing further investiga-tion, such as biopsy, culture and serologi-cal testing. The various individual components of the oropharynx should be examined sequentially with the patient facing a good natural source of light. This is important when looking for cyanosis, pallor and excessive redness of the lips, gums, tongue and the buccal mucosa. Angular cheilitis <b>Angular</b> cheilitis or <b>stomatitis</b> is an acute inflammation of the lips with painful fissur-ing and scaling at the angles of the mouth (Figure 1) which are usually the result of physical damage to the lips by sunlight, cold wind or ill-fitting dentures. In such cases the skin and mucosa {{at the corners of}} the mouth becomes macerated due to dribbling saliva, causing fissuring of the angles of the mouth. A deficiency of the Vitamin B complex, especially of riboflavin, also can be respon-sible for such presentations. 1 Sometimes, angular cheilosis is complicated by a monil-ial infection. Most patients need correction of the mal-occlusion, which is frequently not feasible. Local 1 % hydrocortisone, in combination with a topical anti-yeast preparation, is rec-ommended. In some cases, an oral vitamin B complex, especially riboflavin, is helpful...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare oral signs, {{symptoms}} and oral lesions type and prevalence, in end stage renal disease (ESRD) with non-end stage renal disease (NESRD) in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Methodology: Two groups of DM patients were studied, Group 1 includes 100 patients with ESRD, who were under hemodialysis therapy, and Group 2 includes 100 patients with NESRD whose serum creatinine level is < 2. 0 mg/dl. The DM status and other laboratory investigations were recorded, with the patients consent and thorough oral examination was performed and the findings were recorded. All the data were entered into Microsoft Excel sheets. Statistical analysis including Pearson's correlation analysis, Chi-square test, and t-test were done using SPSS software SYSTAT version 7. 0. Results: On thorough clinical examination, the prevalence of oral lesions was found to be higher in ESRD patients. The most common lesions such as saburral tongue (P ≤ 0. 002), petechiae/ecchymoses (P ≤ 0. 000), pale mucosa (P ≤ 0. 000), stomatitis medicamentosa (P ≤ 0. 043) fissured tongue, smooth tongue, candidiasis, dry and fissured lips, <b>angular</b> cheilitis, uremic <b>stomatitis,</b> signs such as uremic fetor (P ≤ 0. 000), xerostomia and symptoms like burning tongue, unpleasant taste are noted. Conclusion: The high prevalence of uremic fetor, saburral tongue, pale mucosa, and petechiae/ecchymoses in ESRD patient group can be considered as a possible sign of undiagnosed advanced stage of renal disease in other diabetic patients...|$|R

50|$|Erythematous (atrophic) {{candidiasis}} is {{when the}} condition appears as a red, raw-looking lesion. Some sources consider denture-related stomatitis, <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis,</b> median rhombiod glossitis, and antiobiotic-induced stomatitis as subtypes of erythematous candidiasis, since these lesions are commonly erythematous/atrophic. It may precede {{the formation of a}} pseudomembrane, be left when the membrane is removed, or arise without prior pseudomembranes. Some sources state that erythematous candidiasis accounts for 60% of oral candidiasis cases. Where it is associated with inhalation steroids (often used for treatment of asthma), erythematous candidiasis commonly appears on the palate or the dorsum of the tongue. On the tongue, there is loss of the lingual papillae (depapillation), leaving a smooth area.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Diabetes {{can affect}} organs {{including}} the oral mucosa. There is a disagreement about {{the prevalence of}} oral mucosal disease in diabetic patients. We therefore decided to investigate more about that. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of soft tissue pathologies by assessing burning mouth and xerostomia in diabetic patients on the basis of type of diabetes and control status of diabetes. Methods: This descriptive, analytic study was done by visiting 486 known diabetic patients who were referred to the Endocrine Clinic in summer of 2005. Their demographic information with history of systemic diseases accompanied by the amount of HbAIC and duration of disease was recorded in their questionnaire. Diagnosis of oral lesions was done by clinical examination. Burning mouth was assessed by visual analog scale in persons who suffered and subjective xerostomia was evaluated by standard questionnaire. Data collection was done by software SPSS 10, and statistical analysis was done by X 2 and logistic regression test. Results: In this study, 34 patients were type I and 434 were type II patients with mean age of 47. 84 ± 9. 77 years. Frequency of all candidasis lesions was 15. 4 % which included denture stomatitis 5. 3 %, angular cheilitis 4. 1 %, median rhomboid glossitis 1. 5 %and papillary atrophy of tongue 4. 5 %. Frequency of non-candidal lesions was 20. 1 %, which included fissured tongue 10. 5 %, geographic tongue 7. 9 % and lichen planus 1. 7 %. 6. 2 % of patients suffered from glossodyna. 15. 6 % of patients had xerestomia. By logistical regression test, we found that type of diabetes affects denture <b>stomatitis,</b> <b>angular</b> cheilitis, tongue atrophy and amount of HbA 1 c. Conclusion: All of the pathologies were greater in type I than type II diabetes patients. Level of HbA 1 c had an important role in appearance of oral lesions and level changes can cause problems in the mouth. Thus, patients should maintain their oral hygiene and control their glucose regularl...|$|R

5000|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anemia {{is due to}} insufficient {{dietary intake}} or absorption of iron to meet the body's needs. Infants, toddlers, and pregnant women have higher than average needs. Increased iron intake is also needed to offset blood losses due to digestive tract issues, frequent blood donations, or heavy menstrual periods. [...] Iron {{is an essential part}} of hemoglobin, and low iron levels result in decreased incorporation of hemoglobin into red blood cells. In the United States, 12% of all women of childbearing age have iron deficiency, compared with only 2% of adult men. The incidence is as high as 20% among African American and Mexican American women. Studies have shown iron deficiency without anemia causes poor school performance and lower IQ in teenage girls, although this may be due to socioeconomic factors.

40|$|SUMMARY A 39 {{year old}} man {{developed}} an itchy bullous rash in the perineum {{and on the}} extremities. Six years later, after giant intestinal villi had been noted at endoscopy, a diagnosis of the glucagonoma syndrome was made. Investigation revealed a large tumour of the pancreatic body and tail. The molecular species of glucagon secreted by the tumour were characterised using the combined purification procedures of immunoaffinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. A necrolytic migratory erythematous skin rash, anaemia, <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> with or without diabetes mellitus are recognised features of the pancreatic glucagonoma syndrome. ' The syndrome {{is associated with a}} pancreatic islet cell tumour producing glucagon. Removal of the tumour in some cases has resulted in curing of the symptoms and signs of the syndrome. 2 Giant intestinal villi have been found in a patient with a renal tumour producing enteroglucagon. 3 A patient with features of both conditions- that is, skin rash, anaemia, <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis,</b> diabetes mellitus, a pancreatic tumour and giant duodenal villi is reported. Case history A previously healthy male agricultural worker first developed an itchy bullous skin rash in the perineum, feet and hands in April 1969, at the age of 39 years. Over the next six years the skin lesions were variously diagnosed as contact dermatitis, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis or seborrhoeic dermatitis. The skin lesions responded to large quantities of topical steroids or systemic steroids. Diabetes mellitus diagnosed in April 1969, originally was treated with tolbutamide.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{literature}} and identify orofacial manifestations of hematological diseases, with particular reference to anemias and disorders of hemostasis. A computerized literature search using MEDLINE was conducted for published articles on orofacial manifestations of hematological diseases, with emphasis on anemia. Mesh phrases used in the search were: oral diseases AND anaemia; orofacial diseases AND anaemia; orofacial lesions AND anaemia; orofacial manifestations AND disorders of haemostasis. The Boolean operator "AND" was used to combine and narrow the searches. Anemic disorders associated with orofacial signs and symptoms include iron deficiency anemia, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, megaloblastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, thalassaemia and aplastic anemia. The manifestations include conjunctiva and facial pallor, atrophic glossitis, <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis,</b> dysphagia, magenta tongue, midfacial overgrowth, osteoclerosis, osteomyelitis and paraesthesia/anesthesia of the mental nerve. Orofacial petechiae, conjunctivae hemorrhage, nose-bleeding, spontaneous and post-traumatic gingival hemorrhage and prolonged post-extraction bleeding are common orofacial manifestations of inherited hemostatic disorders such as von Willebrand′s disease and hemophilia. A wide array of anemic and hemostatic disorders encountered in internal medicine has manifestations in the oral cavity and the facial region.

The model resembles human malnutrition with respect to weight loss, inanition, <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis,</b> anemia, lymphopenia, hypoproteinemia with hypoal-buminemia, and marked thymic involution. In addition, systemic invasion by gram-negative rods was documented. However, no edema was produced, and animals did not survive for longer than six weeks on the protein-deficient diet. One percent gly-cogen {{was found to be}} a satisfactory nonprotein stimulus for induction of a peri-toneal exudate consisting primarily of young macrophages. Electron microscopy showed that morphologic events of phagocytosis and degranulation proceeded nor-mally in macrophages from protein-deficient animals. In addition, cell surface re-ceptors for IgG were preserved under these experimental conditions. These data indicate that weanling rats may be employed as a small animal model for severe, ful-minant protein-calorie malnutrition in humans. Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) continues to be a prevalent problem throughout the world [1]. Many past studies have shown that infectious diseases contribute to nutritional deterioration in PCM and that malnutrition, in turn, alters host defense mechanisms against infectious agents [2, 3].

OBJECTIVE: This article describes the investigation, lessons learned, and provides guidance for monitoring micronutrient deficiencies among populations receiving food assistance. DESIGN: An investigation into a suspected outbreak of riboflavin (vitamin B 2) deficiency was initiated, including a rapid assessment, mass screening, a convenience sample collection of blood specimens (n =  58 symptomatic cases and n =  18 asymptomatic individuals), {{and analysis of the}} general food ration (70 % ration). RESULTS: Findings showed signs of AS in only 399 (0. 2 %) of 179, 172 screened individuals, including adults and children.

The use of rice mills instead of the primitive hand-pounding method, by which only the husk was removed, and the decreased consumption of millet in urban areas have caused a high incidence of B-complex deficiency among rice-eating Indians. The white bread produced in India also lacks vitamin B. With few exceptions the resulting ocular lesions cannot be definitely ascribed to a deficiency of any particular vitamin, and in most cases all the B-complex factors are deficient. (1) Angular Conjunctivitis and Blepharo-conjunctivitis Lesions of the lid margin {{similar to those of the}} lips in riboflavin deficiency are common. In early cases the lesions appear in the medial and lateral canthi and extend over the whole thickness of the intermarginal strip and some portion of the skin near it. In moderately severe cases where <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> is associated with cheilosis, the whole length of the lid margins is ulcerated, producing typical blepharo-conjunctivitis which extends over the intermarginal strip of both eyelids and the surface of the skin and conjunctiva and even over the naso-labial folds; the lesion may be 0 5 to 1 0 cm. deep with raised and pigmented edges sometimes resembling a rodent ulcer. A case of riboflavin deficiency is shown in Fig. 1. FiG.

40|$|Background: Mucocutaneous lesions {{are common}} {{features}} of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), {{but only a}} few studies have focused on them. To demonstrate the profile of mucocutaneous lesions of pSS and further explore their potential clinical significance, we performed a cross-sectional study on 874 patients. Methods: Demographic data, clinical manifestations, and laboratory results of 874 pSS patients were collected. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of mucocutaneous lesions. Differences in primary symptoms and systemic impairments between the two groups were analyzed. Results of laboratory tests were also compared after excluding those who had taken corticosteroid from both groups. One-year follow-up was done, and occurrences of various new complications were compared. Results: Among the 874 pSS patients, 181 patients had mucocutaneous lesions, accounting for 20. 7 %. Multiple mucocutaneous manifestations were displayed, and the top four most common types of lesions were purpuric eruptions (39. 8 %), urticaria (23. 8 %), Raynaud's phenomenon (14. 9 %), and <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (9. 9 %). Incidences of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary bullae, leukopenia, and anemia were significantly higher among patients with mucocutaneous lesions (P < 0. 05). Increase in IgG and decrease in C 4 among patients with mucocutaneous lesions displayed statistical significance after excluding patients from both groups who had taken corticosteroid (P < 0. 05). After one-year follow-up, patients with mucocutaneous lesions presented a slightly higher incidence of new complications compared to those without. Conclusions: Mucocutaneous manifestations of pSS patients were common and diverse. Patients with mucocutaneous manifestations had more systemic damages, higher level of IgG, and lower level of serum C 4, suggesting a higher activity of the primary disease...|$|E
40|$|Achalasia is a {{motility}} disorder {{characterized by}} obstruction at the gastro-oesophageal junction, {{made worse by}} lack of peristaltic wave in oesophagus, and failure of inferior sphincter to relax in response to swallowing 1. It is commonly seen in middle-aged females but is uncommon in childhood 2. Case report A 3 year and 10 month old boy {{was admitted to the}} university paediatric unit, North Colombo Teaching Hospital, Ragama in March 2001 due to persistent vomiting since age of 9 months. He vomited all that he ate and drank. Nasal regurgitation was noted on many occasions. Vomitus was never bilious or blood stained. His appetite remained voracious, despite these complaints. The child had not had recurrent respiratory infections. He did not have a history of accidental ingestion of corrosives. The complete blood count, blood urea and electrolytes, liver function tests and urine culture did not reveal any abnormality. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen was normal. Upper Gl endoscopy did not reveal any specific abnormality and upper Gl motility studies could not be performed because of his behaviour. Barium swallow and follow through showed abnormal motility and gross dilatation of oesophagus, with the characteristic tapering "breaking " at the gastro-oesophageal junction, which clinched the diagnosis (Figures 1 and 2). He was an only child, a product of a non-consanguineous marriage. He was born at term, with a birth weight of 1. 04 kg. His developmental milestones were normal. His weight and height were well below the 3 rd centile for his age. He was marasmic, severely dehydrated and showed abnormally aggressive behaviour at presentation. He was not pale; however <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> was noted. Examination of the abdomen and other systems did not reveal any abnormality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:  Malnutrition affects human performance, {{health and}} survival, {{including}} physical growth, morbidity, mortality, cognitive development, reproduction, physical work capacity and risks for several chronic diseases. In Madhya Pradesh state there are 1. 3 million severely malnourished children. Nutrition rehabilitation centers (NRCs) were {{started in the}} state to control severe malnutrition and decrease the prevalence of severe malnourished children to less than 1 % among children aged 1 - 5 year. Objective of the present survey was i) to make aware people about nutritional and other preventive measures for protein energy malnutrition and severity of complications of PEM. ii) To investigate Prevalence of Malnutrition in Rural areas of Indore. Protein Energy Malnutrition among children below the age of 3 - 6 years as indicated by anthropometrical measurements (weight-for-age, weight-for- height, height-for-age), had been identified as a major public health problem in children of slum areas. The total number of surveyed children was 500 and they surveyed for appearance and status of hair, lips, teeth, and bones. Percentage of surveyed children having good, fair, poor, very poor appearance were 44. 8 %, 21 %, 31 %, 7. 40 % respectively. Percentage of surveyed children having normal hair, loss and luster hair, discolored & dry hair were 40. 60 %, 27. 80 %, 31. 44 % respectively. Percentage of surveyed children having normal lips and <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> lips were 51 %, 49 %, respectively. Percentage of surveyed children having normal teeth, chalky of teeth, pitting of teeth, discolored teeth were 60. 80 %, 11. 40 %, 9. 40 % 18. 40 % respectively. Percentages of surveyed children having normal skin, dry & rough skin were 71 %, 29 % respectively. Percentages of surveyed children having normal bones and rickets bones were 99. 40 %, 0. 40 %, respectively. Malnutrition among children in slum areas is a public health problem which requires active interventions to improve chil...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{assess the}} {{nutritional}} status and other nutrition related {{problems of the}} workers. To design, implement and evaluate the impact of dietary intervention for the nutritional metabolic disorder which {{is directly related to}} productivity. Background: Indian economy greatly relies on agriculture. Agriculture is set to play a more dynamic role in the economy. The present study focuses on the nutritional status with special reference to the blood iron profile of manual coffee plantation laborers belonging to Kodaikannal, Tamil Nadu, India. The outcome of this study on the dietary intervention, based on nutritional picture of coffee plantation laborers, will have a nationwide application because of the simplified, stable coffee plantation operations throughout India. Method: Experiments were carried out in three phases. In the first phase, the personal background of the laborers was assessed. In the second phase, the nutritional and health status of the laborers, through dietary survey comprising 24 Hour Food Recall record and weighment of cooked food consumed for three consecutive days, clinical and biochemical profile were studied. The serum iron was measured with the total iron binding capacity, from which the transferrin saturation was calculated. In the third phase, dietary intervention was implemented with a nutrient rich nutraceutical food supplement - spirulina incorporated soup. The supplementation was extended for a period of 120 days. The subjects were grouped into control and the experimental group. The control group was given plain soup and the experimental group was administered with soup incorporated with spirulina. The impact of intervention on the biochemical and nutritional profile of the laborers was reassessed in similar working conditions. Results: A deficit of 0. 1 mg to 0. 3 mg of iron intake per kg body weight in the male and female laborers was observed when compared to their RDA The clinical pictures reveal thatFunctional Foods in Health and Disease 2013, 3 (1) : 21 - 3694 percent suffered from anemia, 56 percent showed anemic signs of spooning of nails (koilonychyia), 36 percent of the subjects had glossitis (mouth ulcer), 16 percent suffered from bleeding gums, 4 percent had cheilosis (ulceration of tongue) and 28 percent had <b>angular</b> <b>stomatitis.</b> The average hemoglobin level was 8. 6 ± 1. 12 g/dl for men and 8. 1 ± 1. 01 g/dl for women which are 28 and 37 percent less than normal respectively. Dietary intervention of 5 g of spirulina in 150 ml of soup had significantly improved the blood iron profile. Among the male laborers, 10 percent who suffered from severe anemia with 7. 9 g. dl- 1 hemoglobin before intervention were shifted to moderate levels of 9. 4 g. dl- 1, 30 percent who suffered from mild anemia were shifted to normal ones and among 60 percent of male laborers who were moderately anemic, 50 percent reverted to normalcy. Conclusion: In the present study it was observed that the habitual dietary intake showed deficiency in consumption of iron rich foods and the clinical picture revealed the signs and symptoms of anemia The blood iron profile - Hemoglobin (Hb), Serum Iron, Transferrin Saturation, Serum Ferritin, Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) and Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity (UIBC) were greatly influenced by dietary intervention with the functional food Spirulina incorporated soup The blood hemoglobin content increased by 21 percent i. e from 10. 9 to 13. 3 g. dl- 1. Serum iron, serum ferritin and transferrin levels showed a consistent and progressive rise while TIBC and UIBC reduced resulting in a positive iron balance.
