5000|$|Tetramethylbutane, {{sometimes}} called hexamethylethane, is a hydrocarbon with formula C8H18 or (H3C-)3C-C(-CH3)3. It {{is the most}} heavily branched and most compact of the many octane isomers, {{the only one with}} a butane (C4) backbone. Because of its highly symmetrical structure, it has a very high melting point and a short liquid range; in fact, it is the smallest saturated <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> that appears as a solid at a room temperature of 25 °C. (Among cyclic hydrocarbons, cubane, C8H8 is even smaller and is also solid at room temperature.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} of various <b>acyclic</b> and cyclic <b>hydrocarbons</b> in both saturated and unsaturated forms with the carbon nanostructures (CNSs) have been explored by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Model systems representing armchair and zigzag carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene {{have been considered}} to investigate the effect of chirality and curvature of the CNSs towards these interactions. Results of this study reveal contrasting binding nature of the <b>acyclic</b> and cyclic <b>hydrocarbons</b> towards CNSs. While the saturated molecules show stronger binding affinity in acyclic hydrocarbons; the unsaturated molecules exhibit higher binding affinity in cyclic <b>hydrocarbons.</b> In addition, <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> exhibit stronger binding affinity towards the CNSs when compared to their corresponding cyclic counterparts. The computed results excellently corroborate the experimental observations. The interaction of hydrocarbons with graphene is more favourable when compared with CNTs. Bader’s theory of atoms in molecules has been invoked to characterize the noncovalent {{interactions of}} saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Our results are expected to provide useful insights towards the development of rational strategies for designing complexes with desired noncovalent interaction involving CNSs...|$|R

40|$|Lycopene is an <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{carotenoid}} containing 11 conjugated double {{bonds in}} the all-trans form. It lacks provitamin A activity, but has an exceptionally high singlet oxygen quenching ability. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble, transported in the blood by lipoproteins and appear to concentrate in tissues where lipoprotein uptake is high, as in the adrenals, testes, liver, kidney, and prostate. Increased plasma concentrations of lycopene {{have been shown to}} elevate lycopene metabolites and reduce lipid, protein, and DNA oxidation. Lycopene predominantly occurs in fresh tomatoes and tomato products such as tomato juice and tomato sauce. Its bioavailability is increased in cooked or processed tomato products and when consumed with oils. Epidemiological studies of lycopene and cancer have correlated increased tomato intake with lower incidence of gastrointestinal, stomach, and prostate cancers while decreasing serum values of lycopene increases the risks for various types of cancer. Lycopene is an effective inhibitor of cell growth and DNA synthesis in human cancer cell cultures and suppresses mammary tumor development in SHN mice and DMBA rat tumor models...|$|E
40|$|The main glycophospholipid (MPL) {{from the}} archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum is {{composed}} of a di-isopranol- 2, 3 -glycerotetraether. The fraction of pentacyclizations of its hydrocarbon chains increases with {{the growth temperature of}} the source organism (39 and 59 °C), the respective lipids being named MPL 39 and MPL 59. MPL has a main phase transition between − 15 and − 30 °C. Non-hydrated and hydrated samples of MPL 59 have been studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA). Non-hydrated MPL 59 does not exert any phase transition. Computer simulation of an unhydrated MPL molecule with four pentacycles and another without pentacyclations demonstrates similar behavior, i. e. the MPL molecules form coils with both polar ends getting closely together. The molecule without pentacyclation coils faster than that with pentacycles. With hydrated samples, DTA scanning conditions were varied. Under certain conditions, the shape of the calorimetric scans, i. e. occurrence of an additional (endotherm) phase transition peak at + 17 °C and enthalpy changes of the phase transitions indicate a (metastable) solid-analogue phase in MPL 59 in addition to the well-known liquid–crystalline phase. Only lipid samples from T. acidophilum {{with a high degree of}} <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains (MPL 39) had thus far been reported to form a metastable solid-analogue phase (Blöcher, D., Gutermann, R., Henkel, B., Ring, K., 1990.

Chemical space travel algorithms can be used to explore defined regions of chemical space by generating focused virtual libraries. Maps of the chemical space are produced from property spaces visualized by principal component analysis or by self-organizing maps, and from structural analyses such as the scaffold-tree or the MQN-system.

50|$|Hydrocarbons, {{being an}} {{extremely}} {{great source of}} energy due to their strong chemical bonds, were {{a great source of}} study in the Aegean Sea oil spill. Chemical markers were placed in a sample of the crude oil spilled, and an interesting data was revealed. Alkanes and <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> both having single bonds, appeared to have deteriorated in only six months, while triterpane and steranane were still present after years of weathering. Both triterpane and steranane have multiple bonds, which is the reason they were still present after so many years. As a conclusion for the study, they stated that chemical markers are a great source to use against oil spills. Apparently, they allow a scientist to determine how long the oil has contaminated the sea water, and how the sea water affected the oil collected with water. For instance, thousands of cubic meters of oil were collected through oil booms. Meaning, the oil is mixed with water and that a cleansing process must take place in order to use the oil once again. Chemical markers may now be placed into to the oil to determine how much the oil must be cleaned in order for it to be satisfactory.|$|R
40|$|A gene {{encoding}} {{the enzyme}} lycopene cyclase in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp strain PCC 7942 was mapped by genetic complementation, cloned, and sequenced. This gene, {{which we have}} named crtL, was expressed in strains of Escherichia coli that were genetically engineered to accumulate the carotenoid precursors lycopene, neurosporene, and zeta-carotene. The crtL gene product converts the <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> lycopene into the bicyclic beta-carotene, {{an essential component of}} the photosynthetic apparatus in oxygen-evolving organisms and a source of vitamin A in human and animal nutrition. The enzyme also converts neurosporene to the monocyclic beta-zeacarotene but does not cyclize zeta-carotene, indicating that desaturation of the 7 - 8 or 7 '- 8 ' carbon-carbon bond is required for cyclization. The bleaching herbicide 2 -(4 -methylphenoxy) triethylamine hydrochloride (MPTA) effectively inhibits both cyclization reactions. A mutation that confers resistance to MPTA in Synechococcus sp PCC 7942 was identified as a point mutation in the promoter region of crtL. The deduced amino acid sequence of lycopene cyclase specifies a polypeptide of 411 amino acids with a molecular weight of 46, 125 and a pI of 6. 0. An amino acid sequence motif indicative of FAD utilization is located at the N terminus of the polypeptide. DNA gel blot hybridization analysis indicated a single copy of crtL in Synechococcus sp PCC 7942. Other than the FAD binding motif, the predicted amino acid sequence of the cyanobacterial lycopene cyclase bears little resemblance to the two known lycopene cyclase enzymes from nonphotosynthetic bacteria. Preliminary results from DNA gel blot hybridization experiments suggest that, like two earlier genes in the pathway, the Synechococcus gene encoding lycopene cyclase is homologous to plant and algal genes encoding this enzyme...|$|E

40|$|The {{localized}} charge distributions defined previously {{are used}} to calculate INDO bond moments and energies {{of a variety of}} CH bonds in <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The polarity of all bonds discussed is c+H-. It is found that each basic type of CH bond (primary, vinyl, ethynyl) has an overflow of electron density (a 2 ̆ 2 tail 2 ̆ 2) out of the bond region which resides on and is characteristic of those atoms trans and coplanar to the bond. It is demonstrated that, since these tails are virtually independent of each other, the basic bond moments can be used to construct a model which predicts all calculated bond moments and orientations to a high degree of accuracy. While the total energies of the bonds ei (where the molecular energy E = iei) are not very transferable, the intra bond and interference energies can be predicted rather well using a similar model. The trends in the bond moments are discussed in terms of the point charge and polarization contributions, and the interference energies are shown to correlate well with the trends in experimental CH bond energies. The trends in both properties are principally determined by the loss of interference density within the bond due to the presence of overflow atoms...|$|R

40|$|The study {{continues}} the previous development [MATCH, 72 (2014) 39 - 73] of the perturbative approach to relative stabilities of pi-electron systems of conjugated hydrocarbons modeled as sets of weakly-interacting initially-double (C=C) bonds. Distinct isomers of <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (polyenes) {{are now under}} focus. The relevant total pi-electron energies (E) are expressed {{in the form of}} power series containing members (E_(k)) of even orders (k= 0, 2, 4, [...] .) with respect to the averaged resonance parameter of initially-single (C-C) bonds. Terms to within the sixth order (k= 6) inclusive are shown to be of importance for discrimination between similar isomers. In this connection, missing expressions for corrections E_(6) are originally derived. Conjugated paths of various lengths (i. e. linear chains consisting of C=C and C-C bonds alternately) are shown {{to be the most important}} (but not the only) fragments contributing to stabilization of any acyclic pi-electron system. Again, new types of fragments (substructures) are revealed (viz. the so-called composite conjugated paths) that contribute to destabilization of the system concerned. As a result, formation of the total energy of an acyclic pi-electron system is concluded to be governed by an interplay between stabilizing and destabilizing factors. Accordingly, the perturbative approach applied offers us an extension of the concept of conjugated paths. Particular isomers containing four, five and six C=C bonds are considered in a detail as examples...|$|R

50|$|Saturated {{hydrocarbons}} are {{the simplest}} of the hydrocarbon species. They are composed entirely of single bonds and are saturated with hydrogen. The formula for <b>acyclic</b> saturated <b>hydrocarbons</b> (i.e., alkanes) is CnH2n+2. The most general form of saturated hydrocarbons is CnH2n+2(1-r), where r {{is the number of}} rings. Those with exactly one ring are the cycloalkanes. Saturated hydrocarbons are the basis of petroleum fuels and are found as either linear or branched species. Substitution reaction is their characteristics property (like chlorination reaction to form chloroform). Hydrocarbons with the same molecular formula but different structural formulae are called structural isomers. As given in the example of 3-methylhexane and its higher homologues, branched hydrocarbons can be chiral. Chiral saturated hydrocarbons constitute the side chains of biomolecules such as chlorophyll and tocopherol.|$|R

Unique {{representation}} of adjacency matrix of a labeled chemical structure, a graph, {{is of great}} importance {{in the formation of}} various characteristic matrices based on the vertex connectivities. It finds application in places where two or more structures or parts thereof are to be compared and evaluated for any given purpose. Method. An algorithm, based on the vertex connectivity values, atomic weights, subgraph lengths, loops, heteroatom content, etc. has been developed to uniquely sequence and represent connectivity matrix of chemical structure of cyclic / <b>acyclic</b> fictionalized non-chiral <b>hydrocarbons.</b> In this the terminal vertices are considered separately after completing the sequencing of the core vertices. Results. The proposed algorithm uniquely sequences a given chemical structure according to the vertex priority. Also, this sequencing procedure generates traditional connection table of the chemical graph. This approach provides a kind of multilayered connectivity graphs which can be put to use in comparing two or more structures or parts thereof for any given purpose. Conclusions.

40|$|Relative {{strengths}} of surface interaction for individual carbon atoms in <b>acyclic</b> and cyclic <b>hydrocarbons</b> adsorbed on alumina surfaces are determined using chemically resolved 13 C {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) T 1 relaxation times. The ratio of relaxation times for the adsorbed atoms T 1,ads to the bulk liquid relaxation time T 1,bulk provides {{an indication of the}} mobility of the atom. Hence a low T 1,ads/T 1,bulk ratio indicates a stronger surface interaction. The carbon atoms associated with unsaturated bonds in the molecules are seen to exhibit a larger reduction in T 1 on adsorption relative to the aliphatic carbons, consistent with adsorption occurring through the carbon-carbon multiple bonds. The relaxation data are interpreted in terms of proximity of individual carbon atoms to the alumina surface and adsorption conformations are inferred. Furthermore, variations of interaction strength and molecular configuration have been explored as a function of adsorbate coverage, temperature, surface pre-treatment, and in the presence of co-adsorbates. This relaxation time analysis is appropriate for studying the behaviour of hydrocarbons adsorbed {{on a wide range of}} catalyst support and supported-metal catalyst surfaces, and offers the potential to explore such systems under realistic operating conditions when multiple chemical components are present at the surface...|$|R
