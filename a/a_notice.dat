5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that <b>a</b> <b>Notice</b> to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, <b>a</b> <b>Notice</b> to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, <b>a</b> <b>Notice</b> to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E
