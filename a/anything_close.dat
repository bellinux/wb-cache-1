5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or <b>anything</b> <b>close</b> to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle's {{resignation}} in 1969, {{and more}} importantly the 1970 election of the Liberals in Quebec under Robert Bourassa gave impetus to the calls on both sides for normalization of France-Canada relations. While the ultra-Gaullists and the remaining members of the 'Quebec Mafia' continue to occasionally cause headaches for Canada - such as a 1997 initiative by 'Mafia' members to have the French Post Office issue a stamp commemorating de Gaulle's 1967 visit to Montreal - never again would relations reach <b>anything</b> <b>close</b> to the hostility of the late 1960s.|$|E

The revolutionary government in general, and Fidel Castro in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of deuterium on Earth, {{elsewhere in the}} solar system (as confirmed by planetary probes), and in the spectra of stars, is also an important datum in cosmology. Gamma radiation from ordinary nuclear fusion dissociates deuterium into protons and neutrons, and there are no known natural processes other than the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which might have produced deuterium at <b>anything</b> <b>close</b> to the observed natural abundance of deuterium (deuterium is produced by the rare cluster decay, and occasional absorption of naturally occurring neutrons by light hydrogen, but these are trivial sources). There is thought to be little deuterium in the interior of the Sun and other stars, as at temperatures there nuclear fusion reactions that consume deuterium happen much faster than the proton-proton reaction that creates deuterium. However, deuterium persists in the outer solar atmosphere at roughly the same concentration as in Jupiter, and this has probably been unchanged since the origin of the Solar System. The natural abundance of deuterium seems to be a very similar fraction of hydrogen, wherever hydrogen is found, unless there are obvious processes at work that concentrate it.|$|E

Maria was {{the object of the}} love of two brothers, Eladio (Raymond Cruz) and Soledad Buente; Soledad blames his brother for her death.

In the first round he {{obtained}} a winning position against Topalov after pressing in a long endgame, only to lose on time when he mistakenly thought that he would receive 15 minutes of extra time at move 60. He was then outplayed by Caruana in the second round, missed a win against Anish Giri in round 3, and lost to Anand in round 4. He won against Grischuk in round 5, drew against Nakamura and Vachier-Lagrave in rounds 6 and 7, and defeated Aronian in round 8, but he lost the last round against Jon Ludvig Hammer, leaving him in seventh place and with a performance rating of 2693.

[...] Ornstein commented that [...] "no speaker did more to relegate the regular order to the sidelines than Hastert. ... The House is a very partisan institution, with rules structured to give even tiny majorities enormous leverage. But Hastert took those realities to {{a new and more}} tribalized, partisan plane." [...] Despite this shift, Hastert was widely seen as [...] "affable" [...] and low-key; he did not seek the limelight, [...] "become a regular on Sunday talk shows or <b>anything</b> <b>close</b> to a household word or figure," [...] or [...] "openly exhibit the kind of snarling or mean partisan demeanor that made Tom DeLay such a mark of hatred for Democrats." ...|$|E

In 1999, after Wakefield's departure, lead vocalist Chester Bennington joined the five members of Xero and the band was renamed Linkin Park. Bennington's previous band, Grey Daze, had recently disbanded, so his lawyer recommended him to Jeff Blue, vice president of A coordination for Zomba, {{who at the time}} was seeking a lead vocalist for Xero. Blue sent Bennington two tapes of Xero's unreleased recordings — one with vocals by former Xero member Mark Wakefield, and the other with only the instrumental tracks — asking for his [...] "interpretation of the songs". Bennington wrote and recorded new vocals over the instrumentals and sent the tapes back to Blue. As Delson recalls, [...] " [...] really was kind of the final piece of the puzzle [...] We didn't see <b>anything</b> <b>close</b> to his talent in anybody else." [...] After Bennington joined, the group first renamed itself to Hybrid Theory and released a self-titled EP. Legal complications with Welsh electronic music group Hybrid prompted a second name change, thus deciding on [...] "Linkin Park". Throughout 1999, Linkin Park was a regular act at the Los Angeles club, The Whisky.|$|E

Strange genius that he was, a Napoleon of the law, with a power of visioning that far exceeded Daylight's, he had nothing in common with Daylight outside the office. He spent his time with books, a thing Daylight could not abide. Also, he devoted himself to the endless writing of plays which never got beyond manuscript form, and, though Daylight only sensed the secret taint of it, was a confirmed but temperate eater of hasheesh. Hegan lived all his life cloistered with books in a world of agitation. With the out-of-door world he had no understanding nor tolerance. In food and drink he was abstemious as a monk, while exercise was a thing abhorrent. Daylight's friendships, in lieu of <b>anything</b> <b>closer,</b> were drinking friendships and roistering friendships. And with the passing of the Sunday rides with Dede, he fell back more and more upon these for diversion. The cocktail wall of inhibition he reared more assiduously than ever.|$|R

Under Bungie's agreement with Activision, new intellectual property developed by Bungie will be owned by Bungie, not Activision, in a deal similar to the EA Partners Program. Details of this contract were revealed during the course of Activision's lawsuit against Jason West and Vincent Zampella, founders and former employees of Infinity Ward, including provisions for four Destiny games {{over the course of the}} ten-year deal. Initially, Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick suggested that the total investment in Destiny would be around $500 million. Bungie's COO Pete Parsons clarified that the game's development cost is not even close to $500 million, saying, [...] "For marketing you'd have to ask Activision people, but for development costs, not <b>anything</b> <b>close</b> to $500 million." [...] Activision subsequently confirmed the $500 million figure, stating that marketing, up-front infrastructure costs, and investment in the game's engine were included, and could be amortized over the life of the IP.

2500|$|It {{was in the}} 17th {{century that}} the concept of [...] "religion" [...] {{received}} its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written. In the 19th century, Max Müller noted that what is called ancient religion today, would have been called [...] "law" [...] in antiquity. For example, there is no precise equivalent of [...] "religion" [...] in Hebrew, and Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities. The Sanskrit word [...] "dharma", sometimes translated as [...] "religion", also means law or duty. Throughout classical South Asia, the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between [...] "imperial law" [...] and universal or [...] "Buddha law", but these later became independent sources of power. Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of [...] "religion" [...] since there was no corresponding Japanese word, nor <b>anything</b> <b>close</b> to its meaning, but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this Western idea.|$|E
2500|$|The Concepcion {{decision}} also impacted {{the usage}} of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts, including {{the usage of}} [...] "consumer-friendly" [...] arbitration terms like the ones in AT's agreement.

[...] In a 2012 research paper, Gilles wrote that the majority opinion in Concepcion led to a [...] "race to the top" [...] in implementing arbitration procedures that are more friendly to consumer claims {{and more likely to}} allow their vindication. [...] Gilles wrote that corporate lawyers encouraged companies to implement terms similar to the ones used by AT Mobility and upheld in Concepcion. [...] According to Gilles, many large consumer-oriented businesses changed their arbitration provisions in 2011 and 2012. [...] However, Gilles noted that only 6 out of the 37 companies she examined had arbitration clauses that [...] "offered <b>anything</b> <b>close</b> to AT's set of incentives, and none were quite as generous". [...] Ann Marie Tracey and Shelley McGill wrote that businesses would introduce more consumer-unfriendly terms in their arbitration clauses since unconscionability [...] "provided strong motivation for business to draft agreements fairly in the pre-Concepcion environment; that motivation does not exist in the post-Concepcion era." [...] Suzanna Sherry said that the broad holding of the decision would make harsh arbitration clauses, similar to the earliest consumer arbitration clauses, enforceable, since the unconscionability doctrine that had been used to strike down those harsh clauses could be found preempted based on Concepcion.|$|E
