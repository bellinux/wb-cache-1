40|$|A {{broad range}} of defeasible {{reasoning}} forms has been explicated by prioritized <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics.</b> However, the relative lack in meta-theory {{of many of these}} logics stands {{in sharp contrast to the}} frequency of their application. This article presents the first comparative study of a large group of prioritized <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics.</b> Three formats of such logics are discussed: superpositions of <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics,</b> hierarchic <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> from F. Van De Putte (2011, Log. J. IGPL, doi: 10. 1093 /jigpal/jzr 025) and lexicographic <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> from F. Van De Putte and C. Stra ss er (2012, Log. Anal., forthcoming). We restrict the scope to logics that use the strategy Minimal Abnormality. It is shown that the semantic characterizations of these systems are equivalent and that they are all sound with respect to either of these characterizations. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for the completeness and equivalence of the consequence relations of the three formats are established. Some attractive properties, including Fixed Point and the Deduction Theorem, are shown to hold whenever these conditions are obeyed...|$|R

40|$|After it {{is argued}} that {{philosophers}} of science have lost their interest in logic because they applied the wrong type of logics, examples are given of the forms of dynamic reasoning that are central for philosophy of science and epistemology. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> are presented as a means to understand and explicate those forms of reasoning.

40|$|In this paper, <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> are studied {{from the}} {{viewpoint}} of uni-versal logic (in the sense of the study of common structures of logics). The common structure of a large set of <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> is described. It is shown that this structure determines the proof theory as well as the semantics of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics,</b> and moreover that most properties of the logics can be proved by relying solely on the structure, viz. without invoking any specific properties of the logics themselves. 1 Aim and Preliminaries In this paper the common features {{of a wide variety of}} logics is studied. The <b>logics,</b> viz. <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics,</b> are very different both in nature and in application context. Of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> studied until now, some are close to CL (Clas-sical Logic), others are many valued, still others modal, and there clearly are <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> of a still very different nature. The application contexts too are very varied: handling inconsistency, inductive generalization, abduction, handling plausible inferences, interpreting a person’s changing position in an ongoing discussion, compatibility, etc. I shall show that all these logics have a common structure, which determines their proofs as well as their semantics, and moreover their metatheory. Specific <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> will not even be mentioned, except as illustrative examples. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> adapt themselves to specific premise sets. To be more pre-cise, they interpret a premise set “as normally as possible ” with respect to some standard of normality. They explicate reasoning processes that display an inter-nal and possibly an external dynamics. The external dynamics provides from the non-monotonicity of the inference relation: if premises are added, some consequences may not be derivable any more—formally: there are Γ, ∆ and A such that Γ ` A and Γ ∪ ∆ 0 A.

We present several translations between formal argumentation frameworks and nonmonotonic logics for reasoning with plausible assumptions.

40|$|We {{present and}} discuss a new {{solution}} for reasoning with sorites series and their related paradoxes.

When the latter happens, the logic should be able to retract those applications of classical logic rules that are problematic. The formal core of our solution consists of several <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> based on a Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic extended with the Baaz’Δ-operator and a non-singleton interval of designated values.

40|$|In this article, I {{present a}} dynamic logic game for defeasible {{reasoning}}.

The presented <b>adaptive</b> <b>logic</b> games are based on (i) standard logic games {{on the one hand}} and (ii) dynamic proof procedures for <b>adaptive</b> <b>logic</b> on the other hand. The games are similar to standard logic games, but have the extra property that some moves are revisable. This is handled by means of a main control game, which starts different standard logic games. I argue that the <b>adaptive</b> <b>logic</b> games form intuitive reasoning models for rationality in defeasible reasoning contexts. Moreover, I will also demonstrate that the games give a good insight in the computational complexity of defeasible reasoning forms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Combining {{both kinds}} of fuzzy logic forms {{including}} fuzzy T-S model and <b>adaptive</b> fuzzy <b>logic</b> systems, this paper presents an adaptive control scheme for a class of nonlinear systems. Firstly, the fuzzy T-S model is used to approximate the nonlinear systems, and the fuzzy control law of the fuzzy model is derived by the linear matrix inequality. Secondly, the <b>adaptive</b> fuzzy <b>logic</b> systems are constructed, and the modeling errors are eliminated by a compensator based on the <b>adaptive</b> fuzzy <b>logic</b> systems with three adjustable parameters: weights, centers and widths. It is proved that the closed loop system satisfies the anticipant performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the control scheme is effective.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} question: How should one handle inconsis-tencies {{that derive from}} the {{inadequacy}} of the criteria by which one approaches the world. I compare several approaches. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> defined from CLuN appear to be superior to the others in this respect. They isolate incon-sistencies rather than spreading them, {{and at the same}} time allow for genuine deductive steps from inconsistent and mutually inconsistent premises. Yet, the systems based on CLuN seem to introduce an asymmetry between negated and non-negated formulas, and this seems hard to justify. To clarify and understand the source of the asymmetry, the epistemological presuppositions of CLuN, viz. inadequate criteria, are investigated. This leads to a new type of paraconsistent logic that involves gluts with respect to all logical symbols. The larger part of the paper is devoted to this <b>logic,</b> to the <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> defined from it, and to the properties of these systems. While the resulting logics are sensible and display interesting features, the search for variants of the justification leads to an unexpected justification for CLuN. 1. The Problem The first papers on <b>adaptive</b> <b>logics</b> concerned inconsistency-adaptive logics defined from the logic (now called) CLuN (see especially [3] and [2]).
