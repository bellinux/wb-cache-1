40|$|This book is {{intended}} {{as a resource for}} students and researchers interested in developmental biology and physiology and specifically addresses the larval stages of fish. Fish larvae (and fish embryos) are not small juveniles or adults. Rather they are transitionary organisms that bridge the critical gap between the singlecelled egg and sexually immature juvenile. Fish larvae represent the stage of the life cycle that is used for differentiation, feeding and distribution. The book aims at providing a single-volume treatise that explains how fish larvae develop <b>and</b> differentiate, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> regulate salt, water <b>and</b> acid-base balance, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> transport <b>and</b> exchange gases, acquire <b>and</b> utilise energy, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> sense their environment, and move in their aquatic medium, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> control <b>and</b> defend themselves, <b>and</b> finally <b>how</b> <b>they</b> grow up.

5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E
