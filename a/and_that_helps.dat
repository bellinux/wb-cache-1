25|$|At {{the time}} of hatching, the young start calling within the eggs. They have an egg-tooth {{at the tip of}} their snouts, which is {{developed}} from the skin, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> them pierce out of the shell. Hearing the calls, the female usually excavates the nest and sometimes takes the unhatched eggs in her mouth, slowly rolling the eggs to help the process. The young is usually carried to the water in the mouth. She would then introduce her hatchlings to the water and even feed them. The mother would then take care of her young for over a year before the next mating season. In the absence of the mother crocodile, the father would act in her place {{to take care of the}} young. However, even with a sophisticated parental nurturing, young crocodiles have a very high mortality rate due to their vulnerability to predation. A group of hatchlings is called a pod or crèche and may be protected for months.|$|E

500|$|This {{approach}} to advertising {{was driven by}} Sinclair's reliance on mail-order marketing. It came with a high up-front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it {{had the advantage of}} ensuring that all sales were firm and pre-paid. A big splash on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign, though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand. The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over-the-counter sales by [...] "getting the story across", as Clive Sinclair put it: [...] "Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order, but they see the ads, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ted Chaough (Kevin Rahm); {{recurring}} Seasons 4–5, regular Seasons 6–7: A self-proclaimed rival of Don Draper in {{the advertising}} world, his agency—Cutler Gleason and Chaough (CGC)—was {{in competition with}} SCDP for an account with Honda. Don tricked Ted into making an expensive presentation to Honda executives, which backfired on Ted as he violated Honda's presentation rules (no finished work or commercials allowed at the presentation). Though the two agencies are comparable in size, he seems obsessed with competing against Don. Ted also tried to woo Pete Campbell over to his agency. After Don writes his New York Times ad about dropping business with cigarette companies, Ted makes a prank call to Don pretending to be Robert F. Kennedy. When he returns in Season 5 to recruit Peggy to leave SCDP and join his advertising firm, he remains very confident but is much less obnoxious than in his previous appearances; he does not indulge his typical dislike and jealousy of Don to Peggy, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> her decide to accept his offer, which in the season finale has him assigning her {{a huge amount of}} material involving an account for cigarettes aimed at female consumers. [...] During Season 6, Ted and Don impulsively decide to merge their smaller firms together so as to compete with the larger ones; however, this leads to numerous small struggles for power between them. In the Season 6 finale, Ted moves to a California SC office to have a [...] "new start" [...] after a short-lived affair with Peggy. He returns in Season 7 after the McCann purchase and settles into the culture of the firm.|$|E

It's nicer to sit in the back seats but you can't sit there till your legs grow long enough to touch the floor. Milty drawed a picture of Anne on his slate and it was awful ugly and I told him if he made {{pictures}} of Anne like that I'd lick him at recess. I thought first I'd draw one of him and put horns and a tail on it, but I was afraid it would hurt his feelings, and Anne says you should never hurt anyone's feelings. It seems it's dreadful to have your feelings hurt. It's better to knock a boy down than hurt his feelings if you MUST do something. Milty said he wasn't scared of me but he'd just as soon call it somebody else to 'blige me, so he rubbed out Anne's name and printed Barbara Shaw's under it. Milty doesn't like Barbara 'cause she calls him a sweet little boy and once she patted him on his head." ...|$|E
