50|$|The {{most common}} context to obtain and share for the {{purposes}} of improving situational awareness is the user's location. In an early prototype, the <b>Active</b> <b>Badge</b> system, for example, each user had a uniquely identifying badge that could be tracked via a series of overhead infrared sensors. As users walked throughout a building, their location was constantly monitored by a centralized server. Other users could then view this information (either in text form, or on a map, as was done in later work) to determine if a user is in her office, thereby allowing them to determine the best time to stop by for an unplanned conversation. Location was also shared in the PeopleTones, Serendipity, and the Group Interaction Support Systems to help users determine when they are near friends, users with shared personal interests, and teammates, respectively. In comparison with <b>Active</b> <b>Badge,</b> which only displays location information, these systems are more proactive, and will alert the users when they are in proximity of each other. This lets the user know when a potential interaction opportunity is available, thereby increasing his/her chances of taking advantage of it.|$|E

Modeling the data with a hidden Markov model, we used the Viterbi algorithm to compute optimal paths based on signal strengths over the node graph.

40|$|Abstract—Tracking {{of people}} via <b>active</b> <b>badges</b> is {{important}} for location-aware computing and for security applications. However, the human body has a major effect on the antenna gain pattern of the device {{that the person is}} wearing. In this paper, the gain pattern due to the effect of the human body is experimentally measured and represented by a first-order directional gain pattern model. A method is presented to estimate the model parameters from multiple received signal strength (RSS) measurements. An alternating gain and position estimation (AGAPE) algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the orientation and the position of the badge using RSS measurements at known-position anchor nodes. Lower bounds on mean squared error (MSE) and experimental results are presented that both show that the accuracy of position estimates can be greatly improved by including orientation estimates in the localization system. Next, we propose a new tracking filter that accepts orientation estimates as input, which we call the orientation-enhanced extended Kalman filter (OE-EKF), which improves tracking accuracy in active RFID tracking systems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{prepared}} {{in collaboration with}} Acreo (Research and Development Company) and OpenCare (IT Company). Its purpose was to design and develop a research testbed to enable context awareness in pervasive environments by modifying the MediaSense framework (EU Funded project) of Mid Sweden University. In ubiquitous environments, the proliferation of devices such as sensors, <b>active</b> <b>badges,</b> mobile phones, RFID and NfC tags enables the development of intelligent services towards new forms of pervasive applications. These intelligent services seamlessly gather context information and the benefits offered are {{in the provision of}} better services. The inspiration given by these intelligent services has meant that the focus of thesis has been on using these services in a healthcare application. The challenge is that the proposed testbed should address the intelligent delivery of health information to any host, anywhere, based on the user’s context. Further, context reasoning requires substantial computing power and smart devices have limited resources in terms of processing and memory, so, the testbed should enable smart communication to take place between these devices. The proposed solution satisfies the stated requirements by using a cloud infrastructure and a Distributed Context eXchange Protocol (DCXP). Any device on the internet that is DCXP capable may register with the architecture and share context information in an efficient way. In order to view context information, TV, smartphones, internet tablets and web interfaces have been provided for both the user and the health centre. By successfully addressing the requirements of the testbed, this thesis has enabled the creation of a pervasive healthcare application. Hence, this thesis concludes with the observation that the proposed approach for context awareness in a healthcare system has the ability to deal with the stated challenges. ...|$|R

30|$|RF-based technologies, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, {{cellular}} network, and RFID, are {{the highest}} potential alternatives to positioning in degraded environments because of the existing RF infrastructures. The first well-known WiFi-based positioning system, namely RADAR (Bahl and Padmanabhan, 2000), utilizes kNN positioning algorithm to compute {{the location of a}} mobile device based on radio signal strength (RSS) from visible access points (APs) nearby. Using WiFi RSSIs, Ekahau (Ekahau Inc, 2017) provides an easy and cost-effective solution for locating people, assets, inventory and other objects. Similar to the Ekahau system based on specific RF tags, the <b>Active</b> <b>Badge</b> (Want et al., 1992) system uses ceiling-mounted infrared sensor detectors to detect signals from a mobile <b>active</b> <b>badge.</b> Place Lab (Schilit et al., 2003) combines Wi-Fi, GSM and Bluetooth devices as global beacons. Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2009) proposes a multi-network approach to improve the availability and reliability of navigation and positioning. However, the deployment of diverse wireless devices operating in the 2.4  GHz unlicensed band, is met with growing concerns about signal interference and performance degradation. Pei et al., (2012 b) present the preliminary results of WiFi positioning with Bluetooth interferences. In this paper, we will evaluate the performance of fingerprinting-based WiFi positioning in Bluetooth and WiFi coexistence environments. Instead of using the conventional occurrence-based database, we propose the Weibull-based fingerprint database which has more robust performance when the WiFi spectrum is affected by coexisted Bluetooth signals.|$|E

40|$|The {{manifesto}} of {{ubiquitous computing}} is traditionally {{considered to be}} the justly famous 1991 visionary article written for Scientific American by the late Mark Weiser of Xerox PARC (Weiser, 1991). But the true birth date of this revolution, perhaps hard to pinpoint precisely, precedes that publication by at least a few years: Weiser himself first spoke of “ubiquitous computing ” around 1988 and other researchers around the world had also been focusing their efforts in that direction during the late Eighties. Indeed, one of the images in Weiser’s article depicts an <b>Active</b> <b>Badge,</b> an infrared-emitting tag worn by research scientists to locate their colleagues when they were not in their office (in the days before mobile phones were commonplace) and to enable audio and video phone call rerouting and other follow-me applications. That device was initially developed by Roy Want and Andy Hopper (Want, Hopper, Falcao, and Gibbons, 1992) at Olivetti Research Limited (ORL) in 1989. Soon afterwards other research institutions, including Xerox PARC themselves who later hired Want, acquired <b>Active</b> <b>Badge</b> installations and started to explore the wide horizons opened by the novel idea of letting your spatial position be an input that implicitly told the computer system what to do. I was fortunate enough to work at ORL as a research scientist throughout the Nineties, thereby acquiring first hand experience of these and other pioneering developments in ubiquitous computing 2.

500|$|During her voyages to Vietnam, Sydney transported 16,902 soldiers, 5,753 {{deadweight}} tons of cargo, 2,375 vehicles, and 14 aircraft. Initially, {{personnel from}} Sydney, the other transport ships, and their escorts, could not claim time served on logistics or escort deployments towards the active service {{requirements of the}} Vietnam Medal, the Australian Active Service Medal, or the Returned From Active Service Badge: the Department of Defence had attempted to limit the cost of repatriation benefits by taking the stance that these ships were not eligible as they were not in combat. Following numerous campaigns to change this, the Australian government issued the Returned from <b>Active</b> Service <b>Badge</b> to all these personnel in 1986, and allowed them to receive military service pensions. Further campaigning and legal challenges resulted {{in the creation of}} the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal in 1992, which was presented as a campaign medal to personnel who did not meet the requirements for the Vietnam Medal, but were still involved in the conflict. Similar efforts were made to have Sydneys service recognised with a battle honour: according to Nott and Payne, such a battle honour is yet to be awarded as of 2008, although a 2006 Department of Defence press release lists the honour [...] "Vietnam 1965–72" [...] among those awarded to the ship.

In his letter, Catchlove compared the UNTAG operation to two subsequent operations: the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment deployment to Somalia during Operation Solace and the deployment of service personnel as part of the International Force for East Timor: [...] "both of those operations involved robust rules of engagement appropriate to the intervention of forces in UN-sanctioned, US or Australian-led multi-national coalitions. UNTAG by way of contrast was a classic peacekeeping operation led by the UN in a relatively benign environment where rules of engagement were focused only on force protection". Catchlove questioned the [...] "half-hearted approach to implementing this appalling decision" [...] in which eligible people must apply for the upgrade, saying this [...] "failed the test of commonsense".|$|R

Subjects and method: 99 male styrene exposed workers were examined. During their lamination activities the average styrene concentrations in air ranged between 30 to 60 ppm (maximum: 205 ppm). The laminators were followed during an usual workweek from Monday to Thursday. The external styrene exposure was measured by means of passive <b>active</b> carbon <b>badges.</b> The excretion of mandelic acid (MA) and phenyl glyoxylic acid (PGA) in endof-shift urine samples was used to quantify the internal styrene load. During the work shift some laminators did not use respiratory protection masks. The majority used either a half face mask with active carbon filter or an air purifying respirator. Results: The respiratory masks were worn during an average between 31 % and 72 % of the work time. The styrene concentrations of the ambient air were-depending on the activity- in the range of 30 to 60 ppm. The end-ofshift concentrations of MA and PGA in urine samples varied considerably, their means range from 153 to 606 mg/g creatinine.
