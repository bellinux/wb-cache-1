Searching for a job in order to get money for an abortion, Kuzma was introduced to Roger's friend Lynn for whom she started working as <b>a</b> <b>babysitter.</b> Lynn offered to help her solve her job problems by getting her a fake driver's license ID. Her new ID, with the name of Kristie Elizabeth Nussman, stated she was 22 rather than 15. She ran away from home and ended up on the streets of Hollywood where she landed a job as a nude model. After appearing in a nude centerfold in Penthouse magazine (she was only 15 when the photos were taken), Kuzma became nationally known as Traci Lords.

25|$|In his {{statement}} to the Senate Budget Committee, Mulvaney {{admitted that he had}} failed to pay $15,000 in payroll taxes from 2000-04 for a nanny he had hired to care for his triplets. Mulvaney said he did not pay the taxes because he viewed the woman as <b>a</b> <b>babysitter</b> rather than as a household employee. After filling out a questionnaire from the Trump transition team, he realized the lapse and began the process of paying back taxes and fees. Senate Democrats noted that Republicans had previously insisted that past Democratic nominees' failure to pay taxes for their household employees was disqualifying, including former Health and Human Services nominee Tom Daschle in 2009.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Katy {{is initially}} hired to babysit, though {{it turns out}} that there is no baby. Previous horror films, including When a Stranger Calls, have made use of <b>a</b> <b>babysitter</b> as a plot device, and an urban legend involves <b>a</b> <b>babysitter</b> downstairs with a threat upstairs. Both the viewer and the babysitter learn about the environment together, with both beginning in a position of ignorance. For Pemberton, the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment into the unknown. In [...] "The Harrowing", he suggests, it is obvious that there is something in the bedroom. The writers experimented with different endings, in an attempt to make the bedroom's contents interesting and genuinely scary.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of series two, Shakespeare was still missing and {{believed}} dead. Thomas Flower of the Kalahari Meerkat Project explained the lack of certainty by noting that [...] "...meerkats are often killed defending pups, Shakespeare was <b>a</b> <b>babysitter</b> {{the day before and}} Lazuli were in the area. However it is equally possible that he was killed by a predator, dispersed to another group, or was killed by another group whilst trying to join them, we just weren't there on that particular day."

500|$|The episode's script parodied {{parents who}} voiced strong {{opposition}} to South Park, portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that {{they fail to}} pay attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives.

This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, [...] "I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as <b>a</b> <b>babysitter</b> and the sole educator of their kids." ...|$|E
