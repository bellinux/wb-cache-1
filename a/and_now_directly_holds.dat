Software Reliability & Quality Assurance (SRQA) for Safety-Critical Software (SCS) having the key role in mission success. The term Safety-Critical Software means software systems whose failure may lead to loss of life or severe injury like software used for missile, satellite, cancer radiation therapy machine etc. Every country now a day’s emphasize on faster approach for developing mission.

The House of Representatives obtained much more influence, <b>and</b> was <b>now</b> <b>directly</b> elected (although still by a restricted group of voters within a system of single-winner electoral districts). The reform was in some sense a peaceful revolution, in which liberal politician Johan Rudolph Thorbecke and King William II played important roles.|$|R
