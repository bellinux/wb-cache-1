40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} the new “multicultural phase” <b>anthologies</b> of American literature treat American history. <b>Anthologies</b> of American literature are more historical, more diverse, and more multidisciplinary than ever before, but they have over-extended themselves in both their historical and representational reach. They are not, despite their diversity and historicism, effective vehicles for promoting critical discussions of American history in the classroom. Chapter One outlines {{a brief history of}} <b>anthologies</b> of American literature, while also introducing the terminology and methodology used in this study. Chapter Two explores the role of the headnote as a vehicle for American history in <b>anthologies</b> by focusing on headnotes to Abraham Lincoln in multiple <b>anthologies.</b> Chapter Three examines how <b>anthologies</b> frame Native American origin stories for their readers. Chapter Four focuses on the issues raised by anthologizing texts originally composed in Spanish, and Chapter Five argues for a transnational broadening of the “slavery theme” in <b>anthologies</b> to include Barbary captivity narratives and texts that reference Indian slavery...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the (emergent) {{phenomenon}} of <b>anthologies</b> of European literature in relation to the process of Europeanization. The topic seems to be timely, for one of the results of the European Union’s education policies is a renewed interest in the meanings of “European literature” and how to teach it. For academia, <b>anthologies</b> represent both an important pedagogical tool and a key instrument for charting un/explored literary territories. My analysis is restricted to three case-studies: 1) the “European heritage” in US <b>anthologies</b> of world literature, 2) the forging of new ideas about European literature by way of <b>anthologies</b> which do not focus on “canonical” writers, and 3) private <b>anthologies</b> by model-writers. <b>Anthologies</b> are not conceived here as an aim in themselves—although new <b>anthologies</b> of European literature are certainly necessary—but as an opportunity to open up discussion about alternative pedagogical practices demanded by both the new context of the European Higher Education Area and the paradoxical but nonetheless fruitful relations between the European Union and Europe...|$|R

5|$|In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly {{suggested}} that Aldington should {{produce a new}} Imagist <b>anthology.</b> Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and {{enlisted the help of}} Ford and H.D.

50|$|Keepers of the Code is {{the first}} book-length history of English-Canadian {{literary}} <b>anthologies</b> from 1837 to the present.
