30|$|This study {{presents}} the DNA barcode sequences of the Blackbuck (<b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra)</b> from Haryana, India. A dataset of 43 partial COI sequences of 13 species belonging to 4 genus of Antilopinae sub- family {{were used for}} molecular analysis and to construct the phylogenetic tree to elucidate the species diversity among sub-family Anitlopinae. The data comprised of generated sequences of the Blackbuck (n[*]=[*] 22) and with additional COI sequences of the related species (n[*]=[*] 21) showing maximum homology with Blackbuck COI sequence were downloaded from NCBI-GenBank for wide coverage of inter and intra-specific nucleotide diversity.|$|R
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} blackbuck is <b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra.</b> Its generic name stems from the Latin word antalopus ("horned animal"). The specific name cervicapra is composed of the Latin words cervus ("deer") and capra ("she-goat"). The vernacular name [...] "blackbuck" [...] is {{a reference to the}} dark brown to black colour of the dorsal (upper) part of the coat of the male. The earliest recorded use of this name dates back to 1850. Alternative names for the blackbuck are [...] "Indian antelope", kadiyal, kala hiran, krishna mrig and krishnasaar (in Hindi); krishna jinka (in Telugu); and iralai maan (in Tamil).|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{this present}} study {{developed}} a species-specific barcoding (COI) sequence for Indian Blackbuck (<b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra)</b> from Haryana, India. It demonstrated a high potential to identify Blackbuck antelopes from their sympatric species in wildlife-related (poaching) crimes and in conservation activities. Published barcode sequences in both NCBI and BOLD databases {{serve as a}} wildlife forensic tool {{that can be used}} to solve Blackbuck-related crimes. The study’s results reaffirmed the significance of the DNA barcode gene in wildlife forensics; the findings can be used to discriminate species within the Bovidae family as well as other animals that have been recognized through prior taxonomic work.|$|R

25|$|Some {{wildlife}} species, {{which are}} fast vanishing {{in other parts}} of India, are found in the desert in large numbers such as the blackbuck (<b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra),</b> chinkara (Gazella bennettii) and Indian wild ass (Equus hemionus khur) in the Rann of Kutch. They have evolved excellent survival strategies, their size is smaller than other similar animals living in different conditions, and they are mainly nocturnal. There are certain other factors responsible for the survival of these animals in the desert. Due to the lack of water in this region, transformation of the grasslands into cropland has been very slow. The protection provided to them by a local community, the Bishnois, is also a factor. Other mammals of the Thar Desert include a subspecies of red fox (Vulpes vulpes pusilla) and the caracal.|$|R
30|$|To solve crimes {{related to}} Blackbuck {{wildlife}} poaching around the world, {{the utility of}} these DNA barcodes will {{play an important role}} in the wildlife forensics because they provide a reliable and cost-efficient tool for species identification. Although identification through BOLD and the NCBI-GenBank shows 99 – 100 % matching with <b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra</b> sequences, the low number of sequence availability reflects a serious limitation in the database-based identity. Prior to this study, only four or five COI sequences were available in the NCBI-GenBank, and only one submission was available in the Public Data Portal of the COI record in the BOLD system. After submitting the sequences to both databases, a comparatively rich database is now available for Blackbuck, showing its high potential for use in wildlife forensic investigation; this will further help conserve this species.|$|R

In addition, the divisional forest officer of Deogarh captured a pangolin (scaly ant-eater) and two porcupines, and the divisional forest officer of Puri captured a pair of wild boars and a Python. All of these animals were delivered to the Delhi fair and exhibited at the Odisha pavilion.|$|R
40|$|In February 2012, a {{reproductive}} {{group of}} 60 adult blackbucks (<b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra)</b> from Veracruz, Mexico was relocated to hunting units in eastern and northeastern Mexico.

The blackbucks’ population displayed a general mortality rate of 11. 67 %, where 25 % of total male and 9. 62 % of total female died. The mortality was controlled by segregation of all remaining blackbucks and the treatment for internal and external parasites (biting flies and ticks). After the treatment, no fatality cases related to parasitosis were recorded.

50|$|Regionally, {{the park}} forms {{part of the}} Western Africa Marine ecoregion. It {{encompasses}} a range of types of wetlands and vegetation, from freshwater marsh to sand spits and brackish lagoons. Rhizophora mangrove forest is abundant in the park, and scrub forest is found on Jinack Island and Mbankam spit. The Atlantic coast is heavily populated with Sterna dougallii. The swamp and mudflats are an important sheltering ground for birds, with over 200 species found here. 293 species from 63 families have been recorded of avifauna. Many species found in the park are vulnerable or endangered including the Green turtle, Humpback dolphin, Red Colobus and manatees such as Trichechus senegalensis. In the forested areas of the park, there are significant populations of Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), Vervet Monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops), Spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), Blackbuck (<b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra)</b> and Desert warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus).|$|R

On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe data {{provided}} {{is related to}} the article “Phylogenetic analyses of gazelles reveal repeated transitions of key ecological traits and provide novel insights into the origin of the genus Gazella” [1]. The data is based on 48 tissue samples of all nine extant species of the genus Gazella, namely Gazella gazella, Gazella arabica, Gazella bennettii, Gazella cuvieri, Gazella dorcas, Gazella leptoceros, Gazella marica, Gazella spekei, and Gazella subgutturosa and four related taxa (Saiga tatarica, Antidorcas marsupialis, <b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra</b> and Eudorcas rufifrons). It comprises alignments of sequences of a cytochrome b data set and of six nuclear intron markers. For the latter new primers were designed based on cattle and sheep genomes.

40|$|In this study, the rumen {{metabolism}} of four ruminant species – blackbuck (<b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra),</b> {{barbary sheep}} (Ammotragus lervia), sika deer (Cervus nippon dybowskii) and addax antelope (Addax nasomaculatus) – from the Nuremberg Zoo {{was investigated in}} relation to their feeding management. Parameters of microbial fermentation in the rumen as well as rumen tissue samples were examined. Additionally, the offered and refused food was weighed, analysed and a dietary intake calculation for these ruminant species was performed. Three of the four ruminant species – blackbuck, barbary sheep and addax antelope – all grazers, showed severe characteristics of subacute ruminal acidosis due to a diet high in fermentable carbohydrates (NfE ≥ 55 % of DM basis) and low in fibre (XF ≤ 18 % of DM basis). This was indicated by numerous microabscesses within the rumen mucosa. These results demonstrate that subacute ruminal acidosis is still a severe problem in captive wild ruminants, which are often fed inappropriate diets with a high concentration of easily digestible carbohydrates...|$|R

50|$|Kurten {{made the}} {{explicit}} correlation that Hippocamelus {{was related to}} Navahoceros, only differing by having two, instead of three antler tines, and he thus considered Hippocamelus implicitly to be homologous to chamois and ibex. However, Hippocamelus grow 4 and even 5 tines on each antler, invalidating Kurten's claim, and regarding skeletal proportion, he provided no data on Hippocamelus. Recently, complete appendages were compared between Hippocamelus bisulcus, Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), ibex, Himalayan Tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Navahoceros, Chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), Ovis ammon, Tule elk (Cervus nannodes), Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), Odocoileus lucasi, Red deer (Cervus elaphus), and <b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra.</b> Huemul morphology did not overlap with rock climbing species previously considered analogous, but falls {{within the range of}} other cervids.

30|$|India {{is known}} as a mega {{biodiversity}} nation for its abundant wild flora and fauna, but the country is not untouched by the problem of biodiversity loss and the need to implement conservation efforts to protect its vulnerable biodiversity. Although Haryana, a state {{in the northern part of}} India, is deficient in natural forests, but it has a rich biodiversity of some wild animals, especially Blackbuck antelopes (<b>Antilope</b> <b>cervicapra).</b> The Blackbuck is native to the Indian subcontinent, and it is protected as a scheduled-I animal under the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act, enacted by the Indian government (Kumar et al. 2017). Once, Blackbuck antelopes were abundant and ranged throughout Haryana, but now their population has been marginalized and confined to the southwestern part of Haryana, and are nearly to extinct in the rest of the state due to increases in wildlife poaching, infrastructure development, and biotic interference. The alarming rate of the population depletion of the Blackbuck has brought it to the verge of extinction, and this is a matter of concern for the state.|$|R
