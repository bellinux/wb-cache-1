So I was just one angry {{abandoned}} girl. I'm still angry. The part of me that goes around saying [...] "Fuck you! Fuck you!"

"I {{listened to}} it on my crappy {{computer}} speakers <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to go find my headphones because as soon as I listened to a few bars, I had to listen more closely and I got chills. I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.' It made me feel so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> sat around for three or four. And now I was going {{to sit in the}} dark, and I could only see out of one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Artpop {{coincided with the}} Born This Way Ball. Zedd was {{not happy with the}} initial outcome of the recordings and so he suggested Gaga to re-do the whole process. Gaga's idea of recording the songs with Zedd was to not limit themselves with the intention of creating a staple radio hit, instead be creative in whichever way they wanted. He explained to Rolling Stone that they did not [...] "try to make an EDM album — but, at the same time, we didn't try not to make an EDM album. I've done a lot of stuff that's really outside of what I usually do. There was one song that started from her just giving me, like, 10 words to describe an emotion, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make this into music. It's been a very experimental way of approaching music." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E

As the performance finished, there was a notable stunned silence from the audience, before bursting into applause. Adele has since described this performance as a career defining moment. [...] Later, she performed the song at the 2011 BRIT Awards held at The O2 Arena in London on 15 February 2011.

Speaking on the ITV2 after show, Adele explained why she had cried at the end of the performance saying, [...] "I was really emotional by the end because I'm quite overwhelmed by everything anyway, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a vision of my ex, of him watching me at home and he's going to be laughing at me because he knows I'm crying because of him, with him thinking, 'Yep, she's still wrapped around my finger'. Then everyone stood up, so I was overwhelmed." [...] A writer of Daily Mirror said that [...] "Adele stole the show [...] with her praised performance of Someone Like You." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph chose the song as a highlight on the show saying that Adele knocked [...] "everyone for six with no bells and whistles, just a piano, her gorgeous voice and a monster song, Someone Like You."
