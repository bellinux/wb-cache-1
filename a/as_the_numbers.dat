5|$|In 1940 some of {{the class}} were reallocated to Crewe North (5A) and Glasgow Polmadie (27A, 66A from 1950). <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> grew, Crewe North was {{generally}} the beneficiary, but in 1946 Carlisle Upperby (12B, 12A from 1958), received an initial allocation of six locomotives. At various times locomotives were also seconded to Liverpool Edge Hill (8A). A typical allocation of the 1950s was Camden 15, Crewe North 10, Polmadie 9 and Upperby 4.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E
5|$|Similar effects {{should be}} found for other {{attributes}} connected to the self, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
50|$|Accuracy {{increases}} overall <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> {{of words}} used increase, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of dimensions increases.

25|$|When {{the first}} wave of emigrants left Quebec, the local {{government}} did not pay much attention <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> were relatively small. However, when the emigration began to increase and the provincial economy was going through a depression, leaders of the province attempted to halt the emigration. The church warned of hell being destined for those who decided to leave. Nevertheless, more than 200,000 left between 1879–1901.|$|E
25|$|Different {{ethnic and}} {{linguistic}} groups have produced works {{in their own}} languages. Chinese and Indian literature became common <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of speakers increased in Malaysia, and locally produced works based in languages from those areas began to be produced in the 19thcentury. Beginning in the 1950s, Chinese literature expanded; homemade literature in Indian languages has failed to emerge. English has become a common literary language.|$|E

50|$|Though the {{proportion}} of heads (and tails) approaches 1/2, almost surely the absolute difference in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of heads and tails will become large <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of flips becomes large.

Also, almost surely the ratio of the absolute difference to <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of flips will approach zero.

There is public transportation {{service in the}} Kabul vicinity, but many roads are in disrepair. Drivers are also impeded by {{the large number of}} cyclists. More vehicles are seen in the city because people are purchasing cars. Taxi cabs are found everywhere in the city, also in most of the districts of Kabul.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of birdwatchers increases, {{there is}} growing concern {{about the impact of}} birdwatching on the birds and their habitat. Birdwatching {{etiquette}} is evolving in response to this concern. Some examples of birdwatching etiquette include promoting the welfare of birds and their environment, limiting use of photography, pishing and playback devices to mitigate stress caused to birds, maintaining a distance away from nests and nesting colonies, and respecting private property.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of POWs {{joining the}} legion swelled, the legion {{was moved to}} Königsbrück for further training. It was at Königsbrück that uniforms were first issued, in German feldgrau with the badge of the leaping tiger of Azad Hind. The {{formation}} of the Indian National Army was announced by the German Propaganda Ministry in January 1942. It did not, however, take oath until 26 August 1942, as the Legion Freies Indien of the German Army. By May 1943, the numbers had swelled, aided by the enlistment as volunteers of Indian expatriates.|$|E

25|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the battle, the rebels' {{plans to take}} Tripoli were revealed. The National Transitional Council had {{been in contact with}} rebel cells inside Tripoli, including employees of the Gaddafi government sympathetic to the opposition's cause. Officers within Gaddafi's military and intelligence services gathered data on memory cards and sent them back to the NTC in Benghazi. The data contained invaluable information {{on the state of the}} regime, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of people working in various facilities and the military capabilities of loyalist forces based in Tripoli. The plan was reportedly two months in the making.|$|E
25|$|These {{markings}} {{were effective}} {{within a mile}} of the viewer, but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of groups increased from sixteen to forty, assembly difficulties increased. In February 1944 the USAAF decided to discontinue further camouflage painting of its aircraft, and the 2nd Bomb Division devised a system for its B-24s whereby the entire tail fin was painted in a color (each of its five combat wings was assigned a color) and a black or white band placed across the fin either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to identify the group within that wing. The 93rd CBW of the 3rd Air Division, which operated B-24s from May to September 1944, also adopted a color system in June.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of {{settlers}} {{from the}} mainland increased (at first mostly prisoners and involuntary indentured labourers, later purposely recruited farmers), these indigenous people lost territory and numbers {{in the face of}} punitive expeditions by British troops, land encroachment and various epidemic diseases. Presently, there remain only approximately 400–450 indigenous Andamanese. The Jangil were soon extinct. The Great Andamanese were originally 10 distinct tribes with 5,000 people in total; most of the tribes are extinct, and the survivors, now just 52, speak mostly Hindi. The Onge are reduced to less than 100 people. Only the Jarawa and Sentinelese still maintain a steadfast independence and refuse most attempts at contact; their numbers are uncertain but estimated to be in the low hundreds.|$|E
