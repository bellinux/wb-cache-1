The experiment consisted of four rates of poultry manure (0, 3. 0, 6. 0 and 9 t ha - 1) and two planting arrangement (single alternate row and double <b>alternate</b> <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> arrangement). The eight treatment combinations were {{laid out in a}} randomized complete block design with four replications. The results obtained in both the years showed that sesame when grown with groundnut under different rates of poultry manure and planting arrangement appeared to be a dominant crop as indicated by its higher values of Land equivalent ratio, competitive ratio, higher and positive values for aggressivity and area time equivalent ratio. Application of 6 t ha - 1 of poultry manure and double <b>alternate</b> <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> arrangement produced the highest values for all the competition indices measured respectively. </p...|$|E

40|$|Field {{experiments}} to identify suitable planting method under potato + maize {{system in the}} high hill (2200 m) of eastern Nepal Sindhuwa, Dhankuta, was conducted during 2000 and 2001 seasons for the potato variety Hale and maize variety Ganesh 1. Of the different planting methods tested, significantly the highest yield of potato (15. 5 t/ha) was recorded from the <b>alternate</b> <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> followed by recommended practice and flat row planting. Early emergence (by 7 - 12 days) was in farmers ' practice, whereas uniform plants (1 - 5 scale) observed in flat row and double row planting. Maize did not follow this trend. Double row and farmer's practice favored good ground coverage (80 - 95 %) by potato plants, which attained height from 49. 8 cm (farmer's practice) to 56. 8 cm (flat row). Number of main stems/plant was higher in all treatments, except farmer's practice. Similar trend was followed in tuber numbers. Maturity of crops did not depend on planting methods. Final stand of potato ranged between 46. 9 (alternate row) and 68. 6 thousand/ha (farmer's practice). Late blight and bacterial wilt infection was higher in the farmers' practice. The height of maize plants was significantly differed between sole cropping (220 cm), which yielded higher followed by alternate row (183 cm) and flat row plantings. Gross income from maize and potato was higher in flat row planting. The data revealed that alternate row and flat row planting methods were superior over the common farmers' practice and the recommended practice, so the identified planting methods were recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{out-crossing}} ratio, isolation distance and pollinator insects in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) was studied in a two-year study in Turkey. Plant materials were Maras- 92 (a standard variety), Mc Namara (red plant) and NGF- 63 (a glandless variety). The out-crossing ratio was determined in plot combinations where Maras- 92 with Mc Namara and Maras- 92 with NGF- 63 were <b>planted</b> separately as <b>alternated</b> <b>rows</b> and <b>plants.</b> The out-crossing ratio in between alternated plants was 3. 75 and 4. 6 %, {{while it was}} 3. 25 and 3. 84 % in between <b>alternated</b> <b>rows</b> for Mc Namara and Maras- 92 in 2001 and 2002, respectively. The same ratio was 7. 5 and 13. 58 % in alternated plants and 5. 5 % and 12. 61 % in <b>alternated</b> <b>rows</b> for NGF- 63 and Maras- 92 in both years, respectively. The out-crossing ratio for isolation distance was 3. 75 and 0. 25 % at 1 st and 12 th rows, respectively, in 2001, while it was 5. 6 and 0. 10 % in rows a 1 and a 13; 5. 27 %, 0. 32 % and 0. 0 % in rows b 1, b 8 and b 9, respectively, in 2002. It can be concluded that 12 to 13 rows (8 to 9 m) can provide good separation for isolation distance in cotton.

40|$|Promising {{varieties}} of cowpea {{were found to}} be adaptable in the derived savannah; however, their performances in intercropping systems have not been investigated. Therefore, there is the need to investigate the effect of spatial arrangement of maize/cowpea on the performance of maize and cowpea. The experiment was a 2 x 5 factorial in randomized complete block design. A field experiment was conducted at Federal College of Education, Osiele, Abeokuta, Nigeria during the late cropping seasons of 2009 and 2010. The intercrop proportion mixture and population adopted in this study were additive and replacement series while Oloyin and Sokoto cowpea varieties were combined with TZESR-W maize variety as follows: Oloyin + maize in <b>alternate</b> <b>row,</b> Oloyin + maize in <b>alternate</b> <b>row,</b> Oloyin + maize in alternate stand, Oloyin + maize in strip cropping, Sokoto + maize in <b>alternate</b> <b>row,</b> Sokoto + maize in <b>alternate</b> <b>row,</b> Sokoto + maize in alternate stand, Sokoto + maize in strip cropping, sole maize, Sole cowpea. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was used to determine the productivity of the intercrop. The grain yield of cowpea obtained from <b>alternate</b> <b>row</b> intercrop and sole cowpea for 2009 and 2010 were similar. However, the grain yield of cowpea obtained from <b>alternate</b> <b>row</b> was 33, 37 and 59 % higher than <b>alternated</b> stand, <b>alternate</b> <b>row</b> replacement and strip crop, respectively. Oloyin variety had significantly higher grain yield than Sokoto. Interaction of cowpea variety x spatial arrangement x cropping season was significant on 1000 -seed weight. The two additive series had higher land equivalent ratio compared to replacement series. Maize yield was not affected in two additive series. In conclusion, intercrop was more productive than sole. The two additives arrangement enhances the performance grain yield of maize, Oloyin and Sokoto cowpea varieties...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the perceptions, impacts, and rewards of farmers who adopted <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> {{for the production}} of teff as a result of being exposed to a technology promotion campaign for <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> of teff in the Oromia region of Ethiopia. Our three main findings are as follows. First, despite a positive attitude towards <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> (and reduced seed rates in general) and a belief in the (large) yield increasing potential of <b>row</b> <b>planting,</b> exposed farmers only put a relatively small part of their plots aside for <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> in the next planting season. This indicates concerns with the additional labor requirement and possibly the need for more knowledge and experience with the new technology. Second, by implementing <b>row</b> <b>planting,</b> farmers experienced an increase in teff yield {{in the first year of}} implementation, but there was also a substantial increase in labor input requirements. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the increase in teff yield outweighs the cost of the extra labor in the first year of adoption when yields increase by 8 percent or more. Third, suitable mechanization for <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> would change the cost-benefit picture significantly and is shown to be an investment with possible high returns. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Improved {{technologies}} {{are increasingly being}} promoted to farmers in sub-Saharan-African countries to address low agricultural productivity in their staple crops. There is, however, a lack of evidence on how adoption affects farmers’ labor use and profitability at the farm level, {{as well as the}} importance gender roles play. This paper analyses the labor and profitability impact of the recently introduced <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> technology in teff production in Ethiopia. Based on agronomic evidence in experimental settings, the government of Ethiopia has focused extension efforts on promoting the widespread uptake of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> to address low teff yields, replacing the traditional broadcasting method of planting teff. Using an innovative Randomized Controlled Trial set-up, we show that the implementation of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> at the farm level significantly increases total labor use, but not teff yields, relative to broadcast planting, resulting in a substantial drop in labor productivity when adopting <b>row</b> <b>planting.</b> Moreover, the implementation of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> has important consequences for inter- and intra-household labor allocation, with relatively more use of non-family labor. The adoption of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> was further found not to be profitable for farmers {{in the first year of}} the promotion cam-paign, seemingly explaining the limited success in up-scaling the adoption of the technology by farmers in the second year of the program.

Foi utilizado o delineamento blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições. Os espaçamentos entre plantas foram de 40 cm para fáfia e de 30 cm para tansagem. O tipo de cultivo e os espaçamentos entre fileiras não influenciaram significativamente a produção de massa fresca e seca da parte aérea e das raízes da fáfia. Na tansagem foi observado efeito significativo da forma de cultivo em todas as características avaliadas e do número de fileiras para o número de pendões. As alturas máximas das plantas de fáfia foram de 185 cm e 183 cm, aos 172 e 164 dias após o transplante, sob cultivo solteiro, nos espaçamentos de 54 cm e 36 cm, respectivamente.
