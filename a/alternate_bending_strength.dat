The variability in <b>bending</b> <b>strength</b> and MOE appeared to be higher for treated posts and as a result the 5 % values decreased, especially for the <b>bending</b> <b>strength.</b> The MOE was dependent on density for both treated and untreated posts, but this was not so for the <b>bending</b> <b>strength.</b> There appeared to be a relationship between the <b>bending</b> <b>strength</b> and the MOE, although it was rather weak, especially for treated posts.
