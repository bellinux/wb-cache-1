5|$|In 1988, the Australian Government {{formed the}} Federal <b>Airports</b> Corporation (FAC), placing Melbourne Airport under the {{operational}} {{control of the}} new corporation along with 21 other <b>airports</b> around the nation. In April 1994, the Australian Government announced that all <b>airports</b> operated by Federal <b>Airports</b> Corporation would be privatised in several phases. Melbourne Airport {{was included in the}} first phase, being acquired by the newly formed Australia Pacific <b>Airports</b> Corporation Limited for $1.3 billion. The transfer was completed on 30 June 1997 on a 50-year long-term lease, with the option for a further 49 years. Melbourne Airport is categorised as a Leased Commonwealth Airport.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia {{possesses}} 673 <b>airports</b> in 2013, {{ranging from}} grand international <b>airports</b> to modest unpaved airstrips on remote islands or inland interior areas located throughout the archipelago. In November 2011, Indonesia {{had more than}} 230 conventional <b>airports,</b> most of them operated by Transportation Ministry technical operation units and state-owned PT Angkasa Pura I & II. Major <b>airports</b> are managed by Angkasa Pura; Angkasa Pura I operates 13 <b>airports</b> in Eastern Indonesia, while Angkasa Pura II operates 13 <b>airports</b> in Western Indonesia. After the 2000 aviation deregulation, Indonesian <b>airports</b> endured a surge of passengers, especially catalyzed by the advent of low-cost carriers. According to the Indonesian Transportation Ministry, 9 of the 13 <b>airports</b> managed by PT Angkasa Pura I have exceeded their passenger capacity.|$|E

5|$|A committee, led by Erik Himle {{and later}} Preben Munthe, was {{appointed}} in 1962 to consider additional <b>airports</b> in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle {{was about to}} the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new <b>airports</b> be built which could serve jetliners, including one airport in Florø. Widerøe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller <b>airports</b> be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller <b>airports</b> could be built and operated at lower cost than larger <b>airports,</b> but both <b>airports</b> and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population.|$|E
5|$|A crucial safety {{aspect of}} {{international}} <b>airports</b> is medical facilities and practices. In particular, controlling transmissible disease, such as SARS, is deemed important at international <b>airports.</b> While these standards are regulated by ICAO Standards And Recommended Practices (SARPs) and WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR), local authorities have considerable say {{in how they}} are implemented.|$|E

5|$|Air traffic {{services}} for all UK airspace {{is provided by}} National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which also provides air traffic control at 15 <b>airports.</b> The largest airport operator is BAA Limited, owner of six UK <b>airports</b> including London Heathrow airport. In some cases airport ownership {{is in the hands}} of local government authorities rather than private businesses, and the largest UK owned operator, Manchester <b>Airports</b> Group, operator of Manchester Airport, Bournemouth Airport, East Midlands Airport, and Humberside Airport, is owned by a consortium of 10 Manchester area local authorities. Whilst the number of <b>airports</b> in the UK runs into hundreds, many are smaller aerodromes dealing with general aviation rather than air transport. In terms of the latter, statistics are collected from 59 main <b>airports,</b> and the largest concentration of services is located in the London and South East of England areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Airports</b> can be towered or non-towered, {{depending}} on air traffic density and available funds. Because of high capacity and busy airspace, many international <b>airports</b> have {{air traffic control}} located on site.|$|E

5|$|Avinor {{wants to}} extend most short <b>airports</b> to 1200 m by year 2030, {{because they see}} a lack of {{aircraft}} types which have more than 19 seats able to use 800-meter runways.

Few countries apart from Norway have such short <b>airports.</b> There is however no room for this at Hasvik, so the plan here and for some other <b>airports</b> with few passengers, is to use small planes with less than 20 seats.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, {{travelers}} and the aircraft can clear customs and immigration at the departure airport.

5|$|In the U.S., <b>airports</b> are {{required}} to obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated. Large new <b>airports</b> {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. <b>Airports</b> that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the FAA {{mandates}} {{the taking}} of weather observations at larger <b>airports</b> for safety reasons.
