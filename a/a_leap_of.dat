5|$|The third contest had Shane McMahon against Eric Bischoff in a {{standard}} match. McMahon and Bischoff began by brawling on the arena ramp, as Jonathan Coachman appeared from the backstage area and hit McMahon with a steel chair. Bischoff grabbed a microphone and announced that the match would be contested under no disqualification, falls count anywhere regulations; as a result, Bischoff could not be disqualified for Coachman's interference. Coachman and Bischoff performed double-team attacks on McMahon until Steve Austin interfered by performing a Stone Cold Stunners on Coachman and Bischoff. After Austin's interference, McMahon positioned Bischoff on the television commentators' table, performed <b>a</b> <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> Faith onto Bischoff's chest, thereby breaking the table and covered Bischoff for the pinfall.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{argue for}} the {{necessity}} of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of Søren Kierkegaard, who viewed belief in God as <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> faith that sometimes directly opposed reason. This is also the doctrine of Gordon Clark's presuppositional apologetics, with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also Fideism).|$|E
25|$|In Kierkegaard's meaning, purely {{theological}} assertions are subjective truths {{and they}} cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge. For him, choosing {{if one is}} for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice. He calls the jump from objective knowledge to religious faith <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> faith, since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified. For him the Christian faith {{is the result of}} the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices). Objectively regarded, purely theological assertions are neither true nor false.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commentators}} associate Jaspers {{with the}} philosophy of existentialism, {{in part because he}} draws largely upon the existentialist roots of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and in part because the theme of individual freedom permeates his work. In Philosophy (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method simply cannot transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> faith toward what Jaspers calls Transcendence. In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls Existenz, and can finally experience authentic existence.|$|E

25|$|The real {{exchange}} rate appreciated through 1981 and 1982, public sector investment rose 54 percent {{in real terms}} from 1979 to 1982, and public sector consumption rose 25 percent during the same three-year period. The combination effectively turned the current-account surplus into a large deficit, as increased spending plus import liberalization practically doubled imports {{of goods and services}} between 1979 and 1981. The appreciation also turned manufacturing exports back downward, and a plunge in external prices of primary exports brought them down too. And then the mistake of focusing on the earlier export surplus as the main cause of inflation became clear: the increases in spending led to <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> inflation despite the return to an external deficit. The rate of inflation went from 59 percent in 1980 to 111 percent by 1983.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match, AJ Styles faced Shane McMahon. During the match, Styles {{attempted}} a springboard 450° splash on Shane, who countered into a triangle choke on Styles, who then countered into a one-armed Styles Clash on Shane for a near-fall. After the referee was knocked down, Styles attempted a Coast-to-Coast on Shane, who countered by attacking Styles with {{a trash can}}. Shane then performed a Coast-to-Coast into a trash can on Styles for a near-fall. Shane attempted <b>a</b> <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> Faith through an announce table on Styles, only for Styles {{to move out of}} the way and Shane fell through the announce table. As Styles attempted a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane, Shane countered into a float-over DDT on Styles. Shane attempted a shooting star press on Styles, who avoided the move and performed a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane to win the match.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox.

I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

25|$|Next was a Last Man Standing {{match between}} Kane and Shane McMahon. Before the match began, McMahon {{attacked}} Kane, {{who was doing}} his entrance, with a steel chair. As the referee officially called to ring the bell to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away to block another chair shot. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane. In the end, McMahon attempted <b>a</b> <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> Faith, {{from the top of}} the arena TitanTron, which was roughly 25 feet tall. but Kane moved and McMahon fell through the floor. Kane won the match when McMahon did not stand up in time to answer the referee's 10 count.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Last Man Standing match between Shane McMahon and Kane. On the June 23 episode of Raw, Kane was forced to unmask himself after he had lost a Mask vs. Title match to Triple H. Shortly after Kane unmasked himself, Kane turned on and chokeslammed his tag team partner Rob Van Dam. Three weeks later on the July 14 episode of Raw, during an {{interview}} between Kane and Jim Ross, Kane set Jim Ross on fire after {{he thought he was}} mocking him. The following week on Raw, after a match between Kane and Van Dam ended in a no-contest, Linda McMahon came out to try and stop Kane from attacking Van Dam. Kane, however, gave Linda McMahon a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ramp. On the July 28 episode of Raw, Shane McMahon made a surprise appearance by attacking Kane for his actions the week before. The next week on Raw, Eric Bischoff defeated Shane McMahon after Kane interfered and gave McMahon a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ring steps. On August 24 at SummerSlam, Kane defeated Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match, and Shane McMahon defeated Eric Bischoff in a No Disqualification Falls Count Anywhere match. The following night on Raw, during a match between Shane McMahon and Chris Jericho, Kane interfered and performed a chokeslam on McMahon. Shortly afterwards, McMahon superkicked Kane into a dumpster that was on fire and full of gasoline. On the September 8 episode of Raw, Bischoff announced that McMahon and Kane would face each other in a Last Man Standing match at Unforgiven. The next week on Raw, after both men signed a contract for their match at Unforgiven, McMahon gave Kane multiple low blows, followed by <b>a</b> <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> Faith through an announce table.|$|E
25|$|At the Royal Rumble, AJ Styles {{lost the}} WWE Championship to John Cena. Styles was {{immediately}} {{entered into the}} WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, but SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon also promised Styles {{that he would get}} a one-on-one rematch for the title if he did not win the title back at the pay-per-view. At Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt eliminated both Cena and Styles to win the championship. Cena then immediately invoked his rematch clause, but Styles intervened, stating he should get his first. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then scheduled a triple threat match for the WWE Championship, where Wyatt retained. Randy Orton then refused his right as the Royal Rumble winner to face Wyatt for the title at WrestleMania 33, so Bryan scheduled a 10-man battle royal to determine a new number one-contender. Styles was entered into the battle royal, which ended in a draw between him and Luke Harper. The two faced each other in a number one contender's match the following week. Styles pinned Harper, but the referee did not see Harper's foot on the rope. Shane came out and restarted the match, which angered Styles, even though he would defeat Harper once again. At the conclusion of the show, Orton reclaimed his right to face Wyatt at WrestleMania. Bryan and Shane decided that Styles would have to compete in another number one contender's match, this time against Orton, who won. After the show, an angered Styles got into a heated argument backstage with Shane. The following week, an irate Styles said that he was tired of Bryan and Shane. He said because of them, {{he did not have a}} match at WrestleMania, but Orton, who committed arson, did. Later backstage, Styles attacked Shane and threw him through a car window. Styles was subsequently (kayfabe) fired by Bryan, but at the end of the show, an injured Shane challenged Styles to a match at WrestleMania, which Styles accepted. At the end of the following week's episode, Shane called out Styles and the two brawled, which ended with Shane performing <b>a</b> <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> Faith on Styles through the broadcast table. The following week, the two had a contract signing to make the match official and the two traded barbs.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the notion}} of the 'absurd' pervades all Albert Camus's writing, The Myth of Sisyphus is his chief work on the subject. In it, Camus {{considers}} absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict or a [...] "divorce" [...] between two ideals. Specifically, he defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand– and the silent, cold universe on the other. He continues that there are specific human experiences evoking notions of absurdity. Such a realization or encounter with the absurd leaves the individual with a choice: suicide, <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> faith, or recognition. He concludes that recognition is the only defensible option.|$|E
