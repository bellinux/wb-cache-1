40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} CT truncation in whole-body (WB) PET/CT imaging of large patients, and we evaluated the efficacy of an extended field-of-view (eFOV) correction technique. Methods: Two uniform phantoms simulating a ‘‘torso’ ’ and an ‘‘arms-up’ ’ setup were filled with 18 F-FDG/water. A third, non-uniform ‘‘body phantomwas prepared with hot and cold lesions. All 3 phantoms were positioned {{in the center of}} the PET/CT gan-try with $ 10 % of their volume extending beyond the maximum CT FOV. An eFOV algorithm was used to estimate complete CT projections from nonlinear extrapolation of the truncated pro-jections. CT-based attenuation correction (CT AC) of the phan-tom data was performed using CT images reconstructed from truncated and extended projections. For clinical validation, we processed truncated datasets from 10 PET/CT patients with and without eFOV correction. Results: When using truncated CT images for CT AC, PET tracer distribution was suppressed outside the transverse CT FOV in phantom and patient studies. PET activity concentration in the truncated regions was only 10 %– 32 % of the true value but increased to 84 %– 100 % when using the extended CT images for CT AC. At the same time, the contour of phantoms and patients was recovered to the an-atomically correct shape from the uncorrected emission images, and the apparent distortion of lesions near the maximum CT FOV was reduced. Conclusion: Truncation artifacts in WB PET/CT led to visual and quantitative distortions of the CT and attenuation-corrected PET images in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>truncation.</b> These artifacts can be corrected to improve the accuracy of PET/CT for diagnosis and therapy response evaluation.

40|$|I review {{observations}} <b>of</b> <b>truncations</b> <b>of</b> stellar disks {{and models}} for their origin, compare observations <b>of</b> <b>truncations</b> in moderately inclined galaxies {{to those in}} edge-on systems and discuss the relation between truncations and H I-warps and their systematics and origin. Truncations are a common feature in edge-on stellar disks, but the relation <b>of</b> <b>truncations</b> in face-on to those in edge-on galaxies needs further clarification. The origin <b>of</b> <b>truncations</b> is most likely related to a maximum in the specific angular momentum in the material that formed the stellar disks, but this model does probably require some redistribution of angular momentum. H I-warps start just beyond the truncation radius and disks and warps appear distinct components. This suggests that inner disks form initially and settle as rigid, very flat structures, while H I-warps result from later infall of gas with a different orientation of the angular momentum...|$|R

40|$|Using Non-Redundant Mask {{interferometry}} (NRM), {{we searched}} for binary companions to objects previously classified as Transitional Disks (TD). These objects {{are thought to}} be an evolutionary stage between an optically thick disk and optically thin disk. We investigate the presence of a stellar companion as a possible mechanism of material depletion in the inner region of these disks, which would rule out an ongoing planetary formation process in distances comparable to the binary separation. For our detection limits, we implement a new method of completeness correction using a combination of randomly sampled binary orbits and Bayesian inference. The selected sample of 24 TDs belong to the nearby and young star forming regions: Ophiuchus (∼ 130 pc), Taurus-Auriga (∼ 140 pc) and IC 348 (∼ 220 pc). These regions are suitable to resolve faint stellar companions with moderate to high confidence levels at distances as low as 2 au from the central star. With a total of 31 objects, including 11 known TDs and circumbinary disks from the literature, we have found that a fraction of 0. 38 ± 0. 09 of the SEDs of these objects are likely due to the tidal interaction between a close binary and its disk, while the remaining SEDs are likely the result of other internal processes such as photoevaporation, grain growth, planet disk interactions. In addition, we detected four companions orbiting outside the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the <b>truncation</b> radii and we propose that the IR excesses of these systems are due to a disk orbiting a secondary companionComment: 18 pages, 6 Figures, 11 Table...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} impact <b>of</b> random left <b>truncation</b> <b>of</b> data on the {{estimation}} of time-dependent exposure effects. METHODS: A simulation {{study was conducted in}} which the relation between exposure and outcome was based on an immediate exposure effect, a first-time exposure effect, or a cumulative exposure effect. The individual probability <b>of</b> <b>truncation,</b> the moment <b>of</b> <b>truncation,</b> the exposure rate, and the incidence rate of the outcome were varied in different simulations. All observations before the moment <b>of</b> left <b>truncation</b> were omitted from the analysis. RESULTS: Random left truncation did not bias estimates of immediate exposure effects, but resulted in an overestimation of a cumulative exposure effect and underestimation of a first-time exposure effect. The magnitude of bias in estimation of cumulative exposure effects depends on a combination of exposure rate, probability <b>of</b> <b>truncation,</b> and proportion <b>of</b> follow-up time left truncated. CONCLUSIONS: In case of a cumulative or first-time exposure, left truncation can result in substantial bias in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. The potential for this bias likely differs between databases, which may lead to heterogeneity in estimated exposure effects between studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work is to deliver a consistent patterns <b>of</b> <b>truncation</b> in the internet communication and the factors that initiate the truncation based on the Optimality Theory suggested by McCarthy and Prince 1995, McCarthy 2008. The tasks of {{the research}} are to review the types <b>of</b> <b>truncation</b> in Korean language, to make a detailed analysis of the overall processes <b>of</b> <b>truncation</b> based on analytical tool - the Optimality Theory. Truncated forms in Korean language are mainly observed in the Internet communication, but not in regular communication. There are three main types <b>of</b> <b>truncation</b> in the internet communication. This paper examines the patterns <b>of</b> <b>truncation</b> in internet communication and suggests the major factors triggering truncation and desyllabification. To this end, we employ the basic framework of Optimality Theory (McCarthy & Prince 1995, McCarthy 2008) as our tool of analysis. During the discussion, we invoke several major constrains and show how they interact to represent the surface realization of those new forms. First of all, two major constraints, Truncate-Weak and Recoveralility, indicate that morpho-phonologically weak elements can be truncated only if the original form or meaning can be recovered from the truncated ones. Beside these, the markedness constraints, *Off-glide, *CC, *VV, and *VhV, interact with the faithfulness constraints, such as Max-Initial and Max-σ, in which the markedness constraints are ranked higher than the faithfulness constraints. In any morphological changes the main constraint is RECOVERABILITY. It is also shown that the same analytical method applies to the truncation in English loanwords as well...|$|R
