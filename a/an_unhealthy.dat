5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes {{that it is impossible}} to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. She argues that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of <b>an</b> <b>unhealthy</b> child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important {{in the last couple of}} years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create <b>an</b> <b>unhealthy</b> atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E
5|$|While living indoors {{decreases}} {{the risk of}} contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), being fed <b>an</b> <b>unhealthy</b> diet, and the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health {{to make them more}} prone to specific conditions. Specifically, Tyzzer's disease, protozoic infections (e.g. Giardia muris), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a zoonotic disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with strep throat. A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's immune system is compromised by illness. If this occurs the infection can develop into pneumonia.|$|E

5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive personality trait to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what they thought about the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered <b>an</b> <b>unhealthy</b> state of mind, ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{has been}} pumped {{from the bay}} since 1912, but fishing has been a {{mainstay}} since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $17million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to <b>an</b> <b>unhealthy</b> annual average zinc level of nearly 2500mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc {{is believed to have}} been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz Power Group. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Stress {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{to be involved}} in obesity development. Apart from a direct pathway through cortisol, stress may indirectly facilitate obesity by influencing other lifestyle factors: stressed persons may consume more comfort foods, may have a more sedentary behaviour and may suffer from sleep problems. Methods: In 326 Belgian children (5 - 12 y) of the ChiBS study, the longitudinal relation between stress and body composition was examined over two years. Stress was measured by salivary cortisol (4 samples/day, 2 days) and questionnaires concerning negative life events, problem behaviour and emotions. For body composition, BMI, waist-to-height and fat% estimation by air displacement were used. Furthermore, physical activity, screentime, food consumption, eating behaviour and sleep duration were measured as lifestyle factors. Cross-lagged analyses with Mplus and moderation by cortisol and lifestyle factors were tested. Results: Children with higher stress scores had a less healthy lifestyle. They had <b>an</b> <b>unhealthier</b> diet especially due to more sweet food consumption, performed more emotional eating, were less active and slept less. Two years later, these stressed children maintained the same unhealthy life style except that they were more physical active instead of less. Salivary cortisol and lifestyle were moderators in the stress-obesity relation: stressed children had also more overweight or a higher fat percentage, but only when they had <b>an</b> <b>unhealthier</b> lifestyle or higher cortisol. Discussion: These results confirm that stress can deteriorate lifestyle and cortisol homeostasis already in childhood and that these changes make them vulnerable to overweight. Consequently, obesity prevention should target both lifestyle and stress...|$|R

40|$|In {{many parts}} of our country today, forest health and {{sustainability}} are important management questions. Some individuals and groups have observed that during the past century the emphasis in American forest management on commodity production has, in many cases, contributed to <b>a</b> <b>unhealthy</b> forest landscape. For example, the forestland in eastern Oregon has considerably declined because of the overharvest of commercially valuable ponderosa pine because of over-intensive fire control. In addition to this forest decline problem, public concern has grown about lack of sustainability in traditional (clearcut and replant) timber management. It is increasingly evident that even successful timber management is essentially a systematic conversion of {{both public and private}} forest land to a “tree-farm, ” fiber-production system.

25|$|The fashion {{industry}} is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate <b>an</b> <b>unhealthy</b> and unrealistic body image to the public. In the world of fashion, it often seems as if measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% “felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny”, with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin. Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models, while 46% will strive to achieve it. The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing “the message that <b>an</b> <b>unhealthy</b> body type is the most socially valued”. For eating disorders sufferers, viewing these images could consequently strengthen desires to lose weight.|$|E

40|$|ArticleThe aims of {{the present}} study in {{adolescents}} were 1) to examine how various body composition-screening tests relate to single and clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, 2) to examine how lean mass and body fatness (independently of each other) relate to clustered CVD risk factors and, 3) to calculate specific thresholds for body composition indices associated with <b>an</b> <b>unhealthier</b> clustered CVD risk. We measured 1089 European adolescents (46. 7 % boys, 12. 5 - 17. 49 yr) in 2006 - 2007. CVD risk factors included: systolic blood pressure, maximum oxygen uptake, homeostasis model assessment, C-reactive protein (n= 748), total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Body composition indices included: height, body mass index (BMI), lean mass, the sum of four skinfolds, central/peripheral skinfolds, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Most body composition indices are associated with single CVD risk factors. The sum of four skinfolds, WHtR, BMI, WC and lean mass are strong and positively associated with clustered CVD risk. Interestingly, lean mass is positively associated with clustered CVD risk independently of body fatness in girls. Moderate and highly accurate thresholds for the sum of four skinfolds, WHtR, BMI, WC and lean mass are associated with <b>an</b> <b>unhealthier</b> clustered CVD risk (all AUC > 0. 773). In conclusion, our results support an association between most of the assessed body composition indices and single and clustered CVD risk factors. In addition, lean mass (independent of body fatness) is positively associated with clustered CVD risk in girls, which is a novel finding that helps to understand why an index such as BMI is a good index of CVD risk but a bad index of adiposity. Moderate to highly accurate thresholds for body composition indices associated with a healthier clustered CVD risk were found. Further studies with a longitudinal design are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
