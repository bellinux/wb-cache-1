5|$|The two clubs {{were due}} to meet <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> but the stadium {{disaster}} at Hillsborough, which killed 96 of Liverpool's supporters, meant the fixture was postponed out of respect. It was moved to late May, days after the FA Cup Final which Liverpool won. Arsenal manager George Graham prepared for the match by giving his squad a minibreak and created a calming atmosphere in their training sessions. He adjusted his usual formation to a defensive one to stop Liverpool's attacking threat; David O'Leary was employed as a sweeper in a back five.|$|E
5|$|The typhoon brought {{heavy rain}} and wind to {{areas of the}} Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Taiwan, and {{the east coast of}} China.

5|$|Throughout {{his time}} in the General Assembly, Breckinridge had battled with typhoid fever.

Only then could he be told about the death of his daughter, Louisiana, which had occurred <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier.</b> The illness, combined with the news of the death of his daughter, caused Breckinridge to turn to religion.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave about <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> he stated {{he had been}} a pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one month earlier. U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W. Bush was informed about the situation, but that these were precautionary measures only. The FBI quickly announced {{there was no reason to}} suspect that the crash was an act of terrorism.|$|E

Muki lost in the semifinals by points after his opponent got yuko during the fight. Muki lost the fight for the bronze medal by ippon to Lasha Shavdatuashvili and finished in fifth place. At {{the end of the}} competition, Muki revealed that he suffered from two slipped discs a month before the games and that he ruptured two ankle ligaments <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe had {{suffered}} heavy attrition since {{the opening of}} the Battle of Britain. Just over <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> it possessed 2,226 operational aircraft on 17 August. By 7 September, it had 1,895 aircraft, a drop of 15 percent. Still, most of the losses were being made good by production. During the battle, the Luftwaffe had undergone a major reorganisation. Luftflotte 5 in Norway had sent most of its Messerschmitt Bf 110 and medium bomber units (Kampfgeschwader or Bomber Wings) to Luftflotte 2 and 3. Luftflotte 3 then passed most of its Messerschmitt Bf 109 units to Luftflotte 2 which was based in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E

Yellow cards were also given to Quinton Fortune and Paul Scholes for United and Patrick Vieira for Arsenal, Arsenal substitute Francis Jeffers was shown a straight red for a kick on Phil Neville and, despite originally going unpunished, Sol Campbell was later given a three-match ban by the FA for kicking out at Eric Djemba-Djemba. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and United eventually won the Shield 4–3 on penalties. Ruud van Nistelrooy had his spot kick saved by debutant Jens Lehmann {{but it was his}} opposite number and fellow debutant Tim Howard who was the hero, saving penalties from Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Robert Pirès.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2015 NWSL season, McLeod was {{released}} by the Dash in order to pursue {{a chance to play}} in the UEFA Women's Champions League.

McLeod made her debut for the team in the final of the Super Cup on March 16, 2016, where FC Rosengård won 2–1. Though she was noticeably nervous, she made a number of saves and showed good reflexes. She made one other appearance on March 23, 2016, playing 13 minutes before she was forced to leave the game due to a knee injury. It was later revealed that McLeod had suffered a third right ACL injury, although the injury had most likely occurred <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier</b> while playing with the Canadian national team.|$|E
5|$|Gert's broad wind {{circulation}} produced {{widespread and}} heavy rainfall across Central America through September15–17. Combined with saturated soil from Tropical Storm Bret's passage <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> the storm triggered widespread floods and mudslides that isolated numerous communities. In Costa Rica, the blustery weather destroyed {{a national park}} and led to significant losses for the agricultural and tourism sectors. Much of the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras endured overflowing rivers, with many cities, villages, and crops in those countries left under water. Although Gert's highest winds occurred upon landfall in Mexico, the worst effects in the country were due to an extreme rainfall event in the Huasteca region, where as many as 31.41inches (798mm) of rain fell. As {{an increasing number of}} major rivers burst their banks, catastrophic flooding submerged extensive areas around the Pánuco basin. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate, and scores of structures were demolished in what was described as the region's worst disaster in 40years.|$|E

5|$|In the 1996–97 season, Arsenal contested in the Premier League. The club, having {{dismissed}} manager Bruce Rioch {{before the}} beginning of the league season, appointed French manager Arsène Wenger, in a contract worth £2million. Arsenal led the league table for much of November, but defeat to Nottingham Forest on 21 December 1996 concurred with no wins in December. Two draws and defeats in February moved Arsenal into fourth position; a previous defeat to Liverpool at home <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier</b> left Wenger ruling the club out of the title race. On {{the final day of the}} season, Arsenal beat Derby County 3–1 at the Baseball Ground, finishing third on goal difference. The team, thus, qualified for the UEFA Cup, missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification to second place Newcastle United.|$|E
5|$|On 22June 1949, No.86 Wing, {{comprising}} Nos.36, 38 and 486 Squadrons, relocated from Schofields to {{the nearby}} RAAF Station Richmond. The return of crews from Berlin allowed the wing to release No.38 Squadron and its Dakotas {{to participate in the}} Malayan Emergency, under the control of No.90 (Composite) Wing, commencing in June 1950. After airlifting more than 17,000 passengers and evacuating over 300 injured troops, the squadron left Malaya in November 1952 and returned to No.86 Wing at Richmond. <b>A</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> the wing's Dakotas had flown supply and observation flights in connection with the British atomic test on Montebello in Western Australia. No.36 Squadron disbanded at Richmond on 9March 1953, re-forming the next day from No.30 Transport Unit at Iwakuni, Japan. Here it was part of No.91 (Composite) Wing, which controlled the RAAF's units during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath. The squadron returned to Australia and the aegis of No.86 Wing two years later, when No.91 Wing disbanded.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (<b>A</b> <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> Columbia Pictures {{had done something}} similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.|$|E
