5|$|A pancake {{machine is}} an electrically-powered machine that {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes.

Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce pancake machines, and some have been homemade.

5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another.

5|$|Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs, {{breeding}} between August and January. The birds {{engage in}} aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding mid-air. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Chicks <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> fledged within {{five weeks of}} hatching and can hunt for mice {{within a week of}} leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph {{about the size of}} a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E

5|$|Incubation {{takes two}} weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching {{and covered with}} down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon's milk (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> grown but after {{they are capable of}} digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> developed and live the life of God.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched chicks {{are covered}} with whitish down, and are blind and largely {{helpless}} (nidicolous). Their eyes begin to open on day 6 and <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> open by day 15. The juvenile feathers begin growing through the down from days 7 to 10, covering the baby owls by two weeks of age. Their mother broods them continuously for the first week, then in the day only until the third week. Her partner brings food to the nest, which she tears into pieces before feeding the nestlings. The young vomit up pellets and defecate in the nest, which becomes quite smelly. They leave the nest five to six weeks after hatching, by which time they <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> feathered, with downy head and underparts and short tails. The tail reaches its adult length by 65 to 70 days. Young boobooks lose the remainder of their downy feathers by around five months of age.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E

5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
