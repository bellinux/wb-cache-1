40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and control}} of {{barley yellow dwarf virus}} (BYDV) in spring barley was investigated, at Oak Park, in the periods 1990 to 1993 and 1996 to 2001. Barley was sown in March and April and treated with either organophosphorous or pyrethroid <b>aphicide</b> at various plant growth stages. The most common aphid encountered was Sitobion avenae and MAV the most common strain of BYDV. In untreated plots of March- and April-sown barley, 0. 85 % and 5. 9 %, respectively, of tillers had virus symptoms. Best control of symptoms, from a single <b>aphicide</b> in March- and April-sown crops, was a treatment at growth stage (g. s.) 14. This treatment contributed 77 % of the reduction in symptoms recorded for multiple treatments in April-sown plots. The reduction in grain yield due to high, moderate and low BYDV infection in April-sown barley was 1. 1 t/ha (20 %), 0. 65 t/ha (10 %) and 0. 36 t/ha (7 %), respectively. In Marchsown barley, pyrethroid <b>aphicide</b> applied at g. s. 14 significantly improved grain yield by 0. 26 t/ha (4 %). In the season having the most severe BYDV outbreak, a pyrethroid <b>aphicide</b> at g. s. 14 was best in controlling yield loss. Pyrethroid <b>aphicide</b> gave better control of symptoms and better yields than organophosphorous <b>aphicide.</b> The estimated yield reductions in untreated April-sown barley due to feeding damage by Sitobion avenae was 0. 71 t/ha and 0. 83 t/ha (10. 6 % and 11. 3 %) in the two seasons in which this aphid was plentiful. In the three seasons in which Metopolophium dirhodum was recorded the estimated yield reductions were 0. 32 t/ha, 0. 48 t/ha and 0. 43 t/ha (5. 2 %, 5. 6 % and 5. 7 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine if, in a mild autumn when aphid numbers were high, the recommended <b>aphicide</b> treatments derived from earlier trial results were adequate to control BYDV in autumn-sown barley. Investigations on spring barley at Oak Park, 1990 - 1993, showed Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) can cause reductions in grain yield of up to 1. 4 t/ha. These studies indicated that the risk of infection increased with lateness of sowing date. They also suggested that control of the disease might best be obtained by applying an <b>aphicide</b> at the 4 -leaf stage of growth. The objectives of this investigation were to determine the growth stage at which <b>aphicide</b> should be applied in order to obtain best control of BYDV and to compare the effectiveness of systemic and contact aphicides in controlling the disease. Aphid numbers, species and infectivity with virus yellows were monitored in 20 beet crops between May and July over the period 1990 - 1999. Monitoring was undertaken to provide growers with an aphid-spray warning in order to minimise the risk of virus yellows and to establish aphid-thresholds which if exceeded would necessitate the spraying of crops with insecticide.

40|$|General Production Information Cucumbers {{are a key}} {{fresh market}} {{vegetable}} crop for NY producers, and are produced for local direct-to-consumer sales and for large wholesale markets in the eastern US. Some processing production also occurs. Because {{of the lack of}} registered herbicides, weeds are probably the most important pest of cucumber production; the industry has a critical need for more registrations of weed control products. Like other cucurbits, cucumbers are susceptible to a very wide range of diseases, and along with plant host resistance and cultural practices, fungicides are important disease management tools. Several new fungicides have recently been registered for use. Cucumber beetles and aphids can cause economically significant damage by direct feeding and by vectoring diseases.

40|$|Aphis gossypii {{is a major}} pest of cantaloupe melon crops, causing {{direct damage}} (sap uptake) and {{indirect}} damage (virus transmission). The cantaloupe gene Vat confers resistance to colonization by A. gossypii and resistance to the non-persistent viruses (CMV, WMV, etc) carried by A. gossypii. lt is however ineffective in blocking the transmission of viruses carried by other aphid species and its use is thus generally coupled with <b>aphicide</b> treatments to limit virus transmission by non-colonizing aphids. Moreover, due to its intraspecific variability, A. gossypii can adapt to various selective pressures (host plants, insecticides); this adaptation ability enhances the risk of resistance breakdown. ln France, cantaloupe protection faces a double challenge: to reinforce the effectiveness of Vat {{in a context of}} reducing pesticide use, and ensure the sustainability of Vat in a context of increasing Vat deployment. The hypothesis tested in this project is that an appropriate management of field borders can contribute to regulating the populations of aphids and/or their virus load, thereby reducing the risks of virus epidemies and resistance breakdown. lndeed, literature suggests that flower strips can participate in pest biological control by favoring natural enemies (predators and parasitoids), and strips of non host plants can protect crops from non-persistent viruses by allowing aphids to probe on healthy plants and thus to lose their virus load before reaching the crops.

A fungal lectin, namely Xerocomus Chrysenteron lectin (XCL) was previously purified and was shown to be toxic to several pests including aphids. At the cell level, an increase in the endocytosis, the induction of morphological changes such as the actin cytoskeleton shape was determined. In this work, the recombinant XCL was produced and was tested for its potential <b>aphicide</b> effect on Myzus persicae, a polyphagous aphid found on more than 400 host plant species and transmitting more than 100 viral diseases. We developed bioassays using different artificial diets incorporating a broad range of XCL concentrations (from 10 microgx ml(- 1) to lmg. ml(- 1)) to assess the potential negative effects of XCL on the development and reproduction of the M. persicae aphid.

40|$|The tobacco aphid (Myzus persicae nicotianae) is a {{cosmopolitan}} pest {{and one of}} the major pests of tobacco. Due to its damaging potential, particularly as a vector of virus diseases, management of M. persicae nicotianae relies heavily on chemical control. However, due to insecticide resistance development and ever-stringent regulations on plant protection products in external markets in the First World, {{it is now clear that}} an integrated pest management approach which encourages natural enemy activity is needed. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two of the most commonly found tobacco aphid natural enemies in the country, the ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and the parasitoid, Aphidius colemani (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) as biological control agents of the tobacco aphid. The biology of H. variegata and its aphid predation rates, A. colemani parasitism rate, intraguild predation of the parasitoid by the ladybird, and the effects of some common <b>aphicide</b> sprays on the ladybird were studied. The egg and larval-pupal periods of H. variegata were 2. 6 and 12 - 17 days, respectively. Hippodamia variegata 1 st instar larvae could not survive on tobacco leaves due to impeded movement by sticky exudates from leaf trichomes making them less effective in controlling the tobacco aphid. Adult ladybrids, however, proved to be the most effective. A female ladybird had a daily predation rate of 30. 2 aphids compared to the male which consumed 5. 5 aphids per day.

40|$|Many {{arthropod}} pesticides used by California walnut growers {{have been}} linked to water quality impairment. However lower risk alternatives are often associated with higher costs. The purpose of this paper was to: (1) identify currently practiced pest management strategies with probable high water quality impact, (2) quantify the importance of factors which affect economic tradeoffs associated with reducing water quality impact, and (3) identify pest management strategies that could potentially lower water quality impact with less economic consequence. An integrated analysis using environmental, economic and pesticide use data revealed that 96 % of the pest management strategies analyzed were candidates for reducing the impact on water quality. Replacement of current pesticides by alternative pest controls lowered probable impact, but resulted in an economic tradeoff in the form of higher costs for the majority of growers. If biological control could eliminate the need for miticides and <b>aphicides,</b> this tradeoff could be replaced by savings for nearly half of the sample analyzed. This cost savings would most likely be realized by growers who currently have low numbers of pests that are not candidates for biological control, and relatively high use of organophosphates and miticides. The results indicated that if these pest management strategies had been replaced by alternative strategies and biological control, then total organophosphate, pyrethroid, and miticide active ingredient use would have been reduced by an average of 5 Â kg/hectare per year, while simultaneously lowering the grower's pest management costs by an average of $ 128 /hectare, thus contributing to both economic and environmental long-run sustainability.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Saponins are a {{class of}} {{secondary}} plant metabolites consisting of a sugar moiety glycosidically linked to a hydrophobic aglycone (sapogenin) that often possess insecticidal activities. Four saponins were selected: two triterpene saponins, Q. saponaria saponins and aescin, and two steroidal saponins, digitonin and diosgenin. Their effects were investigated on an important pest species and a model piercing-sucking insect, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. The triterpene Q. saponaria saponins bark saponin received special attention because of its high activity. Aphids were challenged by oral and contact exposure to demonstrate aphicidal activities, and in choice experiments to support use as a natural deterrent. RESULTS: When aphids were exposed to supplemented artificial diet for 3 days, a strong aphicidal activity was recorded for {{three of the four}} saponins, with an LC 50 of 0. 55 mg mL(- 1) for Q. saponaria saponins, 0. 62 mg mL(- 1) for aescin and 0. 45 mg mL(- 1) for digitonin. The LT 50 values ranged between 1 and 4 days, depending on the dose. For diosgenin, only low toxicity (14 %) was scored for concentrations up to 5 mg mL(- 1). In choice experiments with treated diet, a deterrence index of 0. 97 was scored for Q. saponaria saponins at 1 mg mL(- 1). In contrast, direct contact showed no repellent effect. Spraying of faba bean plants with Q. saponaria saponins resulted in an LC 50 of 8. 2 mg mL(- 1). Finally, histological analysis in aphids fed with Q. saponaria saponins demonstrated strong aberrations of the aphid gut epithelium, and exposure of midgut CF- 203 cell lines to Q. saponaria saponins in vitro confirmed the cytotoxic effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present insect experiments provide strong evidence that saponins, as tested here with triterpene Q. saponaria saponins, can be useful as natural <b>aphicides</b> and deterrents. Furthermore, the insect midgut epithelium is suggested to be a primary target of saponin activity...|$|R
40|$|New {{insecticides}} are {{urgently needed}} because resistance to current insecticides allows resurgence of disease-transmitting mosquitoes while concerns for human toxicity from current compounds are growing. We previously reported {{the finding of}} a free cysteine (Cys) residue {{at the entrance of}} the active site of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in some insects but not in mammals, birds, and fish. These insects have two AChE genes (AP and AO), and only AP-AChE carries the Cys residue. Most of these insects are disease vectors such as the African malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto) or crop pests such as aphids. Recently we reported a Cys-targeting small molecule that irreversibly inhibited all AChE activity extracted from aphids while an identical exposure caused no effect on the human AChE. Full inhibition of AChE in aphids indicates that AP-AChE contributes most of the enzymatic activity and suggests that the Cys residue might serve as a target for developing better <b>aphicides.</b> It is therefore worth investigating whether the Cys-targeting strategy is applicable to mosquitocides. Herein, we report that, under conditions that spare the human AChE, a methanethiosulfonate-containing molecule at 6 µM irreversibly inhibited 95 % of the AChE activity extracted from An. gambiae s. str. and > 80 % of the activity from the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti L.) or the northern house mosquito (Culex pipiens L.) that is a vector of St. Louis encephalitis. This type of inhibition is fast (∼ 30 min) and due to conjugation of the inhibitor to the active-site Cys of mosquito AP-AChE, according to our observed reactivation of the methanethiosulfonate-inhibited AChE by 2 -mercaptoethanol. We also note that our sulfhydryl agents partially and irreversibly inhibited the human AChE after prolonged exposure (> 4 hr). This slow inhibition is due to partial enzyme denaturation by the inhibitor and/or micelles of the inhibitor, according to our studies using atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. These results support our view that the mosquito-specific Cys is a viable target for developing new mosquitocides to control disease vectors and to alleviate resistance problems with reduced toxicity toward non-target species...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by the Entomological Society of America and can be found at: [URL] temporal development of biological control of arthropod pests in perennial cropping systems is largely unreported. In this study, the development of biological control of twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, and hop aphid, Phorodon humuli (Schrank), in a new planting of hop in Oregon is described over a period of 9 yr (2005 - 2013). Both the abundance and diversity of natural enemies increased over time. Known predators of hop aphid (Coccinellidae and Anthocoridae) were present in all years; however, stable biological control of hop aphid was not achieved in most years and <b>aphicides</b> were required to suppress populations at commercially acceptable levels in 5 of 9 yr. Populations of aphidophagous coccinellids developed synchronously with hop aphid populations, and temporal correlations indicated these are the primary predatory insect associated with hop aphid regulation. However, sampling methods did not assess levels of aphid parasitoids and hyperparasitoids and their contribution to biological control was unquantified. Spider mite biological control was associated primarily with predatory mites (Phytoseiidae) and Stethorus spp. (Coccinellidae). The magnitude of temporal correlations of abundance of these predators with spider mites was found to be greatest on the same sampling dates and at lags of 7 - 14 d. Stable biological control of spider mites occurred after four field seasons, suppressing spider mites to levels similar to those commonly achieved with chemical control. A survey of 11 commercial hop yards in Oregon documented pest and natural enemy densities under commercial management practices over a period of 4 yr (2008 - 2011). Natural enemy abundance in commercial hop yards was similar to that of a 2 - to 3 -yr-old hop yard with limited disturbance. Whereas total reliance on biological control for hop aphid is unlikely to be successful, there appears to be unrealized potential for biological control of spider mites in commercial production.
