500|$|Umpire Ronnie Howard said [...] "It was a {{damaging}} race, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> {{for possible}} breakages". [...] Oxford's stroke Richard Thorp explained [...] "We expect it [...] but Ali [...] {{has so much}} more experience of the Tideway". Former Oxford coach Dan Topolski suggested that [...] "the race is a battle of guts and willpower, and Cambridge settled to a steady rhythm too soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{about the}} play after the game, Jessee said “I did {{not touch the}} ball. [...] I {{thought it was a}} forward pass <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at the ball being thrown and I was {{signaling}} for a grounding penalty. Then, when I realized the ball was in play, I pulled my hands back… The guys played a great game. The focus shouldn't be on this.” [...] During the game, Mack Brown was furious with the penalty call and insisted that Jessee did not touch the ball. [...] After the game Brown said that Jessee stepping onto the field [...] " [...] how bad our family wanted to win the game".|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I have {{something}} to say. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> at each other. Does my face tell you what is passing in my mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! And so {{you came}} along to me. <b>And</b> you see, <b>I</b> don't turn my back, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> at you <b>and</b> {{thinking}} about you from top to toe." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rollo {{looked at}} it very wishfully, and the {{corporal}} {{told him that he}} might try it if he chose. “Wheel it about,” said he, “while your father <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> at the chaise.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Peter Rabbit. [...] "I thought I heard footsteps, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> {{to see if}} {{it could}} be Reddy Fox {{creeping}} through the grass." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{the subject}} dropped. We were {{silent for a}} while. She was thinking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at her. On a sudden, she raised her head. Her eyes rested on me gravely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she answered. [...] "Besides, {{you told}} me about it, did you not, {{yesterday}} afternoon? I know one of his sisters quite well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> forward to seeing something of him down here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am--I {{just arrived}} in New York <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> for a boarding-house. Can {{you tell me}} where this one is?" [...] and Jerry showed her the card the lady had given him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] rejoined Piet the Red unblushingly, [...] "it {{must have}} been my back that you saw, captain. Willem <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> {{to see that the}} ropes had not given way. The {{prisoner}} is so restless...." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{there are}} many points of {{difference}} between civilised people and savages, {{and we think it}} right to point this out very clearly, good reader, because the man at whom you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> just now <b>is</b> a savage.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too bad," [...] said Aline. [...] "We {{are both}} tired after our ride, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> {{forward to a}} chance for giving you good advice, and a cozy evening. Now some one is coming to upset it all." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{road to the}} widow's house ran {{for half}} a mile or more through a heavy belt of timber land. We were jogging along at a fair pace, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> over a {{newspaper}} I had {{picked up on the}} station platform. Suddenly some one sprang out from the bushes and seized Jerry by the bridle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you {{see that}} hill yonder? Well, in that hill is all the treasures of the earth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> around {{for a man with}} a {{particular}} good kind heart and a noble, generous disposition, because if I could find just that man, I've got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and he could see the treasures and get them out." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I am {{excited to}} be here in England. It is the first time I have played for a club outside of Germany but the Premier League is a very {{exciting}} league <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> forward to my time here at Everton." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{remember}} {{very clearly}} {{sitting on a}} gate beyond the park, in a fold just below the crest, that hid the Beacon Hill bonfire and its crowd, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at and admiring the sunset. The golden earth and sky seemed like a little bubble that floated in the globe of human futility. [...] . Then in the twilight I walked along an unknown, bat-haunted road between high hedges.|$|E
60|$|I {{put down}} the {{receiver}} {{and went back to}} my dinner more than ever puzzled. Ralph's summons, I felt, absolved me from any promise I might have made to Delora, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> eagerly forward to the morrow, when I should be once more in London. What puzzled me, however, more even than Dicky's message, was the extreme interest Ralph's tone seemed to denote. His voice sounded quite like his old self.|$|E
60|$|But day waned; the {{sunlight}} {{went out of}} the great wooden room; the tumult diminished; and finally silence and evening shadow descended on the beleaguered house. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> out of the darkened window at a star that had risen and stood shining in the sky, when I was startled by a voice so low and so different from any I had yet heard that I turned to convince myself it was indeed Mr. Gulliver's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Songbird <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> out for them. Didn't {{you notice}} {{we had the}} door locked? We always lock up now, {{and no one has}} a key but the janitor, and we have cautioned him not to let any one in here without our permission." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as you say," [...] {{returned}} Matt. [...] "I am glad we have {{to stock}} up so often, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> forward {{to the time when}} it will be necessary for us to buy a larger wagon and get another horse to put beside Billy." ...|$|R
6000|$|We had {{our hands}} full of {{business}} making {{ready for the}} march, when Reuben Cox came shyly up to where Sergeant Corney <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> after the stowage of goods in the wagons, and said {{to me in a}} half-whisper, as if fearing others might hear him: ...|$|R
60|$|On a small {{mountain}} {{track on}} the Jaufen, {{not far from}} Meran, was a fallen Christus. I was hurrying downhill to escape from an icy wind which almost took away my consciousness, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> up at the gleaming, unchanging snow-peaks all round. They seemed like blades immortal in the sky. So I almost ran into a very old Martertafel. It leaned on the cold, stony hillside surrounded by the white peaks in the upper air.|$|E
6000|$|The stranger's brow cleared, and {{he smiled}} pleasantly. [...] "Then this is a {{fortunate}} meeting," [...] he said, raising his hat again as he reined in his horse beside the wagon, [...] "for I am Mr. Mallory, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> forward to the pleasure of presenting myself to you {{an hour or two}} later. The fact is, an old acquaintance, Mr. Dawson, telegraphed me yesterday to meet him here on urgent business, and I felt obliged to go there first." ...|$|E
60|$|At dinner-time the {{day when}} I had the {{conversation}} with Jone mentioned in my last letter, we {{was sitting in the}} dining-room at a little table in a far corner, where we'd never been before. Not being considered of any importance they put us sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, instead of giving us regular seats, as I noticed most of the other people had, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> around to see if anybody was ever coming to wait on us, when suddenly I heard an awful noise.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 May 2007, Sarpei {{moved to}} Bayer Leverkusen on a free transfer. After putting pen-to-paper on a two-year deal, Sarpei {{revealed}} to German sports paper kicker: [...] "It's great news for me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> full of joy about the move <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> forward to playing international football with Bayer next season".|$|R

"I {{can assure}} you I {{look at it in}} that light myself, Parkhurst, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> forward to paying him a visit, as, under his protection, I should get {{opportunities}} of collecting which I could never have in the ordinary way; for, unless they are greatly maligned, one could not trust one's self among the Malays without some special protection." ...|$|R
60|$|So I thought also; for, {{with the}} full secret of these desperate men in my possession, what hope was there that they would ever suffer me to leave the hut alive? And yet, so sweet is human life, and so dear a respite, be it ever so short a one, that when that murderous hand was taken from my chin I heard a sudden chiming of little bells, and the lamp blazed up into a strange fantastic blur. It was but for a moment, and then my mind was clear again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> up at the strange gaunt face of my examiner.|$|E
60|$|My {{aunt was}} quite gracious {{on the subject}} of the Thames (it really did look very well with the sun upon it, though not like the sea before the cottage), but she could not relent towards the London smoke, which, she said, 'peppered everything'. A {{complete}} revolution, in which Peggotty bore a prominent part, was being effected in every corner of my rooms, in regard of this pepper; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> on, thinking how little even Peggotty seemed to do with a good deal of bustle, and how much Agnes did without any bustle at all, when a knock came at the door.|$|E
6000|$|We went upstairs--it {{had been}} quite a fine house once, when it was anybody's {{business}} to keep it clean and fresh, and nobody's business to smoke in it all day--and into Mr. Turveydrop's great room, which was built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight. It was a bare, resounding room smelling of stables, with cane forms along the walls, and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with painted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles, {{which seemed to be}} shedding their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed autumn leaves. Several young lady pupils, ranging from thirteen or fourteen years of age to two or three and twenty, were assembled; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> among them for their instructor when Caddy, pinching my arm, repeated the ceremony of introduction.
