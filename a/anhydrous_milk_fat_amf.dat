Changes in thermal transitions in bulk fat and emulsion samples were monitored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under controlled cooling and reheating cycles performed between 50 and - 45 degrees C (5 degrees C min(- 1)). Comparison between bulk fat samples and emulsions indicated similar values of melting completion temperature, whereas initial temperature of fat crystallization (T-onset) seemed to be differently affected by storage temperature depending on triacylglycerols (TAG) composition, After storage at 4 degrees C, T-onset values were very similar for emulsified and non-emulsified AMF-HMT blend, whereas they were lower (by approx. 6 degrees C) for emulsions containing AMF or mixture of AMF-LMT fraction. After storage at - 30 degrees C, T-onset values of re-crystallization were higher in emulsion samples than in bulk fat blends, whatever the TAG fat composition. Light scattering measurements and fluorescence microscopic observations indicated differences in fat droplet aggregation-coalescence under freeze-thaw, procedure, depending on emulsion fat composition. It appeared that under quiescent freezing, emulsion containing 14 AMF-LMT fraction was much less resistant to fat droplet aggregation-coalescence than emulsions containing AMF or AMF-HMT fraction.

Furthermore, pulsed {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} measurements also showed that addition of <b>milk</b> phospholipid to <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> delays crystallisation, since the increase in solid fat content was slower at isothermal crystallisation at 22 degrees C.

40|$|Abstract – The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{physicochemical}} interactions between aroma compounds and various dairy media used as models of complex food matrices, {{as well as the}} consequences of the interactions on aroma partitioning between the air and matrix. Five aroma compounds were investigated: amyl and isoamyl acetate, ethyl pentanoate, hexanal and t- 2 -hexenal. Skim <b>milk,</b> <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and full-fat cream were chosen as dairy media, while water was used as a reference medium. Apparent partition coefficients of the five aromas were determined between the air and media between 30 and 80 °C by static headspace-gas chromatography. Partition coefficients over full-fat cream were also calculated from partition coefficients over skim <b>milk</b> and <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Compared with water, a significant retention of t- 2 -hexenal was observed in skim milk (nearly 90 % whatever the temperature), whereas the retention of the other aromas varied from 6 % for isoamyl acetate to 40 % for hexanal in skim milk. Hydrophobic interactions were responsible for the retention of esters, whereas covalent binding of t- 2 -hexenal by dairy proteins was probably involved. The volatility of the 5 aromas was drastically reduced over <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> because of their hydrophobic nature (log P> 1).

40|$|Milk fat {{in human}} diet is {{associated}} with cardiovascular diseases due to its high content in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Most vegetable oils are much healthier as they are rich in unsaturated fatty acids (1, 2). Lipase-catalysed interesterification of oils and fats has arisen {{as an alternative to}} hydrogenation or chemical processes to produce margarine and shortenings (3), notably because they do not give rise to undesirable trans fatty acids (4). The enzyme exchanges fatty acids from one triglyceride to another, resulting in a redistribution of fatty acids species.

CO was found to induce higher onset crystallisation temperature during cooling from 35 to 5  °C at 0. 5  °C min. X-ray scattering analysis showed that, in the presence of dissolved CO this rapid crystallisation caused the formation of unstable, α polymorph fat crystals. For milk fat crystallised under isothermal condition at 25  °C for 48  h, dissolved CO improved solid fat content, slightly depressed melting temperature and exhibited a sharper melting peak. Microstructure of AMF visualised by Polarised light microscopy of crystallised AMF showed that increasing dissolved CO concentration was associated with smaller crystal size and greater crystal number. The bulk properties of the fat appeared to mirror the microstructural differences, in that the texture of CO-treated AMF was harder under isothermal condition but became softer than untreated AMF under cooling condition. The results of this study are of significance in understanding how CO treatment might be used to modulate the crystallisation behaviour of milkfat and thereby the structural development and physical functionality of fat-containing dairy products...|$|E

PTR-ToF-MS allowed the separation and characterization of different samples based on the volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles. Statistically significant differences in VOC content were generally coherent with differences in sensory evaluation, particularly for SMP, WMP and WP. The good separation of SMP samples from WMP samples suggested the possible application of PTR-ToF-MS to detect possible cases of adulteration of dairy ingredients for the food industry. Our findings demonstrate the efficient and rapid differentiation of dairy ingredients {{on the basis of}} the released VOCs via PTR-ToF-MS analysis and suggest this method as a versatile tool (1) for the facilitation/optimization of the selection of dairy ingredients in the food industry and (2) and for the prompt innovation in the production of dairy ingredient...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThermal {{fractionation}} of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> {{with high}} initial content of {{low molecular weight}} TAGs was performed based on a 22 factorial experimental design with three central and two axial points. The independent variables were the crystallization temperature and the cooling rate. A 2. 0 L agitated glass reactor was used and the rotation was kept at 20 rpm. The filtration was performed under vacuum (500 mmHg), using a 14 μm average pore diameter filter paper. Curves of isothermal crystallization of the stearin fraction showed that increasing the crystallization temperature, increases the induction period and decreases the maximum solid content of stearin. An increase of the crystallization temperature resulted {{in an increase in}} solid fat content. All runs achieved an efficient fractionation using a single separation step and stearin with defined characteristics can be obtained adapting the process conditions...|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} here is {{integrated into a}} programme organized by the Community Bureau of Reference {{with the aim of}} developing edible oil reference materials (RMs) certified for cholesterol content. One vegetable oil (RM 162, a blend of soya and maize oils) and two animal fats (RM 163, a blend of pig and beef fats, and RM 164, an <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat)</b> possessing, respectively, low, medium and high cholesterol contents were chosen for this purpose. The present paper summarizes the analytical conclusions resulting from three interlaboratory trials carried out to identify and correct for the major sources of random and systematic errors linked to the protocol and to the gas–liquid chromatographic analysis. Several improvements to the methodology, and recommendations, have been proposed for the determination of individual sterols within the certification exercise. The latter will be reported elsewhere.

40|$|The need to {{eliminate}} trans-fatty acids from foods’ formulation {{resulted in the}} exploration of new lipid sources and alternative processing conditions that will improve the physicochemical characteristics and nutritional qualities of lipid-based foods. In general, the physicochemical characteristics of lipid networks depend on the microstructure and crystallization behavior of the system. The objective of this work was to use high intensity ultrasound (HIU) as an additional processing condition to alter the crystallization behavior of a lipid model system (<b>anhydrous</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat).</b> Results show that HIU application not only decreases the induction time of crystallization (faster crystallization) at a constant crystallization temperature, but also generates smaller crystals. In addition, higher viscosities are obtained when samples are crystallized after HIU application. The degree of supercooling, ultrasound application settings and {{a combination of both}} parameters influence the degree of ultrasound effect on the crystallization behavior...|$|R
