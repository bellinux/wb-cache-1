Originally {{purchased in}} the 1940s for under $10, {{the piece was}} assigned an insurance value of $60,000 by the appraiser, Alan Fausel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} a peaceful bird, which lives quite happily alongside humans, the willie wagtail will defend its nest aggressively. Willie wagtails {{are known to}} swoop at passers by, much like the Australian magpie. While attacks from willie wagtails are not <b>as</b> <b>common</b> or as formidable as the magpie, they do come as a great shock to recipients.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} value of 400ppb (parts per billion) – 24th among {{elements in the}} universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times <b>as</b> <b>common.</b> This is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass fluorine, and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections, allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not <b>as</b> <b>common</b> as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is quite}} {{popular in the}} lake. The most common species caught is the {{illegally}} introduced carp. Annual monitoring is carried out to determine fish populations. Almost equally <b>as</b> <b>common</b> are the introduced redfin European perch, with these being a regular by catch when fishing for golden perch. However, a number of less common species also inhabit the lake, including native Murray cod, western carp gudgeon and golden perch, as well as introduced goldfish, Gambusia, rainbow trout and brown trout.|$|E

40|$|The food system, {{the most}} {{important}} driver of planetary transformation, is broken. Therefore, seeking a sustainable and socially-fair transition pathway out of this crisis becomes an issue of utmost priority. The consideration of food as a commodity, a social construct that {{played a central role}} in this crisis, remains the uncontested narrative to lead the different transition pathways, which seems rather contradictory. By exploring the normative values on food, this paper seeks to understand how relevant is the hegemonic narrative of food as commodity and its alternative of food <b>as</b> <b>commons</b> to determine transition trajectories and food policy beliefs. Applying the multi-level perspective framework and developing the ill-studied agency in transition, this research enquired food-related professionals that belong to an online community of practice (N = 95) to check whether the valuation of food is relevant to explain personal stances in transition. Results suggest that the view of food as commodity is positively correlated with a gradually-reforming attitude, whereas food <b>as</b> <b>commons</b> is positively correlated with the counter-hegemonic transformers, regardless of the self-defined position in the transition landscape (regime or niches). At a personal level, there are multiple loci of resistance with counter-hegemonic attitudes in varied institutions of the regime and the innovative niches, many of them holding this discourse of food <b>as</b> <b>commons.</b> Conversely, alter-hegemonic attitudes are not positively correlated with the alternative discourse, and they may inadvertently or purportedly reinforce the neoliberal narrative. Food <b>as</b> <b>commons</b> seems to be a relevant framework that could enrich the multiple transformative constituencies that challenge the industrial food system and therefore facilitate the convergence of movements that reject the commodification of food...|$|R

Queens is recorded as used in the kings area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart the game. Kings truce is found in Thomas Dekker's The Honest Whore, Part One (II,i), which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel.|$|E

40|$|Purpose : After first {{highlighting}} the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous {{character of the}} current knowledge environment, this article shows that managing knowledge through collaborative processes (that may be characterized by {{the concept of the}} commons) appears indispensable to adaptation in this unstable setting. Finally, it is discussed the idea that managing knowledge <b>as</b> a <b>commons</b> leads to a deep alteration of the way organizations are managed. Description : In the era of the information society, of a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world, building knowledge collaboratively appears indispensable to adapt to the rapid changes in our environment. Further, this knowledge should be considered <b>as</b> a <b>common</b> good in a collective driven by the principles of reciprocity, autonomy, transparency, and trust. Point of view: It seems that such an approach is made possible by a view of organizations that focuses on individuals – in particular, on their freedom, their responsibility, and their well-being at work. In this context, the organization is conceived of <b>as</b> a <b>commons</b> whose sustainability depends on collaborative knowledge management, itself conceived of <b>as</b> a <b>commons.</b> Conclusions: Combining an approach to knowledge <b>as</b> a <b>commons</b> with an organization that operates <b>as</b> a <b>commons</b> should question the ways we manage our organizations...|$|R
