After the death of Jim Baen and with the publication of Grantville Gazette X by Baen Books, the last under contract with Baen, the Gazettes were again reconstituted as a subscription e-zine, now published regularly at six per year (bi-monthly) and paying <b>above</b> <b>standard</b> <b>rates</b> for submissions. They are a [...] "boiler room" [...] powering the collaborative synergy by the people involved with the 1632 Tech Manual and have developed into a repository for new ideas and themes in the series, although most explore the personal experiences of minor characters in the series or examine in depth some aspect (e.g. a multi-part serial explores and details Grantville's impact on public health in general, and the establishment of twin teaching hospitals as a joint project of the University of Jena and Grantville's new hospital, the Lahey Clinic).

40|$|The {{southern}} and western rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii and Panulirus cygnus, respectively) {{form the basis}} of two of the major seafood export industries in Australia; between them earning over 500 M export dollars yearly. Although a major portion of the catch is exported as 'whole-cooked' or 'tailed' products, an increasing share of the catch is exported live. The majority of lobsters arrive at the processing sheds as live lobsters. However, a lack of basic physiological information has impeded advances in the design and management of transport and holding systems, often resulting in a deterioration of the physiological condition of some lobsters. Such physiological deterioration may result in the final product choice for the processors being limited, leading to a reduced value of the catch. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an understanding of the physiology of lobsters, especially in relation to factors the lobsters may be subjected to during post-capture handling practices. This information could be used to redefine postcapture handling practices and holding system design and management. Standard oxygen consumption of both species increased in response to increases in temperature and body weight.

40|$|We {{carry out}} a {{detailed}} sensitivity analysis of border carbon adjustment (rates) by applying a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) GTAP 7 -based model. We find different incentives for the regions in the climate coalition to raise carbon-based border tax <b>rates</b> (BTAX) <b>above</b> the <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> that mimics an equalisation of carbon prices across regions. Herein, the strategic use of BTAX (the manipulation {{of the terms of}} trade) is stronger for all coalition regions than the environmental use (the reduction of carbon emissions abroad). Higher BTAX can reduce carbon leakage but with a declining marginal effect. Furthermore, we find different incentives for regions outside the coalition to oppose high BTAX rates: Russia and the other energy exporters would oppose it, while the Low-Income Countries would not because of benefits from the trade diversion effect. Thus, BTAX encourages the former to join the coalition, while compensating transfers are necessary to encourage the other (developing) countries including China and India.

40|$|In spacetimes with {{asymmetric}} extra dimensions, cosmic neutrino interactions may be extraordinarily {{enhanced by}} p-brane production. Brane formation and decay may then initiate showers {{deep in the}} Earth's atmosphere at <b>rates</b> far <b>above</b> the <b>standard</b> model <b>rate.</b> We explore the p-brane discovery potential of cosmic ray experiments. The absence of deeply penetrating showers at AGASA already provides multi-TeV bounds on the fundamental Planck scale that significantly exceed those obtained from black hole production in symmetric compactification scenarios. This sensitivity will be further enhanced at the Auger Observatory. We also examine the possibility that p-brane formation resolves the GZK paradox. For flat compactifications, astrophysical bounds exclude this explanation. For warped scenarios, a solution could {{be consistent with the}} absence of deep showers only for extra dimensions with fine-tuned sizes well below the fundamental Planck length. In addition, it requires moderately penetrating showers, so far not reported, and ~ 100 % modifications to standard model phenomenology at 100 GeV energies. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that neutrinos {{originating}} from ultra-high energy cosmic rays produce black holes deep in the atmosphere in models with TeV-scale quantum gravity. Such black holes would initiate quasi-horizontal showers of particles far <b>above</b> the <b>standard</b> model <b>rate,</b> so that the Auger Observatory would observe hundreds of black hole events. This would provide the first opportunity for experimental study of microscopic black holes. However, any phenomenologically viable model with a low scale of quantum gravity must explain how to preserve protons from rapid decay mediated by virtual black holes. We argue that unless this is accomplished by the gauging of baryon or lepton number, the suppression of proton decay will also suppress quantum gravity mediated lepton-nucleon scattering, and hence black hole production by scattering of ultra-high energy cosmic ray neutrinos in the atmosphere. We demonstrate this explicitly for the split fermion {{solution to the problem of}} fast proton decay. Comment: typo corrected, journal reference adde...|$|R

40|$|In {{scenarios}} {{with extra}} dimensions and TeV-scale quantum gravity, black holes {{are expected to}} be produced in the collision of light particles at center-of-mass energies above the fundamental Planck scale with small impact parameters. Black hole production and evaporation may thus be studied in detail at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). But even before the LHC starts operating, neutrino telescopes such as AMANDA/IceCube, ANTARES, Baikal, and RICE have an opportunity to search for black hole signatures. Black hole production in the scattering of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the ice or water may initiate cascades and through-going muons with distinct characteristics <b>above</b> the <b>Standard</b> Model <b>rate.</b> In this Letter, we investigate the sensitivity of neutrino telescopes to black hole production and compare it to the one expected at the Pierre Auger Observatory, an air shower array currently under construction, and at the LHC. We find that, already with the currently available data, AMANDA and RICE should be able to place sensible constraints in black hole production parameter space, which are competitive with the present ones from the air shower facilities Fly’s Eye and AGASA.

A business cycle effect on the Laffer curve is found. In recession years, VAT revenue is typically lower, the curve steeper, and the VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> that maximises VAT revenue slightly smaller than previously. These results can be explained with reference {{to changes in the}} composition of consumption and VAT collection enforcement. A countercyclical VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> policy (procyclical fiscal policy), observable in a few countries, not only increases the underlying business cycle volatility but may also result in long-term instability of VAT revenue.

40|$|Context {{effects are}} a robust finding in {{psychology}} and are {{manifested in the}} form of assimilation effects and contrast effects. Assimilation effects occur when judgments of a target stimulus are biased toward the level of non-target, context stimuli. Contrast effects occur when judgments of a target stimulus are biased in the opposite direction of non-target context stimuli and are much more prevalent than assimilation effects. Limited research has been conducted on contrast effects in the area of industrial/organizational psychology and no study has yet examined contrast effects when target and non-target stimuli are observed simultaneously. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine contrast effects in a group interaction setting (a leaderless group discussion (LGD) exercise of an assessment center) where all stimuli were observed simultaneously. Two factors were manipulated: the performance level of non-target stimuli (<b>above</b> <b>standard</b> and/or below standard candidates) and observation condition of the target stimulus (a standard candidate). In addition, the order in which the <b>standard</b> candidate was <b>rated</b> was counterbalanced. It was hypothesized that (1) contrast effects would occur in the LGD. One hundred, eighty-seven undergraduates were trained as raters and then viewed a videotape of a leaderless group discussion exercise in which a standard candidate was interacting either with two <b>above</b> <b>standard</b> candidates, two below standard candidates, or an <b>above</b> <b>standard</b> and a below standard candidate. Each videotape contained the same footage of the standard candidate; consequently, her performance was identical across conditions. Participants were assigned to observe one of the three candidates (the target candidate or one of the non-target candidates). During the rating session when the assessors discussed the performance of the candidates, performance of the standard candidate was discussed in either the first, second or third position. Individual ratings and consensus ratings were collected and analyzed. At the individual rating level, contrast effects were present in leaderless group discussion exercise ratings. Specifically, the <b>standard</b> candidate was <b>rated</b> significantly higher when performing with below standard candidates than with <b>above</b> <b>standard</b> candidates. The observation assignment had no significant influence on the magnitude of contrast effects; however, a leniency effect occurred for those assessors who were assigned to observe the standard candidate. Contrast effects were not present in the raters' consensus ratings. Conclusions, suggestions for future research, and implications for the study are discussed...|$|R
