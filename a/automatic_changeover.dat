5000|$|The {{light was}} {{converted}} to electric on 1 February 1963 which increased the candlepower to 13,000 white and 2,600 {{in the red}} sector of the light. The character though remained the same, one flash every three seconds. If the electricity supply fails, an <b>automatic</b> <b>changeover</b> to batteries comes into operation and an acetylene standby can be fitted if the battery standby fails.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 the {{original}} Mersey Railway fourth-rail system {{was replaced with}} the third-rail system adopted by LMS from Birkenhead Park to New Brighton and West Kirby, removing the need for <b>automatic</b> <b>changeover</b> switches. Despite the design already being 19 {{years old at the}} time, a new batch of 28 third-rail-only Class 503 units was delivered the following year. Of these, 24 were ordered as replacements for {{the original}} Mersey Railway trains, and the remaining four to replace stock damaged during the Second World War. As each new train was placed in service, a Mersey Railway train was withdrawn and hauled by steam locomotive to Horwich Works for breaking up.|$|E
5000|$|The Wirral Railway had {{considered}} electrification since 1900, but plans were not taken any further until 1935, when increasing traffic prompted the LMS {{to revive the}} scheme. Authorisation was granted for the West Kirby and New Brighton lines, and work was completed by February 1938. The LMS had adopted a 650 V DC third-rail system which differed from the fourth-rail system of the Mersey Railway. To allow through services to run to Liverpool, all trains {{had to be able}} to operate with both systems, and <b>automatic</b> <b>changeover</b> devices were installed between each set of rails at Birkenhead Park. The LMS ordered nineteen three-car units to operate their new electric services, which were later to become the Class 503 under the TOPS numbering system. The vehicles were built in Birmingham by Metropolitan Cammell and the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, and were maintained at Birkenhead Central TMD. Station improvement and modernisation work also accompanied the electrification work at , , , Moreton, [...] and [...]|$|E
30|$|The {{syringes}} {{used with}} power infusion pumps {{are small and}} must therefore be changed frequently. The changeover between vasoactive drug infusion pumps (CVIP) can induce a brief change in the drug flow rate manifesting as hemodynamic instability [7]. Various methods for performing manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>changeovers</b> {{have been developed to}} prevent episodes of hemodynamic instability [6, 8]. In the quick change method (QC), a full syringe is loaded into a new pump then connected to the three-way stopcock, which is turned to open the new and close the old infusion. This new primed line is set at the same flow rate as the running pump. QC has been proven simple and effective for manual CVIP [7, 9, 10] but does not completely eliminate the risk of instability. In addition, QC generates considerable work and stress for the nurse.|$|R
50|$|A system {{developed}} by Talgo and Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) of Spain uses variable gauge wheelsets; {{at the border}} between France and Spain, through passenger trains are drawn slowly through apparatus that alters the gauge of the wheels, which slide laterally on the axles. This is fully described in <b>Automatic</b> Gauge <b>Changeover</b> for Trains in Spain.|$|R
50|$|Gauge {{conversion}} {{may become}} less important {{with the development}} of a number of different variable gauge systems, also called <b>Automatic</b> Track Gauge <b>Changeover</b> Systems, such as the SUW 2000.|$|R
50|$|In such a system, the projectionist had a {{projector}} {{running the}} currently-playing reel (the outgoing projector) {{and a second}} incoming projector with the next reel to play, with each projector switching roles with each changeover. The projectionist would start the incoming projector with the changeover douser closed as the first mark (the motor cue) appeared; the second projector would be threaded with the incoming reel parked 8 seconds of countdown ahead of {{the start of the}} picture section. The second mark (changeover cue) would alert the projectionist that the changeover was imminent, and one full second after the mark he would trigger a solenoid that would open the incoming projector and another solenoid that would close the outgoing projector. The audio would be switched at this time as well; the audio for a particular film frame appears 20 frames (about 15") before the image, and so all film prints carry the first two to three feet of audio of the reel they precede at their tail, called a sound pullup (digital systems use different offsets before or after the image, which a computer corrects for). Film prints could be prepped by a projectionist with <b>automatic</b> <b>changeover</b> cues, which were small metallic appliqués which could be applied to a print at the first cue mark. Readers attached to the projector would read the marks and execute the changeover sequence automatically, as long as the incoming reel was threaded properly on the second projector.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we design an <b>automatic</b> <b>changeover</b> system for {{unwinding}} coils in copper wires stranding machines for energy cables. The system {{is illustrated by}} means of a case study: the stranding department at one of the plants of Pirelli Cables & Systems, the leader manufacturer in the field in Italy. Motivations for the study are increase in production, improvement in manpower utilization and decrease in waste material. Two alternative changeover algorithms are proposed and highlighted by means of simulations. Additionally, three different technical solutions are suggested, with several recommendations for implementations. Finally, a performance evaluation is carried out, investigating the impact of the study on the plant. I...|$|E

50|$|A pair of railway tunnels connect Portbou with Cerbère in France. One tunnel {{contains}} a standard gauge track, and one an Iberian gauge track. Local Spanish trains either terminate at Portbou or {{run through to}} Cerbère, where the Iberian gauge tracks ends, and French trains either terminate at Cerbère or continue to Portbou.Portbou has a TALGO <b>Automatic</b> Track Gauge <b>Changeover</b> System facility, for use by through trains between France and Spain.|$|R
40|$|Continued {{development}} of automatic {{change over switch}} is a necessary requirement for the principle of energy mix especially in developing countries characterised by insufficient mains power supply. In this paper, we report how {{we were able to}} intuitively use basic electronic components to implement an efficient automatic change over switch. In the event of a power failure from the mains supply, this <b>automatic</b> <b>changeover</b> is designed and constructed to switch on a standby generator and transfer the installation load to it (the generator) and vice versa when power is restored. The switching time was calculated and tested to be about 0. 88 ms which is sufficient to prevent any noticeable disruption in the power supply to the installation load, whether home or industrial...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{bottlenecks}} {{of broader}} applications of industrial robots: off-line-programming {{must be more}} efficiently used and the accurate positioning must be accieved by sensor feedback if necessary. Today the flexibility of industrial robot cells generally refers to {{the flexibility of the}} programmable handling devices, but not to the peripherals. However, with a large number of parts to be supplied the peripherals account for the largest part of the investment expenditure. The following demonstrates a concept which, by using image recognition in parts supply and capture of gripping and component tolerances permits component-flexible parts supply capable of <b>automatic</b> <b>changeover.</b> Furthermore a process is demonstrated and examined which enables optimal gauging and assembly toleranced parts with respect to cycle times. This is realized by two robots with fully overlapping workspaces. One robot is handling the magazines and the pc boards while the other robot is mounting the components. The tolerances in the provision of components and the tolerances of the components itself is controled by vision system. The robot programms are generated automatically using the CAD datas of the pc board and the components...|$|E
40|$|Power {{failure is}} a key issue in many {{developing}} countries of the world. To sustain development, the need for alternative power supply becomes necessary. Changing between the main supply line and the alternative supply poses yet another problem. Many {{attempts have been made to}} develop <b>automatic</b> power <b>changeover</b> but without due consideration of the fact that there could be times when we need to regulate the behavior of the automatic change over. This paper therefore presents the design and construction of microcontroller based programmable automatic power change over. The paper discusses the design, construction and operation of a program controlled power change over system that allows users to select the mode they would prefer to have their change over operate. Three modes were achieved, including auto mode, timed mode and manual mode, which were selected from push buttons. LCD interface was used for the output display. 8051 microcontroller was used to implement the control program while modular methodology was adopted...|$|R
50|$|As a {{maintenance}} aid, the exchange {{was equipped with}} a Maintenance Data Recorder (MDR). This had a rather primitive printer, which displayed the identities of equipment in use {{at the time that}} the exchange had detected a call failure. For example, in the event of a successful repeat attempt to provide dial-tone, the MDR would print. If the repeat attempt failed, then the MDR would print twice in quick succession, giving details of the equipment in use on both the failed paths. The prints were not easy to read. All that emerged were short burn marks on the special paper in up to 45 different places in each of two rows. It was necessary to hold a plastic graticule (see picture below right, under that of an MDR) over the paper to find out what the presence of each burn mark indicated. If more than eight call failures were detected in less than 8 minutes, then the critical common control units would be forced to change from the side in service (A or B) to the other side, the <b>automatic</b> 8-minute <b>changeover</b> would be suspended and a prompt alarm would be sent out.|$|R
