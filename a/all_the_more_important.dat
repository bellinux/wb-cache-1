They were extensively used for bombing villages and road communications. However it was soon established that the vintage biplane Breguet 19 and Potez 25 aircraft were ideally suited for missions against Partisan troop concentrations. Although they were outdated and certainly their use would be out of the question on any other front, their performance and armament made them very dangerous for an ill-armed enemy. The Partisans were scattered in villages, forests and mountains and their positions could only be detected by a slow moving aircraft.

Furthermore, the Nintendo DS, and its portable, distant relatives, bring hard con- straints on the processing- and memory resources available to said mechanics. This master thesis aims to find a pathfinding solution well suited to function within the above mentioned, narrow domain. From a broad selection of candidate solutions, a few promising subjects are treated to an investigative empirical study; with the goal of finding the best “fitting” solution, considering the domain. The empirical study shows that the triangle-based TRA* solution and the hierarchical-abstraction influenced Minimal Memory so- lution are both very promising candidates. Depending on how one exactly defines the domain, either one of the solutions could be considered the ‘best’ choice. Since the overall performance of TRA* showed a slight advantage, this solution was further inves- tigated by running an implementation on one of the intended domain platforms; the Nintendo DS.

Universities are facing the challenge to incorporate BIM into their curricula and produce “BIM ready” graduates {{to meet the needs}} of the industry. Like other universities, Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is at the heart of this change and aspires to develop collaborative BIM education across AEC. Previous BIM education studies identify that inadequate BIM awareness of AEC academics is one of the challenges for developing a BIM curriculum and there is a dearth in the learning and teaching support for academics on BIM education.

40|$|This study {{traces the}} {{historical}} {{development of an}} Indian movement to encourage the cultivation of music, to place it on a 2 ̆ 2 scientific 2 ̆ 2 theoretical footing, and to remove the prejudice against music that formerly pervaded much of Indian society. Important though individual efforts are, associations and institutions more clearly reveal attitudes towards music in nineteenth and early twentieth-century India. This study of the movement is approached primarily through examination of the aims and activities of these groups, which ranged from local clubs to large societies with many branches. ^ Certain important features consistently characterized the movement and promoted its development, such as the increasing force of Hindu pride, the impressive capabilities of interregional communication even before the advent of the railroad, the influence of Hindu religious and social reform movements, Hindu-Muslim cultural relations, and the amateur focus of the movement. This dissertation analyzes how these social and cultural forces shaped the Hindu music revival, comparing how they emerged at first regionally in Bengal, Maharashtra, and Gujarat, and then finally on the national level. Although the movement was dominated by Brahmans and placed authority in Sanskrit literature, it won the support of many Muslim musicians, some of whom founded music schools modeled on those of their Hindu colleagues. Examining the development of the movement, this dissertation traces a discernible historical shift in the orientation of the musical associations. Whereas they began in the nineteenth century with apologetics for 2 ̆ 2 Hindu Music 2 ̆ 2 to the British in India and sought sympathizers in Europe, with the increasing strength of nationalism in the twentieth century the movement began to bypass foreign opinion. <b>All</b> of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> musical organizations studied intended to achieve a pan-Indian presence, but this ambition was realized only by two founded in the twentieth-century. ...|$|R

Second, I classify the saver type of the households based on whether they engage in regular savings plans, or rather save irregularly and without a savings plan and I find that saving motives are related to the saver type of the household. The results show that heterogeneity in saving behavior along two dimensions – with respect to the saving rate and the saver type – is systematically related to the importance that households attach to different saving motives. This suggests that policy reforms that change the importance of certain saving motives in the eyes of private households might alter household saving behavior in various ways...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} the demand has become {{increasingly}} insistent among scholars and others for development of a more comprehensive theory of inquiry about international law, drawing upon all relevant areas of knowledge and especially upon the social sciences.

International law is becoming a more and more complex and many-sided subject. 2 ̆ 2 In bringing the book to a close, he reaffirms that basic changes in the 2 ̆ 2 structure of international society 2 ̆ 2 make necessary a 2 ̆ 2 far-reaching reorientation in the science and study of contemporary international law. 2 ̆ 2 For any who are as yet unconvinced of the exigency of this demand, Professor Friedmann 2 ̆ 7 s able and wide-ranging survey of almost <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> and controversial areas of contemporary international law may serve as compelling proof.

40|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} demonstrated that the coordinates of the main-chain atoms alone are sufficient to determine the side-chain conformations of buried residues of compact proteins. Given a perfect backbone, the side-chain packing method can predict the side-chain conformations to an accuracy as high as 1. 2 A RMS deviation (RMSD) with greater than 80 % of the chi angles correct. However, similarly rigorous studies have not been conducted to determine how well these apply, if at <b>all,</b> to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> problem of homology modeling per se. Specifically, if the available backbone is imperfect, as expected for practical application of homology modeling, can packing constraints alone achieve sufficiently accurate predictions to be useful? Here, by systematically applying such methods to the pairwise modeling of two repressor and two cro proteins from the closely related bacteriophages 434 and P 22, we find that when the backbone RMSD is 0. 8 A, the prediction on buried side chain is accurate with an RMS error of 1. 8 A and approximately 70 % of the chi angles correctly predicted. When the backbone RMSD is larger, {{in the range of}} 1. 6 - 1. 8 A, the prediction quality is still significantly better than random, with RMS error at 2. 2 A on the buried side chains and 60 % accuracy on chi angles. Together these results suggest the following rules-of-thumb for homology modeling of buried side chains. When the sequence identity between the modeled sequence and the template sequence is > 50 % (or, equivalently, the expected backbone RMSD is < 1 A), side-chain packing methods work well. When sequence identity is between 30 - 50 %, reflecting a backbone RMS error of 1 - 2 A, it is still valid to use side-chain packing methods to predict the buried residues, albeit with care. When sequence identity is below 30 % (or backbone RMS error greater than 2 A), the backbone constraint alone is unlikely to produce useful models. Other methods, such as those involving the use of database fragments to reconstruct a template backbone, may be necessary as a complementary guide for modeling...|$|R

Three different loads have been simulated with combusting coal, 200 MW, 170 MW and 140 MW respectively.

After air supply system simulation, {{the results have been}} taken as the initial and boundary conditions for furnace simulation. The comparison between the measured values and predicted results from 200 MW case shows much better agreement.

It is concluded that the distributions of temperature, O 2 and CO concentration inside furnace with different loads shows good similarly.

Recent regional developments – {{with the emergence of}} a de facto Kurdish self-rule in Syria and the increasing likelihood of a Kurdish state in Iraq – have made Turkey’s permanent settlement of its own conflict <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> pertinent. <b>Important</b> as these developments are, the exclusive framing of the issue within the discourse of “conflict resolution” bears the risk of reaching faulty policy analyses that attribute too much significance to the cessation of fighting. The crux of the Kurdish issue remains the structural inequalities against the Kurds, which predate the conflict between the PKK and the Turkish military. Current debates on the Kurdish demands in the framework of the peace talks often overlook the history in which these demands were shaped, communicated and pursued, not only by the Kurdish national movement but also, and first and foremost, by the human rights activists in the Kurdish region. The legal and political mobilisation of Kurdish civil society vis-à-vis European institutions raised awareness about the human rights abuses committed by the Turkish government and framed concrete rights claims for equality, justice and the rule of law. The ECtHR and the EU, for their part, have played a critical – though not necessarily always coherent and consistent – role in the relatively significant, albeit substantively limited, reforms adopted by Turkish governments since the late 1990 s. At the same time, this European engagement has not always pushed Turkey in the direction of enhancing the democratic participation and human rights of its Kurdish citizens, particularly in the post- 9 / 11 context. This paper looks into the evolution of the trilateral relationship between Turkey, Europe and the Kurds {{over the course of the}} past three decades. Based on the current political situation in Turkey and its region, it argues that there is an imminent need for European re-engagement in the Kurdish issue in a coherent, continuous and critical manner based on a systematic political dialogue with diversified domestic actors. ...|$|R

Knowledge of the diet composition lets us to preserve diversity and improve {{the management of the}} marine resources for fisheries. The aim of this study was study the trophic ecology of a commercial species, Lophius budegassa in the NW Mediterranean Sea, for this purpose we studied differences in diet between two sizes (size 1 : < 30 cm and size 2 : ≥ 30 cm) and throughout the year. These differences are determined with two methodologies: stomach content analysis through various indexes (%FO, %N, %W, IRI and %IRI) and stable isotope analysis of nitrogen and carbon in muscle samples of our individuals to perform Bayesian isotopic mixing models with isotopic values of the potential preys. Variation in the diet of L. budegassa in the NW Mediterranean Sea was related to different factors as size and season. Our results show that L. budegassa is an opportunistic predator with preference by fishes and lesser extent to crustaceans, although small proportion of molluscs and echinoderms were also found in some stomachs. We found differences in the diet between sizes, in particular, size 2 individuals included more crustaceans and less fishes in the diet than size 1, this was confirmed with both methodologies studied. Regarding seasonal changes in diet, we not found differences between seasons, nor in stomach contents nor with isotopic mixing models, being in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> seasons <b>more</b> <b>important</b> fishes than crustaceans as preys. This study shows the importance to use complementary approaches for diet studies as isotopic mixing models in addition to traditional methodologies as stomach content analysis to improve knowledge about the food web and their fluxesThis final master work is a contribution within ECOTRANS project (CTM 2011 - 26333, Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad del Gobierno Español) Peer Reviewe...|$|R
