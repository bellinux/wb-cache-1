40|$|The {{development}} of a unique Knotless suture anchor for soft tissue repair to bone is described. This device allows for soft tissue repair to bone using a suture anchor {{without the need for}} knot tying. This provides a particular advantage for arthroscopic repairs, where knot tying can be difficult. The Knotless suture anchor has a short loop of suture secured to {{the tail end of the}} anchor. A channel located at the tip of the anchor functions to capture the loop of suture after it has been passed through the soft tissue. The soft tissue is ten-sioned as the anchor is inserted into bone to the ap-propriate depth. Biomechanical testing demonstrated increased suture strength in the Knotless suture an-chor compared with standard suture anchors. This is because of the doubled-suture configuration that is created with the Knotless suture <b>anchor</b> <b>loop.</b> To the author’s knowledge, this paper describes the first knot-less suture anchor. A secure, low-profile repair can be created without knot tying. In recent years, suture anchors have become popular for both open and arthroscopic repairs of avulsed ligaments or tendons, most commonly for Bankart and rotator cuff re-pairs. 12, 21 Many surgeons have been reluctant to perform arthroscopic suture anchor repairs, however. A good qual-ity arthroscopic suture anchor repair is technically diffi-cult to achieve. Satisfactory knot tying requires signifi-cant practice with special knot-tying devices and unfamiliar knot designs. This process can be difficult to master and time-consuming to perform. Arthroscopically tied knots are bulky and may be inferior to openly tied knots, even in the best of hands. 13 For these reasons, an arthroscopic suture anchor repair using standard suture anchors may not, in fact, be consistently as high quality as an open suture anchor repair (S. C Weber, unpublished data, 1995 and 1998). This report describes the {{development of}} a Knotles...|$|E

The influence of the presence of other extracellular loops was also explored. Our results reveal that the error space of modeled loop residues is much larger than that of the anchor residues, although modeling a particular extracellular loop in the presence of other extracellular loops provides constraints that help in predicting near-native loop conformations observed in crystal structures. This implies that errors in <b>loop</b> <b>anchor</b> positions introduce increased uncertainty in the modeled loop coordinates.

We focus on correlation functions containing twist operators, combining these with <b>anchored</b> <b>loops,</b> boundaries with SLE processes and with double SLE processes. We focus further upon n= 0, representing self-avoiding loops, which corresponds to a logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) with c= 0.

Using the additional conditions imposed by the twist operator null-states, we derive a new explicit result for the probabilities that an SLE_{ 8 / 3 } wind in various ways about two points in the upper half plane, e. g. that the SLE passes to the left of both points. The collection of c= 0 logarithmic CFT operators that we use deriving the winding probabilities is novel, highlighting a potential incompatibility caused by the presence of two distinct logarithmic partners to the stress tensor within the theory.

Using PCR-based and in vitro binding assays it was established that LIS and ammonium sulphate extractions gave similar results for the type of attachment of sequences investigated. The harsh extraction with 2 M NaCl or the conventional procedure led to some rearrangements in the attachment of DNA loops.

40|$|When {{fractionation}} {{schemes for}} hypofractionation and stereotactic body radiotherapy are considered, a reliable cell survival model at high dose {{is needed for}} calculating doses of similar biological effectiveness. An alternative to the LQ-model is the track-event theory {{which is based on}} the probabilities for one- and two two-track events. A one-track-event (OTE) is always represented by at least two simultaneous double strand breaks. A two-track-event (TTE) results in one double strand break. Therefore at least two two-track-events on the same or different chromosomes are necessary to produce an event which leads to cell sterilization. It is obvious that the probabilities of OTEs and TTEs must somehow depend on the geometrical structure of the chromatin. In terms of the track-event theory the ratio ε of the probabilities of OTEs and TTEs includes the geometrical dependence and is obtained in this work by simple Monte Carlo simulations. For this work it was assumed that the <b>anchors</b> of <b>loop</b> forming chromatin are most sensitive to radiation induced cell deaths. Therefore two adjacent tetranucleosomes representing the <b>loop</b> <b>anchors</b> were digitized. The probability ratio ε of OTEs and TTEs was factorized into a radiation quality dependent part and a geometrical part: ε = εion ∙ εgeo. εgeo was obtained for two situations, by applying Monte Carlo simulation for DNA on the tetranucleosomes itself and for linker DNA. Low energy electrons were represented by randomly distributed ionizations and high energy electrons by ionizations which were simulated on rays. εion was determined for electrons by using results from nanodosimetric measurements. The calculated ε was compared to the ε obtained from fits of the track event model to 42 sets of experimental human cell survival data. When the two tetranucleosomes are in direct contact and the hits are randomly distributed εgeo and ε are 0. 12 and 0. 85, respectively. When the hits are simulated on rays εgeo and ε are 0. 10 and 0. 71. For the linker-DNA εgeo and ε for randomly distributed hits are 0. 010 and 0. 073, and for hits on rays 0. 0058 and 0. 041, respectively. The calculated ε fits the experimentally obtained ε = 0. 64 ± 0. 32 best for hits on the tetranucleosome when they are close to each other both, for high and low energy electrons. The parameter εgeo of the track event model was obtained by pure geometrical considerations of the chromatin structure and is 0. 095 ± 0. 022.

40|$|Cathepsin B is a papain-like {{cysteine}} protease showing both endo- and exopeptidase activity, {{the latter}} {{due to a}} unique occluding loop that restricts access to the active site cleft. To clarify the mode by which natural protein inhibitors manage to overcome this obstacle, we have analyzed the structure and function of cathepsin B in complexes with the Trypanosoma cruzi inhibitor, chagasin. Kinetic analysis revealed that substitution of His- 110 e, which <b>anchors</b> the <b>loop</b> in occluding position, results in 3 -fold increased chagasin affinity (K-i for H 110 A cathepsin B, 0. 35 nM) due to an improved association rate (kon, 5 x 105 M(- 1) s(- 1)). The structure of chagasin in complex with cathepsin B was solved in two crystal forms (1. 8 and 2. 67 A resolution), demonstrating that the occluding loop is displaced to allow chagasin binding with its three loops, L 4, L 2, and L 6, spanning the entire active site cleft. The occluding loop is differently displaced in the two structures, indicating a large range of movement and adoption of conformations forced by the inhibitor. The area of contact is slightly larger than in chagasin complexes with the endopeptidase, cathepsin L. However, residues important for high affinity to both enzymes are mainly found in the outer loops L 4 and L 6 of chagasin. The chagasin- cathepsin B complex provides a structural framework for modeling and design of inhibitors for cruzipain, the parasite cysteine protease and a virulence factor in Chagas disease...|$|R

Mounting experimental {{evidence suggests that}} metal loss and/or disulfide reduction are important for initiating misfolding and aggregation of SOD 1. To uncover the role of metals and the disulfide bond in the SOD 1 folding, we systemically study the folding thermodynamics and structural dynamics of SOD 1 monomer and dimer with and without metal binding and under disulfide-intact or disulfide-reduced environments in computational simulations. We use all-atom discrete molecular dynamics for sampling. Our simulation results provide dynamical evidence to the stabilizing role of metal ions in both dimer and monomer SOD 1. The disulfide bond <b>anchors</b> a <b>loop</b> (Glu- 49 to Asn- 53) {{that contributes to the}} dimer interface. The reduction of the disulfide bond in SOD 1 with metal ions depleted results in a flexible Glu- 49 –Asn- 53 loop, which, in turn, disrupts dimer formation. Interestingly, the disulfide bond reduction does not affect the thermostability of monomer SOD 1 as significantly as the metal ions do. We further study the structural dynamics of metal-free SOD 1 monomers, the precursor for aggregation, in simulations and find inhomogeneous local unfolding of β-strands. The strands protected by the metal-binding and electrostatic loops are found to unfold first after metal loss, leading to a partially unfolded β-sheet prone to aggregation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{contribution}} of hydrogen bonding by peptide groups to the conformational stability of globular proteins was studied. One of the conserved residues in the microbial ribonuclease (RNase) family is an asparagine at position 39 in RNase Sa, 44 in RNase T 1, and 58 in RNase Ba (barnase). The amide group of this asparagine is buried and forms two similar intramolecular hydrogen bonds with a neighboring peptide group to <b>anchor</b> a <b>loop</b> {{on the surface}} of all three proteins. Thus, it is a good model for the hydrogen bonding of peptide groups. When the conserved asparagine is replaced with alanine, the decrease in the stability of the mutant proteins is 2. 2 (Sa), 1. 8 (T 1), and 2. 7 (Ba) kcal/mol. When the conserved asparagine is replaced by aspartate, the stability of the mutant proteins decreases by 1. 5 and 1. 8 kcal/mol for RNases Sa and T 1, respectively, but increases by 0. 5 kcal/mol for RNase Ba. When the conserved asparagine was replaced by serine, the stability of the mutant proteins was decreased by 2. 3 and 1. 7 kcal/mol for RNases Sa and T 1, respectively. The structure of the Asn 39 w Ser mutant of RNase Sa was determined at 1. 7 Å resolution. There is a significant conformational change near the site of the mutation: (1) the side chain of Ser 39 is oriented differently than that of Asn 39 and forms hydrogen bonds with two conserved water molecules; (2) the peptide bond of Ser 42 changes conformation in the mutant so that the side chain forms three new intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the backbone to replac...|$|R

The effects on ligand binding, kinetics, and receptor function suggest that the second extracellular loop does not provide primary contacts for orthosteric ligands, including ace-tylcholine, but that it does contribute to microdomains that are important for the conformational changes that accompany re-ceptor activation. Kinetic studies suggest that the disulfide bond between Cys 98 and Cys 178 may contribute to structures that regulate the access of positively charged ligands such as N-methyl scopolamine to the binding pocket. Asp 99 may act as a gatekeeper residue to this channel. In contrast, the bulkier lipophilic ligand 3 -quinuclidinyl benzilate may require breathing motions of the receptor to access the binding site. Trp 378 is a key residue for receptor activation as well as binding, whereas Phe 197 represents the floor of the N-methyl scopolamine bind-ing pocket but does not interact with acetylcholine or 3 -quinu-clidinyl benzilate. Differences between the binding modes of N-methyl scopolamine, 3 -quinuclidinyl benzilate, and acetyl-choline have been modeled.

Due {{to the lack of}} backbone hydrogen bonds between Glu 25 -Ala 28 and Tyr 26 -Ser 29, A and B are assigned as two separate helices. There are two disulfide bridges formed by four cysteine residues, which are involved in linking the aminoacid residues 88 – 96, 214 – 232 with other disulfide bridges <b>anchoring</b> the C-terminal <b>loop</b> and α-helix. Though, electron density maps do not show any indication of O-glycosylation sites, but it showed two N-glycosylation sites (Asn 104 and Asn 182) which allows a total of seven carbohydrate residues in the electron density map (Mølgaard et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|Nuclear DNA of metazoans is {{organized}} in supercoiled <b>loops</b> <b>anchored</b> to a proteinaceous substructure {{known as the}} nuclear matrix (NM). DNA is anchored to the NM by non-coding sequences known as matrix attachment regions (MARs). There are no consensus sequences for identification of MARs and not all potential MARs are actually bound to the NM constituting loop attachment regions (LARs). Fundamental processes of nuclear physiology occur at macromolecular complexes organized on the NM; thus, the topological organization of DNA loops must be important. Here, we describe a general method for determining the structural DNA loop organization in any large genomic region with a known sequence. The method exploits the topological properties of loop DNA attached to the NM and elementary topological principles such as that points in a deformable string (DNA) can be positionally mapped relative to a position-reference invariant (NM), and from such mapping, {{the configuration of the}} string in third dimension can be deduced. Therefore, it is possible to determine the specific DNA loop configuration without previous characterization of the LARs involved. We determined in hepatocytes and B-lymphocytes of the rat the DNA loop organization of a genomic region that contains four members of the albumin gene family...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{imprinted}} genes, {{which are}} expressed from {{only one of}} the parental alleles, have a tendency to form clusters and are regulated by long-range mechanisms. Nuclear matrix-attachment regions (MARs), the <b>anchor</b> points of <b>loop</b> domains, are involved in coordination of gene expression and could play a role in regulation of imprinted domains. We have identified and mapped a total of 52 MARs in a 1 -Mb imprinted domain on mouse distal chromosome 7 using our cosmid contigs and an in vitro MAR assay. We find two MAR clusters (comprising 20 and 19 MARs), one of which is mapped in the Th-Ins 2 intergenic region, coincident with the boundary between the two imprinted subdomains. However, the imprinted/non-imprinted boundaries are not associated with a MAR. Based on the sequence information, we find that many of the MARs are rich in long interspersed nuclear elements. In addition, comparisons of the results obtained with several MAR-prediction software programs reveal good performance of ChrClass in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. This study presents the first large-scale mapping of MARs in an imprinted domain and provides a platform for understanding the roles of MARs in imprinting.
