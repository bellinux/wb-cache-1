2500|$|Titans {{starting}} {{running back}} Chris Johnson - {{who had the}} vast majority of the carries in 2009, rushing for over 2000 yards - will reportedly get fewer carries in 2010. This will likely mean in increase in number of carries for Ringer. Backup Running back LenDale White is an impending free agent, and his future with the team also affects Ringer's future. During the 2010 NFL Draft, White was traded to the Seattle Seahawks. Despite the team signing Stafon Johnson and LeGarrette Blount as undrafted free agents, Head coach Jeff Fisher has confirmed that Ringer will be the new #2 running back, stating [...] "We have a terrific running back , and a very talented backup in Javon."

[...] During the first pre-season game of the 2010 season, Ringer led the team in rushing yards (60 yards, seven carries). Fullback Ahmad Hall said of Ringer [...] "Everybody knew he was a great back last year... He really, really immersed himself in the playbook, and picked everything up. If anything happened to C.J. he could definitely fill in and execute well. He is <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> <b>guy,</b> and he applies himself. The guy is a good running back." ...|$|E

5000|$|Brown {{enrolled}} at the University of Maryland, and served a redshirt season in 2009. In 2010, he saw action in four plays against Morgan State.

He has been a fervent {{advocate}} {{of the quality of}} work done by pharmaceutical statisticians in a day and age where many dismiss any research touched by commercial interests (Senn, 2005, 2006). He also argues loud and forcefully for patients when their lives are trampled by unethical demands of the research enterprise (Senn, 1997, 2003 a). He has written the definitive work on crossover trials (Senn, 2002), and a wonderfully readable account of statistics in medicine for the lay public (Senn, 2003 b).

My favorite is his definition of medical statistician: “one who will not accept that Columbus discovered America because he said he was looking for India in the trial plan. ” Finally, he is <b>an</b> all-around <b>smart</b> <b>guy</b> who has moved the statistics discipline forward in many different areas.
