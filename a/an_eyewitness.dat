40|$|The present {{experiment}} examined whether {{attributions of}} blame for an incident can be shifted between individuals {{as a result}} of <b>a</b> leading <b>eyewitness</b> statement. Participants watched a video of an accident involving two men and then read either <b>a</b> non-leading <b>eyewitness</b> statement that blamed no one for the accident or <b>a</b> leading <b>eyewitness</b> statement that blamed one of the two men for the accident. Participants' attributions of blame for the accident were then assessed either immediately or after a 1 [*]week delay. Regardless of the time delay, just over one-third of participants who read a leading statement subsequently blamed the same person as the eyewitness. In contrast, less than 4 % of participants who read a non-leading statement blamed one of the men. This research is the first to demonstrate blame conformity, where blame for an incident can be shifted between individuals {{as a result of}} <b>a</b> leading <b>eyewitness</b> statement...|$|R
5|$|An Old Church Slavonic {{compilation}} of Lives of saints preserved <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness</b> account on the Bulgarian-Byzantine war of 894–896.

Similarly late manuscripts (the oldest of which {{was written in the}} 14th century) offer the text of the Russian Primary Chronicle, a historical work completed in 1113. It provides information based on earlier Byzantine and Moravian sources.|$|E

According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one {{prepared}} by <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness</b> journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom.

Isabeau died there in 1435. Her death and funeral were documented by Jean Chartier (member of St Denis Abbey) who may well have been <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness.</b>|$|E

After the war ended, Morrison and Robert Serber traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project's mission to assess the damage.|$|E

Efim (or Yefim) Moshinsky claims to have seen Wallenberg on Wrangel Island in 1962. <b>An</b> <b>eyewitness</b> asserted that she had seen Wallenberg in the 1960s in a Soviet prison.|$|E

Demonstrators violated the curfew and no one attempted to stop them. Looting was also reported, while no police were visible.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, {{a second}} trial {{took place in}} Orlando for the {{abduction}} and murder of Kimberly Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness</b> who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Bitola inscription where the victory of Samuil, commander of the Bulgarian army, is mentioned in summary form, several medieval historians have written accounts for the battle. Among them were Leo the Deacon who was <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness</b> and a direct participant in the campaign; John Skylitzes and two other historians George Kedrin and Joannes Zonaras who repeat the work of Skylitzes. Not only Byzantine historians wrote accounts for the battle, it was also recorded by the Melkite chronicler Yahaya of Antioch and the Armenians, Stephen of Taron (also known as Asolic) and Matthew of Edessa. More details {{can be found in}} the commended sermon of Saint Photius of Thessaly.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{are unsure}} whether either chronicler was present that evening. According to Crane, Froissart {{wrote of the}} event about five years later, and the monk about ten. Veenstra speculates that the monk may have been <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness</b> (as he was for much of Charles VI's reign) and that his account is the more {{accurate}} of the two. The monk's chronicle is generally accepted as essential for understanding the King's court, however his neutrality may {{have been affected by}} his pro-Burgundian and anti-Orléanist stance, causing him to depict the royal couple in a negative manner. A third account was written in the mid-15th century by Jean Juvenal des Ursins in his biography of Charles, L'Histoire de Charles VI: roy de France, not published until 1614.|$|E
5|$|Selvo {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first Doge {{in the history of}} Venice whose {{election}} was recorded by <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness,</b> a parish priest of the church of San Michele Archangelo by the name of Domenico Tino. The account gives historians a valuable glimpse {{of the power of the}} popular will of the Venetian people. Over the previous two centuries, the rule of quasi-tyrannies had plagued the popular belief that Venetians held democratic control over their leaders. The events of Selvo's election occurred in the spring of 1071, when the nearly thirty-year reign of Doge Domenico Contarini came to an end upon his death.|$|E
5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a cigarette {{in front of a}} police van in Lombard Street. <b>An</b> <b>eyewitness,</b> IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E

5|$|The Austro-Hungarians {{suffered}} about 225,000 casualties, including 30,000 killed, 173,000 {{wounded and}} 70,000 taken prisoner. They reported that 200 of their officers were taken prisoner {{during the battle}} and more than 130 cannon, 70 heavy machine-guns and a large quantity of matériel were captured. The Serbs also suffered heavy casualties, with 22,000 killed, 91,000 wounded and 19,000 missing or captured. The Western press was appalled with the scale of atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian troops against Serbian civilians, including women and children. William Shepard, of the United Press, confirmed as <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness</b> that at least eighteen towns were fully abandoned, and the whole of northwestern Serbia was nearly depopulated.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Barnet was an {{important}} engagement in the Wars of the Roses: it brought {{about the death of}} a prominent figure and secured the throne for another. Despite its importance to history, contemporary records about the battle are rare. The sole chronicle based on <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness</b> account—The Arrivall of Edward IV—was written by someone within Edward's council, which presents a biased account of the battle. Another first-hand observation was found in the Paston Letters, written by the Lancastrian Sir John Paston. Other records, such as The Warkworth Chronicle, offer only bits and pieces about the battle. Therefore, deficits in historical understanding must be filled through field research and discoveries of mediaeval documents.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring is {{featured}} in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being during the Prague Spring. It follows {{the repercussions of}} increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. The Liberators, by Viktor Suvorov, is <b>an</b> <b>eyewitness</b> description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, {{from the point of}} view of a Soviet tank commander. Rock 'n' Roll, a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution.
