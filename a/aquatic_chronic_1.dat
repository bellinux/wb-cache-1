50|$|Chronic toxicity, the {{development}} of adverse effects {{as a result of}} long term exposure to a contaminant or other stressor, is an important aspect of aquatic toxicology. Adverse effects associated with chronic toxicity can be directly lethal but are more commonly sublethal, including changes in growth, reproduction, or behavior. Chronic toxicity is in contrast to acute toxicity, which occurs over a shorter period of time to higher concentrations. Various toxicity tests can be performed to assess the chronic toxicity of different contaminants, and usually last at least 10% of an organism’s lifespan. Results of <b>aquatic</b> <b>chronic</b> toxicity tests can be used to determine water quality guidelines and regulations for protection of aquatic organisms.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Physiotherapy is {{considered}} an important treatment option in patients with upper limb complex regional pain syndrome type- 1 (CRPS- 1). In case of <b>chronic</b> CRPS- <b>1,</b> exercise therapy of the affected limb forms {{an important part of}} the physiotherapeutic program. We investigated whether muscle loading in <b>chronic</b> CRPS- <b>1</b> patients is associated with impairments in muscle circulation of the forearm of the affected limb. METHODS: Thirty patients with <b>chronic</b> CRPS- <b>1</b> unilaterally affecting their upper limbs, and 30 age-matched and sex-matched control participants were included in this study. Local muscle blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation were measured by near infrared spectroscopy within the muscles of the forearm at rest, after 1 -minute isometric handgrip exercises, and after arterial occlusion. Main outcome parameters were: local muscle blood flow, O 2 consumption (mVO 2), and postischemic reoxygenation (ReOx). RESULTS: We found no differences in baseline muscle blood flow, mVO 2, and ReOx between the affected CRPS- 1, unaffected CRPS- 1, and control arms. After exercise, mVO 2 of the affected CRPS- 1 arms was not different from the clinically unaffected CRPS- 1 arms. Furthermore, in comparison with the control arms, unaffected CRPS- 1 arms showed no difference in mVO 2 or ReOx. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle loading does not seems to be related to impairments in muscle oxygen uptake in forearm muscles of upper limbs affected by <b>chronic</b> CRPS- <b>1.</b> Our results suggest that exercise therapy can be safely used in physiotherapeutic training programs for <b>chronic</b> CRPS- <b>1</b> of the upper limb...|$|R

In this study mainly a rostrocaudal morphometrical analysis was performed in the substantia nigra of the lesioned side. The specificity of {{the action of the}} GM- 1 ganglioside on the substantia nigra DA cells was evaluated by a comparison with antiinflammatory drugs such as betametazon and acetylsalicylic acid. In the rostrocaudal analysis it was demonstrated that <b>chronic</b> GM- <b>1</b> treatment preferentially protected the caudally located dopamine nerve cells from degeneration after partial hemitransection, while instead this <b>chronic</b> GM- <b>1</b> treatment increased tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity mainly within the rostrally located DA nerve cells present close {{to the site of the}} lesion. Furthermore, the specificity of the GM- 1 action was demonstrated by the absence of protective effects of chronic treatment with betametazon and acetylsalicylic acid on the dopamine nerve cells of the lesioned side. These results open up the possibility that <b>chronic</b> GM- <b>1</b> treatment, by exerting a stimulatory metabolic action on the DA nerve cells located close to the lesion, can enhance the production of neurotrophic factors in these cells, which in turn can diffuse out to increase the survival of the less severely lesioned DA nerve cells located in the caudal part of the substantia nigra.

ETO-RACs could be derived for 31 insecticides applied to micro-/mesocosms in single or multiple applications, yielding a total number of 36 cases for comparison. The <b>chronic</b> Tier- <b>1</b> RACs calculated according to the EFSA approach resulted in a sufficient protection level, except for one neonicotinoid (slightly under-protective) and for several pyrethroids if toxicity data for A. bahia were not included. This latter observation {{can be explained by}} (1) the fact that A. bahia is the most sensitive standard test species for pyrethroids, (2) the hydrophobic properties of pyrethroids, and (3) the fact that long-term effects observed in (epi) benthic arthropods may be better explained by exposure via the sediment than via overlying water. Besides including toxicity data for A. bahia, the protection level for pyrethroids can be improved by selecting both D. magna and Chironomus spp. as standard test species for <b>chronic</b> Tier- <b>1</b> derivation.

40|$|We {{recently}} reported that insulin and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) can stimulate GLUT 4 translocation via the heterotrimeric G protein Gαq/ 11 and through PI 3 -kinase–mediated pathways in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Because both hormones stimulate glucose transport through a common downstream pathway, we determined whether <b>chronic</b> ET- <b>1</b> pretreatment would desensitize these cells to acute insulin signaling. We found that ET- 1 pretreatment substantially inhibited insulin-stimulated 2 -deoxyglucose uptake and GLUT 4 translocation. Cotreatment with the ETA receptor antagonist BQ 610 prevented these effects, whereas inhibitors of Gαi or Gβγ were without effect. <b>Chronic</b> ET- <b>1</b> treatment inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/ 11 and IRS- 1, {{as well as}} their association with PI 3 -kinase and blocked the activation of PI 3 -kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt. In addition, <b>chronic</b> ET- <b>1</b> treatment caused IRS- 1 degradation, which could be blocked by inhibitors of PI 3 -kinase or p 70 S 6 -kinase. Similarly, expression of a constitutively active Gαq mutant, but not the wild-type Gαq, led to IRS- 1 degradation and inhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS- 1, suggesting that the ET- 1 –induced decrease in IRS- 1 depends on Gαq/ 11 and PI 3 -kinase. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC was also reduced in ET- 1 treated cells, resulting in inhibition of the MAPK pathway. In conclusion, <b>chronic</b> ET- <b>1</b> treatment of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes leads to heterologous desensitization of metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin, most likely through the decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrates IRS- 1, SHC, and Gαq/ 11...|$|R

Methods: Transcripts encoding TLRs were assayed by quantitative real time RT-PCR on peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with HIV- 1 infection who were responding or not responding to antiretroviral therapy and healthy control subjects. Results: <b>Chronic</b> HIV- <b>1</b> -infected patients who failed to respond to therapy showed reduced expression of TLRs 3, 4 and 9, together with increased expression of TLR 7, as compared to healthy subjects.

Methods: Myotube cultures were established from lean and obese control subjects, and obese T 2 D subjects and treated with soluble FA 1 for 4 days supplemented with/without palmitate (PA). Lipid- and glucose metabolism were studied with labelled precursors while quantitative expression of genes was analyzed using Real-Time PCR. Results: Diabetic myotubes express significantly reduced insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism compared to lean myotubes and a significantly decreased basal PA oxidation. <b>Chronic</b> FA <b>1</b> exposure {{did not affect the}} intermediary metabolism in myotubes. Insulin sensitivity of glucose and lipid metabolism was not affected by <b>chronic</b> FA <b>1</b> exposure in myotubes established from lean, obese and T 2 D subjects.

40|$|Cardiac {{diseases}} such as coronary artery disease are the major causes of death around the world. Regulation of -adrenergic receptors by catecholamines is an important facet of understanding cardiac function in health and disease. Acute sympathetic activation of ARs results {{in an increase in}} cardiac output; however, sustained stimulation of the ARs is cytotoxic, leading to myocyte death and cardiac remodeling. -adrenergic blockers are a seminal class of drugs that {{play an important role in}} improving mortality and symptom control in various cardiac diseases. An important transcriptional regulatory protein target of -adrenergic signaling is MEF 2, which plays a crucial role in cardiac gene expression during pathologic and physiological adaptation of the heart. In our experiments, we have observed a robust effect of -blockers on MEF 2 transcriptional activity. Myocardial MEF 2 responses to -blocker treatment indicates an important physiological linkage between -adrenergic signaling and MEF 2 activity in the heart, which underpins changes in cardiac gene expression in response to -adrenergic blockade. In the first set of experiments, the link between MEF 2 and cardiac survival pathways in the heart was examined. Collectively, data indicate a mechanism of the beneficial effects of acute 1 AR blocker treatment through up-regulation of MEF 2 activity, leading to cardiomyocyte survival. In the second set of experiments, changes in MEF 2 activity and global gene transcription networks during heart failure and in response to <b>chronic</b> <b>1</b> -blockade was studied.
