The penetration of acoustically induced cavitation bubbles in micrometer-scale cavities is investigated experimentally by means of high-speed photography and acoustic measurements. Micrometer-scale cavities of different dimensions (width = 40 μm, 80 μm, 10 mm and depth = 50 μm) are designed to replicate the cross section of microvias in a PCB. The aim here is to present a method for enhancing mass transfer due to the penetration of bubbles in such narrow geometries under the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> The micrometer-scale cavities are placed in a test-cell filled with water and subjected to an ultrasound excitation at 75 kHz. A cavitation bubble cluster is generated {{at the mouth of the}} cavity which acts as a continuous source of bubbles that penetrate into the cavity. The radial oscillation characteristics and translation of these bubbles are investigated in detail here. It is observed that the bubbles arrange themselves into streamer-like structures inside the cavity. Parameters such as bubble population and size distribution and their correlation with the phase of the incident ultrasound radiation are investigated in detail here. This provides a valuable insight into the dynamics of bubbles in narrow confined spaces. Mass transfer investigations show that fresh liquid can be continuously introduced in the cavities under the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> Our findings may have important consequences in optimizing the filling processes for microvias with high aspect ratios.

Bubbles collapse asymmetrically to form a jets directed to the capillary but-end. By getting into the capillary channel, every such a jet increments the height of the capillary rise.

30|$|Very {{recently}} using magnetic nanoparticles {{for enhancing}} {{the effectiveness of}} ultrasonic was shown (Józefczak et al. 2016). It was indicated that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (US) for medical applications can be significantly improved by using sonosensitizers like magnetic nanoparticles with mean sizes of 10 – 300 [*]nm. These NPs can be more effectively heated because of additional attenuation and scattering of US. Accordingly, this can enhance the thermal effect <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (US) on the tissue by increasing US absorption. The other interesting aspect using magnetic NPs {{is that they are}} able to produce heat in the alternating magnetic field (magnetic hyperthermia). This is particularly important because it introduces synergetic application of ultrasonic and magnetic hyperthermia which can lead to a promising treatment modality. In particular, it was found that in the samples with magnetic nanoparticles, the synergetic <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> and magnetic field allowed achieving better heating effect in comparison to the heating by either US or alternating magnetic field (AMF) alone. This synergistic effect was confirmed by specific absorption rate (SAR) values. The following SAR values were, respectively, obtained: 66 mW/g for magnetic hyperthermia, 175 [*]mW/g for ultrasonic hyperthermia, and 375 [*]mW/g for both methods applied simultaneously.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} and vagal {{nerve stimulation}} are therapeutically effective in treating some neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. Optogenetic-based neurostimulation approaches {{are capable of}} activating individual synapses and yield the highest spatial control over brain circuit activity. Both electrical and light-based neurostimulation methods require intrusive procedures such as surgical implantation of electrodes or photon-emitting devices. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has also shown therapeutic effectiveness and represents a recent paradigm shift towards implementing less invasive brain stimulation methods. Magnetic-based stimulation, however, has a limited focusing capacity and lacks brain penetration power. Because ultrasound can be noninvasively transmitted through the skull to targeted deep brain circuits, it may offer alternative approaches to currently employed neuromodulation techniques.

30|$|Ultrasound via {{acoustic}} cavitation event induced in {{aqueous solution}} may produce several physical and chemical effects.

To better understanding the chemical <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> {{in aqueous solution}}, a characterization of the acoustic cavitation field is highly needed. In this work, the main characteristics of a 1700 -kHz cavitation field in water (bubble number and size, bubbles temperatures and pressures and bubbles chemical yields) were determined using a theoretical procedure based on single-bubble sonochemistry model. Subsequently, the degradation of TB, as substrate model of organic pollutants, using the 1700 -kHz cavitation field has been achieved at variable experimental conditions and in the presence of formic acid. Ultrasound at 1700  kHz generates cavitational microreactors of high temperatures and pressures, which could be an effective tool to degrade organic pollutants.|$|E

In this study, the nonlinear behaviour of individual gas bubble in liquid under the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> fields has been analysed, and simulated results of formation and collapse of a bubble have been provided.
