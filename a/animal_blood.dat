5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume <b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> (hematophagy). The common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} help them to detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. <b>Animal</b> <b>blood</b> gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was mainly}} shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, {{low-speed}} film that required {{four times more}} light than modern digital cameras. Most of the filming {{took place in the}} farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of <b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.|$|E

5|$|After much research, Bella {{concludes that}} Edward is {{seemingly}} human, but has mysterious powers resembling to a vampire. He eventually confirms this, {{but says he}} and the other Cullens only consume <b>animal</b> <b>blood.</b> The pair fall in love, and Edward introduces Bella to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the family patriarch, is a doctor working at the hospital in Forks. His wife is Esme, and Alice, Jasper, Emmett, and Rosalie, are their informally adopted children. Edward and Bella's relationship is soon put in jeopardy, when three nomadic vampires—James, Victoria, and Laurent—arrive in Forks. James, a tracker vampire with incredible hunting instincts, is instantly intrigued by Edward's protectiveness over a human, which incites him to hunt Bella for sport. Edward and the other Cullens risk their lives to protect Bella, but James tracks her to Phoenix, where she is hiding with Jasper and Alice. James lures Bella into a trap by falsely claiming that he is holding her mother hostage. James attacks Bella by biting her wrist, infecting her with vampire venom. After a ferocious battle, Edward subdues James just as the other Cullens arrive. Alice, Emmett, and Jasper kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her from turning into a vampire. In the aftermath of the battle, Bella has suffered a broken leg, and ends up in the hospital, but her mother comes in to visit. Upon returning to Forks, Edward accompanies Bella to the high school prom, where he refuses to grant her request that he would transform her into a vampire. As the couple dance, they are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is secretly watching, plotting revenge for her lover's death.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with William Harvey's {{experiments}} on {{the circulation of}} blood, research into blood transfusion began in the 17th century, with successful experiments in transfusion between animals. However, successive attempts by physicians to transfuse <b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> into humans gave variable, often fatal, results.|$|E
25|$|These early {{experiments}} with <b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> provoked a heated controversy in Britain and France. Finally, in 1668, the Royal Society and the French government both banned the procedure. The Vatican condemned these experiments in 1670. Blood transfusions fell into obscurity {{for the next}} 150 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{substance}} fights {{both internal}} and surface parasitic infection. Absorbed into the body through the skin and hair follicles, it travels through the bloodstream, intestines, and sebaceous glands; parasites ingest the drug when they feed on the <b>animal's</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|R
50|$|Essential Foods were {{developed}} {{with the aim}} of optimizing good behavior in companion animals, especially dogs, by ensuring stability of the <b>animal's</b> <b>blood</b> sugar levels. The high proportion of meat and low cooking temperature used in preparing the food are meant to stabilize blood sugar.|$|R
25|$|The Ebers papyrus, an {{important}} Egyptian medical treatise from around 1550 BC, describes a pulmonary consumption {{associated with the}} cervical lymph nodes. It recommended that it be treated with the surgical lancing of the cyst {{and the application of}} a ground mixture of acacia seyal, peas, fruits, <b>animal</b> <b>blood,</b> insect blood, honey and salt.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Hawaii, a luakini temple, or luakini heiau, was a Native Hawaiian sacred {{place where}} human and <b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> sacrifices were offered. Kauwa, the outcast or slave class, were {{often used as}} human sacrifices at the luakini heiau. They are {{believed}} to have been war captives, or the descendants of war captives. They were not the only sacrifices; law-breakers of all castes or defeated political opponents were also acceptable as victims.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to requiring that certain foods be eaten for sacred purposes, the Israelite diet {{was shaped by}} religious practices which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, {{both in terms of}} the animals permissible for eating, and the manner of their preparation. The cuisine of the Israelites thus differed from that of their neighbors in significant ways. For example, ancient Mesopotamian recipes describe foods cooked with <b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> and milk added to meat stews; this would have been avoided by the ancient Israelites.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{the mystical}} reason for salting temple sacrifices and {{slaughtered}} meat {{is to remove}} the blood of animal-like passions from the person. By removing the <b>animal's</b> <b>blood,</b> the <b>animal</b> energies and life-force contained in the blood are removed, making the meat fit for human consumption.|$|R
5000|$|The Israelites, {{believed}} that, {{since an}} <b>animal’s</b> <b>blood</b> represented its life, its blood {{should not be}} consumed (...) [...] The blood of a slaughtered animal was thus drained before the meat was used and the blood itself was not used as a cooking liquid or drink.|$|R
50|$|Horseshoe crabs are {{valuable}} {{as a species}} to the medical research community, and in medical testing. The above-mentioned clotting reaction of the <b>animal's</b> <b>blood</b> {{is used in the}} widely used Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test to detect bacterial endotoxins in pharmaceuticals and to test for several bacterial diseases.|$|R
25|$|As for {{distinguishing}} features, Bella {{has a small}} crescent-shaped scar on {{her hand}} where she was bitten by James, a tracker vampire, in Twilight. The scar is described as being pale, always a few degrees colder {{than the rest of}} her body, and it shines like a vampire's skin when exposed to the sunlight. After Bella is changed into a vampire by Edward, she becomes extremely beautiful with even paler skin, straight waist-length hair, and crimson red eyes that will eventually turn gold after months of drinking <b>animal</b> <b>blood.</b> Her features are also heightened and perfected by the transformation.|$|E
25|$|Artificially {{acquired}} {{passive immunity}} is a short-term immunization {{induced by the}} transfer of antibodies, which can be administered in several forms; as human or <b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> plasma, as pooled human immunoglobulin for intravenous (IVIG) or intramuscular (IG) use, and {{in the form of}} monoclonal antibodies (MAb). Passive transfer is used prophylactically in the case of immunodeficiency diseases, such as hypogammaglobulinemia. It is also used in the treatment of several types of acute infection, and to treat poisoning. Immunity derived from passive immunization lasts for only a short period of time, and there is also a potential risk for hypersensitivity reactions, and serum sickness, especially from gamma globulin of non-human origin.|$|E
25|$|After the {{excavation}} concluded, the suspects had unearthed 15 mutilated bodies, all males, including Kilroy's, {{who had been}} killed over a period of nine months. Kilroy's corpse was officially identified after the Brownsville police matched his dental records with the teeth found at the scene. Investigators concluded that most of the victims were rival drug dealers of Constanzo and not random sacrificial victims of the cult. Only three out of the 15 bodies were never identified. At Santa Elena, the Mexican police also seized 110kg (243 lb) of marijuana, 108 grams of cocaine, 12 firearms including three submachine guns, and 11 vehicles, some equipped with telephones. Inside an iron pot, investigators discovered remains of human brain, a goat's head, chicken feet, a turtle, several herbs, a horseshoe, and coins mixed with <b>animal</b> <b>blood.</b> They found no signs of cannibalism.|$|E

5|$|<b>Animals</b> without <b>blood</b> {{were divided}} into soft-shelled Malakostraka (crabs, lobsters, and shrimps); {{hard-shelled}} Ostrakoderma (gastropods and bivalves); soft-bodied Malakia (cephalopods); and divisible animals Entoma (insects, spiders, scorpions, ticks). Other <b>animals</b> without <b>blood</b> included fish lice, hermit crabs, red coral, sea anemones, sponges, starfish and various worms: Aristotle did not classify these into groups.|$|R
5|$|Aristotle {{distinguished}} about 500 {{species of}} birds, mammals and fishes in History of Animals and Parts of Animals. His system of classification, {{one of the}} earliest in scientific taxonomy, was influential for over two thousand years.

25|$|Bella annoys Edward with {{questions}} about how he saved her life. She hears that Edward {{and his family are}} vampires who drink <b>animal</b> <b>blood.</b> She is told legends of the local Quilyeute people by a friend Jacob Black who she met during a camp out. Disturbed by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. To her dismay, she then realizes that Edward hadn't come to school on the blood typing day because he is a vampire; she compares the characteristics of the vampires in mythology to the Cullens, and finds many similarities. Convinced he's a vampire, she finds herself in the state of bewilderment. Bella is saved by Edward again in Port Angeles when she is almost attacked. Driving a silver Volvo, Edward takes Bella to dinner and home. As they drive, she tells him of the stories that he is a vampire. Edward says he tried to stay away, finding her scent too desirable. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love.|$|E
25|$|Each {{individual}} {{has a family}} deity, called Kula dewa, who resides in the temple called the family temple that the individual and his family patronize. Balinese Hindu follow a 210-day calendar (based on rice crop and lunar cycles), and each temple celebrates its anniversary once every 210 days. Unique rituals and festivals of Balinese Hindus, that are not found in India, include those related to death {{of a loved one}} followed by cremations, cockfights, tooth filings, Nyepi and Galungan. Each temple anniversary, as well as festivals and family events such as wedding include flowers, offerings, towering bamboos with decoration at the end and a procession. These are celebrated by the community with prayers and feast. Most festivals have a temple as venue, and they are often occasions for prayers, celebration of arts and community. Some traditions, in contrast, involve animist rituals such as caru (<b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> sacrifice) such as Tabuh Rah (lethal cockfighting) or killing of an animal to appease buta kala (spirits of the earth) - however, the animal sacrifices are conducted outside the premises of a temple.|$|E
25|$|His first {{attempts}} at film direction had limited success, {{and he left}} Denmark {{to work in the}} French film industry. While living in France he met Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo {{and other members of the}} French artistic scene and in 1928 he made his first classic film, The Passion of Joan of Arc. Working from the transcripts of Joan's trial, he created a masterpiece of emotion that drew equally on realism and expressionism. Dreyer used private finance from Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg to make his next film as the Danish film industry was in financial ruin. Vampyr (1932) is a surreal meditation on fear. Logic gave way to mood and atmosphere in this story of a man protecting two sisters from a vampire. The movie contains many indelible images, such as the hero, played by de Gunzburg (under the screen name Julian West), dreaming of his own burial and the <b>animal</b> <b>blood</b> lust on the face of one of the sisters as she suffers under the vampire's spell. The film was shot mostly silent but with sparse, cryptic dialogue in three separate versions – English, French and German.|$|E

25|$|Vasodilators, such as {{acepromazine}}, {{can help}} improve {{blood flow to}} the muscles. However, the owner should only give acepromazine if it is prescribed by the horse's veterinarian, as it can lower the <b>animal's</b> <b>blood</b> pressure and can cause collapse in a severely dehydrated horse. The human drug dantrolene is sometimes given to alleviate the muscle spasms and prevent further degeneration of muscle tissue.|$|R
