Results indicate that dynamic factors {{play a significant role}} in determining the allocation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banana</b> expenditures across exporting sources. Of particular interest is Guatemala’s increased share and Costa Rica’s decreased share of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banana</b> supply. A number of factors explained why Guatemala replaced Costa Rica as the leading U. S. supplier in 2007. (1) Guatemala is the least expensive source on average. (2) Habit persistence, adjustment costs, and other dynamic factors favor Guatemala’s exports. (3) Given increases in the relative price of Costa Rica’s bananas, the price competition between Costa Rica and Guatemala is highly significant. (4) Bananas from Costa Rica are highly responsive to own-price while imports from Guatemala are more price-inelastic. (5) Heavy rains and fluctuating temperatures in Costa Rica have decreased banana production and exports. bananas, imports, demand, Latin America, United States, Demand and Price Analysis, International Relations/Trade, F 14, Q 11, Q 13, Q 17,...|$|R

40|$|Background: A disintegrin and {{metalloprotease}} 12 <b>s</b> (<b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s)</b> is {{a potential}} first trimester serum marker for fetal trisomy and adverse pregnancy outcome in singletons. In this study, <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> levels in first trimester serum of uncomplicated and complicated twins were evaluated. Methods: <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> was studied in maternal serum of 215 twin pregnancies, collected between 2004 and 2008. <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> was measured 'blind to outcome' using AutoDelfia (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland). As a reference, data from 2423 singletons were used. Results: The median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> level was increased in euploid twins [1. 61 multiples of the median (MoM); n = 209] compared with singletons. The median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoM was significantly lower in monochorionic (1. 36 MoM; n = 41) compared with dichorionic twins (1. 67 MoM; n = 168) (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0. 005). Trisomy 21 was identified in two pregnancies. Median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoM in twins complicated by hypertensive disorders (1. 77 MoM, n = 35) or small for gestational age fetus (1. 54 MoM; n = 24) was {{not significantly different from}} uncomplicated twins (1. 64 MoM; n = 134). Conclusion: Median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoM in euploid twins was increased compared with singletons. Monochorionic had significantly lower median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoM than dichorionic twins. Median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoMs were not significantly different in twins complicated by hypertensive disorders or small for gestational age fetus compared with uncomplicated twins.

40|$|Background <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> is a placenta-derived {{glycoprotein}} that {{is involved}} in growth and differentiation, and {{has been shown to}} be a potential first-trimester and second-trimester marker of Trisomy 21 and other aneuploides. Maternal <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> concentrations show a considerable temporal variation with gestational age and here we study the levels at 11 – 13 weeks of gestation to establish the effectiveness or otherwise at a time when other established markers are used. Materials and Methods Samples collected as part of routine first-trimester screening were retrieved from storage. In total, 46 samples from pregnancies with Trisomy 21 were identified and collected between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation—of these 83 % had been identified by combined first-trimester screening. A series of 414 gestational age-matched samples collected during the same period formed the control group. <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> was measured by a new DELFIA assay incorporating two monoclonals (6 E 6 and 8 F 8). Results were expressed as weight-corrected multiples of the median (MoM). Results The median MoM <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> rose from 0. 914 at 11 weeks to 1. 032 at 13 weeks. Conclusions Combining the data from this study and other published studies suggests that <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> is unlikely to be of much additional value when screening for Trisomy 21 in the period 11 – 13 weeks. More studies are required looking at the potential of <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> prior to 10 weeks. Copyright 2008 John Wile...|$|R
