5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, {{architecture}} {{developed into}} the late Baroque style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even more ambitious was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a well-balanced and cohesive Baroque palace.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} years of the ninth century, three sub-ealdormen ruled Mercia under Æthelred. Æthelflæd's uncle, Æthelwulf, {{controlled}} western and possibly central Mercia, while the south and east were ruled by Æthelfrith, the father of Æthelstan Half-King. Alhhelm was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw. Æthelwulf and Alhhelm are not recorded <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, and Æthelfrith may have been Æthelflæd's chief lieutenant when Æthelred's health collapsed soon afterwards. Keynes sees Æthelfrith as an ealdorman of West Saxon origin, probably appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south-east Mercia.|$|E

Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship's completion; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish the ship in November 1881. At the time, she was {{the largest and most}} powerful ship in the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and she would keep that distinction until <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century.

This paper {{presents}} {{problem of}} {{the examination of the}} parameters of cutting process on the micro-geometric and macro-geometric parameters <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> composite material with natural reinforcement (material is combination of two different phases – the plastic matrix and wood flour). The article deals with effect of feed rate and cutting speed to roundness deviation and maximum roughness depth. The results were analysed using device of surface roughness, roundness/cylindricity and digital microscopic camera. From the result, the surface roughness is mostly influenced by feed rate...|$|R
5|$|The {{early years}} of the Representatives' Centralization of Germany were {{dominated}} by a discussion on how to finance strikes by individual local trade unions. The issue was how local unions could retain their autonomy when receiving financial assistance. Originally, all support between local organizations had been voluntary. But this system became more and more impractical, especially <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century saw numerous large strikes in which employers reacted more aggressively— often by locking out workers. In 1899, the Business Committee felt it had to support a strike in Braunschweig. It took out a loan, which was paid off with dues income and from donations by Berlin unions. The following year, the Business Committee incurred 8,000 Marks in debt by supporting strikes. Part of the debt was paid off by the SPD, while the rest was apportioned among the local unions.|$|E
5|$|With the {{takeover}} of two French name brands, HOM and Valisère, Triumph International ventured into the men's underwear and high-quality lingerie market. At the same time, the company announced in 1995 {{that in the future}} it would focus more on its Triumph umbrella brand, under which a number of brands would be classified. To that end, an advertising campaign was launched featuring Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen. In the 1990s, Triumph International launched another phase of international expansion, and since 1998 it has been present on the subcontinent of India. In 2001, its newest production facility opened in Dunaújváros (Hungary). <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> millennium, Triumph {{was one of the biggest}} textile manufacturers in terms of sales in the domestic market.|$|E
5|$|Since the university's {{establishment}} {{in the city}} in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 {{with the arrival of}} the Michigan Central Railroad, and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling. Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.|$|E

In January and February 1972, United conceded 16 goals, including 5 at Elland Road. O'Farrell attempted {{to shore up the}} leaky defence with the signing of Martin Buchan from Aberdeen for a (then) club record fee of £125,000. United never recovered their early season form and they could only manage an eighth-place finish.|$|R

5|$|The three Kaiser Maxes were {{stricken}} {{from the}} naval register <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century {{to free up}} funds for new construction projects. Kaiser Max and Don Juan d'Austria were deleted from the list in December and June 1904, respectively, though Prinz Eugen lingered on until December 1912. The first two ships became floating barracks and Prinz Eugen was converted into a repair ship and renamed Vulkan. All {{three members of the}} class remained in the navy's inventory through World War I; Italy seized Kaiser Max and Vulkan, though both were awarded to the Royal Yugoslav Navy in the postwar peace negotiations. Italy refused to relinquish Vulkan, the fate of which is unknown, but Kaiser Max was transferred to Yugoslavia and renamed Tivat. The ship was either scrapped in 1924, or kept in the Yugoslav inventory until the country was overrun in the Axis invasion during World War II, her fate after falling back into Italian hands unknown. Don Juan d'Austria, meanwhile, sank under uncertain circumstances in 1919 before she could be seized by the victorious Allied powers.|$|E

5000|$|The Peripheral is an {{emphatic}} {{return to}} the science fiction he ceased to write <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> this century, set in {{not one but two}} futures. The first, not far off from our own present day, takes place in a Winter's Bone-ish world where the only industries still surviving are lightly evolved versions of Walmart and the meth trade. The second future is set further along in time, after a series of not-quite-cataclysmic events that have killed most of the world's population, leaving behind a monarchic class of gangsters, performance artists, and publicists in an otherwise deserted London. Like many Gibson books, The Peripheral is basically a noirish murder mystery wearing a cyberpunk leather jacket and, after an uncharacteristically dense first one hundred pages, a super enjoyable read—though perhaps less so when you consider just how accurate Gibson can be when he's thinking about what might come next.
