5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including <b>acetal</b> resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured <b>acetal</b> joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

25|$|Sugar can be {{characterized}} by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full <b>acetal.</b> This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full <b>acetal</b> with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose {{does not have a}} reducing end because of full <b>acetal</b> formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).|$|E

25|$|In a {{finished}} product, {{such a change}} is to be prevented or delayed. Failure of safety-critical polymer components can cause serious accidents, such as fire {{in the case of}} cracked and degraded polymer fuel lines. Chlorine-induced cracking of <b>acetal</b> resin plumbing joints and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious floods in domestic properties, especially in the USA in the 1990s. Traces of chlorine in the water supply attacked vulnerable polymers in the plastic plumbing, a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly extruded or injection molded. Attack of the <b>acetal</b> joint occurred because of faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting which is a serious stress concentration.|$|E

25|$|The Ireland–Claisen {{rearrangement}} is {{the reaction}} of an allylic carboxylate with a strong base (such as lithium diisopropylamide) to give a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The rearrangement proceeds via silylketene <b>acetal,</b> which is formed by trapping the lithium enolate with chlorotrimethylsilane. Like the Bellus-Claisen (above), Ireland-Claisen rearrangement can take place at room temperature and above. The E- and Z-configured silylketene acetals lead to anti and syn rearranged products, respectively. There are numerous examples of enantioselective Ireland-Claisen rearrangements found in literature to include chiral boron reagents {{and the use of}} chiral auxiliaries.|$|E
25|$|In the acetalisation reaction, under acidic or basic conditions, {{an alcohol}} {{adds to the}} {{carbonyl}} group and a proton is transferred to form a hemiacetal. Under acidic conditions, the hemiacetal and the alcohol can further react to form an <b>acetal</b> and water. Simple hemiacetals are usually unstable, although cyclic ones such as glucose can be stable. Acetals are stable, but revert to the aldehyde {{in the presence of}} acid. Aldehydes can react with water to form hydrates, R−CH(OH)2. These diols are stable when strong electron withdrawing groups are present, as in chloral hydrate. The mechanism of formation is identical to hemiacetal formation.|$|E

25|$|Asymmetric ion pairs {{can also}} be {{attacked}} in intermolecular reactions. In an interesting example, asymmetric addition of enol silane nucleophiles to oxocarbenium ions can be effected by catalytically forming the oxocarbenium through anion binding. Starting from an <b>acetal,</b> the chloroether is generated with boron trichloride and reacted with the enol silane and catalyst. The mechanism of formation of the oxocarbenium-thiourea-chloride complex is not fully resolved. It is thought that under the reaction conditions, the chloroether can epimerize and thiourea can stereoselectively bind chloride to form a closely associated ion pair. This asymmetric ion pair is then attacked by the silane to generate alkylated product.|$|E
