40|$|As the {{aviation}} industry moves from paper maps and charts to the digital cockpit and electronic flight bag, producers {{of these products}} need current and accurate data to ensure flight safety. FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) require certified suppliers to follow a defined protocol to produce authoritative <b>map</b> <b>data</b> for the <b>aerodrome.</b> Typical airport <b>maps</b> have been produced to meet 5 m accuracy requirements. The new digital aviation world is moving to 1 m accuracy maps to provide better situational awareness on the aerodrome. The commercial availability of 0. 5 m satellite imagery combined with accurate ground control is enabling the production of avionics certified. 85 m orthophotos of airports around the globe.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} Knowledge-Based System (KBS) to tracking. Section 2 paves {{the way to the}} new technology by discussing the following topics: historical survey of stochastic filtering theory; overview of tracking systems with some details on mono-sensor and multi-sensor tracking, evolution of filtering logics, evolution of correlation logics, and presentation of recent findings on non linear filtering (e. g. : unscented Kalman filter, particle filter) theory which go beyond the classical Kalman filtering. After this introduction to {{the current state of the}} art, Section 3 discusses the new technology referred to as “knowledgebased tracker”: a tracker that exploits a-priori knowledge (e. g. : <b>map</b> <b>data)</b> to gain improved performance. Three applications follow: the first refers to the A-SMGCS (Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System) for traffic control on the surface of an airport (section 4); in this case the target tracker is enhanced by exploiting the knowledge of the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>map</b> with runways, taxiways etc. The sensor is a high resolution surface based radar. The theme of section 5 is the tracking of ground moving or stationary vehicles using an airborne GMTI radar. Here we need to take care of the constraints imposed by the terrain (for which only uncertain data might be available), road networks and regions that could be not-trafficable. These information, also in this case, lead to finite support for the distribution of the target state; the classical Kalman filter doesn’t work well and KBS tracker is needed. The last application (section 6) refers to tracking o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a framework that}} provides domain specific classes for accessing and updating topic <b>map</b> <b>data</b> structures in a distributed environment. While work on Topic Map Web Services (TMWS) [1][2][3][4][5] have begun to provide developers with SOA type patterns for interacting with Topic <b>Map</b> <b>data</b> {{there is still a}} need for developers {{to be able to work}} with higher level views of the topic <b>map</b> <b>data.</b> TMAPI [6] has been the de-facto mechanism by which developers have accessed and updated topic <b>map</b> <b>data.</b> Topic <b>Map</b> Objects marries the advances in TMWS development with advances in modern language features of Java and C#. The result is a framework that allows developers to work with classes and objects that are relevant to the problem domain at hand. The expected contribution from this development is that developers can more easily use and work with topic maps with only a limited amount of knowledge about the full Topic <b>Map</b> <b>Data</b> Model (TMDM) [7]. In addition, developers will spend less time writing specific access code in order to construct domain specific applications...|$|R
