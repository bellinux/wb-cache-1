5|$|The song {{drew the}} {{attention}} of music blogs and received positive reviews from some critics but failed to chart anywhere. A music video for the song, which was directed by Motellet Film <b>and</b> <b>Lo,</b> was released on 5 October 2012. It shows the singer covered in black paint and performing acrobatics {{in the middle of}} a road and on a football field. Lo performed the track several times, including on the Swedish campaign Musikhjälpen and at Notting Hill Arts Club in London, United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|An Octopus card may store {{a maximum}} value of HK$1,000, with an On-Loan card having an initial deposit value of HK$50 and a Sold card having no initial deposit value. Negative value is {{incurred}} on a card {{if it is}} used with insufficient funds—both types of cards may carry a maximum negative value of HK$35 before value needs {{to be added to}} them again for use. At the time, the maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line was HK$34.8, the cost of travelling between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> Wu Station; the current maximum cost is HK$55.3, the cost of travelling between Disneyland Resort Station and either Lo Wu Station or Lok Ma Chau Station.|$|E
5|$|Lauren <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> {{decide to}} host a {{farewell}} party as they prepare {{to move out of}} their house. As wedding preparations continue, Stephanie becomes upset after learning that Heidi has chosen her sister Holly as her maid-of-honor. During the bridal shower, Stephanie assumes the responsibilities after she becomes increasingly displeased with Holly's poor performance. After she makes amends with Spencer, Darlene gives him her blessing for the nuptials. While out for dinner, Brody tries to convince Lauren to attend the wedding, knowing that Heidi would appreciate her presence. In a later outing, Spencer tells Brody of his couples' therapy sessions with Heidi, but is displeased that he is not taken seriously. At the fashion public relations firm People's Revolution, Lauren tells Kelly that she will be leaving the company, which Kelly advocates as a smart decision that will help her to determine her next career endeavors.|$|E

5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E
25|$|MIPS I has {{instructions}} for signed and unsigned integer multiplication and division. These instructions source their operands from two GPRs and write their results {{to a pair}} of 32-bit registers called HI <b>and</b> <b>LO,</b> since they may execute separately from (and concurrently with) the other CPU instructions. For multiplication, the high- and low-order halves of the 64-bit product is written to HI <b>and</b> <b>LO</b> (respectively). For division, the quotient is written to LO and the remainder to HI. To access the results, a pair of instructions (Move from HI and Move from LO) is provided to copy the contents of HI or LO to a GPR. These instructions are interlocked: reads of HI <b>and</b> <b>LO</b> do not proceed past an unfinished arithmetic instruction that will write to HI <b>and</b> <b>LO.</b> Another pair of instructions (Move to HI or Move to LO) copies the contents of a GPR to HI <b>and</b> <b>LO.</b> These instructions are used to restore HI <b>and</b> <b>LO</b> to their original state after exception handling. Instructions that read HI or LO must be separated by two instructions that do not write to HI or LO.|$|E

25|$|With {{the start}} of the {{transition}} to democracy in 1990, the city of Santiago had surpassed the three million inhabitants, with the majority living in the south: La Florida was the most populous area, followed by Puente Alto and Maipú. The real estate development in these municipalities and others like Quilicura and Peñalolen largely came from the construction of housing projects for middle-class families. Meanwhile, high-income families moved into the foothills, now called Barrio Alto, increasing the population of Las Condes and giving rise to new communes like Vitacura <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> Barnechea. Moreover, although poverty began to drop significantly, there remained a strong dichotomy between the thriving global city and scattered city slums.|$|E
25|$|What {{emerged as}} well {{was that the}} {{position}} of Salvatore Lo Piccolo was not undisputed. Authorities said they avoided the outbreak of a war inside Cosa Nostra. The first clash would have been between Rotolo <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> Piccolo. What sparked off the crisis was a request from the Inzerillo family, one of the clans whose leaders – among them Salvatore Inzerillo – {{were killed by the}} Corleonesi during the Second Mafia War in the 1980s and which are now in exile in the United States. Rotolo had passed a death sentence on Lo Piccolo and his son, Sandro, even before Provenzano's arrest – and even procured the barrels of acid that are used to dissolve the bodies of slain rivals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, her singing voice {{strained}} from overwork, {{she appeared in}} the London cast of the Ivor Novello play, Party which opened in London on 23 May 1932. With {{the onset of the}} Depression, she returned to Hollywood and began teaching voice, counting the actors Ramón Novarro and Frances Drake among her pupils. Subsequent theatrical performances on Broadway and on tour included supporting parts in Enter Madame, Night of Love, Claudia, <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> and Behold. During the 1940s/50s, her voice mellowed to that of a mezzo-soprano and she enjoyed modest success on the concert recital circuit, singing occasionally on radio. On tour, many of her costumes were designed by her friend and patroness, heiress Natalie Hays Hammond, daughter of the real adventurer who discovered King Solomon's Mines.|$|E

25|$|Wang takes Jack to his restaurant, {{where they}} {{meet up with}} Gracie, her {{journalist}} friend Margo, Wang's friend Eddie Lee (Donald Li), and magician Egg Shen (Victor Wong), a local authority on mysticism <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> Pan. They try to explain to an incredulous Jack (who only wants his truck back) the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought with them to America. The group devises a plan to infiltrate a brothel, where they believe Miao Yin is held. They break in with some difficulty, but are interrupted by the Storms tearing off the ceiling and making off with Miao Yin, taking her to their master Lo Pan. Jack and Wang track down the front business used by Lo Pan and impersonate electricians to gain access, but are quickly subdued by Rain. After being tied up and beaten by Thunder, the two meet Lo Pan - however, he now appears as a crippled old man.|$|E
25|$|Wang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs {{a special}} green-eyed girl to break an ancient curse, and {{he intends to}} {{sacrifice}} Miao Yin. Centuries ago, Lo Pan, a great warrior and even greater wizard, was defeated in battle by the first sovereign emperor, Qin Shi Huang. The Emperor cursed Lo Pan with incorporeality; although Lo Pan can be temporarily granted a decrepit body by supplication to the gods, he must marry a woman with green eyes to appease Ching Dai, the God of the East, and sacrifice her to satisfy the Emperor. When Jack and Wang's friends attempt to save them, they are also captured, <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too. Lo Pan decides to sacrifice Gracie, while making Miao Yin his unwilling wife. After getting the drop on Thunder, Jack and Wang escape, and free many women kept in holding cells in the process; a horrible orangutan-like monster recaptures Gracie before she leaves.|$|E
