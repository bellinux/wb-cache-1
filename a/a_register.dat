5|$|During Milhail Kogălniceanu's lifetime, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; {{in his speech}} to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, and gave his exact birth date as present in <b>a</b> <b>register</b> kept by his father. It was also then that he mentioned his godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and {{was the mother of}} Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu's would-be protector and foe).|$|E

5|$|The {{main goal}} of the Liber was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep <b>a</b> <b>register</b> of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the Liber should be seen as a working document, compiled {{for the use of the}} bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The Liber was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{clarinet}} {{developed from}} a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This instrument {{was similar to}} a recorder, but with a single-reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore. Lacking <b>a</b> <b>register</b> key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about {{one and a half}} octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{cemetery}} {{is surrounded}} by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance. For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain <b>a</b> <b>register</b> with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.|$|E
5|$|Although still mainly bred in the Kathiawar peninsula, it is {{also found}} in the Maharashtra and Rajasthan states. The Kathiawari Horse Breeders' Association {{maintains}} <b>a</b> <b>register.</b> The Gujarat government maintains stud farms in eleven different locations; one in Junagadh holds both mares and stallions and is tasked with preserving the breed, while the other ten hold Kathiawari stallions that are used for improving the local stock of other or mixed breeds. In 2007, only about 50 Kathiawaris were held by private breeders.Today, the Panchaal region is renowned for its Kathiawari horses, often producing the most beautiful horses of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{ordered an}} inquest into the {{revenues}} and resources of his bishopric, {{along with the}} customs of the see. This took place in 1183, {{and when it was}} finished, the results were entered into <b>a</b> <b>register</b> that became known as the Boldon Book. Hugh also fought a long-running disagreement with his own cathedral chapter over the right to oversee the monks, a conflict that lasted about 40 years. This led to the monks forging many documents purporting to show that earlier bishops had granted the monks rights and privileges exempting them from episcopal oversight. He also fought with Archbishop Roger of York over lands they both held in each other's see.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, McAloney {{was posted}} to the Directorate of Equipment at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. In this {{capacity}} he advised on the procurement {{of equipment and}} spare parts for RAAF aircraft. He was further tasked with compiling <b>a</b> <b>register</b> of aeroplane equipment at RAAF flight training units and operational bases throughout Australia. The latter entailed McAloney visiting several Air Force units in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to check equipment stores. On 1 March 1942, he was commissioned as a flying officer. Transferred to the Directorate of Equipment Administration in July, McAloney was made Officer Commanding Technical and Photographic Staffs {{and served as a}} liaison between his own directorate and that of Technical Services.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at <b>a</b> <b>register</b> office. None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E

5|$|Riel {{made his}} way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the House of Commons—Edward Blake, the Premier of Ontario, had {{announced}} a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest. Famously, Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great Pacific Scandal debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the interim prime minister, and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign <b>a</b> <b>register</b> book at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of Lisgar.|$|E

Above the 1st hole, there is a key that lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet. A key {{at the side of}} the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E
5|$|The re-interment in the Mussolini family crypt in Predappio {{was carried}} out on 1 September 1957, with {{supporters}} present giving the fascist salute. Mussolini was laid to rest in a large stone sarcophagus. The tomb is decorated with fascist symbols and contains a large marble head of Mussolini. In front of the tomb is <b>a</b> <b>register</b> for visitors paying their respects to sign. The tomb has become a neo-fascist place of pilgrimage. The numbers signing the tomb's register range from dozens to hundreds per day, with thousands signing on certain anniversaries; almost all the comments left are supportive of Mussolini.|$|E

5|$|The regular {{army was}} {{supported}} by the Territorial Force, and by reservists. In August 1914, there were three forms of reserves. The Army Reserve of retired soldiers was 145,350 strong. They were paid 3Shillings and 6pence a week (17.5pence) worth about £70 per week in 2013 terms, and had to attend 12 training days per year. The Special Reserve had another 64,000 men and was a form of part-time soldiering, similar to the Territorial Force. A Special Reservist had an initial six months full-time training and was paid the same as a regular soldier during this period; they had three or four weeks training per year thereafter. The National Reserve had some 215,000 men, who were on <b>a</b> <b>register</b> that was maintained by Territorial Force County Associations; these men had military experience, but no other reserve obligation.|$|E

At the same time, he participated in the crafty diplomatic tactics that resulted in peace with Pisa and Lucca. As head of the mint beginning in 1316, he collected its earlier records and created <b>a</b> <b>register</b> of all the coins struck in Florence. In 1321, he was again chosen prior, and in 1324 was deputed to inspect the rebuilding of the city walls. He went with the Florentine army to fight against Castruccio Castracani, lord of Lucca, and was present at Altopascio during Florence's defeat. In his Cronica, he gave a detailed account of why Florence was unable to acquire Lucca after the death of Castruccio Castracani.|$|E
