25|$|In January 1958, {{soon after}} the death of Shoghi Effendi in November, another {{intercontinental}} conference was held in Kampala and attended by his widow Ruhiyyih Khanum. Though sorrowful at his death, there was a call to service in honor of his service. The conference had been initially planned for less than 400 attendees and was overwhelmed as news of over 300 Persians alone were coming. Ultimately some 950 Bahá'ís, six Hands of the Cause, a member of the International Bahá'í Council, sixteen <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Board</b> members, and representatives from eleven national spiritual assemblies (including those from the four African regional assemblies, those from the other national assemblies which had participated in campaign to bring the religion to sub-Saharan Africa - Britain, India, Iraq, Persia, and the United States - and those from Arabia and Japan), 450 African members, over 300 from Persia, two Knights of Bahá'u'lláh (one from the Pacific and one from the Arctic), and others from rest of the world were present at the formal convening of the conference as well as telegrams received from many other Hands of the Cause and 34 national assemblies arrived. Reportedly every hotel room was booked. Ruhiyyih Khanum anointed most attendees with Attar of rose before being admitted into a viewing of relics of Bahá'u'lláh as well as a reproduction of a painting of him {{on the first day of}} the conference. Viewings were also held of a large map by Shoghi Effendi showing the progress of the religion, films of Shrines and gardens from the Bahá'í World Center, as it existed then, as well as the Monument on the grave of Shoghi Effendi. Some $280,000 was raised at the conference from a segment of the attendees for donation to the progress of the religion. The foundation stone for the Mother Temple of Africa was laid and relics in silk bags made by Bahiyyih Khánum were set in place (planned to be under the wall on that side of the Temple facing out across a grassy valley towards the Bahá'í Qiblih.) Ruhiyyih Khanum then spent a day among the Tseo people - speaking to school groups, receiving guests, and visiting homes. She donated money for the reconstruction of a center that had been lost.|$|E

The 1971 National Baha'i Youth School was held in Pisa in April and was followed by a public conference and in June a Youth Symposium in San Marino was used to plan participation in a continental conference as well as a public meeting. In 1975 group of about 170 attended the National Youth Symposium at Florence. An additional school was held in Vieste as well. The September 1977 Bahá'í summer school was held in Giulianova - one of the speakers was Adib Taherzadeh. He was a speaker at the 1978 school along with others and a special guest Dr. Pagnanelli, director of the information center of the United Nations Organization in Rome, gave a public talk on [...] "The First 30 Years of the United Nations Organization." [...] Eight hundred-fifty people from 19 countries attended the 1983 Italian Bahá'í summer school in the southern city of Cosenza.

Mexican pioneers are noted as pioneering {{to other countries}} and other states in Mexico from 1967. Youth from the United States were known to offer a period {{of service to the}} Yucatan area including the institute there and accompanied the <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Board</b> member on many trips. In October there was a major regional conference in Panama at which there was a viewing of a copy of the photograph of Bahá'u'lláh on the highly significant occasion commemorating the centenary of Bahá'u'lláh's writing of the Suriy-i-Mulúk (Tablet to the Kings), which Shoghi Effendi describes as [...] "the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bahá'u'lláh". It also served as a laying of a cornerstone for the first Latin American Bahá'í House of Worship. To this conference there were delegations of various Mexican peoples and institutions. Meanwhile, short term pioneers continued to come to Mexico. Indian actor and documentarian Phil Lucas was among those that lived in Mexico in the 1970s. Bahá'ís reached out to various city and state leaders who were presented with Bahá'í literature including the Governor of Yucatan, and the Governor of Oaxaca.|$|E

2500|$|Through 1961-2 various public {{meetings}} {{began to be}} held. In February 1961 a joint conference of the Bahá'ís of two cities of Venice and Padua reviewed {{the progress of the}} religion there while a public meeting for the Bahá'í Naw-Rúz gathered Bahá'ís and guests from Bologna, Florence, Padua, Rimini, and San Marino. In October there were three events held to honor the United Nations. The first two were talks by Dr. Alessandro Bausani, member of the Italo-Swiss National Assembly and professor of oriental languages at the Universities of Rome and Naples, on the theme of [...] "United Nations and a United World" [...] in Florence and Bologna. The third event was <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Board</b> member Mario Piarulli who spoke in Padua about the UN before an international audience. A feature writer of the Socialist newspaper Avanti interviewed Bausani, and then wrote an account, not only of the meeting but also of the religion in general. A public initiative in Turin drew about eighty people from Genoa, Milan, and Turin to hear Ugo Giachery speak about his slide-illustrated recent visit to Central America. This was followed by a series of six {{public meetings}} to give anyone interested an opportunity to investigate the religion. The average attendance was about seventy. In Bologna a public meeting was held where the audience heard Dr. Giachery on [...] "Bahá'í approaches to modern problems". Another public meeting took place in Padua among youth.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the number}} of Bahá'ís was growing rapidly, Shoghi Effendi asked if members of the {{religion}} could pioneer to neighboring areas where there were still no Bahá'ís. On April 21, 1954 a Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was formed and five young Cameroonians left during the Ridván period, each becoming a Knight of Bahá'u'lláh; the various protectorates they arrived in merged into the modern countries of Cameroon, Ghana, and Togo. It was emphasized that western pioneers be self-effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans - and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense {{of service to the}} Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion are to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background. Enoch Olinga is specifically mentioned as an example of this process unfolding as he arose out of Uganda and repeated the quick growth of the religion. Because of the successive waves of people becoming Knights of Bahá'u'lláh, Enoch Olinga was entitled [...] "Abd'l-Futuh", a Persian name meaning [...] "the father of victories" [...] by Shoghi Effendi. In very early 1955, Valerie Wilson, an <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Board</b> member for Africa stationed in Monrovia, Liberia, embarked on what was considered a bold trip for a woman alone by car to travel on a trip across some [...] to visit the Bahá'í groups functioning in the Gold Coast, Togoland and the British Cameroons. In April 1955 British Cameroon had eight assemblies.|$|E
2500|$|A {{regional}} National Spiritual Assembly for Central America, Mexico and the Antilles {{was then}} elected in 1951 attended by Dorothy Baker and Horace Holley serving as special representatives. The convention hosted 25 delegates from Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Jamaica. Following the election {{a letter of}} the regional assembly noted that [...] "Considerable attention is being paid to stressing the need throughout the area of a much {{greater understanding of the}} administration of the religion. Local assemblies are being taught, by means of the National Teaching Committee and the Baha'i Bulletin to acquire a much higher concept of their own importance as governing bodies. They are being groomed slowly but surely to realize that they are not merely groups of nine people gathered together in a purely spiritual unity, but nine members of a governing body, gathered together to maintain order and peace in their own communities, resolve their problems through the medium of prayer and consultation and to devise efficient ways and means of spreading the Faith in the territory under their immediate jurisdiction." [...] The 1952 members were Raquel Constante, Cora Oliver, James Facey, Elena Marella, Artemus Lamb, Louise Caswell, Zenayda Jurado, David Escalante, and Randolph Fitz–Henley. 1955's convention was held in Mexico City with 27 delegates, 16 of whom attended. During this time <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Board</b> members, assistants to Hands of the Cause at the time, carried on a campaign of visiting many communities with many pioneers still being coordinated by the regional assembly. The first assembly of Monterrey formed in 1956. In July 1956 the first Mexican conference was held about issues specific to Mexico about the promulgation of the religion.|$|E
