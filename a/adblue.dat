25|$|Urea {{is used in}} SNCR and SCR {{reactions}} to reduce the NOx pollutants in exhaust gases from combustion from Diesel, dual fuel, and lean-burn natural gas engines. The BlueTec system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution into the exhaust system. The ammonia produced by the hydrolysis of the urea reacts with the nitrogen oxide emissions and is converted into nitrogen and water within the catalytic converter. Trucks and cars using these catalytic converters need to carry a supply of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF, also known as <b>AdBlue),</b> a mixture of urea and water.|$|E

50|$|Low fuel {{consumption}} and Euro 6-standard emissions (effective from September 2015) are also {{made possible by}} the use of Opel’s “BlueInjection” selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system, which injects <b>AdBlue,</b> a urea-and-water solution, into the exhaust stream. The solution decomposes into ammonia, which is then stored on a catalyst substrate. When nitrogen oxide (NOx) from the exhaust gases enters the catalyst, it is then selectively reduced to nitrogen and water.|$|E
50|$|When the Mark 5 Jetta was introduced, the Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) {{diesel engine}} was not offered in five U.S. States {{due to the}} tight {{emission}} standards promulgated by the California Air Resources Board. In addition to California, four other states adopted the more stringent California standards. Where it was available, it fell into the least-restrictive emission category. That category was removed in 2007, prompting the diesel Jetta to be unavailable {{for more than a}} year until the introduction of a new common rail diesel engine, which appeared in August 2008. The introduction was delayed for approximately six months due to technical issues with the new emissions control system. The TDI Clean Diesel engine is rated , and uses advanced features such as a diesel particulate filter and NOx-storage catalyst (vs. <b>AdBlue)</b> to reduce NOx in order to qualify as a Tier II Bin 5 vehicle (equivalent to California's LEV II rating), and thereby allowing it to be sold in all 50 U.S. states. <b>AdBlue</b> (urea injection fluid) is not required, further reducing maintenance requirements.|$|E

5000|$|The engine {{features}} common rail fuel injection and a variable nozzle turbocharger. The injection system operates at , while the compression ratio is 18:1. [...] The {{engine features}} a counter-rotating balance shaft mounted between the cylinder banks {{to cancel the}} vibrations inherent to the 72 degree V6 design, and the crankpins are offset by 48 degrees to achieve even 120 degree firing intervals. In some heavy vehicle applications, Mercedes' BlueTec <b>AdBlue</b> urea injection is utilised for NOx reduction. In lighter vehicle applications, a NOx storage catalyst captures nitrous oxides, which are periodically purged (decomposed) by running the engine slightly rich. A particulate filter lowers soot, making this engine ULEV certified. [...] Engine mass is 208 kg. Power output is [...] and 510 Nm of torque. [...] For the 2007 model year, torque is raised to 540 Nm.|$|E
50|$|Reduction in NOx {{emissions}} from compression-ignition engines {{has previously been}} addressed {{by the addition of}} exhaust gas to incoming air charge, known as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). In 2010, most light-duty diesel manufacturers in the U.S. added catalytic systems to their vehicles to meet new federal emissions requirements. There are two techniques that have been developed for the catalytic reduction of NOx emissions under lean exhaust conditions: selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and the lean NOx trap or NOx adsorber. Instead of precious metal-containing NOx absorbers, most manufacturers selected base-metal SCR systems that use a reagent such as ammonia to reduce the NOx into nitrogen. Ammonia is supplied to the catalyst system by the injection of urea into the exhaust, which then undergoes thermal decomposition and hydrolysis into ammonia. One trademark product of urea solution, also referred to as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), is <b>AdBlue.</b>|$|E
50|$|Initially, the Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE had the Euro 4 engine as standard. At present, the ISBe5 Cummins engine or Cummins ISB6.7E5 250B or ISB6.7E5 285B {{can be used}} which meets Euro 5 (which is {{the same}} type, but with an {{additional}} filter) or EEV. The bus can also be fitted a CNG-powered engine. To reduce the rear axle load fuel tank with a capacity of 165 dm3 was placed behind the front door, and the <b>AdBlue</b> tank with a capacity of 40 dm3 was placed between the front wheel arches and the middle door. By using these solutions such as the central lubrication system and the self-diagnostic KFBS1 Kogel and the maintenance-free bearings in the drive and steering, this has reduced servicing time and cost. In 2011, the company debuted the first prototype Solaris Urbino electric LE 8.9 electric bus, which was created by a significant redesign of the Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to {{the high}} floor {{in the rear of}} the vehicle, the engine and gearbox are placed in the centre for the third axle. It works with the SCR {{technology}} using <b>AdBlue.</b> All axles are from ZF. Due to the use of larger wheel size 295/70 tires the bus has an extended wheel arch. Behind the front axle there is a storage possibly for snow chains. Two illuminated steps provide access {{to the high}}er floor level at the rear. All seats are located on the raised floor and are equipped with safety belts, while those located on the side of the stairs have additional armrests and handles. Above the seats in the low floor part of the bus there are shelves for luggage on the ceiling. The higher door has wheelchair access. Optionally, in place of the wheelchair bay the space can be transformed for four additional passenger seats. The ventilation of the interior of the bus has side windows and two electric sunroofs. Instead of tilting windows there can be installed an air conditioning system. There are several versions of the cab: open (open door), semi-closed (with glass door) and closed (fully built cabin). Doors used in Solaris Urbino 15 LE all open to the outside.|$|E
50|$|The Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE is {{extended}} {{by more than}} 30 cm from the low-floor variant Solaris Alpino. It has a longer wheelbase and longer rear overhang, which resulted {{in an increase in}} weight. Just like the base model it is structurally related to the third generation Solaris Urbino buses. It is equipped with Cummins ISBe4 250B engine (with a capacity of 6.7 dm3 and 250 HP in power) centrally mounted at the back and a Voith Diwa 854.5 automatic gearbox. Optionally the bus can be mounted with a 6-speed automatic ZF 6HP-504 gearbox. This engine meets the standard Euro 4 using SCR technology, which requires <b>AdBlue.</b> The front suspension can be installed independently or alternatively with the IFS Voith ZF RL 75 EC. At the rear, it has a standard RS ArvinMeritor axle 24 on double tires. The width was reduced by 15 cm when compared with the Solaris Urbino series, and the desire to preserve adequate headroom {{in the rear of the}} bus without unduly increasing the height of the whole bus resulted in the need for the rear tires to have a reduced size. To ensure a broad aisle, on the one side of the bus instead of double seats there are 1 + 1/2 type seats on the rear axle. The cab is fitted as standard with a dashboard designed by Solaris, there is an optional dashboard by Siemens VDO or Multibus Actia.|$|E
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{covering}} the modeling of the melting {{process in a}} tank filled with <b>AdBlue.</b> Due to <b>AdBlue</b> freezing at temperatures below - 11 degree {{there is a need}} to add heat to be able to secure dosing in all situations. A rig for simulating freezing conditions is created with the possibility to store <b>AdBlue</b> in temperatures down to - 40 degree. Temperatures are measured in and around the tank containing <b>AdBlue</b> and in the equipment used for adding heat. Two models are created from physical relations to estimate the mass of <b>AdBlue</b> melted, a static temperature model and a dynamic temperature model. The static model shows good results when calibrated at this specific setup and is very easy to use.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{influence}} urea concentration in the <b>AdBlue</b> fluid on the refractive index. The <b>AdBlue</b> fluid is an aqueous solution of urea and demineralized water. It {{is used as a}} reducing agent for SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system. Due to temperature fluctuation of <b>AdBlue</b> during the measurement of refractive index, the multi-dimensional linear regression had to be used to determine the effect of the two factors – concentration and temperature. This article describes in detail the individual steps of the regression model construction done using the so-called regression triplet. The task of this method was to create a regression model which describes the influence urea concentration and small changes in temperature on refractive index of <b>AdBlue</b> fluid. As the results of the multi-dimensional regression analysis show, the temperature factor is statistically insignificant because of small range of temperature fluctuation during measurement, and thus only the urea concentration in the fluid had the major effect on the refractive index...|$|E
