40|$|The {{function}} of the suppression-chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers is to relieve vacuum in the drywell. There are four vacuum breakers located outside the primary containment which form {{an extension of the}} primary containment boundary. The vacuum relief valves are mounted in special piping between the drywell and the suppression chamber, which allow air and steam flow from the suppression chamber to the drywell when the drywell is at a negative pressure with respect to the suppression chamber. Therefore, suppression chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers prevent an excessive negative differential pressure across the wetwell drywell boundary. Each vacuum breaker is a self <b>actuating</b> <b>valve</b> with one vacuum breaker in each line. Manual isolation valves are located on each side of each vacuum breaker. A negative differential pressure across the drywell wall is caused by rapid depressurization of the drywell. Events that cause this rapid depressurization are cooling cycles, inadvertent drywell spray actuation, and steam condensation from sprays or subcooled water reflood of a break {{in the event of a}} primary system rupture. Cooling cycles result in minor pressure transients in the drywell that occur slowly and are normally controlled by heating and ventilation equipment. Spray actuation or spill of subcooled water out of a break results in more significant pressure transients and becomes important in sizing the vacuum breakers. In the event of a primary system rupture, steam condensation within the drywell results in the most severe pressure transient. Following a primary system rupture, air in the drywell is purged into the suppression chamber free airspace, leaving the drywell full of steam. Subsequent condensation of the steam can be caused in two possible ways, namely, Emergency Core Cooling Systems flow from a recirculation line break, or drywell spray actuation following a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). These two cases determine the maximum depressurization rate of the drywell...|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} test results for {{two types of}} pulsed gas valves are presented. The valves, a piezo valve and a solenoid <b>actuated</b> <b>valve,</b> must have {{exceedingly}} long lifetime to support gas-fed pulsed electric thruster operation for missions of interest. The performance of both valves was tested, with both demonstrating the capability to throttle the gas flow rate while maintaining low leakage levels below 10 (exp - 3) sccs of He {{at the beginning of}} valve lifetime. The piezo valve varies the flow rate by changing the amount that the valve is open, which is a function of applied voltage. This valve demonstrated continuous throttlability from 0 - 10 mL/s, with opening and closing times of 100 microsecond or less. The solenoid <b>actuated</b> <b>valve</b> flow rate changes {{as a function of the}} inlet gas pressure, with demonstrated flow rates in these tests from 2. 7 - 11 mL per second. The valve response time is slower than the piezo valve, opening in 1 - 2 ms and closing in several ms. The solenoid <b>actuated</b> <b>valve</b> was tested to one million cycles, with the valve performance remaining relatively unchanged throughout the test. Galling of the sliding plunger caused the valve to bind and fail just after one million cycles, but at this point in the test the valve sealing surface leak rate still appeared to be well below the maximum target leak rake of 110 (exp - 3) sccs of He...|$|R
