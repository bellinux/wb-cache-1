25|$|Clouds {{initially}} form {{in clear}} air or become clouds when fog rises <b>above</b> <b>surface</b> level. The genus {{of a newly}} formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a mother cloud. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after {{the appearance of the}} new genus, it is termed a genitus cloud. One example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus, a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it {{is considered to be a}} mutatus cloud.|$|E
