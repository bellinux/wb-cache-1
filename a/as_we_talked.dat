60|$|We {{still were}} {{fighting}} furiously <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> in broken sentences, punctured with vicious cuts and thrusts at our swarming enemy.|$|E
60|$|I {{stood beside}} him on the river bank, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> the handle of my parasol touched the bottom button of his waistcoat.|$|E
6000|$|Talk <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> {{and they}} ere death-- [...] Flirt wanly, dance in ghostly-wise, [...] With ghosts of tunes for melodies, And vanish at the morning's breath.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' {{returned}} the other. 'Shall <b>we</b> walk <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk?</b> The damp falls rather heavily. Well,--as you please. But I grieve {{to say that}} I can spare you only a very few moments.' ...|$|R
60|$|Helen, {{engaged with}} Mr. Dalloway and the habit, now fallen into decline, of quoting Greek in the House of Commons, noted, {{in the great}} commonplace book that lies open beside us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk,</b> {{the fact that all}} men, even men like Ridley, really prefer women to be fashionable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{core process}} {{assumptions}} of attitude construction models are mainstays of social cognition {{research and are}} not controversial—as long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about [...] "judgment". Once the particular judgment made {{can be thought of}} as a person's [...] "attitude", however, construal assumptions elicit discomfort, presumably because they dispense with the intuitively appealing attitude concept.|$|R
6000|$|My boy {{beside me}} tripped, so slim [...] 25 [...] And graceful in his rustic dress! [...] And, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> I {{questioned}} him, [7] [...] In very idleness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I shall die when I {{find myself}} {{up on that}} platform, facing people," [...] sighed Sara Ray, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> the affair over in Uncle Stephen's Walk {{the night before the}} concert.|$|E
60|$|But {{that is by}} the way in {{the present}} discussion. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> the {{prospect}} broadened out from a prospect of the growing and distribution of food to a general view of the world becoming one economic community.|$|E
60|$|Wild. Do you {{see their}} father? Let us make <b>as</b> though <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> to one another, {{that we may}} not be suspected.|$|R
40|$|This {{hands-on}} session {{provides a}} quick introduction to eBooks and the ePUB format, including creating, editing and publishing. Participants will {{learn how to}} use free/open source cross-platform tools to develop their own ePUBs as well as to convert them to other formats, such as PDF or Amazon Kindle. We will discuss various aspects of eBook creation, such as copyright, distribution, and access, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about ways that your library can support this latest trend in scholarly communication...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one would}} be so welcome, Guy. If we are never to be {{brothers}}-in-arms <b>as</b> <b>we</b> once <b>talked</b> of, <b>we</b> shall surely be brothers in heart, whether absent or present." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> we {{had been}} {{approaching}} {{the entrance to the}} cave, and as we crossed the threshold I ceased to wonder that the ancient green enemies of the yellow men had been halted by the horrors of that awful way.|$|E
60|$|We had walked, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> and now {{we passed}} through the little gate into the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under the sycamore-tree, {{as it had been}} on the day of my arrival.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said my sentimental friend Gregoire, [...] "for {{the matter}} of that, I can answer that the lad was always talking about this young woman: {{he told me the}} whole story himself, and many a good laugh I had with citizen Schneider <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seems very}} much as you {{described}} him," [...] Marcia answered. [...] "To tell you the truth, his sudden appearance just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were <b>talking</b> about him rather took my breath away." ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{increasingly}} competitive job market, being good at your job isn 2 ̆ 7 t good enough. Potential employees {{must be able}} to do the job and have excellent interpersonal skills, enthusiasm, compassion, and ambition. Communicating these traits in a CV or resume is difficult at best. Prospective employers and colleagues will search for you online in an attempt to discover these traits; what will they find? Come join us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about defining and managing your online identity in order to create and maintain a solid and professional reputation...|$|R
3000|$|Yeah. But {{your feeling}} toward them about judging you is hostility. Now you get anxious <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about this. [Kurt: Yeah] So {{how do you}} feel the hostility {{underneath}} the anxiety, because it’s like that anxiety is trying to sit on top of that hostility right now [Clarifying the link between anxiety and hostility (anger) and the effect of anxiety] [Kurt: Mmmm]… and block it and push it down and not let you have this feeling of hostility in your body. But if you push that anxiety out of the way, {{how do you feel}} the hostility toward them? [...]...|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> I {{had been}} searching the {{interior}} of the chamber with my eyes. It was, perhaps, two hundred feet in length and half as broad, with {{what appeared to be a}} doorway in the centre of the wall directly opposite that through which we had entered.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> Snider joined us, and I {{returned}} his rifle to him. Taylor and Delcarte {{picked up the}} slain deer, and we all started down toward the launch, walking slowly. Delcarte wanted to fetch the tiger's skin, but I had to deny him permission, since we had no means to properly cure it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, it isn't much. Joe {{came and}} sat by me, and, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> over our adventure, he cut that true lover's knot between the letters. I didn't seem to mind, and spun away till {{he pointed to}} it, saying, with the look that always made me meek as a lamb, 'May it stand so, my little Betsey?' ...|$|E
50|$|Another very {{interesting}} {{point on the}} debate {{of whether or not}} it is ethical and moral to engineer the human germline is a perspective of looking at past technologies and how they have evolved. Dr. Gregory Stock discusses the use of several diagnostic tests used to monitor current pregnancies and several diagnostic tests that can be done to determine the health of embryos. Such tests include amniocentesis, ultrasounds, and other preimplantation genetic diagnostic tests. These tests are quite common, and reliable, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about them today; however, in the past when they were first introduced, they too were scrutinized.|$|R
40|$|AbstractReuse and the {{composition}} of libraries of partial system descriptions is a fundamental and well-understood practice in software engineering, <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about source code. For models and modeling languages, the concepts of reuse often are limited to copy & paste, {{especially when it comes}} to domain-specific modeling languages (DSLs). This paper attempts to give an overview of techniques for including support for reuse and library concepts both in the meta-model and the modeling tool, and presents a novel generative approach for this task. The technical consequences for each of the approaches presented are discussed and compared to each other...|$|R
5000|$|It takes...a mind debauched by {{learning}} {{to carry the}} process of making the natural seem strange, so far as to ask for the why of any instinctive human act. To the metaphysician alone can such questions occur as: Why do we smile, when pleased, and not scowl? Why are <b>we</b> unable to <b>talk</b> to a crowd <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> to a single friend? Why does a particular maiden turn our wits so upside-down? The common man can only say, Of course we smile, of course our heart palpitates {{at the sight of the}} crowd, of course we love the maiden, that beautiful soul clad in that perfect form, so palpably and flagrantly made for all eternity to be loved! ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> I {{found that}} they, at least, had {{kept in touch}} with the thought of the east, and Ella {{understood}} in some degree the dark mood which I voiced. She, too, occasionally doubted whether the life they were all living was worth while. [...] "We make the best of it," [...] she said, [...] "but none of us are living up to our dreams." ...|$|E
6000|$|He shuffled off his outer {{slippers}} {{before he}} {{curled up on}} the divan beside me. He clapped his hands, and languidly called [...] "Mustapha." [...] Mustapha came with more lights, pipes, and coffee; and then we fell to talking about London, and I gave him the last news of the comrades in that dear city. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> his Oriental coolness and languor gave way to British cordiality; he was the most amusing companion of the club once more.|$|E
60|$|I noticed <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> {{over his}} condition, that Maud’s sympathy {{went out to}} him more and more; yet I could not but love her for it, so sweetly womanly was it. Besides, there was no false {{sentiment}} about her feeling. She was agreed that the most rigorous treatment was necessary {{if we were to}} escape, though she recoiled at the suggestion that I might some time be compelled to take his life to save my own—“our own,” she put it.|$|E
6000|$|Consider that {{everything}} I am writing of {{took place in}} an almost pre-historic era {{in the history of}} British India. Some folk may remember the years before lawn-tennis was born when we all played croquet. There were seasons before that, if you will believe me, when even croquet had not been invented, and archery--which was revived in England in 1844--was as great a pest as lawn-tennis is now. People talked learnedly about [...] "holding" [...] and [...] "loosing," [...] "steles," [...] "reflexed bows," [...] "56-pound bows," [...] "backed" [...] or [...] "self-yew bows," [...] <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about [...] "rallies," [...] "volleys," [...] "smashes," [...] "returns," [...] and [...] "16-ounce rackets." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charlie {{shook his}} ’ead. [...] "That wouldn’t do," [...] he ses; [...] "besides, I don’t {{know where they}} keep it. No; I’ve got a better plan than that. Come round to the Crooked Billet, so <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can <b>talk</b> it over in peace and quiet." ...|$|R
60|$|Even <b>as</b> <b>we</b> sat <b>talking</b> in subdued tones, {{the noise}} of a distant commotion arose. We had scarce started to our feet, Mr. Chase and I, when the brass knocker resounded, and Mr. Hammond was let in. His wig was awry, {{and his face was}} flushed.|$|R
6000|$|What peace {{there was}} sitting once again under the {{rustling}} {{trees on the}} lawn with the green river and the blue bay spread out before us, and Scipio standing by with my grandfather's punch. Mr. Carvel would have me rehearse again all that had passed in town and colony since his illness, which I did with as much moderation as I was able. And <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> {{he reached out and}} took my hand, for I sat near him, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{sat with}} Mr. Swain many an hour that spring, with Patty sewing {{at the window}} open to the garden. Often, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> unnoticed by her father she would drop her work and the tears glisten in her eyes. For the barrister's voice was {{not as strong as}} it once was, and the cold would not seem to lift from his chest. So this able man, who might have sat in the seats of Maryland's high reward, was {{stricken}} when he was needed most.|$|E
60|$|Those hoardings! They {{were the}} {{brightest}} colored things {{in all that}} vanished world. Upon them, in successive layers of paste and paper, all the rough enterprises of that time joined in chromatic discord; pill vendors and preachers, theaters and charities, marvelous soaps and astonishing pickles, typewriting machines and sewing machines, mingled {{in a sort of}} visualized clamor. And passing that there was a muddy lane of cinders, a lane without a light, that used its many puddles to borrow a star or so from the sky. We splashed along unheeding <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked.</b>|$|E

60|$|And it {{does not}} mean that. I suppose, that three hundred years ago (when the Bible was {{translated}} out of the Greek tongue, in which the Apostles wrote, into English), 'taking thought' meant something different from what it does now: but the plain meaning of the text, if it be put into such English <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> now, is, 'Do not fret about the morrow. Be not anxious about the morrow.' There is no doubt at all, as any scholar can tell you, that that is the plain meaning of the word in our modern English, and that our Lord is not telling us to be imprudent or idle, but not to be anxious and fretful about the morrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked you}} when it was you last saw him--previous, I mean, to his second descent at Venice. You wouldn't say, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were <b>talking</b> of a matter {{comparatively}} more important I let it pass. But the fact remains, you know, my dear, that you haven't told me." ...|$|R
