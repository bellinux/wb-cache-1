5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic {{to be a good}} conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> great musical ability.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's grandfather, Emil Alajääski (born 1881), {{changed his}} name to Vainio soon {{after the turn of the}} century. Vainio's family on his father's side boasted many athletes whilst Kaarina Vainio had some {{athletic}} background. After becoming engaged to Kaarina in 1937, Tauno Vainio worked in Vuoksenniska as a regional head of the White Guard, and was known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> principle. Kaarina Vainio had a middle school education, and Tauno Vainio had graduated as a trade technician.|$|E
50|$|What {{is surely}} known, is {{the text of}} his funeral epitaph, {{transmitted}} us by Goffredo da Bussero (13th century), which describes Magnus <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>men</b> <b>of</b> great charity who helped the prisoners of war.|$|R

5|$|Dušan was {{succeeded by}} his 19-year-old son Uroš, who {{apparently}} regarded Marko Mrnjavčević <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> trust. The new Emperor appointed him {{the head of}} the embassy he sent to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia) at the end of July 1361 to negotiate peace between the empire and the Ragusan Republic after hostilities earlier that year. Although peace was not reached, Marko successfully negotiated the release of Serbian merchants from Prizren who were detained by the Ragusans and was permitted to withdraw silver deposited in the city by his family. The account of that embassy in a Ragusan document contains the earliest-known, undisputed reference to Marko Mrnjavčević. An inscription written in 1356 on a wall of a church in the Macedonian region of Tikveš, mentions a Nikola and a Marko as governors in that region, but the identity of this Marko is disputed.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} to me <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> energy and enthusiasm, {{but he seemed}} shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Morris aided the DF {{using his}} artistic and {{literary}} talents; he designed the group's membership card, and helped author their manifesto, Socialism Made Plain, {{in which they}} demanded improved housing for workers, free compulsory education for all children, free school meals, an eight-hour working day, the abolition of national debt, nationalisation of land, banks, and railways, and the organisation of agriculture and industry under state control and co-operative principles. Some of his DF comrades {{found it difficult to}} reconcile his socialist values with his position as proprietor of the Firm, although he was widely admired <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> integrity. The DF began publishing a weekly newspaper, Justice, which soon faced financial losses that Morris covered. Morris also regularly contributed articles to the newspaper, in doing so befriending another contributor, George Bernard Shaw.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish Crown {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} with public health. Diseases had always troubled the colonies, and town councils spent money to bring physicians or sanitary equipment {{from other parts}} of the Americas. Reports by doctors about the sanitary and hygienic conditions of various neighborhoods of the cities were frequent. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> science, Eugenio Espejo demonstrated his knowledge of the latest scientific advances in Europe and the Americas. Most of the arguments and recommendations he made in his medical works can be found in contemporary sources, such as the Mémoires of the French Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|The {{peaceful}} town of Duisburg, untroubled {{by political}} and religious unrest, was the perfect place for the flowering of his talent. Mercator quickly established himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. There, he also gave a globe to John Dee. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and {{a close friend of}} Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.|$|E
5|$|Serbian epic poetry {{agrees that}} King Vukašin was Marko's father. His {{mother in the}} poems was Jevrosima, sister of voivode Momčilo, {{the lord of the}} Pirlitor Fortress (on Mount Durmitor in Old Herzegovina). Momčilo is {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> immense size and strength with magical attributes: a winged horse and a sabre with eyes. Vukašin murdered him {{with the help of the}} voivode's young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, Skadar, and married her according to the advice of the dying Momčilo. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo. This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary Momchil, who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 Battle of Peritheorion. According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a vila (Slavic mountain nymph) married by Vukašin after he caught her near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.|$|E

5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E
5|$|To {{understand}} why the Chinese made such reports, Waley explained that any military action, whether successful or not, {{was followed by a}} scramble to get mentioned in the official report to the throne as an incentive for receiving a decoration, promotion, or other reward. The number of alleged casualties inflicted on the enemy was often based on what officers thought would entitle them to the reward they had in mind. Although Lin forwarded Lai's concocted reports to the Daoguang Emperor, Waley noted that it is unclear to what extent, if any, that Lin was aware of the fabrications, especially since he was regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> unusually high integrity by the British and Chinese. This was {{the first in a series}} of reports in which the emperor became aware in 1841 that the Canton authorities had been systematically deceiving him about events during the war. The emperor ordered the Governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-chü, to send him clear accounts of the events at Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by secret inquiries from other places.|$|E
5|$|Varro, {{in command}} {{on the first}} day, is {{presented}} by contemporary sources <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> reckless nature and hubris, who was determined to defeat Hannibal. While the Romans were approaching Cannae, {{a small portion of}} Hannibal's forces ambushed them. Varro repelled the attack and continued on his way to Cannae. This victory, though essentially a mere skirmish with no lasting strategic value, greatly bolstered the confidence of the Roman army, perhaps leading to overconfidence on Varro's part. Paullus, however, was opposed to the engagement as it was taking shape. Unlike Varro, he was prudent and cautious, and he believed it was foolish to fight on open ground, despite the Romans' numerical strength. This was especially true since Hannibal held the advantage in cavalry (both in quality and quantity). Despite these misgivings, Paullus thought it unwise to withdraw the army after the initial success, and camped two-thirds of the army east of the Aufidus River, sending the remainder to fortify a position on the opposite side. The purpose of this second camp was to cover the foraging parties from the main camp and harass those of the enemy.|$|E

25|$|The affair {{inspired}} Sir Herbert Croft's epistolary novel Love and Madness (1780), {{an imagined}} correspondence between Hackman and Martha Ray. In this, Hackman is dealt with sympathetically.
