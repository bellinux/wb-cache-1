40|$|Although {{humans are}} almost {{constantly}} exposed to stimuli from multiple sensory modalities during daily life, the {{processes by which}} we learn to integrate information from multiple senses to acquire knowledge of multisensory objects are not well understood. Here, we present results of a novel <b>audio</b> – <b>visual</b> statistical learning procedure where participants are passively exposed to a rapid serial presentation of arbitrary <b>audio</b> – <b>visual</b> pairings (comprised of artificial/synthetic <b>audio</b> and <b>visual</b> stimuli). Following this exposure, participants were tested with a two-interval forced-choice procedure in which their degree of familiarity with the experienced <b>audio</b> – <b>visual</b> pairings was evaluated against novel <b>audio</b> – <b>visual</b> combinations drawn from the same stimulus set. Our results show that subjects acquire knowledge of <b>visual</b> – <b>visual,</b> <b>audio</b> – audio, and <b>audio</b> – <b>visual</b> stimulus associations and that the learning {{of these types of}} associations occurs in an independent manner...|$|R

25|$|<b>Audio</b> <b>visual</b> (AV) rental {{systems have}} to be able to {{withstand}} heavy use, and even abuse from renters.

As well, rental companies tend to select gear which has electronic protection features, such as speaker-protection circuitry and amplifier limiters.|$|E

25|$|Superior {{temporal}} cortex (STG/STS/PT) <b>Audio</b> <b>visual</b> cross modal {{interactions are}} known {{to occur in the}} auditory association cortex which lies directly inferior to the Sylvian fissure in the temporal lobe. Plasticity was observed in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) by Petitto et al. (2000). Here, {{it was found that the}} STG was more active during stimulation in native deaf signers compared to hearing non signers. Concurrently, further research has revealed differences in the activation of the Planum temporale (PT) in response to non linguistic lip movements between the hearing and deaf; as well as progressively increasing activation of the auditory association cortex as previously deaf participants gain hearing experience via a cochlear implant.|$|E
