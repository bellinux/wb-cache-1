5|$|The MAUD {{reports were}} {{reviewed}} by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish its first. The report ultimately stated {{that if there were}} even <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

25|$|The county's {{boundary}} forms <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of {{land at the}} far northern tip of {{the county}} that is several miles long and averages less than 200 yards wide.

These jurisdictions and Carroll County meet at a single point at Parr's Spring on Parr's Ridge.|$|E
25|$|The 1923 {{boundary}} between British Mandatory Palestine and the French Mandate of Syria was drawn with water in mind. Accordingly, it was demarcated {{so that all}} of the Sea of Galilee, including a 10-meter wide strip of beach along its northeastern shore, would stay inside Mandatory Palestine. From the Sea of Galilee north to Lake Hula the boundary was drawn between 50 and 400 meters east of the upper Jordan River, keeping that stream entirely within Mandatory Palestine. The British also received <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of land along the Yarmouk River, out to the present-day Hamat Gader.|$|E

Using a gas mask-based setup similar to the one used by Nemesis, Question impersonates Steve Trevor and frees Superman, while presenting a lead towards who caused Superman to kill Doctor Light. The lead {{turns out to be a}} dead end, but it places Question in with the various Justice League factions when Pandora attempts to seek their help to open the skull-shaped box that various forces are coveting.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{effectively}} Alsace-Lorraine was annexed: German law {{applied to}} the region, its inhabitants were conscripted into the Wehrmacht and pointedly the customs posts separating France from Germany were placed back {{where they had been}} between 1871-1918. Similarly, <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of French territory in the Alps was under direct Italian administration from June 1940 to September 1943. Throughout the rest of the country, civil servants were under the formal authority of French ministers in Vichy. René Bousquet, the head of French police nominated by Vichy, exercised his power in Paris through his second-in-command, Jean Leguay, who coordinated raids with the Nazis. German laws, however, took precedence over French ones in the occupied territories, and the Germans often rode roughshod over the sensibilities of Vichy administrators.|$|E
25|$|The Warsaw Treaty, an {{agreement}} with the exiled Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlura signed on 21 April 1920, was the main Polish diplomatic success. Petlura, who formally represented the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic (by then de facto defeated by Bolsheviks), along with some Ukrainian forces, fled to Poland, where he found asylum. His control extended only to <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of land near the Polish border. In such conditions, there was little difficulty convincing Petlura to join an alliance with Poland, despite recent conflict between the two nations that had been settled in favour of Poland. By concluding {{an agreement}} with Piłsudski, Petlura accepted the Polish territorial gains in Western Ukraine and the future Polish–Ukrainian border along the Zbruch River. In exchange, he was promised independence for Ukraine and Polish military assistance in reinstalling his government in Kiev.|$|E

25|$|Both states filed {{bills of}} equity with the Supreme Court in 1852, and after more {{surveying}} and negotiation, a decree was issued on December 16, 1861. On March 1, 1862, when the Supreme Court ruling became effective, {{the western part}} of Old Seekonk (all of which was on the eastern shore of the Blackstone River) was ceded by Massachusetts and incorporated as East Providence, Rhode Island. Part of North Providence, Rhode Island was also combined with the former Pawtucket, Massachusetts and <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of Seekonk to form the modern Pawtucket, Rhode Island. A small amount of land was also added to Westport, Massachusetts. The southern boundary of Fall River, Massachusetts was moved from Columbia Street to State Avenue, expanding its territory. The Supreme Court made these adjustments not in conformance with King George's instructions, but to unify the thickly settled areas of Pawtucket and Fall River under the jurisdiction of a single state.|$|E
25|$|MD 27 {{starts out}} of Damascus as a four-lane {{undivided}} highway but quickly drops to two lanes. At {{the north end}} of the unincorporated town, the state highway meets the northern end of county-maintained Woodfield Road. MD 27 meets the eastern end of MD 80 (Kemptown Road) in the hamlet of Claggettsville. The highway crosses the Patuxent River just south of its source and passes through the western edge of Howard County. Between a pair of intersections with Penn Shop Road, MD 27 crosses <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of Montgomery County before entering Frederick County and expanding to a four-lane divided highway. The highway meets the west end of the Mount AiryEllicott City segment of MD 144 (Old National Pike). The intersection is just west of Parrs Spring, the source of the South Branch of the Patapsco River. Parrs Spring contains the quadripoint where the boundaries of Montgomery, Howard, Frederick, and Carroll counties meet.|$|E

500|$|Sue's {{campaign}} {{for congress in}} the third season has not heretofore found much favor with reviewers, though Futterman felt that the addition of Burt Hummel as a rival candidate [...] "gives us <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of hope, mainly because Mike O'Malley has managed to do no wrong thus far" [...] as Burt, and VanDerWerff, while otherwise unimpressed, said he liked [...] "the idea of the show pitting its most purely heroic figure against its most purely villainous". Bell {{was pleased with the}} new development, and noted that in three seasons, [...] "no character has grown more than Burt". Canning said he loved having Burt as Sue's nemesis, and Kubicek wrote that the two are [...] "awesome together".|$|E
500|$|M-134 {{starts at}} the {{interchange}} for exit359 along I-75 north of St. Ignace in rural Mackinac County near the St. Martin Bay of Lake Huron. As the highway runs eastward, it carries the Lake Huron Circle Tour over the Pine River on Huron Shore Drive. The trunkline turns to the southeast and follows the shoreline along the bay and runs inland at the bases of the peninsulas that form the Search Bay. Returning to a shoreline routing at Mismer Bay, M-134 runs through the wooded rural areas into Hessel. There Huron Shore Drive continues eastward to Cedarville where the highway meets {{the south end of}} M-129 north of Marquette Island. Farther east, M-134 runs along {{the north side of the}} many small bays and channels that separate the Les Cheneaux Islands from the mainland. About [...] west of Cedarville, M-134 crosses into Chippewa County for about a mile and a half (2.5km); the highway passes back into <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of Mackinac County that extends along the Lake Huron shoreline for another [...] before finally crossing back into Chippewa County.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars. Reviewer Jim DeRogatis praised the album as [...] "one of the rare epic rock {{releases}} whose bulk is justified in the grooves". The writer stated that the album's main flaw was Corgan's lyrics, describing the songwriter as [...] "wallowing in his own misery and grousing about everyone and everything not meeting his expectations." [...] DeRogatis contended that while Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness [...] "may even match The Wall in its sonic accomplishments", Corgan's lyrics lacked in comparison. Mojo reviewer Ben Edmunds also praised the music while criticizing Corgan's lyrics. Edmunds wrote, [...] " [...] lyrics {{appear to be the}} repository for the worst aspects of his most treasured influences. He writes with a heavy metal aptitude for wordplay and an inflated prog-rock conviction of its worth, a deadening combination. But there's <b>a</b> <b>sliver</b> of distance in his rage-mongering now that comments as well as expresses." [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau picked out one song from the album, [...] "1979", as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
