40|$|The {{history of}} food {{provision}} {{at the summer}} Olympic Games (OG) {{over the past century}} (1896 – 2008) provides insight into the evolution of sports nutrition research and the dietary strategies of athletes. Early research favoring protein as the main fuel for exercise was reflected in OG menus from 1932 to 1968. Despite conclusive research from the 1960 s demonstrating the clear benefit of carbohydrate on exercise performance, a specific emphasis on carbohydrate-rich foods was not noted until the 1970 s. Athlete food preferences and catering complexity evolved rapidly between 1970 and 2000, driven predominantly by a dramatic expansion of the OG and the emergence of systematic sports nutrition research. Nutritional <b>advice</b> <b>by</b> <b>experts</b> and sponsorship by food companies became increasingly important beginning with the 1984 Los Angeles OG. More recent developments include nutritional labeling of menu items and provision of a nutrition information desk (Barcelona 1992), demand for a “high-starch, low-fat menu” (Atlanta 1996), the addition of a dedicated menu website and the systematic gathering of information on athletes' apparent consumption (Sydney 2000), and appointment of the first international dietetic review committee (Beijing 2008). The history of catering at the OG tracks the evolution of sports nutrition practice from anecdotes and myth towards an established specialty in nutrition and dietetics grounded in evidence-based science...|$|E

Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Missouri-Columbia 2008. Includes bibliographical references. Vita. A total of 241 messages posted in 2007 by mothers of 0 - to 2 -year-olds on two U. S. and two Japanese parenting magazine websites were content analyzed. All messages pertained to one or more of six domains of childrearing: feeding/eating, toilet-training, sleep, development, discipline, and mother-child relationships. Every issue of the four U. S. and four Japanese best selling parenting magazines published in the years 2005 and 2006 were also content analyzed to examine advice given to parents in the six domains. The results suggested that mothers' childrearing concerns and the <b>advice</b> <b>by</b> <b>experts</b> in the two countries were similar in some areas but differed markedly in others, such as within the sleep domain. The similarities suggest some globalization of childrearing practices in that both countries are importing advice from other cultures. In particular, I found that in Japan, the promotion of autonomy is infused with Japanese traditional parenting ideologies and social circumstances...|$|E
40|$|In India, 30 % to 40 % {{babies are}} {{low birth weight}} babies (LBW) as opposed to about 5 % to 7 % of newborn in the west. In India, 7 to 10 million LBW infants are born annually. About 10 % to 12 % of Indian babies are born preterm (less than 37 {{completed}} weeks) as compared with 5 % to 7 % incidence in the west. These infants are physically immature and therefore their neonatal mortality is high. It is possible to increase {{the survival of the}} infants and quality of human life through prompt and adequate disease management of the newborn. The proposed model of cost effective major infant disease management system based on artificial intelligence algorithm is helpful for diagnostic- cum- preventive approach to reduce the immaturity, fragility, vulnerability and dependence of the neonates in the developing countries to reduce neonatal and child mortality. Secondly, a significant proportion of the pediatricians‟ time, especially in major hospitals, large cities and overpopulated areas is spent on examination and evaluation of apparently healthy babies and detection of minor developmental defects. In addition to these facts, many third world countries including countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh face the major problem of child health diagnosis and malnutrition. Medical facilities and expertise is either absent or out of reach of these tribal and poor communities, many public health centers (PHCs) lack in <b>advice</b> <b>by</b> <b>experts</b> on immediate basis in case of emergencies.

40|$|Last December, Paris was {{the host}} {{city for the}} 21 st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Representatives of 195 {{countries}} met to dispute a legally binding climate agreement – a highly complex process involving thousands of politicians, scientists and activists, that to date has taken over two decades. The director ensemble “Rimini Protokoll” re-enacted this mammoth-scale drama of diplomacy in the play “Weltklimakonferenz” (World Climate Conference) at the “Deutsches Schauspielhaus” theatre in Hamburg, Germany. Since the opening night (21 st Nov. 2014), the play has been performed 16 times, reaching an audience of over 9000. All performers in the play were experts and scientists {{at different stages of}} their careers, including PhD students, journalists and professors. Each spectator took on the identity of a delegate of one of the 195 participating countries. We will present the project and the performance, thereby highlighting the role of and the interaction between the spectators and early career scientists. In a nutshell the play went as follows ([URL] after an opening ceremony, the audience was divided up into seven groups, each of which was given <b>advice</b> <b>by</b> <b>experts</b> in several different briefings. These informed on country-specific challenges caused by the social and economic situation, possible future climatic changes and negotiating tactics. In addition, the delegations had bilateral meetings, enabling them to exchange views and experiences with one another. Towards {{the end of the play}} each delegation was asked to submit a national commitment to greenhouse gas reduction and a financial contribution to the Green Climate Fund. Based on these national commitments, the final plenum revealed whether or not the delegations had managed to submit reductions compatible with restricting global warming to 2 °C compared to pre-industrial times. Due to their direct personal involvement in the play, each spectator was confronted with the full complexity and challenge of a climate change conference: Revealing the "culprit" - in other words the causes of climate change – is all about facts. In contrast, when developing options for action, the matter at hand is ultimately values. Which risks should the world community take on? What cost is it prepared to accept to protect the population in areas menaced by droughts or floods? These are all decisions based on political, economic, and indeed ethical issues. Based on feedback from spectators both during and after the performance, we will discuss to what extent the performance managed to convey the complexity of the question at hand and to what extent the spectators actually took on the role of their given country. The spectators were not the only ones to be put out of their comfort zone during the performance. Also the experts had to, in cooperation with the directors, think carefully on how to find the right balance between scientific integrity and a captivating dramaturgy, ultimately leading to a performance that would be informative, thought-provoking, as well as enjoyable...|$|E

40|$|We all do it: we all {{communicate}} about {{space and}} we do it with ease {{as one of our}} most basic natural abilities. Even animals do it- for example, bees as they dance to communicate distance, direction and the quality of a food source. Humans utilize a variety of senses and channels for communicating about space, among them the use of spoken and written language, gestures, sketches, or the gentle physical force when taking a person by the arm or leading in a dance. In addition, we have learned to interpret the language of experts communicating about space – such as in maps (cartography), posted signs (semiotics) or the affordance of designed spaces (architecture). Which brings us to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) – advanced tools to analyze complex spatial and dynamic interrelations, and to display them in forms such as maps, graphs, tables and reports.

40|$|Abstract—In the literature, we {{find that}} the {{consensus}} models proposed for group decision making problems are guided by consensus degrees and/or similarity measures and/or consistency measures [1]. When we work in heterogeneous group decision making frameworks, we have im-portance degrees associated with the <b>experts</b> <b>by</b> expressing their different knowledge levels on the problem. Usually, the importance degrees are applied in the weighted aggregation operators developed to solve the decision situations. In this paper, we study another application possibility, i. e., to use heterogeneity existing among experts to guide the consensus model. Thus, the main goal {{of this paper is to}} present a new consensus model for heterogeneous group decision making problems guided also by the heterogeneity criterion. It is also based on consensus degrees and similarity measures, but it presents a new feedback mechanism that adjusts the amount of <b>advice</b> required <b>by</b> each <b>expert</b> depending on his/her own relevance or importance level.

Yet despite this great interest and intensive hype, perhaps not as many new solutions have been implemented as might have been expected. The over 1, 200 Nordic municipalities have faced challenges in transforming interest and projects into implemented solutions and innovative new everyday lives for staff and citizens. This publication, and the CONNECT project overall, addresses {{some of the problems}} faced by the Nordic municipalities in their work with welfare technology: How can we capitalise more on our projects? How do we ensure that the knowledge we gather is integrated in the municipal organisation? How can we become better at sharing our knowledge and experience, rather than thinking that we each need to reinvent the wheel? How can we strengthen the joint Nordic market for welfare technology? How do we ensure that staff see technology as a co-player? The issues to be tackled are numerous and complicated. CONNECT gathers these threads to create the first complete Nordic toolbox for how municipalities can work with welfare technology on the best possible basis.

40|$|Purpose: This thesis explores how web {{startups}} {{operating in}} a crowded, fast-moving and highly competitive marketplace can gain competitive advantage through building dynamic capabilities and what these capabilities consist of. Design/methodology/approach: Firstly, insight was obtained through reviewing key themes within classic resource based theory and entrepreneurship theory. Newer empirical research on entrepreneurial success factors, as well as popular science and <b>advice</b> given <b>by</b> <b>expert</b> web entrepreneurs was then reviewed. Combining this, a framework of dynamic capabilities in web startups was synthesized. Qualitative empirical data was collected from interviewing founders and key people in four active Norwegian web startups. From the empirical findings in these interviews, the synthesized framework was iterated to account for important factors that were found to apply specifically for web startups. Lastly, a set of propositions {{was derived from the}} combination of the synthesized framework and the empirical findings. Findings: It was found that many of the contributions both from established contributors, newer contributors and popular science build on the same principles, albeit with a different degree of practical versus theoretical approach. By bridging different literature and approaches, this thesis contributes to clarify many of the &# 147;invented&# 148; terms found in the literature and operationalize them in practice for what they actually mean for web startups, and much of this is probably applicable for startups in general. From the empirical data it was found that web startups have important differences from other types of companies and startups. This was e. g. planning on very short time spans (most planned on a weekly basis or shorter), the ability of employees to do work outside of their expertise areas and the ability to learn or acquire new skills fast according to continuously changing market needs. Research limitations/implications: The propositions have both empirical and theoretical backing, but the empirical backing is limited to four cases, all in Norway. It would be useful to test the propositions on larger sample sizes, and preferably also to include cases from other contexts and cultures than Norway. Practical implications: Entrepreneurs in web startups should focus on building a great team and company culture. Policy makers should consider introducing programmin...|$|R

40|$|Rule-based {{diagnostic}} {{expert systems}} {{can be used to}} perform many of the diagnostic chores necessary in today's complex space systems. These expert systems typically take a set of symptoms as input and produce diagnostic advice as output. The primary objective of such expert systems is to provide accurate and comprehensive advice which can be used to help return the space system in question to nominal operation. The development and maintenance of diagnostic expert systems is time and labor intensive since the services of both knowledge engineer(s) and domain expert(s) are required. The use of adaptive learning mechanisms to increment evaluate and refine rules promises to reduce both time and labor costs associated with such systems. This paper describes the basic adaptive learning mechanisms of strengthening, weakening, generalization, discrimination, and discovery. Next basic strategies are discussed for adding these learning mechanisms to rule-based diagnostic expert systems. These strategies support the incremental evaluation and refinement of rules in the knowledge base by comparing the set of <b>advice</b> given <b>by</b> the <b>expert</b> system (A) with the correct diagnosis (C). Techniques are described for selecting those rules in the in the knowledge base which should participate in adaptive learning.

Exploring Novel Forms of Scientific Advice in Political Decision-Making; Dordrecht: Springer, S. 21 - 40 At the {{beginning}} of 2002 the German parliament took a decision on the permissibility of embryonic research. The compromise reached had neither the compelling logic of the liberal position nor the moral consistency of the opponents of research involving the destruction of human embryos: it allows research on imported embryonic stem cells which originated before January 2002. The decision was preceded by a public discussion in talk shows and newspapers where, {{for a long period}} before the funda- mental political decision, the most important arguments and positions {{on the question of the}} ethical legitimacy of stem cell research were debated. At the end of November 2001 the recommendations of the ethics councils were made available. The Natio- naler Ethikrat (National Ethics Council) and the Enquete-Kommission ‘Recht und Ethik in der modernen Medizin’ (Study Commission on Law and Ethics in Modern Medicine) expressed the anticipated dissent in the commissions by formulating diver- gent positions and documenting them in separate votes. A similar situation occurred a little later in Austria. At about the same time as the German National Ethics Council was being established, the Austrian chancellor convened a bioethics commission which drew up a statement on stem cell research. As in the German case, competing positions were expressed and documented. On the basis of this example of ‘ethical assistance’ to political decision-makers, we discuss in this chapter the following questions: Can one identify a social meaning of the <b>advice</b> provided <b>by</b> <b>expert</b> commissions under conditions of the absence of clarity? Or, more generally: What does the “new institutionalisation of morality” (Kuhlmann 2002) mean for the relationship between expertise and politics? And what follows from the disagreement of the commissions’ experts for the legitimation of political decision-making? Our chapter, dealing with this „new complexity in the relationship between sci- ence and politics“ (Weingart 2001 a: 80), is structured in two sections. In the first section, against the background of the sociological tradition, we critically address the basic assumptions of the theory of reflexive modernisation concerning the role of expert knowledge in the face of new risks. In the second section we outline, in the form of a series of theses, some findings of our qualitative interviews with members of the Austrian Bioethics Commission...|$|R
