2500|$|Opt-out consent, {{otherwise}} known as [...] "deemed" [...] consent, support refers {{to the notion that}} the majority of people support organ donation, but {{only a small percentage of}} the population are actually registered, because they fail to go through the <b>actual</b> <b>step</b> of registration, even if they want to donate their organs at the time of death. This could be resolved with an opt-out system, where many more people would be registered as donors when only those who object consent to donation have to register to be on the non-donation list. For this reasons, countries, such as Wales, have adopted a [...] "soft opt-out" [...] consent, meaning if a citizen has not clearly made a decision to register, then they will be treated as a registered citizen and participate in the organ donation process. Likewise, opt-in consent refers to the consent process of only those who are registered to participate in organ donation. Currently, the United States has an opt-in system, but studies show that countries with an opt-out system save more lives due to more availability of donated organs. The current opt-in consent policy assumes that individuals are not willing to become organ donors at the time of their death, unless they have documented otherwise through organ donation registration. Registering to become an organ donor heavily depends on the attitude of the individual; those with a positive outlook might feel a sense of altruism towards organ donation, while others may have a more negative perspective, such as not trusting doctors to work as hard to save the lives of registered organ donors. Some common concerns regarding a presumed consent ("opt-out") system are sociologic fears of a new system, moral objection, sentimentality, and worries of the management of the objection registry for those who do decide to opt-out of donation. Additional concerns exist with views of compromising the freedom of choice to donate [...] and conflicts with religious beliefs which exist. Even though concerns exist, the United States still has a 95 percent organ donation approval rate. This level of nationwide acceptance may foster an environment where moving to a policy of presumed consent may help solve some of the organ shortage problem, where individuals are assumed to be willing organ donors unless they document a desire to [...] "opt-out", which must be respected.|$|E

A blue sky was now above me, {{and some of the}} Northern liberals devised for me a triumphant visit to the Tyne, which of course entailed as one of its incidents a public dinner.” Seeing a visit to Newcastle announced, Lord Palmerston wrote (Sept. 24) to Mr. Gladstone, begging him on no account to let the chancellor of the exchequer be too sympathetic with the tax-payer, or to tell the country that it was spending more money than it could afford. A more important part of the letter was to inform Mr. Gladstone that he himself and Lord Russell thought the time was fast approaching when an offer of mediation ought to be made by England, France, and Russia, and that Russell was going privately to instruct the ambassador at Paris to sound the French government. “Of course,” Lord Palmerston said, “no <b>actual</b> <b>step</b> would be taken without the sanction of the cabinet. But if I am not mistaken, you would be inclined to approve such a course.” The proposal would be made to both North and South. If both should accept, an armistice would follow, and negotiations on the basis of separation. If both should decline, then Lord Palmerston assumed that they would acknowledge the independence of the South. The next day Mr. Gladstone replied. He was glad to learn what the prime minister had told him, and for two reasons especially he desired that the proceedings should be prompt. The first was the rapid progress of the Southern arms and the extension of the area of Southern feeling. The second was the risk of violent impatience in the cotton-towns of Lancashire, such as would prejudice the dignity and disinterestedness of the proffered mediation.(54) On September 17 Russell had replied to a letter from Palmerston three days earlier, saying explicitly, “I agree with you that the time is come for offering mediation to the United States government, with a view to the recognition of the independence of the Confederates. I agree further, that in case of failure, we ought ourselves to recognise the Southern states as an independent state.”(55) So far, then, had the two heads of the government advanced, when Mr. Gladstone went to Newcastle.|$|E

Key factors in choosing this location were the favourable railway links to the Ruhr area and the Aachen Coalfield. In {{the years that followed}} industrial workers and engineers flocked to Erkelenz, creating a shortage of housing, a situation that could only be alleviated by establishing a charitable building association. [...] Between the town centre and the railway line, a new quarter emerged, known colloquially as Kairo (pronounced: Kah-ee-roh) due to the little foreign looking towers on many of the houses. In 1909 the drilling firm employed 50 staff and 460 workers. During the wartime year of 1916 it had as many as 1,600 employees. When, on 10 May 1898, a bronze statue of Emperor William I was erected on the market place, it was illuminated, at Raky's initiative, with electric lighting from arc lamps. That marked the introduction of electricity into the public arena in Erkelenz. In the same year the first street lamps were erected in Bahnhofstraße (today Kölner Straße) and the first mains electricity was delivered to houses.|$|E

Most small businesses say [...] "We just want to see what happens", which just wastes their money leading to disappointment on media planning ("The importance of frequency," [...] n.d.). In Advertisement, once is just not enough ("The importance of frequency," [...] n.d.). The biggest problem in media planning is; advertisers assume that someone would see their advertisement, would walk in their store and just buy something!!That is definitely not how it happens. There are five different steps for buying cycle a consumer goes through before actually purchasing something (Euan, 2013). These are Awareness, interest, need, Comparison and purchase ("The importance of frequency," [...] n.d.). Frequency is important as it pushes a consumer towards the <b>actual</b> <b>step</b> of purchasing something. The understanding of how exactly a consumer goes through the buying cycle is very essential to grasp the importance of frequency in media planning. Initially, the idea of reach is there to increase the awareness and exposure, but people forget. 80% of people forget the advertisement they see within 24 hours or even sooner ("The importance of frequency when advertising," [...] 2016). So, frequency is also important for awareness - deceasing the chances for forgetfulness. Secondly, frequency builds familiarity, familiarity builds trust ("The importance of frequency," [...] n.d.) and trust builds interest. In need, it is absolute that the consumer is aware of the company and have somewhat trust/ interest. And again, frequency plays essential role is remembrance, trust and interest. Higher frequency also helps to beat the competition ("The importance of frequency when advertising," [...] 2016). And finally, the consumer is on the final step of buying cycle the purchase, with the help of frequent advertisement. Without the good amount of frequency, a consumer would be very unlikely to get to the purchasing step. Thus, frequency is important because consistence advertisement reinforces top of mind brand awareness, brand favor-ability and brand loyalty among the current and potential consumers. Patience and effective frequency plays a great role in a business's long term success.|$|E

In this paper, we present a critical review of {{the historical development of}} the notion of stiffness, before introducing a new approach. A functional, called the stiffness indicator, is defined terms of the logarithmic norms of the differential equa-tion’s vector field. Readily computable along a solution to the problem, the stiffness indicator is independent of numerical integration methods, as well as of operational criteria such as accuracy requirements. The stiffness indicator defines a local reference time scale t, which may vary with time and state along the solution. By comparing t to the range of integration T, a large stiffness factor T/t is a necessary condition for stiffness. In numerical computations, t can be compared to the <b>actual</b> <b>step</b> size h, whose stiffness factor h/t depends on the choice of integration method.

The second aim was to study the impact of BMI, waist and hip circumference and waist-hip ratio on different pedometer and accelerometer positions on the body. Methods: Forty women with a BMI> 30 kg/m 2 wore two pedometers and two accelerometers during a standardized 6 minute walk test. Accelerometer 1 (A 1) was placed around the neck. Accelerometer 2 (A 2) was attached to the waistband of the woman’s trousers in line with left hip, Pedometer 1 (P 1) in line with right hip and pedometer 2 (P 2) behind back in line with the spine.

Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine the accuracy of four brands of pedometers at measuring steps, and to determine if a relationship exists between pedometer cost and accuracy. The hypothesis was that the more expensive brands of pedometers (the Fitbit Charge™ and Omron HJ- 303 ™) would yield more accurate step counts than less expensive brands (the SmartHealth – Walking FIT™ and Sportline™). While wearing all pedometers at once, one male and eleven female college students (mean ± SD; age = 20. 8 ± 0. 94 years) walked 400 meters on a treadmill for 5 minutes at 3. 5 miles per hour. The pedometer step counts were recorded at the end.
