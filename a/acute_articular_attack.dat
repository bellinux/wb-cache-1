40|$|Although {{obesity is}} {{associated}} with osteoarthritis, {{it is unclear whether}} body weight (BW) independently affects articular cartilage catabolism (i. e., independent from physiological factors that also accompany obesity). The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the independent effect of BW on articular cartilage catabolism associated with walking. A secondary purpose was to determine how decreased BW influenced cardiovascular response due to walking. Twelve able-bodied subjects walked for 30 minutes on a lower-body positive pressure treadmill during three sessions: control (unadjusted BW), + 40 %BW, and - 40 %BW. Serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) was measured immediately before (baseline) and after, and 15 and 30 minutes after the walk. Heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured every three minutes during the walk. Relative to baseline, average serum COMP concentration was 13 % and 5 % greater immediately after and 15 minutes after the walk. Immediately after the walk, serum COMP concentration was 14 % greater for the + 40 %BW session than for the - 40 %BW session. HR and RPE were greater for the + 40 %BW session than for the other two sessions, but did not differ between the control and - 40 %BW sessions. BW independently influences <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> cartilage catabolism and cardiovascular response due to walking: as BW increases, so does <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> cartilage catabolism and cardiovascular response. These results indicate that lower-body positive pressure walking may benefit certain individuals by reducing <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> cartilage catabolism, due to walking, while maintaining cardiovascular response...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Osteoarthritis is a {{long-term}} complication of <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> infections. However, the roles of cartilage and synovia in this process are not yet fully understood. Methods. Patients with acute joint infections were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial and the cytokine composition of effusions compared in patients with arthroplasty (n = 8) or with intact joints (n = 67). Cytokines and cell function were also analyzed using a human in vitro model of joint infection. Results. Synovial IL- 1 β levels were significantly higher in patients with arthroplasty (p = 0. 004). Higher IL- 1 β concentrations were {{also found in the}} in vitro model without chondrocytes (p < 0. 05). The anti-inflammatory cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 10 were consistently expressed in vivo and in vitro, showing no association with the presence of cartilage or chondrocytes. In contrast, FasL levels increased steadily in vitro, reaching higher levels without chondrocytes (p < 0. 05). Likewise, the viability of synovial fibroblasts (SFB) during infection was higher in the presence of chondrocytes. The cartilage-metabolism markers aggrecan and bFGF were at higher concentrations in intact joints, but also synthesized by SFB. Conclusions.

40|$|Crystal-induced {{arthritis}} (CIA) {{is characterized}} by an intense inflammatory reaction triggered by the deposition of monosodium urate, calcium pyrophosphate, and basic calcium phosphate crystals in articular and periarticular tissues. Severe, acute pain constitutes the most important clinical symptom in patients affected by these diseases. Pain along with redness, warmness, swelling, and stiffness in the affected joint arises abruptly in gout and disappears when the acute phase of the attack resolves. While an acute joint attack caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals can mimic a gout flare, basic calcium phosphate crystal arthritis {{gives rise to a}} series of clinical manifestations, the most severe of which are calcific periarthritis, mostly asymptomatic, and a highly destructive arthritis known as Milwaukee shoulder syndrome, which {{is characterized by}} painful <b>articular</b> <b>attacks.</b> Pain development in CIA is mediated by several inflammatory substances that are formed after cell injury by crystals. The most important of these molecules, which exert their effects through different receptor subtypes present in both peripheral sensory neurons and the spinal cord, are prostaglandins, bradykinin, cytokines (in particular, interleukin (IL) - 1 β), and substance P. The pharmacological treatment of pain in CIA is strictly associated with the treatment of acute phases and flares of the disease, during which crystals trigger the inflammatory response. According to international guidelines, colchicines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or corticosteroids are first-line agents for the systemic treatment of acute CIA, while biologics, namely anti-IL- 1 β agents, should be used only in particularly refractory cases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Temporomandibular {{disorder}} (TMD) patients might {{present a}} number of concurrent clinical diagnoses that may be clustered according to their similarity. Profiling patients’ clinical presentations can be useful for better understanding the behavior of TMD and for providing appropriate treatment planning. The {{aim of this study}} was to simultaneously classify symptomatic patients diagnosed with a variety of subtypes of TMD into homogenous groups based on their clinical presentation and occurrence of comorbidities. Methods Clinical records of 357 consecutive TMD patients seeking treatment in a private specialized clinic were included in the study sample. Patients presenting multiple subtypes of TMD diagnosed simultaneously were categorized according to the AAOP criteria. Descriptive statistics and two-step cluster analysis were used to characterize the clinical presentation of these patients based on the primary and secondary clinical diagnoses. Results The most common diagnoses were localized masticatory muscle pain (n[*]=[*] 125) and disc displacement without reduction (n[*]=[*] 104). Comorbidity was identified in 288 patients. The automatic selection of an optimal number of clusters included 100 % of cases, generating an initial 6 -cluster solution and a final 4 -cluster solution. The interpretation of within-group ranking of the importance of variables in the clustering solutions resulted in the following characterization of clusters: chronic facial pain (n[*]=[*] 36), acute muscle pain (n[*]=[*] 125), <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> pain (n[*]=[*] 75) and chronic articular impairment (n[*]=[*] 121). Conclusion Subgroups of acute and chronic TMD patients seeking treatment can be identified using clustering methods to provide a better understanding of the clinical presentation of TMD when multiple diagnosis are present. Classifying patients into identifiable symptomatic profiles would help clinicians to estimate how common a disorder is within a population of TMD patients and understand the probability of certain pattern of clinical complaints. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) is a lipid {{mediator}} {{involved in the}} resolution of inflammation. Increased levels of LXA(4) in synovial fluid and enhanced expression of the formyl peptide receptor 2 /lipoxin A(4) receptor (FPR 2 /ALX) in the synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis patients have been reported. Endothelins (ETs) play a pivotal pro-inflammatory role in <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> inflammatory responses. Here, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory role of LXA(4), during the acute phase of zymosan-induced arthritis, focusing on the modulation of ET- 1 expression and its effects. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The anti-inflammatory effects of LXA(4), BML- 111 (agonist of FPR 2 /ALX receptors) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) pre- and post-treatments were investigated in a murine model of zymosan-induced arthritis. Articular inflammation was assessed by examining knee joint oedema; neutrophil accumulation in synovial cavities; and levels of prepro-ET- 1 mRNA, leukotriene (LT) B(4), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha and the chemokine KC/CXCL 1, after stimulation. The direct effect of LXA(4) on ET- 1 -induced neutrophil activation and chemotaxis was evaluated by shape change and Boyden chamber assays respectively. KEY RESULTS LXA(4), BML- 111 and ASA administered as pre- or post-treatment inhibited oedema and neutrophil influx induced by zymosan stimulation. Zymosan-induced preproET- 1 mRNA, KC/CXCL 1, LTB(4) and TNF-alpha levels were also decreased after LXA(4) pretreatment. In vitro, ET- 1 -induced neutrophil chemotaxis was inhibited by LXA 4 pretreatment. LXA(4) treatment also inhibited ET- 1 -induced oedema formation and neutrophil influx into mouse knee joints. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION LXA(4) exerted anti-inflammatory effects on articular inflammation through a mechanism that involved the inhibition of ET- 1 expression and its effects.

40|$|AbstractHydrated calcium pyrophosphates (CPP, Ca 2 P 2 O 7 ·nH 2 O) are a {{fundamental}} family of materials among osteoarticular pathologic calcifications. In this contribution, a comprehensive multinuclear NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) study of four crystalline and two amorphous phases {{of this family}} is presented. 1 H, 31 P and 43 Ca MAS (Magic Angle Spinning) NMR spectra were recorded, leading to informative fingerprints characterizing each compound. In particular, different 1 H and 43 Ca solid state NMR signatures were observed for the amorphous phases, depending on the synthetic procedure used. The NMR parameters of the crystalline phases were determined using the GIPAW (Gauge Including Projected Augmented Wave) DFT approach, based on first-principles calculations. In some cases, relaxed structures were found to improve the agreement between experimental and calculated values, demonstrating the importance of proton positions and pyrophosphate local geometry in this particular NMR crystallography approach. Such calculations serve {{as a basis for}} the future ab initio modeling of the amorphous CPP phases. Statement of significanceThe general concept of NMR crystallography is applied to the detailed study of calcium pyrophosphates (CPP), whether hydrated or not, and whether crystalline or amorphous. CPP are {{a fundamental}} family of materials among osteoarticular pathologic calcifications. Their prevalence increases with age, impacting on 17. 5 % of the population after the age of 80. They are frequently involved or associated with <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> arthritis such as pseudogout.

40|$|Systemic {{administration}} of the cytokine, TGF beta 1, profoundly antagonized the development of polyarthritis in susceptible rats. TGF beta 1 administration (1 or 5 micrograms/animal), initiated one day before an arthritogenic dose of streptococcal cell wall (SCW) fragments, virtually eliminated the joint swelling and distortion typically observed during both the <b>acute</b> phase (<b>articular</b> index, AI = 2. 5 vs. 11; P less than 0. 025) and the chronic phase (AI = 0 vs. 12. 5) of the disease. Moreover, TGF beta 1 suppressed the evolution of arthritis even when administration was begun after the acute phase of the disease. Histopathological examination of the joint revealed the systemic TGF beta 1 treatment greatly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus formation, and joint erosion. Consistent with the inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment into the synovium, TGF beta 1 reversed the leukocytosis associated with the chronic phase of the arthritis. Control animals subjected to the same TGF beta 1 dosing regimen displayed no discernable immunosuppressive or toxic effects even after 4 wk of treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some of {{theories}} {{try to explain}} the insurgence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> rheumatism (AAR). These theories remind the close relation between AF and left atrium, or with valvular vitium degree, or monophasic action potential and histological cardiac structure. In 15 years {{of work in the}} academic Department of Heart and Big Vessels in Rome, the Authors studied 243 patients with mitral valvular disease post AAR before and after surgical manoeuvres. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were divided in order to monitor atrium and ventricle morphological and functional modifications of the valve according to cardiac rhythm. Patients classification was based on surgical therapy adopted, kind of mitral disease and cardiac rhythm. An histological examination was performed, only in patients treated with valvular replacement. During the operation an histological examination in an atrial tissue fragment was performed. 243 patients with mitral valvular disease post AAR with indication in valvular adjustment were studied. The whole population was treated with mitral transcutaneous valvuloplasty (Group B [...] 130 patients) or with mitral valve replacement surgery (Group A [...] 113 patients). These two groups were divided: in Gr. A in Gr. A 1 and Gr. A 2, and Gr. B in Gr. B 1 and Gr. B 2, according to cardiac rhythm (sinus rhythm iSR, AF). These subgroups were also divided in Gr. A 1 SR, Gr. A 1 AF; Gr. A 2 SR, Gr. A 2 AF; Gr. A 3 SR, Gr. A 3 AF, according to mitralic disease's kind (stenosis, stenosis/regurgitation, regurgitation). A complex screening were exerted to all patients using echocardio-doppler technology. Morphological parameters of atrium and ventricle, and functional parameters of mitral valve, aorta and tricuspid were evaluated. In Gr. A group patients during the operation were execute a bioptic sampling from left atrium and a consecutive histological valuation. RESULTS: In Gr. A 1 mitral valve area (MtVA) arises smaller (p 0. 05). Left atrium volume arises elder in patients in AF than in patients in SR (p< 0. 01), either in patients of subgroups Gr. A 1, Gr. A 2 or in patients of the whole Gr. B before and after valvuloplasty. In the whole population Gr. B, either Gr. BRS or Gr. BFA, left and right atrial volumes decrease eloquently (p< 0. 01) after valvoplasty. There's no linear relationship (Pearson r< 0. 5) between the different subgroups of Gr. A (Gr. A 1, Gr. A 2, Gr. A 3) and those of Gr. B according to mitral valve area (MtVA), volume and left atrial area. Left atrial biopsy shows in patients of SR a normal atrial tissue in the 48 % of cases and lightly altered in remaining 52 %. On the contrary in patients of AF there are strong anomalies in the 100 % of cases. CONCLUSIONS: According to histological view, atrial volumes variations and valvular area variations before and after surgical treatment, and according also to their comparisons in different groups, authors could assume that insurgence of AF and its chronicization could be an expression of a strong atrial myocardial histological alteration. Furthermore while starting moment of AF genesis is characterized by histological alterations of atrial myocardium (expression of rheumatic chronic disease), its chronicization hands to anatomic-volumetric progressive deterioration of the atrial dysfunction...|$|R

Here, we report the antiinflammatory and antinociceptive effects of gedunin in an <b>acute</b> model of <b>articular</b> inflammation induced by zymosan (500 μg/cavity; intra-articular) in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Intraperitoneal (i. p.) pretreatment with gedunin (0. 005 – 5 mg/kg) impaired zymosan-induced edema formation, neutrophil accumulation and hypernociception in mouse knee joints, due to decreased expression of preproET- 1 mRNA and production of LTB 4, PGE 2, TNF-α and IL- 6. Mouse post-treatment with gedunin (0. 05 mg/kg; i. p.) 1 and 6 h after stimulation also impaired articular inflammation, by reverting edema formation, neutrophil accumulation {{and the production of}} lipid mediators, cytokines and endothelin. In addition, gedunin directly modulated the functions of neutrophils and macrophages in vitro. The pre-incubation of neutrophil with gedunin (100 µM) impaired shape change, adhesion to endothelial cells, chemotaxis and lipid body formation triggered by different stimuli. Macrophage pretreatment with gedunin impaired intracellular calcium mobilization, nitric oxide production, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and induced the expression of the antiinflammatory chaperone heat shock protein 70.

The study was performed in 16 pigs using both animals' knees. The chodrograft was prepared from chondrocytes mixed with the fibrin glue Tissucol (Baxter, Germany). According to the type of chondrocytes an autologous or allogenic chondrograft was prepared. The allogenic chondrograft was placed into the area of the defect in the left knee and 21 days later the autologous chondrograft was implanted into the defect in the right knee of the same animal. This procedure was done in 13 animal, 6 defects (3 animals) were left without treatment as a negative control group. The evaluation of the chondrograft's quality consisted of gross inspection and histological investigation. The results of grafts incorporation were evaluated by dissection, light and electron microscopy. All defect treated by autologous and allogenic chondrografts were healed in by a hyaline-like cartilage. No significant statistical difference in the results of defect's healing by autologous and allogenic chondrografts was found. The chondrografts based on the fibrin glue Tissucol seem to be an acceptable medium for <b>acute</b> defects of <b>articular</b> cartilage in load-bearing areas defects healing.

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this work}} {{the role of the}} central nervous system in the modulation of the inflammatory peripheral pain in the zymosan induced arthritis (AZy) in rats. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sinovial fluid were collected from animals at different AZy times (1, 3, 6, 12 and 14 hours) {{in order to determine the}} nitrite level. Different groups of male, Wistar rats (n= 6), 250 to 300 g weight, were then submitted to surgery in order to place a cannula in the subarachnoid space, to allow for intrathecal (i. t) insertion of substances. The animals were also submitted to AZy followed by the paw suspension test (PST) that measures articular incapacitation (AI), aiming to analyze hyperalgesia in this experimental model. The pharmacological modulation was achieved by the prophylactic or therapeutic i. t administration of a NO donor (SIN- 1), NOS inhibitors (L-NAME, 1400 W), a soluble Guanylate cyclase inhibitor (ODQ), a GMPc analogue (8 -Bromo-GMPc) and an NMDA receptor antagonist (MK- 801). The ODQ was also administered intraarticulary to one group of animals. The results are expressed as mean Â s. e. m, followed by ANOVA and the Tukey test, comparing to the groups that received the vehicle. The levels of nitrite in the CSF were smaller at 1 and 3 hours after zymosan injection, as compared with basal levels (P< 0. 05). The surgical procedure did not alter hyperalgesia. SIN- 1 i. t (10 mcg) reduced the AI, while 40 mcg increased the AI (P< 0. 05). L-NAME or 1400 W, prophylactic or therapeutic, reduced the AI (P< 0. 05). ODQ i. t, prophylactic, but not therapeutic, reduced the AI, and also reverted the AI promoted by the 40 mcg of SIN- 1. Besides, ODQ, intraarticulary, reverted the AI promoted by the 40 mcg of SIN- 1, administered i. t. MK- 801 i. t inhibited the AI, both caused by AZy and by the 40 mcg of SIN- 1. The results suggest a central endogenous anti-nociceptive role of NO in the <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> hyperalgesia of the AZy. The NO, depending on the dose and local where it acts, may present an anti-nociceptive or pro-nociceptive effect in the AZy, both due to the activation of GMPc and the excitation of NMDA receptors. We have shown, for the first time, the existence of a peripheral-central activation way modulating the articular hyperalgesia in the AZy acute phase. Nesse trabalho, investigamos a participaÃÃo do sistema nervoso central (SNC) na modulaÃÃo da dor inflamatÃria perifÃrica na artrite induzida por zymosan (AZy) em ratos. Coletou-se o lÃquor (LCR) e lavado articular dos animais em diferentes tempos de artrite (1, 3, 6, 12 e 24 horas) para a determinaÃÃo dos nÃveis de nitrito. Em seguida, diferentes grupos de ratos (n= 6) machos, Wistar, pesando entre 250 300 g, foram submetidos ao procedimento cirÃrgico para colocaÃÃo de uma cÃnula no espaÃo subaracnÃideo, para permitir a administraÃÃo intratecal (i. t) de substÃncias. Os animais foram tambÃm submetidos Ã artrite induzida por zymosan (AZy) seguida da realizaÃÃo do teste de suspensÃo da pata (TSP) para permitir a avaliaÃÃo da incapacitaÃÃo articular (IA), refletindo a hiperalgesia no modelo. A modulaÃÃo farmacolÃgica foi realizada atravÃs da administraÃÃo i. t, de forma profilÃtica ou terapÃutica, de um doador de NO (SIN- 1), de inibidores de NOS (L-NAME, 1400 W), de um inibidor da guanilato ciclase solÃvel (ODQ), de um anÃlogo do GMPc (8 -Bromo-GMPc) e de um antagonista dos receptores NMDA (MK- 801). Em um grupo, o ODQ foi tambÃm administrado por via i. a. Os resultados foram expressos em mÃdia Â e. p. m., seguida de ANOVA e Teste de Tukey, comparando-se aos grupos que receberam o veÃculo. Os nÃveis de nitrito no LCR foram menores Ã 1 e 3 h apÃs a injeÃÃo do zymosan, em relaÃÃo aos valores basais (P< 0, 05). O procedimento cirÃrgico nÃo alterou a hiperalgesia. SIN- 1 i. t (10 mcg) reduziu a IA, mas 40 mcg de SIN- 1 aumentaram a IA (P< 0, 05). L-NAME ou 1400 W, de forma profilÃtica ou terapÃutica, reduziram a IA (P< 0, 05). ODQ i. t, profilÃtico, mas nÃo terapÃutico, reduziu a IA da AZy e tambÃm reverteu a IA promovida por 40 mcg de SIN- 1. Ainda, ODQ, intra-articular, reverteu a IA promovida por 40 mcg de SIN- 1, i. t., MK- 801 i. t inibiu a IA tanto da AZy quanto de 40 mcg de SIN- 1. Os resultados sugerem um papel antinociceptivo endÃgeno central do NO na hiperalgesia articular aguda da AZy. O NO, a depender da dose e do local de aÃÃo, pode ter efeito prÃ ou anti-nociceptivo, por ativaÃÃo de GMPc e excitaÃÃo de receptores NMDA.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the natural history and pathogenesis of the acute arthritis induced by inoculation of a viable Chlamydia trachomatis biovar (mouse pneumonitis agent or MoPn) in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. Immunologically naive (previously unsensitized) mice as well as mice immunized against Chlamydia (MoPn) by vaginal infection were employed. Both intravenous and intraarticular inoculations were employed. No arthritis developed after intravenous injections of MoPn although statistically significant antibody titers and splenic enlargement ensued. Intra-articular inoculation into knee joints produced a definite arthritis of 7 to 10 days duration marked by granulocyte and mononuclear cell infiltration of the joint and vacuolated synovial macrophages that stained heavily for chlamydial antigen by immunoperoxidase technique. Statistically significant increases in <b>articular</b> <b>acute</b> and chronic inflammation (P less than 0. 02 were observed in previously sensitized, but not unsensitized, female mice at 2 but not 7 days after intra-articular chlamydial challenge. Chlamydiae were isolated from injected joints up to day 5, but not at day 10, after challenge. Chlamydial antigen disappeared rapidly from knee joints between day 10 and 15 after challenge. Electron micrographs demonstrated vacuolated synovial cells of the macrophage type, many of which contained degenerating chlamydial elementary bodies. Reticulate and intermediate bodies also were seen but were far less frequent than degenerating elementary bodies. Unaltered elementary bodies were difficult to identify beyond day 2 after articular inoculation. Thus, it appears likely that intra-articular chlamydial survival is shorter than the duration of the arthropathy. This may have important implications in attempts to identify chlamydiae in human joints in Reiter's Disease...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivePost-traumatic {{arthritis}} is {{a frequent}} cause of disability and occurs most commonly and predictably after articular fracture. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to examine the effect of fracture severity on acute joint pathology in a novel murine model of intra-articular fracture. DesignLow and high energy articular fractures (n= 25 per group) of the tibial plateau were created in adult male C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The <b>acute</b> effect of <b>articular</b> fracture severity on synovial inflammation, bone morphology, liberated fracture area, cartilage pathology, chondrocyte viability, and systemic cytokines and biomarkers levels was assessed at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-fracture. ResultsIncreasing intra-articular fracture severity was associated with greater acute pathology in the synovium and bone compared to control limbs, including increased global synovitis and reduced periarticular bone density and thickness. Applied fracture energy was significantly correlated with degree of liberated cortical bone surface area, indicating greater comminution. Serum concentrations of hyaluronic acid (HA) were significantly increased 1 day post-fracture. While articular fracture significantly reduced chondrocyte viability, there was no relationship between fracture severity and chondrocyte viability, cartilage degeneration, or systemic levels of cytokines and biomarkers. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that articular fracture is associated with a loss of chondrocyte viability and increased levels of systemic biomarkers, and that increased intra-articular fracture severity is associated with increased acute joint pathology in a variety of joint tissues, including synovial inflammation, cortical comminution, and bone morphology. Further characterization of the early events following articular fracture could aid in the treatment of post-traumatic arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Recognition of {{patterns}} of traumatic elbow instability helps anticipate specific fracture characteristics and associated injuries. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the association of fracture line distribution and location of displaced partial articular radial head fractures with specific patterns of traumatic elbow instability using fracture mapping techniques. Fracture line distribution and location of 66 <b>acute</b> displaced partial <b>articular</b> radial head fractures were identified using quantitative 3 -dimensional computed tomography reconstructions that allowed reduction of fracture fragments and a standardized method to divide the radial head into quadrants with forearm in neutral position. Based on qualitative and quantitative assessment of fracture maps, the association between fracture characteristics of displaced partial articular radial head fractures and specific elbow fracture patterns was determined. In partial articular radial head fractures, the highest fracture line intensity was located in the anterolateral quadrant near the center of the radial head. Fracture location corresponded with fracture line distribution; most fractures involved the anterolateral quadrant (n[*]=[*] 65; 98 %), whereas parts of the posteromedial quadrant were involved in a minority of the fractures (n[*]=[*] 10; 15 %). The association of fracture line distribution and location with overall fracture patterns of the elbow, as depicted on fracture maps, was not statistically significant. Fracture maps demonstrated no association between fracture line distribution and location of displaced partial articular fractures of the radial head and overall specific patterns of traumatic elbow instability, suggesting a common fracture mechanism that involves the anterolateral part of the radial head in most patient...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Five {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis and no previous hip joint disease developed an acute disabling arthritis in one hip joint. Roentgenograms were negative and synovial fluid {{from the hip}} joint was inflammatory, but no crystals were seen and cultures were negative. Four of the five patients responded rapidly to intra-articular corticosteroids, {{and none of the}} five has had further hip joint symptoms during a mean follow up period of two years. Key words: transient synovitis. Hip joint involvement in {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be defined clinically, but most published observations addressing the problem have focused on roentgenographic abnormalities; by this definition, hip joint involvement has been recog-nised in 30 - 75 % of patients with RA. 1 - 7 <b>Acute</b> flares of <b>articular</b> synovitis are a well recognised phenomenon in RA, though an acute flare of limited distribution should raise the question of a superim-posed infectious process. 8 Flares in the hip joint in patients with RA could be assumed to occur as often as flares in other joints, but no previously published report has specifically addressed this issue. Because of the apparent rarity, unique clinical features, and dramatic presentation of this phenomenon we report our experience with five cases of acute hip joint arthritis in patients with RA. Case reports Over a five year period 400 patients with definite or classical RA according to the criteria of the Amer-ican Rheumatism Association were evaluated and followed up. During this period five of these patients developed an acute hip joint arthritis; their clinical and laboratory findings are summarised in Table 1.

Entretanto, agentes ativadores de NADPH oxidase, produtores de EROs, reduzem o processo inflamatÃrio em modelos experimentais. Considerando-se a participaÃÃo controversa da via NO-GMPc na nocicepÃÃo, inibidores de 5 -fosfodiesterase tÃm papel contraditÃrio em modelos de dor. Nesse trabalho, investigou-se o efeito do fitol, um ativador de NADPH oxidase, e tadalafil, um inibidor de 5 -fosfodiesterase, em modelos de artrite induzida por zymosan (AZy) e peritonite induzida por Zy, bem como em osteoartrite por transecÃÃo do ligamento cruzado {{anterior}} (TLCA) e contorÃÃo abdominal por Ãcido acÃtico. Na AZy, ratos e camundongos receberam 1 mg e 100 Âg de Zy intra-articular (i. art.), respectivamente. Na peritonite ou contorÃÃo, camundongos receberam 100 Âg de Zy ou Ãcido acÃtico intraperitoneal (i. p.), respectivamente. Na osteoartrite, ratos foram submetidos Ã TLCA. Ratos receberam fitol subcutÃneo (s. c.) 30 min â 8 d antes da AZy ou tadalafil via oral (v. o.) 2 h apÃs Zy. Outros ratos receberam SIN- 1 (i. art.), ODQ (i. art.) ou naloxona (i. p.) 1, 5 â 2 h apÃs Zy. Camundongos receberam fitol s. c. 1 â 24 h antes do Zy i. art [...] Outros camundongos receberam fitol i. art. 1 h antes ou 1, 5 h apÃs Zy. Na peritonite ou contorÃÃo, fitol s. c. foi injetado 30 min â 24 h antes do Zy ou Ãcido acÃtico, respectivamente. Na osteoartrite, foi feita a administraÃÃo de fitol s. c. 5 d antes e 35 d depois da TLCA ou de tadalafil v. o do 4 â 7 d apÃs TLCA. Grupos controles receberam Zy i. art. ou i. p. ou Ãcido acÃtico ou foram submetidos Ã TLCA. A hipernocicepÃÃo foi avaliada pelo teste de incapacitaÃÃo articular, registrada como tempo de suspensÃo da pata â TSP. O influxo celular (IC) foi quantificado no lavado articular, apÃs 6 h ou 7 d da AZy e, no lavado peritoneal, apÃs 4 h da peritonite. NO, IL- 1, TNF-&# 945;, IL- 10 e CINC- 1 foram medidos no sobrenadante articular agudo em ratos, enquanto os glicosaminoglicanos (GAGs) da cartilagem foram quantificados apÃs 7 d da AZy em ratos. Resultados foram expressos como mÃdia Â e. p. m., submetidos Ã ANOVA e teste de Tukey ou ao teste t de Student (P< 0, 05). Na contorÃÃo, dados foram expressos em mediana e submetidos ao teste de Kruskal-Wallis (P< 0, 05). Na AZy, a administraÃÃo sistÃmica (s. c.) e profilÃtica de fitol diminuiu IC agudo, independente da dose e tempo de administraÃÃo, em camundongos. A injeÃÃo local (i. art.) profilÃtica ou terapÃutica de fitol diminuiu de forma significativa IC em camundongos submetidos Ã AZy. Semelhante Ã fase aguda, fitol reduziu significativamente IC crÃnico. Na AZy em ratos, fitol diminuiu IC agudo e crÃnico, bem como TSP. Quanto aos GAGs, houve aumento significativo pelo fitol, atingindo nÃvel semelhante ao dos animais naive. Na peritonite ou contorÃÃo, fitol reduziu IC ou nÃmero de contorÃÃes, respectivamente, independente do tempo de administraÃÃo. Na osteoartrite, fitol reduziu significativamente TSP nos dias 1, 7, 9 e 11, bem como no pico entre 4 Â e 7 Â d apÃs TLCA. NO, IL- 1, TNF-&# 945; e IL- 10 tambÃm foram reduzidos na AZy. Quanto ao tadalafil, houve diminuiÃÃo do IC agudo e TSP, de forma dose-dependente, na AZy em ratos. ODQ, administrado previamente ao tadalafil, reverteu o efeito do tadalafil sobre IC e TSP na AZy, o que nÃo ocorreu com a injeÃÃo prÃvia de naloxona. Tadalafil reduziu TNF-&# 945; e IL- 10 na AZy e o TSP na osteoartrite. Os resultados mostram que fitol promove efeitos antiinflamatÃrios e antinociceptivos independente da espÃcie, estÃmulo, tecido e via de administraÃÃo. Essas aÃÃes se associam Ã reduÃÃo na liberaÃÃo local de NO e citocinas. Paralelamente, tadalafil tem efeito antiinflamatÃrio e antinociceptivo similar, associado ao bloqueio na liberaÃÃo local de TNF. Esses achados sugerem que ativadores de NADPH oxidase, possivelmente a partir de compostos da dieta, modifiquem a histÃria natural de artropatias inflamatÃrias. O efeito antinociceptivo de inibidores de 5 -fosfodiesterase deve ser explorado, uma vez que esses compostos encontram progressiva indicaÃÃo em patologias inflamatÃrias que cursam com dano vascular e hipÃxia. Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) promote tissue destruction in inflammatory {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis. However, agents that activate ROS production by NADPH oxidase reduce inflammation in experimental models. Considering the controversial participation of via NO-cGMP in nociception, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase- 5 have controversial role in models of pain. In this study, it was investigated the effect of phytol, an activating of NADPH oxidase, and tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor, in models of zymosan-induced arthritis (ZyA) and Zy-induced peritonitis as well as osteoarthritis by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and acetic acid writhing. In ZyA, rats and mice received 1 mg and 100 Âg zymosan intra-articular (i. art.), respectively. In peritonitis or writhing, mice received 100 Âg of Zy or acetic acid intraperitoneal (i. p.), respectively. In osteoarthritis, rats underwent ACLT. Rats received phytol subcutaneous (s. c) 30 min â 8 d before ZyA or tadalafil orally (p. o.) 2 h after Zy. Other rats received SIN- 1 (i. art.), ODQ (i. art.) or naloxone (i. p.) 1. 5 â 2 h after Zy. Mice received phytol s. c. 1 â 24 h before Zy i. art [...] Other mice received phytol i. art. 1 h before or 1. 5 h after Zy. In peritonitis or writhing, phytol s. c. was injected 30 min â 24 h before Zy or acetic acid, respectively. In osteoarthritis, it was done one s. c. phytol administration 5 d before and 35 d after ACLT or tadalafil p. o. from 4 â 7 d after ACLT. Control groups received Zy i. art. or i. p. or acetic acid or were submitted to ACLT. The hypernociception was assessed by articular incapacitation test recorded as paw elevation time - PET. Cell influx (CI) was quantified in joint lavage after 6 h or 7 d of ZyA and in peritoneal lavage after 4 h of peritonitis. NO, IL- 1, TNF-&# 945;, IL- 10 and CINC- 1 were measured in <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> supernatant in rats while cartilage glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were quantified after 7 d of ZyA in rats. Results were expressed as mean Â SEM, submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test or to Studentâs t test (P < 0. 05). In writhing, data were expressed as median and submitted to the Kruskal-Wallis test (P< 0. 05). In ZyA, systemic (s. c.) and prophylactic administration of phytol decreased acute CI, independent of dose and time of administration, in mice. Local (i. art.) prophylactic or therapy injection of phytol decreased significantly CI in mice submitted to ZyA. Similar to the acute phase, phytol reduced significantly chronic CI. In ZyA in rats, phytol decreased acute and chronic CI as well as PET. As to GAGs, there was significant increase by phytol, reaching a level similar to naive animals. In peritonitis or writhing, phytol decreased CI or number of writhing, respectively, regardless of administration time. In osteoarthritis, phytol decreased significantly PET on days 1, 7, 9 and 11 {{as well as the}} peak between 4 th and 7 th d after ACLT. NO, IL- 1, TNF-&# 945; and IL- 10 were reduced in ZyA too. As tadalafil, there was decreased acute IC and PET, in a dose-dependent, in ZyA in rats. ODQ, administered prior tadalafil, reversed tadalafil effect about CI and PET in ZyA, that didnât happen with a prior injection of naloxone. Tadalafil reduced TNF-&# 945; and IL- 10 in ZyA and PET in osteoarthritis. The results show that phytol promotes anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects species, stimulus, tissue and route of administration independent. These actions are associate with the local release of NO and cytokines. In parallel, tadalafil has similar anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects associated with the lock on the local release of TNF. These findings suggest that activators of NADPH oxidase, possibly from compounds in the diet, modify the natural history of inflammatory arthropathy. The antinociceptive effect of phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors should be explored, since these compounds are progressive indication in inflammatory diseases that occur with vascular damage and hypoxia...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} project was to {{identify}} a growth factor that would enhance the in vitro chondrogenesis of the equine mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and subsequently to assess {{the capacity of the}} growth factor expressing MSC to improve cartilage repair and osteoarthritis (OA) prevention in vivo. Previous efforts on MSC enhanced cartilage repair have focused on implantation of MSCs to articular cartilage defects. This approach is only applicable to <b>acute</b> and focal <b>articular</b> cartilage injury and does not apply to the OA joint. Global joint disease, as in OA, is far more common than focal cartilage injury and no disease modifying therapies of regenerative therapies are currently available. Short term tracking studies of intra-articular injection of autologous MSCs were performed as part of this dissertation. Studies revealed that MSCs efficiently engraft the synovial membrane but not articular cartilage, whether normal or diseased. Differing three-dimensional culture systems were tested for suitability as a system to study in vitro chondrogenesis of MSCs. In chondrogenic media, fibrin alginate culture and pellet culture (500, 000 cell pellets) were superior for chondrogenic induction to agarose, alginate alone and 250, 000 cells pellets. For in vitro MSC chondrogenesis, supplementation with an isoform of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-[beta]) is required. TGF-[beta] 1, -[beta] 2 and -[beta] 3 have been used and although TGF-[beta] 1 is the most frequently reported both in vitro and in vivo, it is not clear which is superior for chondrogenic induction and prevention of hypertrophy. The chondrogenic effect of the 3 isoforms was tested in MSC pellet culture. All 3 isoforms resulted in MSC chondrogenesis, however, TGF-[beta] 3 had clear enhancement of prevention of hypertrophy. Growth factor supplementation in vivo is difficult to maintain because of the short halflife of injected or implanted growth factors. Gene therapy techniques to induce growth factor expression by injected or implanted MSCs would allow for continuous growth factor supplementation to the joint. Adenoviral vectors for expression of TGF-[beta] 1, -[beta] 2 and -[beta] 3 were constructed and tested in MSC pellet culture to confirm transgene expression and efficacy for chondrogenic induction in long term 3 -dimensional culture. Adenoviral transgene expression of TGF-[beta] 3 resulted in chondrogenic induction and reduced progression toward hypertrophy compared to Ad TGF-[beta] 1 and -[beta] 2. Given the synovial distribution of MSCs injected to the arthritic joint, injection of growth factor enhanced and anti-catabolic MSCs to the middle carpal joint of horses in the osteochondral fragmentation model of OA was tested. This resulted in improved control of joint disease evidenced by improved effusion scores and range of motion in the week following treatment injection, reduced cartilage MMP 13 and synovial IL 1 b expression, reduced synovial fibrosis and a strong trend of increased cartilage glycosaminoglycan content...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{history of the}} Medici family is well known [1]. It emerges that {{several members of the}} Medici family suffered from arthritic diseases. The term frequently reported by contemporary sources to indicate these morbid episodes, is “gout”. It should be remembered that the term “gout” was used in those times to indicate several pathological conditions of rheumatic origin [2]. This disease {{seems to have been a}} family disease among the Medici, as attested by the nickname “the gouty” attributed to Piero (1416 - 1469). In particular, gout is reported in the {{clinical history}} of Cosimo I (1519 - 1574), Ferdinand I (1549 - 1609), Cardinal Carlo (1596 - 1666), Lorenzo (1599 - 1648), Cosimo II (1590 - 1621), Cardinal Giovanni Carlo (1611 - 1663), Prince Matthias (1613 - 1667), Cardinals Leopoldo (1617 - 1675) and Francesco Maria (1660 - 1711). The archive data refer that Cosimo I suffered from several illnesses, including an <b>acute</b> <b>articular</b> disorder of the right knee, named “gout” by the court physicians, which appeared at the age of 49 and 52 - 53 [1]. The palaeopathological study of Cosimo’s remains reveals a series of lesions of the axial and appendicular skeleton. The skull shows hyperostosis frontalis interna. The anterior longitudinal ligament on the right-hand side of the column is ossified at the level of the T 6, T 7 and T 8 vertebral bodies; this flowing ossification forms a bony bridge between the vertebrae, appearing as a continuous line of bumps. Two other vertebrae, L 2 and L 3, are fused on the left-hand side through a bony bridge. Several thoracic and lumbar vertebrae present syndesmophytes, but without vertebral fusion. Marked bone spurs at the insertion of the ligamenta flava are also visible. Intervertebral disks and articular surfaces are normal. Ligament and tendon attachments of the appendicular skeleton show enthesopathies, in particular at the level of clavicles, humeri, ulnae, radii, coxal bones, femurs, patellae, tibiae and calcanei. A diffuse and severe arthritis affecting the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and the great joints is also visible. For Ferdinand I, the historic documentation attests that he suffered from many acute attacks of gout, generally of the left foot, typically positioned in the big toe, from the age of 33 until death. The first attack seems to have been dated back to 1582, when Ferdinand wrote to his brother, the Grand Duke Francesco I, referring that he was confined to bed or chair because of “…some catarrh has fallen down to my left foot. By God’s grace, may it not be podagra!”. In 1591 the court physician Giulio Angeli accurately describes a typical gout attack: “yesterday the gout started to pinch the big toe of the Grand Duke’s left foot and then continued to advance rapidly! Overnight the toe has become swollen, inflamed and painful”. The crises afflicted the Grand Duke also in the following years; furthermore, he started to become obese at the age of 41 [1]. The paleopathological investigation carried out on the skeleton of Ferdinand I reveals pathological features similar to those observed in his father. The vertebral bodies from T 5 to T 11 are fused in a unique block for the ossification of the right anterior ligament, conferring the typical aspect of a “candle wax” to this spine segment. The body of several cervical and thoracic vertebrae presents partial ossification of the right anterior ligament, but with no formation of bony bridges between the vertebrae. The intervertebral spaces and the apophyseal joints are normal. Ossifications of ligamenta flava, interspinal and supraspinal ligament insertions are largely present. The extra-spinal ligaments show massive hyperostotic changes. Enthesopathies were present at the muscular insertion of clavicles, scapulae, humeri, ulnae, coxal bones, femurs, patellae, tibiae and calcanei. The thyroid cartilage and the epiglottis are ossified and well preserved. Large rough bilateral calcifications of the sterno-costal cartilages of the first and of the last ribs are present, leading to a sternum with multiple ribs attached. Ferdinand I was affected by diffuse osteoarthritis, involving not only the spine and major joints, but also several articulations of his hands and feet. Furthermore, the skeleton of Ferdinand shows a peculiar lesion in the left foot. The interphalangeal joint of the big toe presents cavitations, erosions and osteophytic margins. At the peri-articular and articular surface of the joint a “scooped-out” defect, with partial destruction of the sub-chondral plate, is also visible. X-ray examination reveals an evident sclerotic margin, which involves both bones of the joint. The changes observed in Cosimo I and Ferdinand I meet the standard major criteria established for the diagnosis of DISH (Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis) [3]. Both skeletons showed hyperostosis of the column, with the involvement of at least three contiguous vertebrae in Cosimo I, and up to seven vertebrae in Ferdinand. Such changes were limited to the right side of the thoracic segment and diffuse ossifications of the articular ligaments and entheses. Features often associated with DISH, such as hyperostosis frontalis interna, ossification of the neck and rib cartilages and massive osteoarthritis, confirm the diagnosis. The lack of evidence of these diseases in the written sources may be due to the fact that, despite the dramatic radiological aspect, DISH is generally asymptomatic, as its manifestations are limited to back stiffness and mild pain. Paleopathological literature has reported several cases of DISH from different geographical sites and different periods [4, 5]. The aetiology of this condition remains uncertain, but has been related to various metabolic disorders, in particular obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. Recent studies have highlighted a link between the incidence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and high social status, with particular regard to life style and nutritional patterns. A palaeonutritional study performed recently on the Medici Grand Dukes and their families confirmed the written sources. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis revealed a diet very rich in meat, as demonstrated by the δ 15 N high values at the level of the carnivores. The δ 13 C values, related to the consumption of fish, revealed an intake of marine proteins at 14 - 30 % [6]. The present study seems to further confirm the association between DISH and elite status. Among the five individuals belonging to the Medici family of more than 40 years of age that have been studied so far, two were affected by DISH. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning the case of Cosimo “the Elder” (1389 - 1464), whose remains showed the stigmata of this condition as well [7]. Despite the narrowness of the sample, the high incidence of DISH in the Medici family is remarkable and a significant life style indicator, supporting the link between social status and risk of developing DISH in mature age. Furthermore, the case of Ferdinand I is of particular interest for the diagnosis of gout, of which very little evidence has been found in palaeopathology [8]. An alimentation rich in animal proteins, as attested by the palaeonutritional investigation carried out on the Medici family [6], may have favoured the onset of this disease. An association with obesity, diabetes and hyperinsulinemia is ascertained [9]. Modern clinical studies report a significant association between diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and gout [10]. As the aetiology of DISH has also been related to obesity and hyperinsulinemia, it has been proposed that the link factor between these two rheumatic diseases could be hyperinsulinemia, possibly related to obesity. Not only do the typical skeletal and radiological features observed in the bone remains of Ferdinand I confirm the data reported by the written sources regarding the arthritic left foot gout which affected the Grand Duke, but this represents the first documentation of the coexistence between diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and gout attested in palaeopathological literature.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this thesis project was to {{investigate}} the role of mitochondria (MT) in the very early pathogenesis of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) and to test mitoprotection as a strategy to prevent chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration after cartilage injury. 	Ankle sprain is the most common athletic injury, and {{the most common cause of}} end-stage ankle osteoarthritis (OA). Evidence suggests that the magnitude of the initial cartilage/subchondral bone injury is the most important factor in the development of sprain-associated PTOA. However, most PTOA models utilize the knee and rely on joint destabilization or intraarticular fracture to initiate disease. These models cause rapid progression of cartilage pathology with severe synovitis and do not reflect the likely etiology of ankle PTOA resulting from a high-speed impact injury. Therefore, the first aim of this dissertation research was to develop a clinically relevant large animal model of impact-induced talocrural (ankle) PTOA. A minimally invasive surgical approach was used to apply rapid impact injuries to the equine talus. Twelve weeks after injury, the severity of cartilage lesions was positively correlated to peak impact stress. The significance of this work is that it allows us to directly link in vitro mechanistic studies to in vivo longitudinal studies of disease development, using the same impact system. This model will also allow preclinical testing of disease modifying OA drugs. 	The second aim of this thesis was to study MT function of chondrocytes within their native extracellular matrix immediately following a single, rapid impact, which simulates an injury expected to initiate PTOA in vivo. Fresh cartilage explants were subjected to injury at varying stress rates. MT respiratory rate and control were assessed by microrespirometry. Functional integrity of the inner MT membrane was investigated using polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes on confocal microscopy. We found that injury resulted in decreased basal and maximal chondrocyte respiration as well as MT depolarization within hours of cartilage impact, indicating that MT dysfunction is an <b>acute</b> response of <b>articular</b> cartilage to injury. The response of chondrocytes differed between two areas of the same joint; chondrocytes from a non-weight bearing articular surface (the distal patellofemoral groove) were more sensitive to MT dysfunction and chondrocyte death than the main weight-bearing surface of the knee (the medial femoral condyle), indicating regional differences in mechanotransduction. These findings suggest that MT may represent an early therapeutic target in the prevention of PTOA. 	The third aim of this thesis work was therefore to investigate mitoprotection as a strategy to prevent chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration in vitro. SS- 31 is a highly targeted peptide antioxidant that prevents MT respiratory dysfunction, MT-mediated apoptosis, and ROS production by stabilizing the MT-specific phospholipid cardiolipin. Cartilage was injured, then treated with SS- 31 at 0, 1, or 6 hours after injury, and cultured for 1 week. We found that SS- 31 prevented impact induced chondrocyte death, apoptosis, and cartilage matrix degradation at 1 day and 1 week after injury. Our findings indicate that mitoprotective therapy within 6 hours after joint injury may be a useful strategy to prevent PTOA. 2018 - 02 - 0...|$|R
