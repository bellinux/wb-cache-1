25|$|Her {{recapture}} {{gave rise}} to a court case over whether Georgiana and her cargo were <b>a</b> <b>prize,</b> or salvage. The High Court of Admiralty ruled for salvage for the cargo, but <b>a</b> <b>prize</b> for the <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{answered}} Don Juan, with an unmoved air {{and great}} politeness of manner, [...] "though {{it would be}} out of my power to satisfy you. Everything was lost in the schooner, and I have not a paper of any sort to show you. If it be your pleasure to make <b>a</b> <b>prize</b> of <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> in this situation, certainly it is in your power to do it. A few barrels of wet flour are scarce worth disputing about." ...|$|R
2500|$|The action {{took two}} and a half hours, during which the British {{suffered}} three wounded, one of whom died later. Manly, which had 94 men, suffered five killed and six wounded. She was under the command of Captain-Lieutenant J.W. Heneyman (or Heeneman) of the Dutch Navy. During her cruise she had taken one small <b>prize,</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> sailing from Embden to England with a cargo of oats. Manley [...] arrived in the Humber on 6 January.|$|R
5000|$|Soon afterwards, Manley divided his squadron, keeping Lynch and Lee with Hancock. On the {{afternoon}} of 2 April, they sighted the brig Elizabeth. This <b>prize,</b> <b>an</b> American <b>vessel</b> captured by the British the previous October, was filled with loot plundered from the warehouses of patriot Bostonian merchants and carried a number of Tory refugees. Many of the Tories were transferred to Lee, while their leaders were taken on board Hancock, and the captive crew imprisoned in Lynch, which accompanied Hancock into Portsmouth.|$|R
5000|$|This {{suggests}} that British vessels were undermanned, {{and had some}} guns removed since she was reported with only four 2 1/2-lbs guns. one 1 1/2 lbs and her swivels as <b>a</b> <b>prize.</b> The British <b>vessel</b> was only recently advised {{of the state of}} war with Spain, and the American captain used a [...] "strategem" [...] to approach her within a few days of the declaration of war. Overhauling the West Florida, Pickles ordered her to surrender. The English captain, Payne, laughed at him. Shots were exchanged simultaneously. Account of the action suggests the British crew put up a significant resistance and surrendered only after her commander, Lieutenant John Payne, was mortally wounded in the performance of his duty in defending his command.|$|R
2500|$|The pirate's {{characteristic}} loot included various ships' cargo like slaves or tobacco. There {{were also}} very unconventional trophies, {{such as the}} wig of a captured captain that the famed pirate Walter Kennedy once took as booty. The most sought after prize that pirates wanted to capture was, unquestionably, a ship, an ocean vessel that pirates could convert to suit their own needs. Pirates would scrape a captured ship for guns, masts, rope, and other supplies that could repair or improve their current vessel. Whereas capturing a ship that was more equipped and more powerful than their current craft was the ultimate prize, the issue was that [...] "the pirate could only capture <b>a</b> <b>prize</b> which his <b>vessel</b> could catch." [...] A faster, larger ship with quality weaponry indicated that the pirate could capture other treasures more easily.|$|R
5000|$|Read {{was soon}} ordered to Mobile, Alabama and was {{assigned}} to the [...] which set sail on 15 January 1863. He transferred to the , <b>a</b> captured <b>prize</b> of the Florida, and set out on his own. During this raiding mission, which lasted from 6 June 1863 to 27 June 1863, Read transferred his command to <b>prize</b> <b>vessels</b> twice more, once to the [...] and finally to the [...]|$|R
5000|$|Another special type is the Panathenaic prize amphora, with black-figure decoration, {{produced}} exclusively as <b>prize</b> <b>vessels</b> for the Panathenaia {{and retaining}} the black-figure technique for centuries after {{the introduction of}} red-figure vase painting. Some examples bear the inscription [...] "ΤΩΝ ΑΘΗΝΗΘΕΝ ΑΘΛΩΝ" [...] meaning [...] "am one of the prizes from goddess Athena" [...] (these amphorae contained oil from the sacred olive tree of goddess Athena as <b>a</b> <b>prize</b> to {{the winners of the}} athletic contests held to honour the goddess). Those amphorae depicted goddess Athena on one side (as seen on the second image on this page) and the athletic event on the other side, e.g. a scene of wrestling or running contest etc.|$|R
25|$|Pirates had {{a system}} of {{hierarchy}} on board their ships determining how captured money was distributed. However, pirates were more egalitarian than any other area of employment at the time. In fact, pirate quartermasters were a counterbalance to the captain and {{had the power to}} veto his orders. The majority of plunder was in the form of cargo and ship's equipment with medicines the most highly <b>prized.</b> <b>A</b> <b>vessel's</b> doctor's chest would be worth anywhere from £300 to £400, or around $470,000 in today's values. Jewels were common plunder but not popular as they were hard to sell, and pirates, unlike the public of today, had little concept of their value. There is one case recorded where a pirate was given a large diamond worth a great deal more than the value of the handful of small diamonds given to his crewmates as a share. He felt cheated and had it broken up to match what they received.|$|R
50|$|The {{last major}} fight between Danish and British {{warships}} {{took place on}} 6 July 1812 during the Battle of Lyngør, when a small squadron of British warships met a small squadron of Danish warships at Lyngør on the Norwegian coast. The British withdrew after destroying the Danish frigate Najaden. On 2 August the same year, boats of , which was {{under the command of}} Captain Lord George Stuart, captured two Danish vessels, under the command of Lieutenant Hans Buderhof, and their <b>prize,</b> <b>an</b> American <b>vessel</b> of about 400 tons burthen (bm). The two Danish vessels were schooner No. 114 (of six 6-pounders and 30 men), and cutter No. 97 (of four 6-pounders and 22 men). In the action the British lost nine men killed and 16 wounded, of whom two died of their wounds; the Danes lost ten men killed and 13 wounded.|$|R
50|$|Although they {{retrieved}} some {{supplies and}} destroyed others at Chestnut Neck, the British and American Loyalists {{were not able}} to capture any of the American privateers or recapture any of the <b>prize</b> <b>vessels</b> present in the area.|$|R
5000|$|Velocity {{joined the}} West Gulf Blockading Squadron {{shortly after her}} acquisition, {{deploying}} with the blockade off Sabine Pass. There, on 25 November, she assisted Kensington, Rachel Seaman, and another <b>prize</b> <b>vessel,</b> Dan, in the capture of the British schooner Maria and the Confederate schooner Course.|$|R
50|$|It {{would be}} during Mayo’s {{command of the}} squadron, on November 3, 1853, that Constitution would capture the last <b>prize</b> <b>vessel</b> taken by her in combat. That was the H.N. Gambrill, a {{schooner}} with no slaves aboard. It {{would be the only}} action of Mayo’s 2 year command of the squadron.|$|R
50|$|Automedon was sunk at 15:07. Rogge soon {{realised}} {{the importance}} of the intelligence material he had captured and quickly transferred the documents to the recently acquired <b>prize</b> <b>vessel</b> Ole Jacob, ordering Lieutenant Commander Paul Kamenz and six of his crew to take charge of the vessel. After an uneventful voyage they arrived in Kobe, Japan, on 4 December 1940.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the small}} naval force began {{to return to}} port with <b>prize</b> <b>vessels,</b> Washington became {{concerned}} that the Beverly base would gain {{the attention of the}} British. [...] In December 1775, Washington dispatched the Marblehead Regiment from Cambridge to fortify and defend Beverly. [...] By mid-1776 Beverly Harbor was protected by five separate forts, with the 14th Continental responsible for much of the task of defending them.|$|R
50|$|Herndon {{spent the}} fall and winter escorting Japanese <b>prize</b> <b>vessels</b> along the coast, patrolling the Korean and China coasts, and {{assisting}} the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and the movement of Chinese Nationalist troops. On 5 December 1945 she was detached from this duty to participate in Operation Magic Carpet, the transfer of troops from the Pacific to the United States, and reached San Diego via Shanghai, Eniwetok, Okinawa, and Pearl Harbor on 27 December. After disembarking some of the troops, Herndon continued on to New York with the rest, arriving 15 January 1946.|$|R
2500|$|On 2 October, the Juliana, out of Liverpool had {{encountered}} and driven off a French privateer 200 {{miles west of}} Scilly. [...] The next day, Juliana spotted a brig, and after closing on her under a French flag, raised the English flag and boarded her. Suspicious because her captain was carrying several different sets of papers, Captain Bibby of the Juliana planned to take her into Liverpool. Mutine {{arrived on the scene}} in the evening, and after ascertaining the situation, Captain Stewart took over the <b>prize</b> <b>vessel,</b> by now identified as the Joannah, and put his own crew aboard her.|$|R
50|$|The privateers {{took many}} of these {{captured}} ships to small harbours along the northern coast of Saint-Domingue. There the privateers thought they and their prizes would be safe from the British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, which based at Môle-Saint-Nicolas. In early April 1797, the French civilian governors at the capital of Cap-Français on the Northeastern coast insisted that these vessels come to the capital; the governors ordered the French frigate Harmonie, based in the port, to sail to Port-de-Paix and back, collecting all <b>prize</b> <b>vessels</b> that lay in harbour there and at {{the nearby town of}} Jean-Rabel.|$|R

60|$|It {{was with}} great {{satisfaction}} Washington learned that Admiral de Barras had anticipated his wishes, in sending transports and <b>prize</b> <b>vessels</b> up the bay {{to assist in}} bringing on the French troops. In the meantime, he with Count de Rochambeau was desirous of having {{an interview with the}} admiral on board of his ship, provided he could send some fast-sailing cutter to receive them. A small ship, the Queen Charlotte, was furnished by the admiral for the purpose. It had been captured on its voyage from Charleston to New York, having Lord Rawdon on board, and had been commodiously fitted up for his lordship's reception.|$|R

50|$|Other {{sources of}} income {{have been used in}} the past. At one time a small {{percentage}} of the Prize Money awarded for the capture of enemy war ships and pirate vessels, was awarded to the Naval Home Trust Fund. A notation in the “Congressional Record for the Navy Affairs Committee” in 1907-09 notes that the Naval Home Trust still had a balance of $14,000,000 partly from the capture of <b>Prize</b> <b>Vessels,</b> per <b>an</b> Act of 1870, and from suits for depredation of timber belonging to the United States.
