If they are losing, it is because they're doing something wrong. Poker is skill, it isn't luck. In the long run, day <b>after</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>day,</b> you cannot get lucky all the time." [...] In the book Deal Me In, Giang said [...] "Poker is a game of skill with an element of luck, not a game of luck with an element of skill." [...] He discusses how he lost his twenty million dollar bankroll playing craps, a game of luck. He says nowadays he gets a physical revulsion when he goes near a game of craps, or any game of dice. He believes that if he sticks to poker, he will always make money in the long run.|$|E

40|$|Allegations about money-laundering {{by former}} President Chen Shui-bian, his relatives, and his acquaintances have been front page news for three weeks, and, on some TV stations, occupy the first 30 - 40 {{minutes of the}} news hour. As might be imagined, {{this is also a}} hot topic on the {{political}} talk shows, day <b>after</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>day.</b> New reports continue to surface about alleged improprieties, ranging from misusing government funds, to opening shady accounts in Swiss banks and tax havens like Liechtenstein and Aruba, to buying mansions and other properties in the U. S. The media hounds are now hot on the chase of Chen’s daughter (Chen Hsing-yu 陳幸妤), trying to goad her into outbursts that play well on the evening news and YouTube. Is the fact that Taiwan’s former president is suspected of corruption newsworthy? Obviously. Do these allegations merit a thorough investigation? Definitely. If the evidence warrants it, should indictments be filed? Unquestionably. Is this the most pressing issue facing Taiwan? That’s another matter entirely. To a certain extent, the saturation reporting of the Chen story reminds one of the second of Sunzi 孫子’s Thirty-six Stratagems (三十六計), namely “Besieging Wei to Rescue Zhao” (圍魏救趙), which is based on events during the Warring States Era, when the Qi general Sun Bin 孫臏 (d. 316 BCE; considered a descendent of Sunzi) attacked the Wei capital of Daliang in order to distract Wei troops from the siege of the Zhao capital of Handan (the exhausted Wei army was eventually ambushed and defeated).

Nitrogen applied at or before 18 days caused the greatest increase in weight, while application of nitrogen between 6 and 12 days most likely coincides with tuber initiation.
