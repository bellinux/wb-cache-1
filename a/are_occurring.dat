Similar to many towns in the Texas Panhandle, the city's downtown has suffered economic deterioration throughout the years. To help revitalize it, the organization Center City of Amarillo was formed to establish partnerships with groups who have a large presence in the city. Since its conception in the 1990s, Center City has sponsored public art projects and started block parties in the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events <b>are</b> <b>occurring</b> in his mind {{suffered}} from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing {{the location of the}} basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of Ex-press glaucoma filtration device implantation under scleral flap for traumatic glaucoma. METHODS: Totally 19 eyes of 19 patients with traumatic glaucoma were implanted with Ex-press glaucoma filtration device under the scleral flap from December 2012 to May 2013. The postoperative visual acuity, anterior chamber depth and hyphema,intraocular pressure(IOP), filtering bleb and other complications were observed and summarized. RESULTS: Ex-press glaucoma filtration device were implanted successfully in 19 patients. At 1 d postoperatively shallow anterior chamber <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 2 eyes and hyphema <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 3 eyes. At 3 mo postoperatively increased vision <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 9 eyes(47 %),functional filtering bleb <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 18 eyes(95 %),and IOP was 12. 1 ± 6. 1 mmHg.
