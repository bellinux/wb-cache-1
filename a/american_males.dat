5|$|On {{the episode}} of Nitro after Fall Brawl, Riggs and Bagwell won the World Tag Team Championship after {{defeating}} then-champions Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) in an upset win in an impromptu match. The <b>American</b> <b>Males</b> {{had been scheduled}} to face The Blue Bloods, but Harlem Heat attacked both members of the Blue Bloods prior to the match and volunteered to take their place. As champions, the pair defeated Harlem Heat and the team of Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. However, Bagwell and Riggs lost the titles back to Harlem Heat one week later on Saturday Night. The <b>American</b> <b>Males</b> remained top challengers for the title belts for the rest of 1995 but were unable to regain the championship from Harlem Heat.|$|E
5|$|The homeless, {{who were}} by {{majority}} South and Central <b>American</b> <b>males,</b> {{said that they}} came into the area from their respective countries in promise of work. A particular individual who was interviewed said that the work he was told about had only been short term and, along {{with many of the}} others, had nowhere else to go. Most who had been approached about relocation into nearby homeless shelters express their hesitation to leave the Grove Church Cemetery grounds, fearful that they would lose the freedom they had on the public property. Measures were taken to remove and clean up the cemetery, and it is believed that while some may have entered into shelters, others likely still reside in the general area, while some had moved into the wooded eastern side of the Palisades hills in Union City, where many shacks can be seen supporting the homeless.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that black <b>American</b> <b>males</b> have the {{shortest}} lifespans of any {{group of people in}} the US, averaging only 69 years (Asian-American females average the longest). This reflects overall poorer health and greater prevalence of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer among black American men.|$|E
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study examined African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> secondary principals' beliefs, values, and leadership practices {{that contribute to}} successful urban schools. Narrative inquiry was used to investigate the factors that influenced the leadership practices [...] and related education environment success [...] of six African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> public school principals from six different secondary urban schools in Ohio. Findings related to participant input led to three primary conclusions: (a) effective African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> principals address broad social and systemic issues that affect student education and performance; (b) effective African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> principals employ an integrated leadership style; and (c) effective African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> principals embrace the dualism of bureaucrat-administrator and ethno-humanist roles. These findings highlight several implications for consideration: (a) social and systemic issues severely distract African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> urban school leaders from their educational focus; (b) attention needs {{to be given to}} the critical dual role of African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> principals; and (c) focus needs to be directed toward developing and then hiring qualified African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> principals...|$|R
40|$|Educational {{and public}} {{narratives}} on the achievement outcomes of Black boys in mathematics {{are too often}} negative. Contrary to these negative narratives, however, research affirms positive outcomes for students, including Black boys, when engaged in caring teacher–student relationships (see, e. g., Bartell, 2011; Roberts, 2009; Steele, 1992). Considering the growing importance of mathematics both nationally and globally, {{an investigation into the}} benefits of such caring relationship is important. But literature specific to caring teacher−student relationships, African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students, and mathematics teaching and learning is all but nonexistent. For this reason, I sought to uncover the definition that African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students had of teacher care, and how, if at all, an African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> teacher might influence their perceptions of teacher care. Additionally, I was intrigued with and wished to uncover any influence an African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> teacher might have on African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students’ attitudes toward mathematics. The purpose of this qualitative study, therefore, was to explore the influence a “successful” African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> teacher had on three African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students’ perceptions of teacher care and their attitudes toward mathematics. This critical ethnography was guided by an intersection of an eclectic array of theoretical traditions (Stinson, 2009), including care theory (e. g., Gilligan, 1982; Noddings, 1992), critical race theory (e. g., Ladson-Billings, 1998), and culturally relevant pedagogy (e. g., Ladson-Billings, 1992). This eclectic array aligned with both the philosophical foundations of the project and the methodological procedures employed. The project used ethnographic methods—specifically, participant observations and semi-structured interviews—during data collection. Data analysis identified six overarching themes that the participants used to describe teacher care: (a) motivation, (b) culture, (c) confidence, (d) discipline, (e) concern for futures, and (f) environment. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} teachers should reconsider the ways they care for African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students, specifically, in the mathematics classroom, and that a caring teacher–student relationship has a positive influence on African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students’ attitudes toward mathematics as well as their descriptions and perceptions of teacher care...|$|R

25|$|With {{passage of}} the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (which outlawed slavery), the 14th Amendment (which granted full U.S. {{citizenship}} to African Americans) and the 15th amendment (which extended {{the right to vote}} to African <b>American</b> <b>males),</b> African Americans in the South were made free citizens and were given the right to vote. Under Federal protection, white and black Republicans formed constitutional conventions and state governments. Among their accomplishments were creating the first public education systems in Southern states, and providing for welfare through orphanages, hospitals and similar institutions.|$|E
25|$|After two trials, BiDil was {{licensed}} {{exclusively for}} use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African Americans than in other groups, but merely {{that it was more}} effective in African Americans than other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African <b>American</b> <b>males,</b> but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{esophageal cancer}} is the seventh-leading {{cause of cancer death}} among males (making up 4% of the total). The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} there were about 18,000 new cases and more than 15,000 deaths from esophageal cancer in 2013 (the American Cancer Society estimated that during 2014, about 18,170 new esophageal cancer cases would be diagnosed, resulting in 15,450 deaths). The squamous-cell carcinoma type is more common among African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> with a history of heavy smoking or alcohol use. Until the 1970s, squamous-cell carcinoma accounted {{for the vast majority of}} esophageal cancers in the United States. In recent decades, incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (which is associated with Barrett's esophagus) steadily rose in the United States to the point that it has now surpassed squamous-cell carcinoma. In contrast to squamous-cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma is more common in Caucasian men (over the age of 60) than it is in African Americans. Multiple reports indicate esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence has increased during the past 20 years, especially in non-Hispanic white men. Esophageal adenocarcinoma age-adjusted incidence increased in New Mexico from 1973 to 1997. This increase was found in non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics and became predominant in non-Hispanic whites. Esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rates for African Americans continue to be higher than the rate for Causasians. However, incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer has significantly decreased among African Americans since the early 1980s, whereas with Caucasians it has continued to increase. Between 1975 and 2004, incidence of the adenocarcinoma type increased among white <b>American</b> <b>males</b> by over 460% and among white American females by 335%.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, {{following}} passage of {{federal civil rights}} legislation in the mid-1960s and enforcement of constitutional rights by the federal government, {{the influence of the}} Councils had waned considerably yet remained an institutional basis for the majority of white residents in Mississippi. The successor organization to the White Citizens' Councils is the St. Louis-based Council of Conservative Citizens, founded in 1985 to continue collaborations between Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist political agendas in the United States. Republican politician and past Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was a member while North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms and Georgia Congressman Bob Barr were both strong supporters of the Council of Conservative Citizens; David Duke also spoke at a fund raising event, while Patrick Buchanan's campaign manager was linked to both Duke and the Council. In 1996, a Charleston, SC, drive-by shooting by Klan members of three African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> occurred after a Council rally; Dylann Roof, responsible for the 2015 murder of nine Emanuel AME church members in Charleston, espoused Council of Conservative Citizens rhetoric in a manifesto.|$|E
25|$|Crowds {{began to}} gather on Superior Avenue {{almost as soon}} as the {{shooting}} started. Superior Avenue is a major city thoroughfare which also carries U.S. Route 6. As police vehicles began racing down Superior Avenue to reach E. 120th Street, E. 123rd Street, Lakeview Road, and E. 124th Street, the crowd began throwing rocks at police and jeering them. At 9:15 PM, Mayor Stokes called Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes to inform him that a riot in Cleveland was likely. The governor called Major General Sylvester Del Corso, Adjutant General of the Ohio Army National Guard, and had the National Guard placed on alert. By 9:30 PM, the crowd numbered close to a thousand, mostly young adult, teenage, and pre-adolescent African <b>American</b> <b>males.</b> About this time, the Glenville riots broke out. A Molotov cocktail hit a marked police vehicle, causing it to burst into flames. A commercial panel truck, driving down Superior Avenue, was stopped by the crowd, the white driver brutally beaten, and the truck overturned and set afire. A black Cleveland Police officer, Herbert Reed, was pulled from his vehicle and savagely beaten. Two television news vehicles were also set aflame.|$|E
