25|$|The graph {{isomorphism}} {{problem is}} the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, but {{it is believed that}} the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to László Babai and Eugene Luks, has run time 2O(√nlog(n)) for graphs with n vertices.|$|E
25|$|The D-Wave 2X system hosted at NASA Ames Research Center {{has been}} {{recently}} {{used for the}} learning of a special class of restricted Boltzmann machines that {{can serve as a}} building block for deep learning architectures. Complementary work that appeared roughly simultaneously showed that quantum annealing can be used for supervised learning in classification tasks. The same device was later used to train a fully connected Boltzmann machine to generate, reconstruct, and classify down-scaled, low-resolution handwritten digits, among other synthetic datasets. In both cases, the models trained by quantum annealing had a similar or better performance in terms of quality. The ultimate question that drives this endeavour is whether there is quantum speedup in sampling applications.

The idea of cultural openness is illustrated by the character of Tirio Actamo: once a well-known citizen of Ansul who was taken to be the concubine of the Gand, she then wins his love and uses her position to bring about an end to the conflict. Scholar Marek Oziewicz identified the story as critiquing the notion of retributive justice, considered the norm in Western societies, and instead supporting the idea of restorative justice. The protagonists of Voices succeed in [...] "making things right" [...] without punitive action. According to Oziewicz, the central question of the story is one that Memer asks the Oracle: [...] "How can we be free of the Alds?" [...] The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a bloody revolution, but a compromise, possible because both parties are willing to recognize and end the conflict. Desac symbolizes the idea of retributive action, which is more emotionally satisfying but ultimately unsuccessful, while Orrec offers the more difficult, but successful method.|$|E

500|$|The novel's format, {{its various}} {{multiple}} sources, its manipulation of linear time and its inclusion of supernatural elements (talking dogs and meteor rifles, for example) all serve to deconstruct {{the idea of}} absolute power, by creating an ambiguity between fact and myth, between Dr Francia and the Supreme, and between Roa Bastos and the Compiler. Francia places himself above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet in the Compiler's notes and retelling of events, the novel {{is presented as a}} genuine version of history, one that contradicts and questions the Supreme's. In their collectivity, they deny the illusion of absolute power, whether the power is that of Francia the dictator or Roa Bastos the writer. This ambiguity between myth and fact is elaborated on {{at the end of the}} novel in the fictional debate over the Supreme's remains; it questions the nature of national political myth, and how heroes and villains are created in it and where the Supreme falls into those categories after being portrayed as both by Roa Bastos. As Deiner poses the question raised by the novel, [...] "Is he to be portrayed as a valiant leader who held the country together in the face of enormous external aggression, or as a despot who laid the basis for almost two centuries of exploitation of Paraguay’s peoples by its leaders?" [...] The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> so much of importance to the novel, so much as the fact that the question itself exists, thereby confirming the power of writing over so called [...] "absolute" [...] power.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2007, a New York Times op-ed {{article by}} April DeConick {{asserted}} that the National Geographics translation is badly flawed: For example, in one instance the National Geographic transcription refers to Judas as a [...] "daimon," [...] which the society’s experts have translated as [...] "spirit." [...] However, the universally accepted word for [...] "spirit" [...] is [...] "pneuma" [...] — in Gnostic literature [...] "daimon" [...] is always taken to mean [...] "demon." [...] The National Geographic Society responded that [...] "Virtually all issues April D. DeConick raises about translation choices are addressed in footnotes in both the popular and critical editions." [...] In a later review of the issues and relevant publications, critic Joan Acocella questioned whether ulterior intentions had not begun to supersede historical analysis, e.g., whether publication of The Gospel of Judas could {{be an attempt to}} roll back ancient anti-semitic imputations. She concluded that the ongoing clash between scriptural fundamentalism and attempts at revision were childish because of the unreliability of the sources. Therefore, she argued, [...] "People interpret, and cheat. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to fix the Bible but to fix ourselves."

2500|$|Online {{publication}} NewMusicBox—which normally covers new American music {{outside the}} commercial mainstream—argued that the Beach Boys could never earn themselves [...] "the same {{pride of place}} in American music history held by other great innovators" [...] because of their mistaken reputation as a [...] "light-hearted party band that drooled over California Girls while on a Surfing Safari," [...] hampered not only by the over-saturation of their early songs being used in film, commercials, and other media, but also [...] "...their latter-day cover-band-version-of-their-former-selves concert appearances." [...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison contests that the group produced work that could [...] "almost" [...] be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, [...] "The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces." [...] While the group [...] "went into the great void beyond", such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: [...] "What influences could these innovations then have? The short <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> <b>not</b> much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. … It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation.
