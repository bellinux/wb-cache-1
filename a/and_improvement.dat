5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight {{services}} and concentrate on the electrification <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> of the core routes in London.

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project.

5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology.

A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Open-air cages {{installed}} in the Monkey House resulted in a dramatic improvement in the life expectancy of its residents, but the potential for expansion <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> after the First World War was limited by the post-war economy. Rising labour costs and minimal profits resulted in the gardens' increasing dilapidation. The zoo began to be neglected after the sale of Belle Vue in 1925, but it was rejuvenated by the appointment of Gerald Iles as zoo superintendent in 1933. A new Gibbon Cage and Monkey Mountain were created and the Reptile House was extended.|$|E
