5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Ralph Friedgen {{took over}} <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> {{team that had}} one winning season in the past decade, and led them to an ACC {{championship}} and a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game in his first season. In the following two years, Friedgen became the only ACC head coach to have led his team to win ten games {{in each of his}} first three seasons. In his ten-year tenure, Friedgen led the Terrapins to seven bowl appearances. Most recently, Maryland concluded the 2010 season with a 9-4 record, a win in the Military Bowl, and a top 25 national ranking.|$|E

Faloney finished {{fourth in the}} running and received 258 points, behind Notre Dame's John Lattner (1,850), Minnesota's Paul Giel (1,794), and UCLA's Paul Cameron (444). Stan Jones was selected as a consensus first-team All-American. Bernie Faloney was also named a first-team All-American. Chet Hanulak was named a second-team All-American. Four Terrapins were named to the All-ACC first-team: John Bowersox, Bernie Faloney, Chester Hanulak, and Stan Jones. Three were named to the All-ACC second-team: Ralph Felton, Bob Morgan, and Bill Walker.|$|E
5|$|Mark Vogel, <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> {{real estate}} agent, {{purchased}} both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs Racetrack in 1987 for $6 {{million in cash}} plus $5.5 million in debt. Rosecroft was awarded another Breeders Crown race in 1988, making it their fifth straight—but final—year of hosting them. Vogel had three main goals when he became owner: to construct a $10 million grandstand, simulcast Rosecroft races at other racetracks throughout Maryland to attract a larger market, and have more racing days. In 1989, Vogel purchased Freestate Raceway. Freestate was sold to a development firm the next year, and Rosecroft was awarded more racing days.|$|E
5|$|Maryland next {{traveled}} to South Carolina {{to face a}} team coming off of a four-game winning streak. Ralph Felton scored first to cap a long drive with a short rush. In the next series, the Gamecocks punted it away and the ball was returned by Hanulak 35 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, South Carolina recovered <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> fumble on the Terrapins' 14-yard line. In three plays, Maryland had pushed {{them back to the}} 32-yard line before South Carolina finally scored. With South Carolina held to 37 rushing yards the final result was 24–6.|$|E

5|$|The teams {{met again}} in 1950 when Navy had a last-minute opening in its schedule. The Terrapins won three {{consecutive}} games from 1950 to 1952, and the Midshipmen won three from 1958 to 1963. During the 1964 game, <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> player twice flashed an obscene gesture, which prompted Navy {{to cancel the}} series again. After contractual obligations were fulfilled with the following year's game, the series was put on hiatus for 40 years. Maryland and Navy finally resumed the rivalry in 2005 and again in 2010, with the Terps winning both contests.|$|E

5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} an AP Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid. The second loss dropped them out of the AP Poll {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1973, Agnew was {{investigated}} by the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland on suspicion of conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax fraud. Agnew had accepted payments from contractors during his time as <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> official, and the payments had continued into his time as vice president. After denying his guilt for months, Agnew negotiated a plea agreement that would involve his resignation from office. On October 10, 1973, Agnew pled no contest to a single felony charge of tax evasion, resigned his office, {{and was replaced by}} House Minority Leader Gerald Ford. Agnew spent the remainder of his life quietly, rarely making public appearances. He wrote a novel, and also a memoir defending his actions. He died in 1996.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{attempts}} to both ban and legalize same-sex marriage {{did not pass}} through the legislature. After <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> House of Delegates committee voted in March 2004 to reject a pair of marriage bills that would have submitted a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage to voters and invalidated same-sex marriages performed in another state or foreign country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Equality Maryland filed a lawsuit, Deane & Polyak v. Conaway, to challenge the existing law on behalf of nine same-sex couples and one bereaved man whose partner had died. The lead plaintiffs, from whom the case received its name, were Gita Deane, a learning specialist at Goucher College, and her partner Lisa Polyak, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Army Medical Department. The plaintiffs had applied for marriage licenses in several different Maryland counties but were denied by court officials. In their complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the state's statutory ban on same-sex marriage violated constitutional protections of due process, equality, and prohibitions against sex discrimination in Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, {{former coach}} and quarterback William Skinner {{helped lead the}} {{formation}} of the Maryland Intercollegiate Football Association (MIFA) in order to improve the process of naming the state champions. Other teams involved included Baltimore City College, Gallaudet, Johns Hopkins, Washington College, and Western Maryland. The game against St. John's once again aroused controversy, and the MAC accused their opponent of hiring s from Lehigh. When Johns Hopkins canceled their game, Maryland arranged to play Georgetown instead. The Maryland team called the game with a 6–4 lead as darkness fell. However, the referee, Georgetown halfback Mike Mahoney, ruled it a forfeiture and awarded the win to Georgetown. Today, Maryland and Georgetown both count the game as <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> Agricultural win in their records.|$|E
5|$|States sent Union regiments {{south in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, attacked Union troops who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. John Merryman, <b>a</b> <b>Maryland</b> official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, Roger B. Taney, author of the controversial pro-slavery Dred Scott opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus, and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.|$|E
