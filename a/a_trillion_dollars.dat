2500|$|In {{terms of}} the {{macroeconomic}} impact of the gas crisis, the Committee relied heavily upon State Treasury forecasts provided during its inquiry, including that [...] "the June 2008 disruption in gas supplies... is expected to cost the Western Australian economy around $2 billion in Gross State Product (GSP) terms, with roughly half of this impact {{in each of the}} June and September quarters of 2008. This translates to approximately a 0.5 percentage point reduction in estimated GSP growth in 2007-08, from 7.5% at budget-time to 7.0%." [...] The report refers to the Reserve Bank's modelling of the national impact of the crisis, [...] "that the disruption is expected to result in a temporary reduction in national GDP growth of around 0.25 percentage point, spread across the June and September quarters... as national GDP is around <b>a</b> <b>trillion</b> <b>dollars,</b> a 0.25 percentage point represents about $2½ billion, so the Reserve Bank estimate is broadly consistent with that of the Western Australian Treasury." ...|$|E

40|$|Nanotechnology, {{according}} to the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), is defined as utilisation of structures {{with at least one}} dimension of nanometre size for the construction of materials, devices or systems with novel or significantly improved properties due to their nano-size. Applications include solid-state, bio-, chemical and measurement technologies that converge "top-down" and "bottom-up" to the nanoscale. The concept of nanotechnology is however not new, having been adopted by Taniguchi in 1974 when he defined the critical dimensions and tolerances in technology. Hence nanotechnology is part of the evolution of machining accuracy, with no differences from traditional fields of science or engineering except in size.

Therefore, the unintentional introduction of nanoparticles into the environment is increasingly likely. However, currently applied risk-assessment practices require further adaptation to accommodate the intrinsic nature of engineered nanoparticles. Combining a chronic flow-through exposure system with subsequent acute toxicity tests for the standard test organism Daphnia magna, we found that juvenile offspring of adults that were previously exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles exhibit a significantly increased sensitivity to titanium dioxide nanoparticles compared with the offspring of unexposed adults, as displayed by lower 96 h-EC 50 values. This observation is particularly remarkable because adults exhibited no differences among treatments in terms of typically assessed endpoints, such as sensitivity, number of offspring, or energy reserves. Hence, the present study suggests that ecotoxicological research requires further development to include {{the assessment of the}} environmental risks of nanoparticles for the next and hence not directly exposed generation, which is currently not included in standard test protocols...|$|R
