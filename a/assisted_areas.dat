40|$|When {{an office}} relocates from London, its {{accommodation}} costs and salary costs decrease substantially. Some contacts must, however, be maintained {{with people in}} the capital, resulting in an increase in travel costs. Those increases are compared with accommodation and salary savings to show that the greatest net saving is usually obtained by a move to a town in the outer South East. Such moves have been very common. Few offices would obtain greater savings by moving to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas,</b> despite government incentives, which would have to be increased substantially to make those areas attractive. Similarly the replacement of 30 % of meetings by cheap teleconferences would not alone persuade many more offices to move there. Policies concerning many aspects of travel and communications would have to be combined before relocation to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas</b> would be worthwhile for more than a very small minority of offices. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid 1970 s, {{there have}} been {{attempts}} in West German regional policy to relocate jobs in the expanding service sector to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on the locational behaviour of the headquarters of industrial companies, the possibility and usefulness of a decentralisation of management jobs is examined. In view of the location requirements and the mobility of those tertiary functions requiring highly qualified personnel, an increasing importance accruing to the leading locations for headquarters can be expected. The financial incentives to relocate have proven too weak. A policy of forced decentralisation, however, would not be useful, because of the already decentralised location structure in West Germany when compared internationally. A further decentralisation would detract from {{the function of the}} leading locations as national growth centres and would endanger their international competitiveness. A policy to activate the endogenous development potential of disadvantaged regions is therefore more suitable than long-distance relocations of service industries to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} new plant locations. In particular, the paper looks at whether discretionary government grants influence the location of new plants, and how effective these incentives are {{in the presence of}} agglomeration and urbanisation externalities – that is, benefits arising from locating near to other firms in the same industry or in an area with a diverse industrial structure. The specific government grants we consider are Regional Selective Assistance grants that are available in designated <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas</b> of the UK. We examine these questions using data on new plant entrants to the production sector in Great Britain, together with matched information on Regional Selective Assistance grant offers. We look at those new entrants that appear a priori to be more mobile – new plants owned by existing firms, (either UK groups or foreign multinationals). Our findings are of interest in the context of government policies concerned with regional variation in economic performance. We find evidence that regional industrial structure affects the location of new entrants. Firms in more agglomerated industries locate new plants near to others in the same industry, and firms are also attracted to industrially diversified locations. In line with other work in this area we find that foreign multinationals locate new plants near to other foreign-owned plants in the same industry. Fiscal incentives in the form of Regional Selective Assistance grants are found to have some effect in attracting plants to <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas.</b> Agglomeration, regional grants and firm locatio...|$|E

40|$|This paper tests {{one of the}} {{fundamental}} assumptions of regional policy makers over the last 20 years. Western governments, in seeking to attract internationally mobile capital have spent significant sums of public money on subsidies and grants. This is justified on the basis that the social returns to FDI are significantly greater than the private returns, due to productivity or technology spillovers from inward investors to domestic industry. However, this paper generates some estimates of these spillovers for both <b>assisted</b> <b>areas</b> and non-assisted areas in the UK, and questions the size of these social returns, arguing that productivity spillovers do not occur in regions where significant inward investment incentives are available.

40|$|Purpose – {{the purpose}} of this article is to make initial {{evaluation}} of the allocation of EU funds in Latvian territories in context with regional development strategy and comparing with previous programming period 2004 - 2006. Design/methodology – comparative analysis of allocation of financing in absolute and relative terms is complemented with correlation analysis between financial and territory development indicators. The analysis is performed in regional (5 planning regions) and local (118 municipalities) level, as well as in such types of territories as municipalities with growth poles of international, national and regional importance, other municipalities and specially <b>assisted</b> <b>areas.</b> Findings – more financing in absolute terms has been allocated to more developed regions with an exception of least developed region Latgale which has attracted second largest amount of financing after most developed Riga region. In relative terms more financing has been received by the least developed regions due to large investments in public infrastructure. Although growth poles have attracted greatest part of financing in activities of local importance, in relative terms major growth poles have received less financing than other territories. Practical implications –in perspective when planning EU funds programmes more attention should be paid to promotion of education, science, entrepreneurship and innovations in regions. Otherwise least developed regions will not grow fast enough to reduce regional disparities. Creation of additional territorial principals to promote investments in major growth poles should be invented in order to facilitate concentration of resources thus increasing the ability of growth poles to encourage development in their surrounding areas. Originality/value – this article gives insight in the allocation of EU funds in Latvian territories both in regional and local level. It analyses the concentration of investments in growth poles, specially <b>assisted</b> <b>areas</b> and other territories.

40|$|Summary. Using data on {{closures}} and transfers, {{the decline}} of manufacturing employment in Greater London is resolved into its components. The largest component is the net decline due {{to the difference between}} closures and openings with 44 per cent of the total job loss, followed by movement with 27 per cent and in situ shrinkage with 22 per cent. The rate of decline differs little between inner and outer London but inner London suffers more from closures and outer London suffers more from movement, particularly to the <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas.</b> South East London and the East End have been especially hard hit, and smaller plants appear most prone to closure. The major cause of movement from London was restrictions upon expansion caused by site congestion, obsolescent premises and labour shortages...|$|E

Secondly, after establishing the effects that inward investment has on wage inequality, we then analyse {{the reasons for this}} in terms of the wages paid to skilled and unskilled workers, and the effect that inward investment has on this. We illustrate the important differences that horizontal and vertical FDI have on both wages and wage inequality, and the importance of allowing for regional differences in the results. FDI nationally tends to increase wage inequality, while the local, effects are opposite.

As {{part of an}} international global partnership to control onchocerciasis, The Carter Center’s Global 2000 River Blindness Program (GRBP) assists the ministries of health in ten countries to distribute ivermectin (Mectizan, donated by Merck & Co.). The GRBP priorities are to maximize ivermectin treatment coverage and related health education and training efforts, and to monitor progress through regular reporting of ivermectin treat-ments measured against annual treatment objectives and ultimate treatment goals (e. g., full coverage, which is defined as reaching all persons residing in at risk villages who are eligible for treatment). Since the GRBP began in 1996, more than 21. 2 million ivermectin treatment encounters have been reported by assisted programs. In 1999, more than 6. 6 million eligible persons at risk for onchocerciasis received treatment, which represented 96 % of the 1999 annual treatment objective of 6. 9 million, and 78 % of the ultimate treatment goal in <b>assisted</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Analysis {{of changes}} in the {{locations}} of the headquarters of the leading thousand companies in the UK, both at the regional and urban levels, reveals evidence of increasing centralization of control in the Southeast. The main elements of change are analysed to assess their relative significance in the process. Several recent studies have commented favourably on the impact of regional policy in the <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas</b> of the UK (defined in the Annual Report on the Industry Act, 1977). McDermott (1977) has indicated the apparent shift of new overseas manufacturing investment towards these areas, and Keeble (1977) has stressed the apparent convergence of regional disparities in manufacturing-employment growth rates. This paper provides evidence that, in contrast to manufacturing employment as a whole, regional disparities in the location of administrative control, as indicated by the changing locations of the headquarters of the leading thousand companies (measured by turnover), are widening. Aaronovitch and Sawyer (1975) consider that the primary cause of increasing levels of industrial concentration in the UK economy is acquisition activity, with th...|$|E
40|$|Local {{authority}} {{involvement in}} economic matters has become widespread {{since the early}} 1970 s. Recent developments {{in the pattern of}} local economic activity have been the increasing use of section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972 to fund local programmes, the spread of local authority involvement from the <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas</b> to the more prosperous regions, and the increasing interest shown by the smaller shire districts, often in rural areas. The portfolio of possible interventions has also changed, bringing a new diversity to the practice of local economic development. Whereas central government has in the past eschewed the temptation to exercise close controls over these activities, the new diversity of local economic initiatives presents it with new dilemmas. It can no longer be assumed that such initiatives will be supportive of central government's spatial or sectoral policies. This vacuum in central - local relations is unlikely to remain, and renewed pressures to grant specific economic development powers to local authorities can be expected. If these claims are accepted, central government will be drawn inexorably into local economic affairs by the need to develop the capacity of local authorities to intervene effectively in pursuit of economic and employment goals. ...|$|E
