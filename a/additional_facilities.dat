Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the Department for Transport, at which proposals for <b>additional</b> <b>facilities</b> and runways were considered. It was agreed {{that there would be no}} further expansion at Gatwick unless it became impossible to meet growth targets at London Heathrow Airport within existing pollution limits.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{announcement}} proclaiming the ACC's expansion to 12teams, several cities and sports organizations were preparing bids {{to host the}} ACC Football Championship Game. The prospect {{of tens of thousands}} of visitors could provide a multimillion-dollar economic boost for a host city and region while requiring few, if any, <b>additional</b> <b>facilities.</b> One early contender was the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Even before Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner and operator of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (as it was called then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection. Other early options included Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|In July 1992, the IOC {{voted to}} approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; {{it was first}} held at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was {{hesitant}} to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and ensured that no <b>additional</b> <b>facilities</b> would be built. The Canadian and American teams have dominated the event, typically losing only to each other. The United States won the first tournament in 1998. Canada won in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014.|$|E

The Act also gives the VA Secretary expanded authority to fire managers who perform poorly, and authorized the VA to lease <b>additional</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{refurbishment}} and recommissioning of the New Orleans Mint was due {{partly to}} the fact that in 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. had passed the Bland–Allison Act, which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The Treasury Department needed <b>additional</b> <b>facilities</b> to do so. It reopened the New Orleans facility primarily to coin large quantities of silver dollars, most of which were simply stored in the building instead of circulated. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed former Mississippi Senator and governor Henry S. Foote the new superintendent of the mint.|$|E
5|$|Towson United Methodist Church is in {{the midst}} of a $3million phased {{renovation}} and expansion project started in 2006.

Counter terrorist training includes close quarters battle (CQB), explosive entry, tubular assault (in vehicles such as in buses, trains and aircraft) and in high rise buildings, as well as room and building clearance.

5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, <b>additional</b> <b>facilities</b> had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E

5|$|Starting in fall 1942, {{large numbers}} of Soviet {{soldiers}} arrived in Fairbanks {{to work with the}} U.S. soldiers already in the town. The massive Lend-Lease effort required <b>additional</b> <b>facilities</b> to be built in and near Fairbanks. Ladd Field expanded in size, and the grounds of the U.S. Army post expanded until it met the city limits of Fairbanks. The University of Alaska, which saw most of its students taken up by the draft, provided office and dormitory space for U.S. and Soviet soldiers. Its professors also contributed to the war effort with specially created Russian language classes. Russian airmen were regular customers of Fairbanks stores, and they bought large amounts of consumer goods unavailable at home. To meet demand when Ladd Field was unusable due to fog, an airfield now known as Eielson Air Force Base was built southeast of Fairbanks. Although there were some conflicts between Soviet and U.S. soldiers and civilians, Lend-Lease operations in Fairbanks continued {{through the end of the}} war, and when Lend-Lease ended in September 1945, 7,926 aircraft and tons of cargo had been transferred to Soviet officials in Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{increased}} to almost AU£55,000, {{for a variety}} of reasons. It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to Sydney was required. The Army demanded that <b>additional</b> <b>facilities</b> and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities, hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a calorifier, the rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions. The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved living and dining conditions, including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{graduation}} Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, {{which had}} been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was {{to assist with the}} design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the <b>additional</b> <b>facilities</b> that would be required in the next 25–50 years. He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada. The report's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s. Paton was responsible {{for the construction of a}} new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a storage silo, roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner in the firm in 1938.|$|E
