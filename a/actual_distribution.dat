However, the <b>actual</b> <b>distribution</b> of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another.

5|$|The {{results of}} the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he found that even with these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their <b>actual</b> <b>distribution</b> was uniform.|$|E

The bioclimatic variables used in this model are: minimum temperature in the coldest month, maximum temperature in the warmest month, accumulated growing-season warmth, and minimum value of soil moisture availability in the growing season. A comparison was made between simulated current distributions of tree species and their <b>actual</b> natural <b>distributions</b> on the Tibetan Plateau. It was shown that there is good agreement between simulated current and <b>actual</b> natural <b>distributions.</b> The simulated current distribution areas of tree species such as Abies spectabilis, Picea likiangensis var. linzhiensis, Pinus densata, Larix griffithiana were a little larger than their <b>actual</b> <b>distributions.</b> For Quercus aquifolioides and the relict species Betula platyphylla, simulated areas were a little smaller than their <b>actual</b> <b>distributions.</b> Future distributions of dominant tree species were predicted under a climate scenario with a CO 2 concentration of 500 ppmv in the year 2100. The distribution areas of Abies spectabilis, Picea likiangensis var. linzhiensis, Pinus densata, Larix griffithiana and Quercus aquifolioides would shift and extend towards {{the north and west}} under the future climate scenario.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} the formulation {{and analysis of}} a model to measure, compare, and contrast the effects of counterforce (pre-launch attack) and active defense (post-launch attack) against tactical ballistic missiles (TBM's). It is shown that without counterforce an active defense system could require an impractical number of weapons to counter incoming missiles and/or their warheads. This number is shown to decrease geometrically as effective counterforce is used, so that the expected number of warheads killed increases dramatically with counterforce that is only modestly effective. <b>Actual</b> <b>distributions</b> of warheads reaching the target area are shown to be complex mixtures of binomial distributions.

The results show that the circle detection algorithm is able to find a high percentage of pellets in an image and find their sizes.

40|$|Data {{from the}} South Australian Cancer Registry (SACR) for 1977 - 2003 {{were used to}} {{calculate}} expected and <b>actual</b> <b>distributions</b> of cancer sites in Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal populations. Expected distributions were calculated using indirect standardisation and compared with <b>actual</b> <b>distributions</b> using a global Chi-square test. Individual contributions to the Chi-square statistic (from each cancer site) were examined using a z-test and Bonferroni corrected p-value. The expected figure for each cancer site corresponds {{to the number of}} cancers we would have expected in Aboriginal patients if they had the same cancer distribution of site by age as the non-Aboriginal population. Expected 5 - and 10 -year survivals were also calculated and compared to expected survivals drawn from Statewide survivals adjusted for age at diagnosis. There was an overall significant difference in expected and <b>actual</b> cancer site <b>distributions</b> for South Australian Aboriginal male (c 2 (17 df) = 202. 94) and female (c 2 (20 df) = 311. 93) patients, and all patients collectively (c 2 (22 df) = 485. 43). Aboriginal patients had poorer expected 5 - and 10 -year survival compared with South Australian non-Aboriginal patients, and even poorer actual 5 - and 10 -year survival than expected. The differences between the expected and <b>actual</b> cancer site <b>distributions</b> reflect the disparities in risk factor prevalence for largely preventable cancers and the survival results reflect the multitude of obstacles confronting Aboriginal patients with cancer compared with non-Aboriginal cancer patients.

There are, so far as yet known, twelve species of true jays, occupying an area extending from Western Europe to Eastern Asia and Japan, and nowhere passing the Arctic circle to the north, or the tropic of Cancer to the south, so that they constitute one of the most typical of the Palæarctic[6] genera.

LAZY-ARVE is an improvement upon LAZY arcreversal (LAZY-AR), which was very recently proposed and empirically shown to be the state-of-the-art method for exact inference in discrete BNs. The primary advantage of LAZY-ARVE over LAZY-AR is that the former only computes the <b>actual</b> <b>distributions</b> passed during inference, whereas the latter may perform unnecessary computation by constructing irrelevant intermediate distributions.
