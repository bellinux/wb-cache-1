500|$|Fey {{and former}} SNL castmate Amy Poehler {{starred in the}} 2008 comedy Baby Mama. The movie was written and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. The plot concerns Kate (Fey), a business woman, who wants a child but, discovering she has only a million-to-one chance of getting pregnant, decides to find a surrogate: Angie (Poehler), a white-trash schemer. Baby Mama received mixed reviews, but critics enjoyed Fey's performance. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote: [...] "Fey is <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> watch throughout. Able to convey Kate's intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing." [...] The movie grossed over US$64million at the box office.|$|E
500|$|Overall {{reception}} of Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon was also positive, though some reviewers felt {{that several of}} the tracks were of lesser quality {{than the rest of the}} album. Patrick Gann of RPGFan described it as [...] "Awesome. Purely spectacular." [...] and Matt Brady of Final Fantasy Symphony concurred, saying that the [...] "music quality for this soundtrack was spectacular." [...] Daniel Space of RPGFan, however, found the quality mixed, and said that [...] "some of the pieces do not live up to the new orchestration," [...] although others [...] "were <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> hear." [...] He also found some of the instruments to be slightly out of tune, which he disliked, though Matt Brady felt it gave the pieces an [...] "ethnic feel".|$|E

He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as [...] "the most moving in a soap this year" [...] and added that [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> finally alight on an episode... that was so satisfying." [...] Conversely, Pauline's exit {{was described}} as a [...] "mess" [...] by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: [...] "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead." ...|$|E

[...] He also noted in the interview, [...] "Rory was <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> work with, and so was the director. The whole experience was five days in Belfast, and I enjoyed it a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast. McCann, whose character is frequently shown chopping wood in the episode, previously spoke in interviews about his prior career with chopping down trees, revealing [...] "I was a lumberjack for years, [...] and I even trained myself to be a tree surgeon." ...|$|E

The story of a fisherman down on his luck reminded Beatrix of the 'fish stories' her father's friends had told in Scotland, as well as her brother's travails with rod and reel. She also recreated the gentlemen's club atmosphere absorbed from her father's reports of evenings spent at the Reform and the Athenaeum... The text and illustrations for this story {{are some of the most}} balanced and compatible of all her writing. Nature is described and illustrated truthfully: beautifully tranquil as well as unpredictably aggressive....Its carefully coloured botanical backgrounds of water plants, a frog with anatomically correct turned-out feet, a trout that any self-respecting fisherman would enjoy snagging, and a rather frighteningly rendered water-beetle who tweaks Jeremy's dainty toes, all made it <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> look at as well as to read.|$|E

If only his {{character}} weren’t so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series’ movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, {{no one seems}} nearly in Underwood’s league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it." [...] Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that [...] "Frank's [...] "Survivor"-like back-stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive." [...] and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: [...] "...things always seem to fall neatly into place for him. Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided..." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday notes that [...] "Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, and certainly no second thoughts.

500|$|Britten was, as he acknowledged, {{notorious for}} dumping {{friends and colleagues}} who either {{offended}} him or ceased to be of use – his [...] "corpses". The conductor Sir Charles Mackerras believed that the term was invented by Lord Harewood. Both Mackerras and Harewood joined the list of corpses, the former for joking {{that the number of}} boys in Noye's Fludde must have been <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> the composer, and the latter for an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce from Lady Harewood, which shocked the puritanical Britten. Among other corpses were his librettists Montagu Slater and Eric Crozier. The latter said in 1949, [...] "He has sometimes told me, jokingly, that one day I would join the ranks of his 'corpses' and I have always recognized that any ordinary person must soon outlive his usefulness to such a great creative artist as Ben." [...] Dame Janet Baker said in 1981, [...] "I think he was quite entitled to take what he wanted from others... He did not want to hurt anyone, but the task in hand was more important than anything or anybody." [...] Matthews feels that this aspect of Britten has been exaggerated, and he observes that the composer sustained many deep friendships {{to the end of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|Pre-Madonna {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Mark Egan from Rocky Mountain News writes that [...] "although the songs have soul in them, it's the delivery that lacks in Madonna's voice; {{you just feel}} that something is really missing." [...] Mark Zug from Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "the demos on Pre-Madonna are <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> listen to. To all the Madonna fans, this is one album worth collecting and replaying." [...] Jasmine Temple from Lexington Herald-Leader calls the album, [...] "a gloriously voyeuristic—and unauthorized—glimpse at Madonna's past, the woman she was then. You can actually sense {{the development of the}} icon she is today from the songs." [...] Robin DeRosa from USA Today was disappointed with the release, saying that [...] "it feels forced. This release is as unneeded as the hoopla surrounding Madonna's new born. Every artist has demo recordings in their early phases of career and they are generally not good. This one is not different." [...] After Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, Tony Sclafani from MSNBC noted that none of Madonna's songs were in the rock music genre, [...] "but all use rock as a jumping off point. Audible evidence of Madonna's rock roots {{can be found on the}} collection of early demos Pre-Madonna." ...|$|E

He was the kindest man and he enjoyed life so much". Reviewing his career in The Guardian, Adrian Turner considered that [...] "we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain"; {{he also said that}} Terry-Thomas was [...] "a national treasure". Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that [...] "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; Adair wrote that [...] "the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness". Terry-Thomas's friend Jack Lemmon called him [...] "a consummate professional... he was a gentleman, <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much—he made it look simple".|$|E

Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

500|$|Mike Fahey, {{writing for}} Kotaku, called the game brilliant, and {{compared}} the gameplay, graphics and music favorably to their Metroid II counterparts. Siliconera Ishaan found the game impressive, {{and said that}} it stands out from other fan-made remakes. Sam Machkovech at Ars Technica said that the game would be <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> people who liked Zero Mission, and that its quality and amount of polish put it on par with Nintendo's games. Zack Furniss of Destructoid liked the game {{to the point that}} he thought Nintendo should use some ideas from it in future Metroid titles. Jonathan Holmes, also at Destructoid, said that AM2R does a good job at filling the [...] "void" [...] left by Nintendo's lack of new 2D Metroid games, calling it [...] "even more of an extensive re-imagining than Metroid: Zero Mission was to Metroid 1". Gonçalo Lopes at Nintendo Life said that the game was a great way to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary and a dream come true for Metroid fans, and that he imagined people {{would be willing to pay}} money for it if sold on Nintendo's eShop. Matthew Castle at Nintendo Gamer called it an example of how to do a remake right. Tom Sykes at PC Gamer praised AM2R as a [...] "great game in its own right" [...] regardless of whether one had played Metroid II prior or not. NF Magazine Tony Ponce initially worried that the game would lose the [...] "eerie charm" [...] of Metroid II, but found it to be able to keep a high-tension feeling, as well as including new things for longtime fans of the original.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. It {{was named the}} eighth best episode of The Simpsons by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Bart the Lover" [...] represent The Simpsons [...] "at its apex as a well tuned talent machine grinding out the good stuff with surprising accuracy and skill." [...] Gibron added that the episode shows that the made-up romance between Mrs. Krabappel and Woodrow [...] "works because it's so painfully true. [...] How the kiss-off to Mrs. Krabappel is created and handled shows that The Simpsons has heart to add to its humor." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating. He thought the intertwining of the two plots in the episode [...] "works very well, creating a fast paced story. Bart's alias, Woodrow, is <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> hear in voice-overs and Homer's antics produce many laughs." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said [...] "Bart the Lover" [...] stands out as a [...] "very strong episode" [...] because it [...] "steers clear of most potentially sappy material and offers a lively piece. [...] The 'B' story in which Homer tries not to swear also swings and creates some great moments." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said they [...] "loved" [...] Homer's suggestion for the [...] letter from Woodrow: [...] "Dear Baby.
