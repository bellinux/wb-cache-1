500|$|On 8 January, Tshombe reappeared in Élisabethville. The {{same day}} Prime Minister Adoula {{received}} a letter from the chiefs of the most prominent Kantangese tribes pledging allegiance to the Congolese government and calling for Tshombe's arrest. Thant, at the urging of the United States, considered making contact with Tshombe to negotiate. Bunche advised against this, saying to the secretary-general, [...] " [...] is maneuvering in every possible way to get some recognition. His position, after all, is only that of a provincial president, <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> the first time, he is reduced to size. He should be kept there." [...] He shortly thereafter clarified his opinion, stating, [...] "If we could convince [...] that there is no more room for maneuvering and bargaining, and no one to bargain with, he would surrender and the gendarmerie would collapse." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bangkok Post {{noted that}} the band [...] "stick firmly to their '90s alt-rock guns." [...] Their [...] "fuzzy-guitar/catchy-hook formula {{continues}} to dominate the album" [...] and amidst the fuzz and electronics, [...] "the title-track, Sugar and Beloved Freak do offer moments of (relatively) quiet bliss" [...] — songs that [...] "refreshingly showcase the essence of Manson's voice". It is proposed however that, apart from older, devoted 90's fans, the album probably won't connect with contemporary audiences. In his review for Time, Adam Kivel likewise stated that the album {{is most likely to}} resonate with fans of 90's alternative fusion, characterizing it as [...] "an anomaly" [...] in the current musical climate and not likely to gain significant radio-play. Lindsay Zoladz of Pitchfork Media summarized the album as [...] "a statement from a band that's stuck, combatively, to its guns. The times have changed but Garbage haven't, <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> better and for worse, they've at last become alternative to everything." ...|$|E

500|$|The paper shook Charles Lyell's {{belief that}} species were immutable. Although his friend Charles Darwin {{had written to}} him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had {{continued}} to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did Edward Blyth who thought it [...] "Good! Upon the whole!... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species." [...] Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the progressive creationism {{of the time and}} wrote that it was [...] "nothing very new... Uses my simile of tree [...] it seems all creation with him." [...] Lyell was more impressed, and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend Joseph Hooker <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> the first time, he spelt out the full details of natural selection to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a species sketch of his continuing work in May 1856.Browne Charles Darwin: Voyaging pp. 537–46.|$|E
500|$|Ruiz {{began the}} 2012 season strongly, and {{throughout}} the season was a bright spot on an otherwise disappointing team. Through June 27, he led the Major Leagues with a [...]364 average. This contributed to a stellar {{first half of the}} season earned him his first placement on the National League All-Star team. He was a reserve, though some analysts, including ESPN's John Kruk, felt his numbers warranted a starting nod, which ultimately went to the San Francisco Giants' Buster Posey through the fan voting. Shortly after the announcement that he was an all-star, a piece in The Philadelphia Daily News entitled [...] "The evolution of Carlos Ruiz" [...] summarized his career: [...] "Ruiz, though, was never a major prospect. He was a reserve catcher before he was a starting catcher. He was a bottom-of-the-order hitter before he was a middle-of-the-order hitter. <b>And</b> <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in his}} career, Carlos Ruiz is an All-Star." [...] After the all-star break, he spent over a month on the disabled list with plantar fasciitis, hindering his statistical totals, which at the time of his injury were among the best in the National League. He led all NL catchers in doubles, en route to posting a [...]325 batting average with 16 home runs and 68 RBIs, all of which were career highs. He finished 28th in MVP voting, the third consecutive season he had received votes.|$|E
