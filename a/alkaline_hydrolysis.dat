25|$|The {{third class}} {{includes}} reactions describing {{the synthesis of}} FDCA from furfural. Furfural can be oxidized to 2-furoic acid with nitric acid and the latter was subsequently converted to its methyl ester. The ester was then converted via chloromethylation at position 5 to give 5-chloromethylfuroate. The latter was oxidized with nitric acid to form dimethyl 2,5-furandicarboxylate, which, after the <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> gave FDCA in 50% yield. Andrisano reported that potassium 2-furoate, when heated up to 300nbsp&°C in a nitrogen atmosphere, underwent decarboxylation to furan with simultaneous carboxylation at position 5 to di-potassium 2,5-furandicarboxylate.|$|E
25|$|Degree of {{acetylation}} (DA) for soluble chitosan {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength. Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.|$|E

25|$|Doughty's main {{inspiration}} for her advocacy work was the frequent {{absence of the}} decedents' families in the process, which she attributed to the Western death anxiety and death phobia. She wanted to encourage death acceptance, {{and a return to}} such practices as memento mori, reminders of one's own mortality, resulting in healthier grieving, mourning, and closure after the inevitable deaths of people around us, as well as starting a movement to broaden the funeral industry to offer more funeral options, such as natural burial, sky burial, <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> (liquid cremation), or promession. Embalming began to dominate in the US after the Civil War. A century later, in the 1960s, Americans began to turn away from embalming and burial, as cremation became increasingly popular, so that today it is used in almost half of deaths in urban areas. Cremation is seen {{as a threat to the}} traditional funeral industry, but has a reputation as the more environmentally friendly option. This change can be traced to the lifting of the ban on cremation by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and to the publication in the same year of The American Way of Death by Jessica Mitford, documenting abuses in the funeral industry and criticizing the excessive cost of funerals. Mitford's book, and the movement it started, was one of Doughty's inspirations, but Doughty feels that while Mitford had the right target, the profit-driven funeral industry, Mitford erred in sharing the industry's, and the public's, unhealthy desire to push out of sight and avoid thinking about the corpse itself. Doughty seeks to build on Mitford's reforms but in a direction that embraces the reality of death and returns to funeral and mourning practices that include spending time with and having contact with the dead body itself.|$|E

2500|$|Doughty advocates reappropriating pejoratives like 'morbid', and [...] {{wants to}} reverse the {{attitude}} that [...] "talking about death is deviant".

[...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, and that you have the power over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do your research and understand your options. The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; you have time to make the right decision for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property.

40|$|The {{combination}} {{of chemical and}} biological degradation offers an attractive alternative to the common used incineration of energetic materials which have to be disposed of. In the case of nitrocellulose based propellants <b>alkaline</b> pressure <b>hydrolysis</b> is suitable for the initial chemical degradation step. The following biological steps (anoxic denitrification; aerobic degradation) require a reaction mixture which does not interfere with biology. In addition energy and material consumption should be minimized and the emission of air pollutants should be avoided as far as possible. In this study the pressure hydrolysis of a double-base propellant (NDT- 3) was studied under different alkaline contents of the reactive mixture. Generally, stronger NaOH-content leads to better conversion ratios of the propellant. Under high alkaline content the solid residue is minimized to equal/smaller than 3 percent. The nitrogen of the propellant is converted into NO 2 and NO 3. In principle the conversion ra tio of NO 3 is with about 25 - 28 percent N and not influenced by the alkaline content. On the contrary the formation of NO 2 {{is strongly dependent on}} the alkaline content and ranges from 16 to 51 percent. Evolved gases are strictly inhibited under strong alkaline conditions. The emission of NOx for example is reduced to 0, 001 percent of the propellant N. The carbon conversion ratio shows a similar behavior. CO 2 in form of gaseous CO 2 or HCO 3 is produced in an amount of approx. 20 percent whereas the chemical oxygen demand (COD) increases with increasing alkaline content. A special problem for the biological steps is the presence of toxic nitro- and aminoaromatic compounds. The results show that also under high alkaline conditions the content of nitro- and aminoaromatic compounds in the aqueous solution is reduced (smaller than 10 mg/l). <b>Alkaline</b> pressure <b>hydrolysis</b> of propellants can be improved by modifying the reaction conditions.
