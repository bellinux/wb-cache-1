The town had become a byword for racial division after Conservative supporters used the slogan, [...] "If you want <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> for a neighbour, vote Labour." [...] In Smethwick he compared the treatment of colored residents with the treatment of Jews under Hitler, saying: [...] "I would not wait for the fascist element in Smethwick to erect gas ovens." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{child of}} the Jim Crow South, Stengel has {{sometimes}} {{been accused of being}} a racist, for example by Roy Campanella Jr., who stated that Stengel made racist remarks from the dugout during the World Series towards his father Roy Campanella, Jackie Robinson and other black stars of the Dodgers. Bak noted, though, that Stengel was a [...] "viscous and inventive" [...] bench jockey, hazing the other team with whatever might throw off their performance. Stengel had poor relations with Robinson; each disliked the other and was a vocal critic. One widely quoted Stengel comment was about catcher [...] Elston Howard, who became the first black Yankee in 1955, eight years after Robinson had broken the color barrier, [...] "they finally get me <b>a</b> <b>nigger,</b> I get the only one who can't run".|$|E
500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E

2500|$|In an 1868 {{newspaper}} interview, Forrest {{stated that}} the Klan's primary opposition was to the Loyal Leagues, Republican state governments, people such as Tennessee governor William Gannaway Brownlow and other [...] "carpetbaggers" [...] and [...] "scalawags". He argued that many southerners believed that blacks were voting for the Republican Party because they were being hoodwinked by the Loyal Leagues. One Alabama newspaper editor declared [...] "The League {{is nothing more than}} <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> Ku Klux Klan." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 12, 2010, Margera was {{allegedly}} attacked {{with a baseball}} bat outside of his bar, The Note. Margera spent the night at Crozer-Chester Medical Center, where he was treated for head injuries. According to the alleged assailant, Elizabeth Ray, it was because Margera allegedly called her <b>a</b> <b>nigger.</b> Ray denies attacking Margera. Margera denies having said the word, claiming [...] "I called her a crazy bitch and an idiot, but I definitely didn't use the n-word".|$|E

2500|$|After [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me" [...] was released, instead, Haggard later commented to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "People are narrow-minded. Down South {{they might}} have called me <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> lover." [...] In a 2001 interview, Haggard stated that Nelson, who was also head of the country {{division}} at Capitol at the time, never interfered with his music, but [...] "this one time {{he came out and}} said, 'Merle, I don't believe the world is ready for this yet.' ... And he might have been right. I might've canceled out where I was headed in my career." ...|$|E
2500|$|In court, Blount {{said that}} {{alternate}} service was unacceptable; he debated the judge on points {{of law and}} Biblical interpretation. Though sympathetic, the judge ruled that Blount was violating the law and was at risk for being drafted into the U.S. military. Blount responded that if inducted, he would use military weapons and training to kill the first high-ranking military officer possible. The judge sentenced Blount to jail (pending draft board and CPS rulings), and then said, [...] "I've never seen <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> like you before." [...] Blount replied, [...] "No, and you never will again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, the {{national}} organization of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the University of Oklahoma chapter after a video surfaced showing members chanting a song which featured the racial slur, [...] "nigger," [...] and made reference to lynching. The chant, set to melody of the popular children's song, [...] "If You're Happy and You Know It", declares, [...] "There will never be <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> in SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he will never sign with me." [...] Sigma Alpha Epsilon suspended {{the charter of the}} involved chapter and suspended its members on [...] March 8, 2015. The University of Oklahoma president, David Boren, closed the fraternity chapter, giving members two days to vacate the fraternity's campus dwellings. On March 10, 2015, two students identified in the video were expelled from the university.|$|E

2500|$|Klebold {{walked toward}} {{another set of}} tables, where he {{discovered}} 18-year-old Isaiah Shoels, 16-year-old Matthew Kechter and 16-year-old Craig Scott (the younger brother of Rachel Scott), hiding under one table. All three were popular athletes. Klebold tried to pull Shoels {{out from under the}} table. He called to Harris, referring to him by his online identity and shouting, [...] "REB! There's <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> over here!" [...] Harris left Pasquale and joined him. According to witnesses, Klebold and Harris taunted Shoels for a few seconds, making derogatory racial comments. Harris knelt down and shot Shoels once in the chest at close range, killing him instantly. Klebold also knelt down and opened fire, hitting and killing Kechter. Harris then yelled; [...] "Who's ready to die next?". Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured; he lay in the blood of his friends, feigning death. Harris turned and threw a CO2 bomb at the table where Hall, Steepleton, and Ireland were located. It landed on Steepleton's thigh, and Hall quickly threw it away.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{productions}} update some of {{the words}} and phrases in The Mikado. [...] For example, two songs in the opera use the word [...] "nigger". In [...] "As some day it may happen", often called the [...] "list song", Ko-Ko criticizes [...] "the nigger serenader and the others of his race". In the Mikado's song, [...] "A more humane Mikado", the lady who modifies her appearance excessively is to be punished by being [...] "blacked like <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> with permanent walnut juice". These references are to white performers in blackface minstrel shows, a popular entertainment in the Victorian era, rather than to dark-skinned people. Until well into the twentieth century, the word [...] "nigger" [...] was not considered by audiences to be offensive. Audience members objected to the word during the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's 1947 American tour, however, and Rupert D'Oyly Carte asked A. P. Herbert to supply revised wording. These alterations have been incorporated into the opera's libretto and score since then.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, Indian-born actress Somi Guha made {{a formal}} {{complaint}} to BBC for $1.8 million, for a racist term used after building a {{bridge over the}} Kok River in the Burma Special. Upon its completion, Clarkson said, [...] "That's a proud moment, but there's a slope on it", and Richard Hammond added, [...] "Yeah, right. It's definitely higher on that side". This led to complaints that [...] "slope" [...] is a derogatory term for an Asian person. In April, Top Gear’s executive producer Andy Wilman apologised for the racist remark. In July 2014 Ofcom ruled that the BBC had breached broadcasting rules by including this offensive racial term. In May 2014, there were complaints and calls for Clarkson to be sacked after {{it was revealed that}} he recited [...] "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe; catch <b>a</b> <b>nigger</b> by his toe" [...] as a children's rhyme on an unaired take from the show. Clarkson denied having used the word, then apologised when a previously unbroadcast clip revealed him doing so.|$|E
