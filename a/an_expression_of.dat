5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, Norwegian {{architecture}} {{has been}} characterized by its connection with Norwegian social policy on the one hand, and innovation on the other. Norwegian architects have been recognized for their work, both within Norway—where architecture has been considered <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> social policy—and outside Norway, in several innovative projects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} oil {{study for the}} {{defeated}} warrior (York Art Gallery), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch he is not on his knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> defiance and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only were}} such monasteries <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> David's undoubted piety, {{but they also}} functioned to {{transform}} Scottish society. Monasteries became centres of foreign influence, and provided sources of literate men, able to serve the crown's growing administrative needs. These new monasteries, and the Cistercian ones in particular, introduced new agricultural practices. Cistercian labour, for instance, transformed southern Scotland into one of northern Europe's most important sources of sheep wool.|$|E
5|$|Restrictions {{were imposed}} on the {{advertisement}} of tobacco products, enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as {{was the use of}} advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.|$|E

5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies {{became more and more}} dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E

5|$|Although {{football}} {{has traditionally}} been the more popular sport in north Wales, rugby union {{is seen as a}} symbol of Welsh identity and <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> national consciousness. The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup, hosting the tournament in 1999. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets. The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14, the Anglo-Welsh Cup, the European Rugby Champions Cup and the European Rugby Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E

She has stated her intention to formally convert to Buddhism when the political conditions enable her to become Prime Minister of India. Her act of performing the last rites (traditionally done by a male heir) was <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> their views against gender discrimination. When she was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, she publicly called Bhikkhus to prayer.|$|E

5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E
5|$|In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I {{appealed to}} Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars, which caused Urban {{to launch the}} First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and {{returning}} the Holy Land to Christian control. In the 11th century, strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin Church separated them in the East–West Schism, partially due to conflicts over papal authority. The Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach. In this age great gothic cathedrals in France were <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> popular pride in the Christian faith.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne (1898–1977), {{daughter}} of Frederick Horne of Drinkstone, Suffolk. Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states {{that she was}} a maid in domestic service, whereas Reid notes {{that she was a}} keen rider, with many friends in hunting circles, and that her uncle (who officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was rector of Drinkstone, Suffolk. According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry Horne, having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 was <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> his grief.|$|E
