The approach is based on determination of a consensus relation which is in "nearest distance " from all initial rankings shaped by multiple sensors of each network node. Statistically and probabilistically based analytical models useful for assuring network performance and providing reasonable number values n – k and m are proposed and discussed, where n – k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of packets transmitted to the sink; n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of the network sensor nodes; k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of dropped packets due to a congestion; and m <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of node sensors (or rankings) ...|$|R
