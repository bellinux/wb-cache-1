5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary {{reaction to the}} work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it {{is the extent to}} which Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E

5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even go so far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E

5|$|After Ecgric {{had been}} ruling alone for two years, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army, led by Penda. The date of the invasion is usually given as around 636, although Kirby suggests {{it could have been}} so late as 641. Ecgric was sufficiently forewarned <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to gather an army, described by Bede as opimus or splendid. Realising that they would be inferior in battle to the war-hardened Mercians and remembering that Sigeberht was once their most vigorous and distinguished leader, the East Anglians urged him to lead them in battle, hoping that his presence would encourage them not to flee from the Mercians. After he refused, on account of his religious calling, he was borne off against his will to the battlefield. He refused to bear weapons and so was killed. Ecgric was also slain during the battle and many of his countrymen either perished or were put to flight. The location of the site of the battle in which the East Anglians were routed and their king was killed is unknown, but it can be presumed to have been close to the kingdom’s western border with the Middle Angles.|$|E

5|$|By definition, any two atoms with an {{identical}} number of protons in their nuclei {{belong to the}} same chemical element. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form, also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and more than two neutrons. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element oganesson. All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> practically negligible.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unpleasant for her.|$|E

Most Golondrina specimens from the South Texas Plains are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods.

5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E

5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was a {{discussion}} about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit.

But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips.|$|E
