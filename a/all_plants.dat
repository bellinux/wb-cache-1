5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of <b>all</b> <b>plants,</b> making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{cultivated}} plant taxonomy {{can be traced}} from the first plant selections {{that occurred during the}} agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans. The naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of <b>all</b> <b>plants</b> until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar. Since that time the classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path.|$|E
5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly <b>all</b> <b>plants,</b> even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E

5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of <b>all</b> <b>plants,</b> for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. <b>All</b> <b>plants</b> {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of phosphite inhibits growth of P.cinnamomi in B.sessilis, {{but does not}} kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of P.cinnamomi by over 90% in plants infected with B.sessilis two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly <b>all</b> <b>plants</b> infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but {{has been shown to}} reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year.|$|E

5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in <b>all</b> <b>plants</b> and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{systems of}} plant {{identification}} were developed comparable to dichotomous keys, where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) {{by making a}} series of choices between pairs of characters. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or {{more closely related to}} the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linn√© (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included <b>all</b> <b>plants</b> with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that in 2006 there was sufficient capacity to treat 52% of municipal residential wastewater. By June 2010, there were 1,519 municipal wastewater treatment plants in China and 18 plants were added each week. Many existing plants are being expanded and upgraded to include a tertiary treatment stage for nutrient removal to comply with more stringent discharge standards introduced in 2002. In terms of technologies, in 2007, the most commonly used technologies were various forms of activated sludge, including oxidation ditches (24% of <b>all</b> <b>plants),</b> sequencing batch reactors (11%), conventional activated sludge (5%) and membrane bioreactors. In small communities, plants using only primary treatment were still common (15% of <b>all</b> <b>plants).</b> An analysis in 2004 by the Ministry of Construction showed that, according to treatment plant records, most plants operated in compliance with discharge standards.|$|E

40|$|There {{are over}} {{a half a}} million plant species on earth, and we use them in {{virtually}} every aspect of our lives. Little or no genomic information exists about the vast majority of these plants. This study investigated the use of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) to locate highly conserved sequences from which to design a set of universal molecular markers for <b>all</b> <b>plant</b> species. Plant species for this study were chosen to representative of the plant kingdom. This was done by sampling several individuals of at least one species from all of the major terrestrial plant groups. Conserved sequences are generally found {{in a wide range of}} plants species and often in <b>all</b> <b>plant</b> species. A set of eight degenerate primers was designed specifically to detect Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) using capillary array electrophoresis-single stranded conformational polymorphism (CAE-SSCP). The results of this research confirmed that homologous regions of the genome could be used to design universal molecular markers for <b>all</b> <b>plant</b> species...|$|R
25|$|Odor {{pollution}} can be {{a problem}} with old-style incinerators, but odors and dust are extremely well controlled in newer incineration plants. They receive and store the waste in an enclosed area with a negative pressure with the airflow being routed through the boiler which prevents unpleasant odors from escaping into the atmosphere. However, not <b>all</b> <b>plants</b> are implemented this way, resulting in inconveniences in the locality.|$|E
25|$|The female {{component}} of GSI in the Solanaceae {{was found in}} 1989. Proteins {{in the same family}} were subsequently discovered in the Rosaceae and Plantaginaceae. Despite some early doubts about the common ancestry of GSI in these distantly related families, phylogenetic studies and the finding of shared male determinants (F-box proteins) clearly established homology. Consequently, this mechanism arose approximately 90 million years ago, and is the inferred ancestral state for approximately 50% of <b>all</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
