[...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six.

500|$|In the song, Spears and Madonna sing of {{the pleasures}} of letting go on the dancefloor, in lyrics such as [...] "I'm up against the speaker / Trying {{to take on the}} music / It's like a competition". Spears {{explained}} the concept of the song as [...] "basically about just going to a club and letting yourself go and battling with whoever is <b>around</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> battling against the music as well." [...] Magnet continued, saying, [...] "Like she was hearing the music and trying to out-dance the track or out-beat the drum or out-pluck the guitar. It's as if she's in the club, losing herself in the music." [...] William Shaw of Blender stated Madonna's verse could be interpreted as her passing the baton to a new talent, as well as [...] "a taunt from the old guard to the uptight youngster." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{itself was}} {{recorded}} at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles. In {{an interview with}} Noisey, Oh Land spoke with Kim Taylor Bennett who asked her for further clarification on the lyrics. Bennett interpreted the lyrics as a [...] "girl who is perhaps incapable of love and commitment" [...] {{but by the end}} of the song, it is revealed that [...] "it's the guy who is the asshole", to which Oh Land confirmed and said, [...] "Yeah, so it's like, 'fuck you!'". She also described it as a song that [...] "fast-forwards a bit" [...] and inspires her because she believes that she [...] "will do everything better when [...] get older". Oh Land discusses loving someone to a deeper extent as she ages: [...] "I will wrap my arms <b>around</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> keep you from the cold / I will love you better when I'm old". Several music critics described [...] "Love You Better" [...] as a ballad. The Guardians Paul MacInnes called the song an [...] "acoustic ballad", while Leonie Cooper from NME felt it was a [...] "folk ballad".|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} {{necessarily}} a hotel restaurant from {{the inception of}} the Ritz, the current hotel restaurant, L'Espadon (The Swordfish) was established in 1956 by Charles Ritz. He was a keen fishing enthusiast so named the restaurant after a fish. The restaurant is inspired by the legendary first chef of the hotel, Auguste Escoffier, serving [...] "traditional French culinary style with contemporary overtones". The cuisine is by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel; the restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide. The head chef was formerly Guy Legay, cited as one of Paris's greatest chefs, who had served from at least 1986 to beyond 1999. In 1999, Esquire magazine wrote, [...] "the dining room, L'Espadon, down the long corridor of mirrors and display cases, has a glittering Regency formality that seems to swirl <b>around</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> it's easy enough to imagine Hemingway sitting down with Dietrich to a dish of chef Guy Legay's buttery scrambled eggs..." [...] The restaurant decor is described as [...] "opulent with trompe l’oeil ceilings, swagged drapes, and views into the garden." [...] The courtyard garden is rich in greenery and contains several statues and a fountain. The hotel hires five or so florists to provide fresh flowers.|$|E

500|$|John Pomfret of The Washington Post said a wide {{spectrum}} of Chinese and foreigners believed that Liu's award [...] "could actually resonate more deeply within China than any similar act in years". The open letter by Xu Youyu et al, which described Liu as [...] "a splendid choice" [...] because of his advancement of human rights causes and the peaceful fight against social injustice, amassed signatures from about 200 mainland intellectuals and activists; it was posted in Chinese, English, French and Japanese on websites hosted outside China. Artist and critic Ai Weiwei said that, although the regime ought to feel the most ashamed, [...] "intellectuals who had drifted away from their public responsibilities" [...] should bear some of that burden for betraying values they once strove for. Ai said that the Prize was a message from the international community to the Chinese government to respect universal human values, notwithstanding China's economic performance. Writer Liao Yiwu, a close friend of Liu, described it as [...] "a big moment in Chinese history". Another writer, Yu Jie, said he spent the night awake with tears streaming down his face – [...] "Twenty years ago Liu Xiaobo said that China needed someone with moral clarity about what China needs. Now he has become just that person, that he himself was looking for", he said. Former Chinese diplomat Yang Hengjun described it as a strong signal to the Chinese government to speed up political reform [...] "or you will have a lot of enemies <b>around</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> within you." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fifteen" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman White, who previously directed Swift's music video [...] "You Belong with Me". White began {{with the intention of}} creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere you walk in on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming <b>around</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|E

2500|$|Adkins {{compared}} {{the process of}} writing the album's lyrics to that of the band's third studio album, Clarity (1999), stating: [...] "It's similar to [...] because that's how I approached a lot of emotional things in those days.

A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon {{the most important thing you}} possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have at stake." ...|$|E

2500|$|When in India after World War II, many {{prominent}} personalities came to meet Krishnamurti, including Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

Relationship is the mirror in which the self is revealed. Without self-knowledge there is no basis for right thought and action." [...] Nehru asked, [...] "How does one start?"

[...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it was someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it." [...] "Eventually" [...] concerns [...] "knowing that you're about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation you get is this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because you know they aren't going to be now or soon." [...] Parker conceded that he [...] "can't really deny" [...] it is a breakup song.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the release}} of their debut album, the band {{recorded}} two demos in 1999 and 2000. In mid-2001, {{it was reported that}} Meacham had attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. The attempt affected the band's Take Action Tour. During his hospitalization he remained in poor condition and was replaced by Dameon Ash. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that [...] "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's going on all <b>around</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> it makes {{you want to do something}} to prevent it from happening to other people." [...] Avenged Sevenfold's debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were in their late teens and still in high school. It was originally released on their first label, Good Life Recordings in 2001. When lead guitarist Synyster Gates joined the band after the album was released, the introductory track [...] "To End the Rapture" [...] was re-recorded featuring a full band element. The album was subsequently re-released on Hopeless Records in 2002. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall and playing on the Take Action Tour.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1884, after a {{courtship}} {{of several}} years, Hassam married Kathleen Maude (or Maud) Doane (born 1861), a family friend. Throughout their life together, {{she ran the}} household, arranged travel, and attended to other domestic tasks, but {{little is known about}} their private life. By the mid-1880s, Hassam began painting cityscapes; Boston Common at Twilight (1885) was of his first. He joined a few other progressive American artists who were taking to heart the advice of French academic master Jean-Léon Gérôme, who abandoned his traditional subject matter and told his American peers, [...] "Look <b>around</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> paint what you see. Forget the Beaux-Arts and the models and render the intense life which surrounds you and be assured that the Brooklyn Bridge is worth the Colosseum of Rome and that modern America is as fine as the bric-a-brac of antiquity." [...] However, one Boston critic firmly rejected Hassam's choice of urban subject matter as [...] "very pleasant, but not art." [...] Although he had shown steady improvement in his oil painting, his watercolors continued provided consistent financial success. He returned with his wife to Paris where in 1886 they were able to engage a well-located apartment/studio with a maid near the Place Pigalle, the center of the Parisian art community. With the exception of fellow American artist , they lived among the French and socialized little with other American artists studying abroad.|$|E
