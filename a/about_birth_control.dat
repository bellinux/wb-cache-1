5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information <b>about</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E

25|$|Stella Browne was {{a leading}} birth control campaigner, who {{increasingly}} began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced {{by the work of}} Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists. She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy. In this case she argued that doctors should give free information <b>about</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not.|$|E

500|$|Born in Kovno, Russian Empire (present-day Kaunas, Lithuania) to a Jewish family, Goldman {{emigrated to}} the United States in 1885. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned {{lecturer}} on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick {{as an act of}} propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892 and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison.

500|$|Fraser {{began her}} work in {{gynaecology}} and obstetrics in 1924, noting that the only internships available to her were in OBGYN or children's tonsillectomies. Much of her work required her to visit immigrant patients of the tenement houses of the Lower East Side. She had little understanding of the diverse ethnicities of her patients, their poverty and {{the conditions in which}} they lived. Fraser had been influenced by Eugenics studies, which caused her medical practices to be influenced by ethnic origin. She became convinced that there was inadequate information available <b>about</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> available to both physicians and patients and she sought information from non-medical sources, becoming an advocate. Soon after her arrival in New York, Fraser began a more intense correspondence with Williams, who would become her life partner. Despite the desires of both women's families to keep them apart—Williams' family sending her to England and Fraser's family threatening that continuing the relationship would fracture her familial ties—the two refused to give up their relationship.|$|E
500|$|In 1889 the Workman family {{relocated}} to Germany citing William's health, although Pauly speculates {{that this may}} have been merely a pretext, for he recovered surprisingly quickly. The couple's second child, Siegfried, was born shortly after they arrived in Dresden. Fanny chose not to conform to the traditionally circumscribed roles of wife and mother, and became an author and adventurer. [...] She lived a vigorous life that diverged from idealized femininity in the 1800s. [...] As a feminist, Fanny considered herself an example of the idea that women could equal and excel over men in the arduous life, and embodied the New Woman ethos of the day. Moreover, as Miller points out in her book about women explorers, since the ideal family of the time was a large one and information <b>about</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> was not easily available, William's medical knowledge must have been invaluable. The Workmans left their children with nurses while they took long trips. In 1893, Siegfried died from a combination of influenza and pneumonia. [...] After his death, according to Pauly, Workman, through her bicycle tours, [...] "aggressively pursued an alternative identity, one that liberated her from the conventional responsibilities of wife and mother and allowed for her interests and ambitions". [...] They missed their daughter's wedding to Sir Alexander MacRobert in 1911 while exploring in the Karakoram.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{association}} between religiousness and conservative sexual attitudes, links between reli-gion and patterns of parent–child communication <b>about</b> sex and <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> are largely undocu-mented. This study examines these relationships using two nationally representative data sets of parents and adolescents. I evaluated a conceptual model of religious influence on the sexual social-ization of adolescents. Results suggest that parental public religiosity curbs the frequency of conver-sations <b>about</b> sex and <b>birth</b> <b>control,</b> and after accounting for conversations about sexual morality, so does parental religious salience. Despite notable relationships with religious affiliation, age, race, and gender still shape parental communication patterns most consistently. There are numerous ways in which religion can affect adolescent sexuality and its prac-tice, that is, religion can factor into attitudes and beliefs about contraception, permissible premarital sexual activities, pornography, and homosexuality, as well as indirectly through its effects on friendship choices, dating patterns, and so on (Wallace and Williams 1997). Overall, recent research suggests that multiple facets of adolescent religion—including attendance, the importance of religious faith, and denominational affiliation—typically correspond to such outcomes as more conservative sexual attitudes...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies on}} the {{fertility}} differential by religion have considered both Catholics and Protestants to be equally homogenous groups.

Using data from the General Social Survey we find that conservative Protestants and Catholics had about the same level of fertility, while mainline Protestants have a fertility rate that is significantly lower than that of Catholics. We also examine the changes in these differences over time...|$|R

Results indicated that (1) teens are very concerned about pregnancy but are less concerned about STIs, and (2) teens are not comfortable with negotiating condom use or STI testing with sexual partners. The outcomes from this study support the previous findings that teens do discuss sexual health on the Internet and shows that they specifically turn to the Internet with questions and anxieties regarding pregnancy and <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> options. These results indicate that sexual education should place more emphasis on training teenagers how to talk to their potential sexual partners about the importance of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> options and STI testing before engaging in sexual activities...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Browne began a {{speaking}} tour around England, providing {{information about her}} beliefs {{on the need for}} accessibility of information <b>about</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> for women, women’s health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics. These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman’s right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929 she brought forward her lecture [...] "The Right to Abortion" [...] in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women’s right to decide to have an abortion. She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning.|$|E

However, in teaching children about sexual morals and birth control, Mormons parents have ranked among the lowest in comfort discussing these topics with their children among US parents of all religious affiliations. In discussing another method of family planning the church [...] "strongly discourages" [...] surgical sterilization like vasectomies and tubal ligation and only allows it for serious medical conditions after discussing it with a bishop. The LDS Church opposes elective abortion [...] "for personal or social convenience" [...] but states that abortion could be an acceptable option in cases of rape, incest, danger to the health or life of the mother, or where the fetus has been diagnosed with [...] "severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth." ...|$|E

[...] These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. Birth control was an embarrassing issue because it would directly challenge relations between men and women too, making this control for women a touchy subject. [...] During this tour several women asked Browne for abortions, however as Jones recognizes in her article, Browne was not “medically qualified” and had to refuse them. Though she was becoming increasingly interested in women’s right to terminate their pregnancies, she would still be considered a “heretic” were she to say so at this time. [...] Despite this, in 1929 she brought forward her lecture “The Right to Abortion” in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. [...] In the years leading up to the presentation of this paper, Browne worked to gather information on maternal mortality, and found that rates were higher than ever before in 1929, and became the secretary of the Chelsea Labour Party in hopes of bringing ideas of birth control and abortion to light in political platform in 1926. [...] She was unable to do so as she was forced to leave Chelsea later in 1926, as the Party was no longer recognized as a political Party. By the end of the 1920s, Browne had felt that the fight for birth control had become more successful, as it was more frequently seen in the public sphere and was now being talked about and debated more openly. [...] In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference was a success bringing 700 delegates to attendance and bringing birth control into the political sphere, which she attended and spoke at. [...] In July 1930, the Ministry of Health issued MCW/153, which allowed local authorities to give birth control advice in welfare centres, another partial success for Browne.|$|E
5000|$|Williams was an {{advocate}} of family planning and served on the executive committee of the local <b>Birth</b> <b>Control</b> League.
