Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others.

25|$|A {{number of}} xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; {{a large amount}} of the phenocrysts are {{ultimately}} derived from them. Hornfels, skarn, and rocks derived from Lascar's lava dome ridge form these xenoliths. Minerals encountered in xenoliths include <b>andradite,</b> anhydrite, anorthite, apatite, biotite, calcite, diopside, fassaite, garnet, gypsum, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, perovskite, plagioclase, prehnite, quartz, sphene, thorite, wilkeite, wollastonite and zircon. A number of such xenoliths formed from carbonate rocks that were influenced by magma from Lascar and from other volcanoes such as Tumisa.|$|E
25|$|The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al2SiO5 – are {{structurally}} {{composed of}} one 4− tetrahedron, and one Al3+ in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al3+ {{can be in}} six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as tephroite, Mn2SiO4. The garnet group has a general formula of X3Y2(SiO4)3, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al3+ in the Y position: pyrope (Mg3Al2(SiO4)3), almandine (Fe3Al2(SiO4)3), and spessartine (Mn3Al2(SiO4)3). The ugrandite garnets have Ca2+ in the X position: uvarovite (Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3), grossular (Ca3Al2(SiO4)3) and <b>andradite</b> (Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Andradite</b> is a calcium-iron garnet, Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3, is of {{variable}} composition {{and may be}} red, yellow, brown, green or black. The recognized varieties are topazolite (yellow or green), demantoid (green) and melanite (black). <b>Andradite</b> is found both in deep-seated igneous rocks like syenite as well as serpentines, schists, and crystalline limestone. Demantoid {{has been called the}} [...] "emerald of the Urals" [...] from its occurrence there, {{and is one of the}} most prized of garnet varieties. Topazolite is a golden-yellow variety and melanite is a black variety.|$|E
2500|$|All {{species of}} garnets possess similar {{physical}} properties and crystal forms, but differ in chemical composition. [...] The different species are pyrope, almandine, spessartine, grossular (varieties {{of which are}} hessonite or cinnamon-stone and tsavorite), uvarovite and <b>andradite.</b> The garnets make up two solid solution series: pyrope-almandine-spessartine and uvarovite-grossular-andradite.|$|E
2500|$|Discovered the 1960s, {{the rich}} green tsavorite variety of {{grossular}} {{is also very}} popular. Both grossular and <b>andradite</b> are isotropic and have relatively high RIs (around 1.74 and 1.89 respectively) and high dispersions (0.027 and 0.057), with demantoid's exceeding diamond. However, both have a low hardness (6.5–7.5) and invariably possess inclusions atypical for diamond—the byssolite [...] "horsetails" [...] seen in demantoid are one striking example. Furthermore, most are very small, typically under 0.5 carats (100mg) in weight. Their lusters range from vitreous to subadamantine, to almost metallic in the usually opaque melanite, which {{has been used to}} simulate black diamond. Some natural spinel is also deep black and could serve this same purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Another fragile {{candidate}} mineral is sphalerite (zinc blende). Gem-quality {{material is}} usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, {{and it is also}} isotropic. But here again, its low hardness (2.5–4) and perfect dodecahedral cleavage preclude sphalerite's wide use in jewelry. Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are grossularite (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and <b>andradite.</b> The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—topazolite (yellow), melanite (black), and demantoid (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. Demantoid (literally [...] "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the Ural Mountains in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique Russian and Art Nouveau jewelry. Titanite or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of chartreuse and has a luster, RI (1.885–2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105–0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).|$|E
