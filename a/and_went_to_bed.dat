Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite {{being unable to}} move his head, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where {{he was told he}} merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E

Around 9:30 pm, Margaryan went to visit another program participant from Armenia, Hayk Makuchyan, who was staying in another room.|$|E
500|$|Much nearer was , {{which had}} warned Titanic of ice {{a few hours}} earlier. Apprehensive at his ship being caught in a large field of drift ice, [...] Californians captain, Stanley Lord, had decided at about 22:00 to halt for the night and wait for {{daylight}} {{to find a way}} through the ice field. At 23:30, 10minutes before Titanic hit the iceberg, Californians sole radio operator, Cyril Evans, shut his set down for the night <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> On the bridge her Third Officer, Charles Groves, saw a large vessel to starboard around [...] away. It made a sudden turn to port and stopped. If the radio operator of Californian had stayed at his post fifteen minutes longer, hundreds of lives might have been saved. A little over an hour later, Second Officer Herbert Stone saw five white rockets exploding above the stopped ship. Unsure what the rockets meant, he called Captain Lord, who was resting in the chartroom, and reported the sighting. Lord did not act on the report, but Stone was perturbed: [...] "A ship is not going to fire rockets at sea for nothing," [...] he told a colleague.|$|E
500|$|By June 1943, it {{was clear}} to the USCG that the {{recruiting}} process in place did not favor the SPARS, so it withdrew from the joint agreement effective 1 July 1943. Hence, all women applicants for SPARS would be interviewed and enlisted at USCG district recruiting stations. The change was met with increased enthusiasm by the recruiters and it proved positive overall. Still, the competition remained keen with the other, better known, women services. Some recruiters referred to themselves as peddlers of patriotism, but their lot was not an easy one. In their book, Three Years Behind the Mast, the authors Mary Lyne and Kay Arthur, both officers in SPARS, described the realities of recruiting in this way: During the day, we made speeches distributed posters, decorated windows, led parades, manned information booths, interviewed applicants, appeared on radio programs, and gave aptitude tests. By night, we made more speeches; prayed women would be drafted, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> dreaming about our quotas. [...] The main recruiting effort had ended. During the 25-month recruitment period, about 11,000 women signed enlistment contracts to serve in the SPARS. Yeoman Third Class Dorothy Tuttle was the first woman to enlist in the SPARS at a recruiting station on 7 December 1942.|$|E

2500|$|Two key {{developments}} in the modeling of the modern α-helix were: the correct bond geometry, thanks to the crystal structure determinations of amino acids and peptides and Pauling's prediction of planar peptide bonds; and his relinquishing of the assumption of an integral number of residues per turn of the helix. The pivotal moment came {{in the early spring}} of 1948, when Pauling caught a cold <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> Being bored, he drew a polypeptide chain of roughly correct dimensions on a strip of paper and folded it into a helix, being careful to maintain the planar peptide bonds. After a few attempts, he produced a model with physically plausible hydrogen bonds. Pauling then worked with Corey and Branson to confirm his model before publication. In 1954, Pauling was awarded his first Nobel Prize [...] "for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances" [...] (such as proteins), prominently including the structure of the α-helix.|$|E
2500|$|Cheatham was at {{that time}} {{attempting}} to find Bate and steer him into the combined attack. Brown sent two staff officers to find Cheatham and halted his troops while he awaited a decision. By the time Cheatham and Brown were able to speak, at around 6:15p.m., the battlefield was in total darkness, and the two officers decided that an assault conducted then without knowing the condition of their right flank might be a disaster. Cheatham rode off to Hood's headquarters to consult with the army commander. Hood was furious that the attack had not proceeded as he intended and that the pike was still open. Cheatham said that he needed assistance from Stewart to protect his right flank, so Hood dispatched a staff officer to find Stewart. Having been up since 3 a.m., Hood was by this time very fatigued. He indulged in a large dinner at Oaklawn, which included considerable [...] "toasting" [...] of drinks, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at 9 p.m., confident that whatever setbacks his army had suffered during the day, {{they would be able to}} correct them in the morning and bag Schofield.|$|E
2500|$|Nehru's health began declining {{steadily}} after 1962, and {{he spent}} months recuperating in Kashmir through 1963. Some historians attribute this dramatic decline to his surprise and chagrin over the Sino-Indian War, which he perceived as a betrayal of trust. Upon his return from Dehradun on 26 May 1964 he was feeling quite comfortable <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at about 23:30 as usual, he had a restful night till about 06:30 soon after he returned from bathroom, Nehru complained of pain in the back. He spoke to the doctors who attended on him for a brief while and almost immediately Nehru collapsed. He remained unconscious until he died. His death was announced to Lok Sabha at 14:00 local time on 27 May 1964 (same day); cause of death {{is believed to be}} heart attack. Draped in the Indian national Tri-colour flag the body of Jawaharlal Nehru was placed for public viewing. [...] "Raghupati Raghava Rajaram" [...] was chanted as the body was placed on the platform.

Between 4:00 and 4:15 the next morning, Roosevelt died in his sleep at Sagamore Hill after a blood clot had detached from a vein and traveled to his lungs. He was sixty years old. Upon receiving word of his death, his son Archibald telegraphed his siblings: [...] "The old lion is dead." [...] Woodrow Wilson's vice president, Thomas R. Marshall, said that [...] "Death had to take Roosevelt sleeping, for {{if he had been}} awake, {{there would have been a}} fight." [...] Following a private farewell service in the North Room at Sagamore Hill, a simple funeral was held at Christ Episcopal Church in Oyster Bay. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, Charles Evans Hughes, Warren Harding, Henry Cabot Lodge, and William Howard Taft were among the mourners. The snow-covered procession route to Youngs Memorial Cemetery was lined with spectators and a squad of mounted policemen who had ridden from New York City. Roosevelt was buried on a hillside overlooking Oyster Bay.|$|E
