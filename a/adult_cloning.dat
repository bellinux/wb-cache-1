40|$|Preclinical {{experiments}} are currently performed {{to examine the}} feasibility of several types of nuclear transfer to prevent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders. Whereas the two most promising types of nuclear transfer to prevent mtDNA disorders, spindle transfer and pronuclear transfer, do not amount to reproductive cloning, one theoretical variant, blastomere transfer does. This seems the most challenging both technically and ethically. It is prohibited by many jurisdictions and also the scientific community seems to avoid it. Nevertheless, this paper examines the moral acceptability of blastomere transfer as a method to prevent mtDNA disorders. The reason for doing so is that most objections against reproductive cloning refer to reproductive <b>adult</b> <b>cloning,</b> while blastomere transfer would amount to reproductive embryo cloning. After clarifying this conceptual difference, this paper examines whether the main non-safety objections brought forward against reproductive cloning also apply {{in the context of}} blastomere transfer. The conclusion is that if this variant were to become safe and effective, dismissing it because it would involve reproductive cloning is unjustified. Nevertheless, as it may lead to more complex ethical appraisals than the other variants, researchers should initially focus {{on the development of the}} other types of nuclear transfer to prevent mtDNA disorders.

40|$|To gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of global methylation differ-ences associated with development of nuclear transfer (NT) -gen-erated cattle, we analyzed the genome-wide methylation status of spontaneously aborted cloned fetuses, <b>cloned</b> fetuses, and <b>adult</b> <b>clones</b> that were derived from transgenic and nontrans-genic cumulus, genital ridge, and body cell lines. Cloned fetuses were recovered from ongoing normal pregnancies and were morphologically normal. Fetuses generated by artificial insemi-nation (AI) were used as controls. In vitro fertilization (IVF) fe-tuses were compared with AI controls to assess effects of in vitro culture on the 5 -methylcytosine content of fetal genomes. All of the fetuses were female. Skin biopsies were obtained from <b>cloned</b> and AI-generated <b>adult</b> cows. All of the <b>adult</b> <b>clones</b> were phenotypically normal and lactating and had no history of health or reproductive disorders. Genome-wide cytosine meth-ylation levels were monitored by reverse-phase HPLC, and re-sults indicated reduced levels of methylated cytosine in NT-gen-erated fetuses. In contrast, no differences were observed be-tween <b>adult,</b> lactating <b>clones</b> and similarly aged lactating cows produced by AI. These data imply that survivability of cloned cattle may be closely related to the global DNA methylation status.

40|$|Cloning {{enables the}} {{generation}} of both clinically normal and pathological individuals from the same donor cells, and may therefore be a DNA sequence-independent driver of phenotypic variability. We took advantage of cattle clones with identical genotypes but different developmental abilities to investigate the role of epigenetic factors in perinatal mortality, a complex trait with increasing prevalence in dairy cattle. We studied livers from pathological clones dying during the perinatal period, clinically normal <b>adult</b> <b>clones</b> with the same genotypes as perinatal clones and conventional age-matched controls. The livers from deceased perinatal clones displayed histological lesions, modifications to quantitative histomorphometric and metabolic parameters such as glycogen storage and fatty acid composition, and an absence of birth-induced maturation. In a genome-wide epigenetic analysis, we identified DNA methylation patterns underlying these phenotypic alterations and targeting genes relevant to liver metabolism, including the type 2 diabetes gene TCF 7 L 2. The <b>adult</b> <b>clones</b> were devoid of major phenotypic and epigenetic abnormalities in the liver, ruling out the effects of genotype on the phenotype observed. These results thus provide the first demonstration of a genome-wide association between DNA methylation and perinatal mortality in cattle, and highlight epigenetics as a driving force for phenotypic variability in farmed animals...|$|R

Cattle cloning can be performed by a large number of laboratories around the world, and the efficiency of nuclear transfer in cattle is the highest among all species in which successful cloning has been achieved. However, an understanding of the expression of imprinted genes in this important species is lacking. In the present study, real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was utilized to quantify the expression of the bovine Igf 2, Igf 2 r, and H 19 genes in eight major organs (brain, bladder, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and thymus) of somatic cell cloned calves that died shortly after birth, in three tissues (skin, muscle, and liver) of healthy clones that survived to adulthood, and in corresponding tissues of control animals from natural reproduction. We found that, deceased bovine cloned calves exhibited abnormal expression of all three genes studied in various organs. Large variations in the expression levels of imprinted genes were also seen among these clones, which were produced from the same genetic donor. In surviving <b>adult</b> <b>clones,</b> however, the expression of these imprinted genes was largely normal, except for the expression of the Igf 2 gene in muscle, which was highly variable. Our data showed disruptions of expression of imprinted genes in bovine clones, which is possibly due to incomplete reprogramming of donor cell nuclei during nuclear transfer, and these abnormalities may be associated with the high neonatal mortality in cloned animals; clones that survived to adulthood, however, are not only physically healthy but also relatively normal at the molecular level of those three imprinted genes...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess whether}} {{heterozygosity}} of the donor cell genome {{was a general}} parameter crucial for long-term survival of cloned animals, we tested the ability of embryonic stem (ES) cells with either an inbred or F 1 genetic background to generate cloned mice by nuclear transfer. Most clones derived from five F 1 ES cell lines survived to adulthood. In contrast, clones from three inbred ES cell lines invariably died shortly after birth due to respiratory failure. Comparison of mice derived from nuclear cloning, in which a complete blastocyst is derived from a single ES cell, and tetraploid blastocyst complementation, in which only the inner cell mass is formed from a few injected ES cells, allows us to determine which phenotypes depend on the technique or {{on the characteristics of}} the ES cell line. Neonatal lethality also has been reported in mice entirely derived from inbred ES cells that had been injected into tetraploid blastocysts (ES cell-tetraploids). Like inbred clones, ES cell-tetraploid pups derived from inbred ES cell lines died shortly after delivery with signs of respiratory distress. In contrast, most ES cell-tetraploid neonates, derived from six F 1 ES cell lines, developed into fertile <b>adults.</b> <b>Cloned</b> pups obtained from both inbred and F 1 ES cell nuclei frequently displayed increased placental and birth weights whereas ES cell-tetraploid pups were of normal weight. The potency of F 1 ES cells to generate live, fertile adults was not lost after either long-term in vitro culture or serial gene targeting events. We conclude that genetic heterozygosity is a crucial parameter for postnatal survival of mice that are entirely derived from ES cells by either nuclear cloning or tetraploid embryo complementation.

Here, we use long-term in vivo genetic lineage tracing and clonal analysis of individual cells from kidneys undergoing development, maintenance, and regeneration. We show that the adult mammalian kidney undergoes continuous tubulogenesis via expansions of fate-restricted clones. Kidneys recovering from damage undergo tubulogenesis through expansions of clones with segment-specific borders, and renal spheres developing in vitro from individual cells maintain distinct, segment-specific fates. Analysis of mice derived by transfer of color-marked embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into uncolored blastocysts demonstrates that nephrons are polyclonal, developing from expansions of singly fated clones. Finally, we show that <b>adult</b> renal <b>clones</b> are derived from Wnt-responsive precursors, and their tracing in vivo generates tubules that are segment specific. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate that fate-restricted precursors functioning as unipotent progenitors continuously maintain and self-preserve the mouse kidney throughout life...|$|R

While general biology of palms is well studied, there are gaps {{in the literature on}} palm growth through life stages and in response to environmental conditions. Literature gaps on palm growth could be caused by the slow growth of palms; it is difficult to monitor morphology and architecture for the periods of time necessary to capture changes. Acoelorrhaphe wrightii is a threatened palm native to southern Florida with an unusual adult architecture. The purpose of this dissertation was to study growth A. wrightii throughout its life stages and in response to changes in environmental conditions. In order to do study growth, I first had to understand the evolutionary history and types of vegetative branching in palms to identify vegetative branching possibilities in A. wrightii. I described branching types for 1903 species from all 181 genera using literature reviews and hands-on analysis. I then studied adult morphology and architecture in a common garden setting by monitoring leaf morphology, ramet growth and architecture of A. wrightii in two gardens in Miami, FL, over a two year period. I tested the effects of water and light on germination and growth of juvenile plants in a mesocosm where water and light were manipulated, following growth for a year. Finally, I compared leaf morphology and architecture of adult individuals in four populations in Belize and Florida. I found five branching types were present in the palms: lateral axillary branching, shoot apical division, false vivipary, abaxial branching and leaf-opposed branching. In the garden, Acoelorrhaphe wrightii displayed two types of lateral axillary branching: basal suckering and rhizomatous branching. The two branching types produced tiers in <b>adult</b> <b>clones,</b> which were used to model architecture. Ramets had an establishment period and growth varied seasonally in establishing and established phases. Low water levels and full sun yielded greater germination of A. wrighti and produced juveniles with a greater number of leaves, more root mass and more branches.
