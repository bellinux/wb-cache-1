5|$|After leaving Marquette, Heikkinen {{worked as}} {{executive}} secretary and {{attorney for the}} Studebaker-Packard Corporation. He later joined the legal staff at General Motors, retiring in 1978 after 20 years of service in GM’s legal department. Heikkinen helped initiate and implement a corporation-wide alcohol treatment and education program <b>at</b> <b>GM.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2001, Heisley {{announced}} that he had selected Memphis. Memphis and Louisville were the most promising cities, with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in Louisville. The choice would still have to be studied by a five-member NBA group before permission was granted from the league. The team's final game <b>at</b> <b>GM</b> Place was a 95–100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14; the team's final game as a Vancouver-based franchise was a road 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission {{over the life of the}} VL. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. <b>At</b> <b>GM</b> headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E

25|$|The AMC {{influence}} {{also continued}} at General Motors. GM recruited a new executive team to turn itself from near bankruptcy {{in the early}} 2000s. Among the new strategists <b>at</b> <b>GM</b> was Lutz who brought {{an understanding of the}} importance of passion in the product design. Lutz implemented a new thinking <b>at</b> <b>GM</b> that incorporated the systems and structures that originated from AMC's lean and focused operations.|$|E

Smith voluntarily retired from GM, and later toured the new Saturn facility in Tennessee, which he brought to fruition, in 1991.|$|E

25|$|While <b>at</b> <b>GM,</b> Mann {{was active}} in the New Directions Movement, a {{national}} UAW reform group founded by Jerry Tucker in 1986. New Directions aimed for a more democratic union and opposed the UAW’s collaboration with Ford, GM and Chrysler, its support of anti-Japanese protectionism and its support of “labor-management cooperation”. Mann continues to contribute significantly to organizing and redefining the union movement in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Chevrolet Cruze was {{launched}} in the Chinese market on April 18, 2009 as a sedan manufactured <b>at</b> <b>GM</b> India's Halol factory. Transmission choices were a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic along with 1.6- or 1.8-liter engines. The sedan range consisted of the 1.6 SL, 1.6 SE, 1.8 SE (automatic only) and 1.8 SX (automatic only). Hatchback models were introduced in 2013 available with the 1.6-liter or 1.6-liter turbo engines.|$|E
25|$|An all-new Grand Prix was {{scheduled}} for 1972. However, a 67-day corporate-wide strike <b>at</b> <b>GM</b> in late 1970 that hobbled the 1971 model introduction set back 1972 model production plans and the new A and G-body cars planned for 1972 were delayed for introduction by {{one year to the}} 1973 model year. Production numbers increased substantially after two years of decline, reaching 91,961 units and only second place to the 1969 model.|$|E

The 1970 Ford Thunderbird styling change was reportedly ordered by Ford Motor Co. president Bunkie Knudsen, {{who moved from}} GM to Ford in 1968 after a long career <b>at</b> <b>GM</b> which included the position of general manager for the Pontiac Motor Division from 1956 to 1961 and ordered {{the addition of the}} Grand Prix to the 1962 model lineup.|$|E

25|$|LaSalle sales had {{consistently}} exceeded Cadillac's since 1933, so {{the question}} arises, why did GM decide to drop LaSalle? Evidently {{the lesson of the}} Packard One-Twenty had been weighing on the minds of the executives <b>at</b> <b>GM.</b> Since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle, with sales volume exceeding Cadillac's counterpart by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively. Since LaSalle had been a Cadillac in all but name for most of its lifespan, it was {{decided it was time to}} bestow upon it the prestigious title of Cadillac.|$|E

25|$|As {{short as}} this {{agreement}} was, {{it gave the}} UAW instant legitimacy. The workers there also got a 5% increase in pay and were allowed to talk during lunch. The UAW capitalized on that opportunity, signing up 100,000 GM employees and building the union's strength through grievance strikes <b>at</b> <b>GM</b> plants throughout the country. Several participants in the strike, including Charles I. Krause, went on to greater prominence within the union. Other notable participants in the sit-down strike were future D-Day hero and Greco-Roman wrestling champion Dean Rockwell, labor leader and future UAW president Walter Reuther, and the uncle of documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, whose debut feature Roger & Me contains a clip from the strike.|$|E
25|$|A mid-engine layout was {{originally}} chosen {{as a way}} to reduce both aerodynamic drag and vehicle weight to improve fuel efficiency, and also for its handling, traction, and braking benefits. However, the sports car potential of the mid-engine layout was not realized when the Fiero debuted. As a cost-saving measure commonly employed <b>at</b> <b>GM,</b> the tires, brakes, and suspension components were carried over from other GM economy cars (like the X and T platforms). As a result, the handling and cornering abilities of the initial Fiero were merely on par with other contemporary sporty coupes (Road & Track 1985). Additionally, the Iron Duke I4 motor, which was designed for optimal running at low RPM, was unsuited to drivers who purchased the Fiero expecting a quick, high-revving motor more in keeping with the design of the car. As drivers attempted to frequently run the engine at greater RPM than it was designed for, the engines experienced a number of reliability problems and breakdowns were frequent.|$|E
