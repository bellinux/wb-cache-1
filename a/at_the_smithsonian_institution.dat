5|$|Conchology is the {{scientific}} study of mollusc shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells. Many people pick up shells on the beach or purchase them and display them in their homes.

Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's grandfather, recruiting Milo to lead an expedition to Atlantis, as soon as he receives it.|$|E
5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who {{emigrated to the}} USA in 1894. Wrensted learned her craft from her {{maternal}} aunt, Charlotte Borgen, {{and for a time}} in the 1880s operated a studio on Torvet 8, in Horsens, Denmark. Much of her photographic career is anchored to her studio in Pocatello, a small town in southeastern Idaho, where she took photographs of the local inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. Perhaps her most famous work remains her documentary photographs of the Shoshone Great Basin Native Americans which are considered of great anthropological importance. Wrensted became a U.S. citizen in 1912, at age 53, and in the same year ended her career as a photographer. Many of her Native American images are preserved <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> and National Archives.|$|E

5000|$|The entire cast reunited for <b>the</b> {{first time}} <b>at</b> an August 1975 Chicago {{convention}} that 16,000 attended. [...] "Star Trek" [...] Lives!, an early history and exploration of Trekkie culture published that year, {{was the first}} mass-market book to introduce fan fiction {{and other aspects of}} fandom to a wide audience. By 1976 there were more than 250 Star Trek clubs, and at least three rival groups organized 25 conventions that attracted thousands to each. While discussing that year whether to name the first Space Shuttle Enterprise, Jim Cannon, Gerald R. Fords domestic policy advisor, described Trekkies as [...] "one of the most dedicated constituencies in the country". [...] "Unprecedented" [...] crowds visited a 1992 Star Trek exhibit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institutions</b> National Air and Space Museum, and in 1994, when Star Trek reruns still aired in 94% of the United States, over 400,000 attended 130 conventions.

5|$|Haynes' car is {{believed}} to be the second gasoline-engine powered vehicle successfully road tested in the United States, according to its exhibit information <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution.</b> It was built two years before Henry Ford's Quadricycle, and preceded only by Charles Duryea's Motorized Wagon less than a year earlier. Unlike Duryea's car, which was an adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power but still able to be pulled by horse, Haynes' car was designed only to run on its own. Some automotive historians use this difference to determine that Haynes' car was the first true American automobile. The Sintz company continued to be intrigued by Haynes' use of their motor and sent representatives to photo his vehicle and published the images as an advertisement for one of their engine's possible uses. The publicity spurred the creation of numerous other automobiles across the American midwest.|$|E
5|$|The cannon's fate is disputed. According to the memoirs (written in the 1890s) of Gonzales {{blacksmith}} Noah Smithwick, {{the cannon}} was abandoned after the cart's axles began to smoke during a march to San Antonio de Béxar {{to assist in}} Austin's siege. Smithwick reported that the cannon was buried near a creek not far from Gonzales. A small iron cannon was exposed during a June 1936 flood near Gonzales. In 1979, this cannon was purchased by Dr. Patrick Wagner, who believed it matched Smithwick's descriptions of the cannon used in the battle. The Curator of Military History <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> verified that Wagner's cannon was a type of small swivel gun used in America through 1836. The Conservation Laboratory at the University of Texas confirmed that Wagner's cannon had been buried in moist ground for an extended time period.|$|E

5000|$|The tragic Paluxy River {{flood in}} 1908 {{uncovered}} 3-toed prints from the Cretaceous period, possibly Acrocanthosaurus, and were discovered {{by high school}} student George Adams in the limestone river bed. The teenager relayed the discovery to his principal, Robert McDonald. Adams later ended up selling self-manufactured fake [...] "giant man tracks" [...] to tourists sometime during the 1930s, sparking a debate {{about whether or not}} humans existed alongside dinosaurs. In 1934, resident Charlie Moss discovered footprints of 4-toed sauropods. Resident Jim Ryals dug out the actual dinosaur prints and sold them to tourists. Paleontologist Roland T. Bird of the American Museum of Natural History in New York spotted the Adams [...] "giant man tracks" [...] in a tourist shop in Gallup, New Mexico, and, while recognizing them as fakes, was still intrigued enough to travel to Somervell County to see the Glen Rose area for himself. Bird's visit resulted in a 2-year WPA project to uncover the dinosaur prints.

500|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{exhibition}} in 1883, the Pennsylvania Railroad ended up resolving two problems <b>at</b> once. In <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution,</b> <b>the</b> railroad {{was able to}} find a home for the historic locomotive, as well as a suitable new employer for a young civil engineer named J. Elfreth Watkins. Watkins had been involved in an accident on the railroad in New Jersey a few years before the exhibition. [...] He had lost a leg in the accident, so he was no longer suited to the physical demands of railroad work, although the railroad did employ him as a clerk for a while after his accident. The PRR employed his engineering experience as an expert curator for the Smithsonian's new Arts and Industries Building, which was opened in 1880. [...] The locomotive's first public exhibition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> occurred on December 22, 1884, where it was displayed in the East Hall of the Arts and Industries building.|$|R
50|$|The {{winner of}} the auction was American {{jewellery}} company Tiffany & Co., who initially set the emerald in a tiara. The tiara remained unsold for several decades, so in 1950 the stone was removed and re-set into a brooch. The brooch was featured with matching earrings in that year's Christmas catalogue. It remained with the company until 1955, when it was purchased by Janet Annenberg Hooker, a philanthropic heiress and the emerald's namesake, for an undisclosed price. In 1977, Hooker donated the brooch, then valued <b>at</b> US$500,000, to <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> in Washington, D.C..

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIAlong the {{south-western}} {{coast of}} South America, three genera of fossil phocids (true seals) have been formally described {{from the late}} Neogene: Acrophoca and Piscophoca from Chile and Peru, and, more recently, Hadrokirus from Peru, which all represent medium-to large-sized phocids. Here, we report the discovery of Australophoca changorum gen. et sp. nov., a diminutive phocid from the late Miocene of the Bahia Inglesa Formation (northern Chile) and Pisco Formation (southern Peru), comparable in size with the smallest species of modern phocids. This taxon is based on diagnostic postcranial material, including a humerus that has an elongated deltopectoral crest but lacks an entepicondylar foramen; a femur with a subtrochanteric fossa, among other characters; in combination with a relatively small body size. All these features together distinguish A. changorum from all other reported pinnipeds. This new taxon not only increases the taxonomic and morphological diversity of phocids of the late Neogene of the eastern South Pacific Ocean, but it also provides new insights about the evolutionary history of fossil pinniped assemblages in South America and, broadly, in the southern hemisphere.
