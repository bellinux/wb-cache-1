5|$|The {{converted}} carrier aircraft were heavier {{versions of}} their land-based predecessors and this required {{a host of}} changes to Graf Zeppelins original design: the existing catapults needed modernization; stronger winches were necessary for the arresting gear; the flight deck, elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement. Changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well: installation of air search radar sets and antennas; upgraded radio equipment; an armored fighter director cabin mounted on the main mast (which in turn meant a heavier, sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin's added weight); extra <b>armoring</b> for the bridge and fire control center; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter director cabin from smoke; replacing the single-mount 20mm AA guns with quadruple Flakvierling 38 guns (with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply) to improve overall AA defense; and additional bulges {{on either side of}} the hull to preserve the ship's stability under all this added weight.|$|E

25|$|In the {{presence}} of heavy metals, calcium silicate reacts in a different manner than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the bulk solution, and if heavy metals are present, precipitation of the metal hydroxides (with extremely low solubilities) is normally accelerated and the potential of <b>armoring</b> of limestone particles increases significantly. In the calcium silicate aggregate, as silicic acid species are absorbed onto the metal surface, the development of silica layers (mono- and bi-layers) lead {{to the formation of}} colloidal complexes with neutral or negative surface charges. These negatively charged colloids create an electrostatic repulsion with each other (as well as with the negatively charged calcium silicate granules) and the sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a dispersed state - effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to <b>armoring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Several {{types of}} Iron Man <b>armors</b> were also {{featured}} in the Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes episode [...] "Shell Games". The <b>armors</b> that were featured were the Mark I <b>Armor,</b> Stealth <b>Armor,</b> Hulkbuster <b>Armor,</b> Arctic <b>Armor,</b> War Machine <b>Armor,</b> and the Silver Centurion <b>Armor.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{numerous}} alternate <b>armors</b> that Stark uses in special occasions, including the Silver Centurion <b>Armor,</b> the Stealth <b>Armor</b> and the Hulkbuster <b>armor</b> (which was originally named the Dynamo Buster <b>armor).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Amtgard also {{utilizes}} <b>armor</b> for {{a number}} of classes. <b>Armor</b> grants anywhere from 1 to 6 points to a covered hit location. <b>Armor</b> receives a rating based on the type of <b>armor</b> and materials and techniques used to construct it. Each class is able to wear <b>armor</b> ranging from 0 to 6 points. A player may wear <b>armor</b> that is rated higher than the maximum allowed by their class, but it only grants <b>armor</b> up to the class maximum. Regular weapon hits to covered locations remove a single point of <b>armor,</b> however, several classes, spells and creatures are able to remove additional points per blow. Combat involving <b>armor</b> is simple in Amtgard. There are essentially three kinds of damage <b>armor</b> may be subject to. Normal melee attacks remove a single point. <b>Armor</b> breaking attacks will remove one point of <b>armor</b> from a location with more than three points, and all remaining points from a location with 3 or less points. An <b>armor</b> destroying attack will remove all <b>armor</b> from a location struck. Other class abilities enhance all <b>armor</b> worn to [...] "Ancestral Armor", which is removed one point at a time, regardless of the type of damage it is being struck with. As <b>armor</b> in Amtgard is not physically functional, realism and aesthetics are encouraged with <b>armor</b> in Amtgard, in order to enhance atmosphere and balance the substantial benefits offered by <b>armor.</b> Non-period, modern-looking materials and shoddy construction can reduce the protection granted by the <b>armor.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{benefits}} of the A-kit/B-kit principle are that armor is only fitted when required, reducing vehicle wear and tear and, by default, whole life cycle costs. Improvements and/or upgrades to armor are also far easier to integrate into an appliqu√© solution. No quantity for JLTV <b>armoring</b> kits has yet been disclosed, but it is anticipated that the estimated $65,000 kits will be procured on a 'one kit to three vehicle' basis. The overall protection solution will include a spall liner to minimize perforation effects within a vehicle when the vehicle takes hostile fire.|$|E
25|$|The armor {{system for}} LVSR follows the A-kit/B-kit principle, with {{vehicles}} designed 'fitted for, but not with', protection. In {{the case of}} LVSR, 'fitted for' includes an armored cab floor as standard. Cargo and wrecker variants require an upgrade of the front springs. Protection kits can be installed and uninstalled from vehicles in the field using only basic tools. The A-kit is fitted on the production line and is {{the combination of a}} limited amount of <b>armoring</b> (in difficult-to-access areas of the vehicle), together with a significant amount of armour installation attachments and required support structures. The bulk of the armor, the B-kit, is installed in the field on an 'as required' basis.|$|E
25|$|Preparing for {{sea-level rise}} can be {{justified}} in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared {{to the cost of}} reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, long-lived infrastructure, and coastal land-use planning. Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline <b>armoring</b> over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E

25|$|The Storm SRTV {{is based}} on an {{original}} design by BC Customs (BCC) of Utah, originally submitted for the Ground Mobility Vehicle System (GMV 1.1) competition hosted by SOCOM. It is in the tactical family of SXOR Mobility Vehicles of SXOR Motorsports. It is a highly mobile 2-door off-roading pickup truck design with all-wheel-drive. The light-weight tactical vehicle has a high performance mid-engine for maximum stability with 430 horsepower and 425lb-ft of torque. The SRTV can exceed double its curb weight in payload while performing missions. The engine will run using standard gasoline, 87 Octane or higher, diesel, or JP-8. The SRTV is constructed of MIL-STD aircraft tubing, minimizing weight, maximizing strength, and providing a skeletal base for multiple types of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ballistic and blast <b>armoring.</b> The vehicle utilizes identical components with multiple body configurations, hence, it provides multi-role configurations.|$|E
25|$|Copeland Creek and {{its tributaries}} drain this property; moreover, all of these streams rise on Sonoma Mountain and {{eventually}} discharge to the Laguna de Santa Rosa, which discharges to the Russian River. The Copeland Creek watershed is the southernmost drainage in the Russian River drainage basin. All creeks south of Copeland, beginning with Lichau Creek, {{are part of the}} San Francisco Bay watershed. Precipitation within the Copeland Creek watershed is considered moderate within the state of California; in fact, the maximum intensity for an historic one-hour rainfall is classified as below average (at about 1.90inches (48millimeters) per hour). Since many of these upper reaches of Copeland Creek involve steep slopes, often above 50percent, the momentum of streamflow in winter months is high. Even though soils in the watershed are moderately erosive, the extensive basaltic <b>armoring</b> of Copeland Creek minimizes sedimentation and produces an outcome of stream waters lacking in significant turbidity.|$|E

25|$|In June 1905 the NTC finally {{approved}} Skvortsov's {{proposal to}} decrease deck armor, saving 130 tonnes of gross weight. This {{was only a}} prelude to a major redesign of the ships's protection scheme. In August 1905 Krylov and Skvortsov independently raised concerns about the ship's stability in combat. Skvortsov wrote that although the maximum roll angle was set at a respectable 30¬∞, combat damage would reduce it to an unacceptably low 15¬∞. The only solution, he wrote, was to extend belt armor upward, effectively <b>armoring</b> the whole freeboard surface. Skvortsov compensated the added weight with the removal of two 8-inch gun turrets and yet another redesign of the remaining turrets. The NTC, scared by the losses at Tsushima, approved the proposal. They were not yet aware {{of the effectiveness of}} counter-flooding system of the Borodino-class battleships. Counter-flooding enabled survival of Oryol but her crewmen were still held prisoners in Japan. Their experience materialized in a counter-flooding system designed by Skvortsov in the summer of 1906.|$|E

500|$|The {{battle is}} {{significant}} in the technological history of the Song navy. The technological advances of the Song navy ensured its access to the East China Sea, where they competed with the military forces of Jin and Mongol rivals. Although huopao launched by the ship-mounted trebuchets had been invented decades earlier, the bombs did not become mandatory on Song warships until 1129. Paddle-wheel ships operated with treadmills were constructed continuously in various sizes between 1132 and 1183. The engineer Gao Xuan devised a ship outfitted with up to eleven paddle wheels on each side, and Qin Shifu, another engineer, designed the iron plating for <b>armoring</b> the ships in 1203. All these advances supported a rapid increase {{in the size of}} the force; according to the 20th-century historian Joseph Needham, [...] "From a total of 11 squadrons and 3,000 men [...] rose in one century to 20 squadrons totalling 52,000 men".|$|E

They suggested that the ship be cut down to the top of her gun deck, <b>armoring</b> her sides and deck and mounting four revolving Ericsson gun turrets, each mounting two [...] or [...] guns. This scheme would give her an ample [...] of freeboard. Aside from reinforcing her hull to carry the weight of the turrets, the only other changes that they recommended were the elimination of the hoisting screw, replacement by a propeller smaller in diameter, and the addition of a ram.

500|$|Spain's Republican Forces {{fabricated}} {{a number}} of different armored vehicles throughout the war. Although serving little military purpose, due to the poor quality of their design and construction, they were important factors in lifting the Popular Front's military's morale. [...] Factories in the northern areas of Spain produced a fair number of armored tractors and trucks; for example, sixteen armored vehicles, denominated Naval-Somua, were manufactured based on the chassis of the French Somua bus. [...] The Trubia Factory, at this time working for the Republic, manufactured between 15 and 20 light tanks known as the Trubia-Naval, which were heavily influenced by the Landesa and the Trubia A4. [...] However, most construction revolved around the <b>armoring</b> of trucks, known as Tiznaos for the grey color of their steel armor.
