The clinic recruited volunteer doctors, Physician Assistants, medical students, nurses, pharmacists, EMTs, and paramedics from different parts of the United States to volunteer for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. Medications and medical tools were donated by dozens of organizations including Pfizer, which donated the majority of the medications used. During its three months of operation, the clinic had over 5,500 documented patient encounters.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Railway {{was unhappy}} with the {{performance}} and safety of the D Class locomotives and sold them between 1916 and 1922. With much of their route close to London now electrified the MR had surplus steam locomotives, and two Metropolitan Railway A Class locomotives, numbers 23 (built 1866) and 41 (built 1869), were transferred to the route. Built by Beyer, Peacock and Company from 1864, the A Class {{had been the first}} locomotives owned by the Metropolitan (in 1863, the first year of operation, the MR had used engines loaned from the GWR). Although the most advanced locomotives regularly to work the route, the A Class predated all other rolling stock on the Tramway. The two locomotives operated for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. Occasionally, the MR substituted other similar locomotives.|$|E

Workers in the mills worked an average of 54 hours <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> average rate of just over 20 cents per hour and were threatened with a loss of income through an uncompensated cut of working hours. A demand grew among the millworkers for full 54 hours pay for the new 48-hour working week.|$|R
5|$|The group {{became a}} {{professional}} band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry. During this time, the group accepted a position {{playing at the}} nearby Canyonland theme park. The park would bring in established stars, such as Jerry Wallace, Bobby Bare, and Narvel Felts, and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set. After a while, with opportunities for the band slimmed, a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston, Alabama. Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University, and Cook had an electronics job. The trio shared at $56-a-month apartment in Anniston, working to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs. The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast. In March, the band relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, performing six nights <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> club named The Bowery for tips. They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard. The group could not secure a record contract and began to self-finance recordings. The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows. Vartanian {{dropped out of the}} group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.|$|E

25|$|The Netflix {{model has}} also {{affected}} viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly {{eight out of}} 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule. Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes {{at a time of}} their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.|$|E
25|$|Experiments in mice, rats, {{and dogs}} {{have shown that}} a degree of 25% {{deuteration}} causes (sometimes irreversible) sterility, because neither gametes nor zygotes can develop. High concentrations of heavy water (90%) rapidly kill fish, tadpoles, flatworms, and Drosophila.

It is more toxic to malignant cells than normal cells but the concentrations needed are too high for regular use. As in chemotherapy, deuterium-poisoned mammals die of a failure of bone marrow (bleeding and infection) and intestinal-barrier functions (diarrhea and fluid loss).|$|E
25|$|While Genie {{lived with}} the Riglers her mother usually met with her once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> park or restaurant, and their {{relationship}} continued to grow stronger. Although the Riglers never expressed antipathy towards Genie's mother their efforts to be polite to her inadvertently came off as condescension, and years later Marilyn said she was uncomfortable acting as a mother to Genie in her house with Genie's real mother present. With the exception of Jay Shurley, who felt the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, Genie's mother did not get along well with the other researchers, some of whom disliked her due to her apathy during Genie's childhood. The scientists speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they reminded her of her earlier inaction on behalf of her children, and David Rigler also thought she was in denial about Genie's condition and the hand she had in causing it. Curtiss wrote that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements about her married life and Genie's childhood, seemingly saying what she thought people wanted to hear, which the research team believed was {{out of fear of}} reprobation or ostracism for telling the truth.|$|E

500|$|John Bolt {{was born}} on 19 May 1921 in Laurens, South Carolina, to Thomas Crews Bolt and Brucie Bolt (née Bagwell). John had a younger brother, Bruce. In 1924 {{the family moved to}} Sanford, Florida. In his youth, John Bolt gained the {{nickname}} [...] "Jack" [...] from his friends and family. His family was poor and he was for the most part responsible for providing his own clothes and social expenses {{from the time he was}} ten years old. He worked several part-time jobs, at one point working 30 to 40 hours <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> local creamery in addition to attending school. He also enrolled in the Boy Scouts, eventually attaining the rank of Star Scout.|$|E
500|$|Life Begins was {{inspired}} by Bullen's re-evaluation {{of the lives of}} people around him as they approached 40 years old. During a conversation with a friend he realised that three women he knew had had failed marriages {{by the time they reached}} 40. The series was designed as a vehicle for actress Sarah Lancashire, who had signed an exclusive [...] "golden handcuffs" [...] deal with ITV. Two months after the series was announced, Lancashire left Life Begins, feeling unable to commit to a potentially long-running series. ITV replaced Lancashire with Caroline Quentin. Life Begins concerns Maggie Mee, who believes she is in a loving relationship with her husband Phil (Alexander Armstrong). When Phil announces on a family holiday that he is leaving her, she realises that she must begin her life again. Bullen wrote the series with John Forte. The first series was broadcast in 2004. As with Cold Feet, he integrated events from his own life into the storylines; Maggie's father suffers from Alzheimer's disease as does one of Bullen's own relatives. He researched Maggie's travel agency job by spending <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> travel agents' in Bristol.|$|E

500|$|U2 hired Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno {{to produce}} the album, based on the duo's prior work with the band on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree. Lanois was {{principal}} producer, with Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis as engineer. Eno took on an assisting role, working with the group in the studio for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time to review their songs before leaving {{for a month or}} two. Eno said his role was [...] "to come in and erase anything that sounded too much like U2". By distancing himself from the work, he believed he provided the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them. As he explained, [...] "I would deliberately not listen to the stuff in between visits, so I could go in cold". Since U2 wanted the record to be harder-hitting and live-sounding, Lanois [...] "push the performance aspect very hard, often to the point of recklessness". The Lanois–Eno team used lateral thinking and a philosophical approach—popularised by Eno's Oblique Strategies—that contrasted with the direct and retro style of Rattle and Hum producer Jimmy Iovine.|$|E
500|$|A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{unveiled}} the government's plans in his Queen's Speech. The plans included the duty {{for parents to}} assist their children in education or training participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation {{in some form of}} education or training until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015. This was referred to as raising the [...] "participation age" [...] to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16. To qualify as participation the young person must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day <b>a</b> <b>week</b> (<b>at</b> <b>a</b> minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available. The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion, so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training.|$|E
