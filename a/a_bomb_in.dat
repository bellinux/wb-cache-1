The head office in Essen suffered a direct hit from <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> March 1945, and regional offices and construction centres in Danzig, Halle, Katowice, Königsberg, Kraków, Leipzig and Magdeburg were lost as the territory they were in was allotted to Poland or the Soviet Zone of occupation.

5|$|Jim Caviezel's character, Carroll Oerstadt, {{seemed to}} mirror {{in several ways}} the story of Timothy McVeigh, a {{domestic}} terrorist who destroyed the Alfred P.

Caviezel and Scott did not deny this, and both admitted that the Oerstadt character was at least partly based on McVeigh. Ross Johnson of The New York Times also compared the ferry bombing at the film's beginning to the Oklahoma City bombing.|$|E

5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, {{there were}} many plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which {{proceeded}} to significant degrees. The most well known, the 20 July plot, came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war. In July 1944, in the 20 July plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, Claus von Stauffenberg planted <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> one of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. Later, Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900people.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez {{was convicted}} on bank fraud charges {{and became an}} FBI {{informant}} {{in exchange for a}} lower sentence. However, due to the EPB's policies of anonymity, most of the information was hampered by the use of codenames and useless for the investigation. During this time, there were internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful husband. On January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.|$|E

5|$|After her refit was {{completed}} on 18 January 1944, Steinbrinck {{and her sister}} Theodor Riedel spent {{the first half of}} the year laying minefields at the entrance to the Skaggerak and escorting convoys to and from Norway. On 3 May the ship passed through the Kiel Canal en route to Hamburg for a lengthy refit. While in the dockyard, she was struck by <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> the diesel generator room on 18 June. Despite the extent of the damage, the dockyard reported that her refit would be completed as scheduled on 20 November. On 4 November another bomb detonated alongside Steinbrinck and caused extensive flooding and shock damage from the explosion. The ship was patched up and towed to Wesermünde for more thorough repairs, but her completion was seriously delayed. By 1 April 1945, only a single engine was operable and the Kriegsmarine made the decision to strip her crew for combat duties ashore after she was moved to Cuxhaven.

5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player {{to let them know}} that they have hidden <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E
5|$|Fearing that Darvin may be {{attempting}} to assassinate Kirk, the crew dress in period uniforms and investigate the Enterprise.

Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) get involved in a bar brawl between the Enterprise crew and a number of Klingons on shore leave. Captain Kirk disciplines them on the Enterprise alongside Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig). Bashir and O'Brien notice that the ship is covered with tribbles. Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) and Odo (René Auberjonois) detain Darvin and return him to the Defiant. There, Darvin admits that he planted <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> a tribble to kill Kirk.|$|E
5|$|In Deathmatch, {{all players}} compete {{against each other}} and the strongest player wins. Team Deathmatch is similar, but players form two teams. In Capture the Flag, a player must {{retrieve}} the flag from his enemy's base, and bring it to his own team's base. In Sabotage, one team must place <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> three different locations, while the opposite team must protect these areas; the protectors win if the time limit is exceeded (except if the time is set to infinite). The bomb is always found {{at the beginning of the}} team base, and the player who holds the bomb must wait 12 seconds until he may drop it and take shelter from the ensuing detonation. In The Hunt, players must shoot ghosts, which become gradually smaller after receiving hits. The player only has one weapon, the hunting gun, with which he can also shoot human opponents. Power Up is a deathmatch game, in which boxes containing special, temporary abilities, such as invisibility and higher speed, are found throughout the map.|$|E

Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes.
