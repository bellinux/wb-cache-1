It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Tested and {{effective}} <b>approaches</b> are available <b>to</b> prevent mental, emotional, {{and behavioral problems}} in youth, but they are underutilized. Communities That Care (CTC) is a coalition-based strategy that creates a local infrastructure for prevention service delivery that facilitates the community-wide adoption of <b>a</b> scientific <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> preventing these problems. A community-randomized trial of CTC in 24 communities, matched in pairs and randomly assigned to a control or an intervention condition, has demonstrated that CTC significantly increases the community-wide adoption of <b>a</b> science-based <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention, as reported by community leaders. For this dissertation, I first examined {{the extent to which}} the effect of CTC on the adoption of <b>a</b> community-wide scientific <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention varied significantly across matched community pairs. Results indicated significant and substantial variation in the effect of CTC on the adoption of <b>a</b> scientific <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention across the 12 community pairs. Next I explored potential sources of the variation across community pairs in community transformation toward <b>a</b> scientific <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention. These sources included five coalition capacities: member knowledge, member acquisition of new skills, member attitudes, organizational linkages, and influence on organizations. Findings indicated that CTC coalitions successfully built capacities. Results also showed that new skill acquisition by coalition members and the engagement of diverse sectors in coalition work, as reported by coalition members, moderated the relationship between CTC and the community-wide adoption of <b>a</b> science-based <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention. Finally, I explored whether the internal functioning of CTC coalitions predicted community-wide adoption of <b>a</b> science-based <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention directly or through a coalition culture that builds capacities necessary for coalitions to achieve system transformation. No significant direct effects of four dimensions of coalition functioning, (goal-directedness, efficiency, opportunities for participation, or cohesion,) on community-wide adoption of <b>a</b> science-based <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention were found. However, results suggest that coalition functioning may affect community adoption of <b>a</b> science-based <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention through <b>an</b> indirect pathway of building specific capacities: new member skills and organizational linkages to diverse sectors. Identification of these malleable coalition processes and capacities, which facilitate the community-wide adoption of <b>a</b> scientific <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> prevention, should be useful for improving the effectiveness of community coalitions focused on preventing adolescent mental, emotional, and behavioral problems...|$|R
