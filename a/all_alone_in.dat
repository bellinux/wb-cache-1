25|$|Rana Prasad Rao of Amarkot duly welcomed Humayun {{into his}} home and {{sheltered}} the refugees for several months. Here, in the household of a Hindu Rajput nobleman, Humayun's wife Hamida Bano, daughter of a Sindhi Shia family, {{gave birth to the}} future Emperor Akbar on 15 October 1542. The date of birth is well established because Humayun consulted his astronomer to utilise the astrolabe and check the location of the planets. The infant was the long-awaited heir-apparent to the 34-year-old Humayun and the answer of many prayers. Shortly after the birth, Humayun and his party left Amarkot for Sindh, leaving Hamida and her child in the custody of their Hindu hosts. A couple of years later, at Humayun's behest, Hamida would leave her infant son in the safety of remote Amarkot and join her husband as he fled into Persia, where her Shia and Persian background would bring influence. The infant Akbar was to live for more than five years, <b>all</b> <b>alone,</b> <b>in</b> the care of a Hindu, Rajput foster-family. This was to have a profound, indelible influence on his views and personality, and a momentous effect on the subsequent history of India. In particular, Akbar developed a strong affinity for the Rajputs, going {{out of his way to}} forge alliances (including marriage alliances) with them, and they would form the bedrock of support for his dynasty for two centuries.|$|E

Marie's paternal aunt, the Dowager German Empress, wrote to her daughter, the Crown Princess of Greece, that [...] "Missy of Roumania is more to be pitied than you. The King is a great tyrant in his family, & has crushed the independence in Ferdinand so that no one cares about him, & his beautiful & gifted little wife, I fear, gets into scrapes, & like a butterfly, instead of hovering over the flowers, burns her pretty wings by going rather near the fire!" [...] Easily learning to speak the Romanian language, she followed her mother's advice to dress carefully and show respect for Orthodox rituals.|$|E

Although Queen Victoria subsidised the {{education}} (at Rugby) of Dejazmatch Alemayehu Tewodros, Captain Tristam Speedy was appointed as his guardian. He developed a very strong attachment to Captain Speedy and his wife. However, Prince Alemayehu grew increasingly lonely as the years went by, and his compromised health made things even harder. He died in October 1879 at the age of 19 without seeing his homeland again. Prince Alemayehu left an impression on Queen Victoria, who wrote of his death in her journal: [...] "It is too sad! <b>All</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> a strange country, without a single person or relative belonging to him...

2500|$|According to Scorsese, {{the script}} {{was left to}} him and De Niro, and they spent two-and-a-half weeks {{on the island of}} Saint Martin {{extensively}} re-building the content of the film. The most significant change would be the entire scene when LaMotta fixes his television and then accuses his wife of having an affair. Other changes included the removal of Jake and Joey's father; the reduction of organized crime's role in the story and a major re-write of LaMotta's fight with Tony Janiro. They were also responsible for the end sequence where LaMotta is <b>all</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> his dressing room quoting the [...] "I could have been a contender" [...] scene from On the Waterfront. An extract of Richard III had been considered but Michael Powell {{thought it would be a}} bad decision within the context of an American film. According to Steven Bach, the first two screenwriters (Martin and Schrader) would receive credit, but since there was no payment to the writer's guild on the script, De Niro and Scorsese's work would remain uncredited.|$|E

The actress said that this leaves Lynsey to fight her own battles, teasing that the situation gets [...] "even worse before it gets better". Lynsey discovers Texas has been speaking to a girl online. Hassan explained that when Texas is telling Lynsey about the girl she realise that the correspondent is actually Silas who is planning to hurt Texas. Lynsey arranges to meet the correspondent in the woods, planning to take journalist Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) with her. However, Nancy does not plan to turn up following Silas' intervention. Hassan explained that Lynsey is unaware Nancy is not coming until [...] "the penny drops that she's <b>all</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the woods with Silas, she's absolutely terrified". Lynsey goes missing, with the actress explaining that nobody knows where her character is. Hassan explained that Brendan finds a note which he believes is from Lynsey telling him to meet her in the woods and because he is already suspicious of Silas he come to rescue Lynsey. Brendan arrives at the woods and discovers the body of Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) in his car before the police arrive and arrest Brendan. Lynsey soon after returns home.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, Chad was scripted {{as the son}} of Bill and Marsha Peterson. In June 2009 it was {{announced}} that David Leisure had been cast in the recurring role of D.A. Woods. In October 2009, the character's name was revised to Chad Peterson Woods when D.A. Woods was revealed to be his father. In February 2010 Soap Opera Digest reported that veteran soap actress, Jessica Tuck, known for her role as One Life to Live's Megan Gordon was cast in the role of Chad's mother. Deidrick explained that Chad goes to Kate for answers because she has been a [...] "mother figure." [...] Both the actor and executive producer Gary Tomlin enjoyed Chad's scenes with Koslow's Kate. Chad immediately confronts Madeline and he is [...] "completely devastated" [...] when she admits to being a former prostitute. Chad is fed up with his mother's lies and just wants everything out on the table. The revelation really impacts him in an [...] "inexplicable" [...] way. Deidrick described Chad's reaction as [...] "flabbergasted" [...] and wants to get away from her. When Chad witnesses Madeline's fall, he freezes for a moment because he is unable to [...] "process" [...] the situation. Such tragedy could have the potential to screw him up. Because Deidrick did not know the pain of losing a parent, let alone his own mother, the actor does his best to portray Chad during the scenes; Deidrick's first reaction as Chad is going into denial. Chad clings on to the little bit of courage he has left hoping to work things out with Charles in the future. According to Deidrick, the aftermath of his mother's death and his confrontation with Charles makes Chad a little [...] "cuckoo crazy." [...] Knowing Chad is <b>all</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the world Kate schemes to expose that Chad is Madeline's son with Kate's husband, Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) born on March 3, 1990, making him a whole year older than was initially said to be. The storyline showcased two very distinct sides to Chad's personality. According to Deidrick, during scenes with Kate, he intentionally emphasized Chad's vulnerabilities due to his mother's recent death; he is in desperate need of a mother figure at the moment, and Kate fills that void. Chad does not show that side of his personality too often for fear of getting hurt. On the other hand, Chad's relationship with his new found father Stefano appears to be a bit more volatile. The nature of the relationship is first displayed in November 2010 when Chad confronts Stefano with a knife and demands blood for a DNA test. Chad has no idea how to react to the DNA results. According to Deidrick, [...] " [...] struggles to find the courage to be able to love [...] who had a relationship with his mother and never knew he existed." [...] Deidrick explained that Chad rejects Stefano based on instinct. It is all he knows thanks to D.A. Woods who always pushes him away when things get difficult. However, Stefano is not easily turned away. Deidrick expected the role to be short lived thinking the character was only to wrap up the baby switch storyline. However, he accredited Gary Tomlin with fighting for the character and believing in him as an actor. Deidrick said that it was Tomlin's idea to attach him to a main family, [...] "So they made [...] a DiMera." ...|$|E
