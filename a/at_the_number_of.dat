25|$|Commonwealth {{involvement}} in the Boer War can be summarized into three parts. The first part (October 1899 – December 1899) was characterized by questionable decisions and blunders from the Commonwealth leadership which affected its soldiers greatly. The soldiers of the Commonwealth were shocked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Afrikaner soldiers {{who were willing to}} oppose the British. The Afrikaner troops were very willing to fight for their country, and were armed with modern weaponry and were highly mobile soldiers. This {{was one of the best}} examples of Guerrilla style warfare, which would be employed throughout the twentieth century after set piece fighting was seen as a hindrance by certain groups. The Boer soldiers would evade capture and secure provisions from their enemies therefore they were able to exist as a fighting entity for an indeterminate period of time.|$|E
25|$|There are ghost {{towns in}} parts of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec.

In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.

Even though the game was a best seller during the holiday season, retailers still stated that its sales figures did not meet expectations. Warner Communications also expressed disappointment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sales. Lower-than-expected sales figures combined with excess inventory, which produced a negative supply and demand event, prompted retailers to repeatedly discount price. According to Ray Kassar, about 3.5 million of the 4 million produced were sent back to the company as unsold inventory or customer returns. Despite sales figures, the quantity of unsold merchandise, coupled with the expensive movie license and the large number of returns, made E.T. a major financial failure for Atari.

500|$|In {{addition}} to assembly of weapons, the AFSWP supported nuclear weapons testing. For Operation Sandstone in 1948, Groves ordered Dorland to fill every possible job with his men.

The successful testing in Operation Sandstone was a major leap forward. The new Mark 4 nuclear bomb that the AEC began delivering in 1949 was a production design that was much easier to assemble and maintain, and enabled a bomb assembly team to be reduced to just 46 men.

In the reverse fixture, Cygan scored an own goal to cancel out Henry's first-half opener; the result left Arsenal in second position. Their next match was against PSV at the Philips Stadion, where after eight minutes the home side took the lead. Henry {{equalised}} for Arsenal, having created the chance following a one-two with Ljungberg. In the second half Lauren and Vieira were both sent off, for two bookable offences.

500|$|Produced as a {{side project}} by Kial Natale, Dylan Innes and Lee Majdoub, the concept {{originated}} in December 2008 from the desire to produce a live-action version of a series, with Natale wishing to focus on Grand Theft Auto, and Majdoub suggesting a film based upon Dragon Ball Z. After {{another member of the}} group suggested Pokémon as a possibility, they focused on that concept instead. Kial quickly wrote a script for the short film, while Majdoub and executive film producer Innes contributed additional material to flesh it out. Originally intended to be a film in the vein of CollegeHumor's parody productions, more scenes were added and visual effects improved due to Kial's love for the series and his desire for the film to be [...] "more and more". Planning of the film took four months, while filming and production took a year and a half. Varying crew sizes were used for the four different filming periods with the majority of filming occurring within one weekend.

500|$|In particular, the console's {{status as}} an add-on and poor timing after the {{announcement}} of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. [...] Allgame notes that [...] "very add-on whittled away <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales." [...] GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. [...] According to reviewer Blake Snow, [...] "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if {{you were one of the}} unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Reparaz noted that [...] "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons." [...] Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that [...] "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." [...] Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that [...] "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience." ...|$|E
