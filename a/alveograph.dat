40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of seven winter wheat cultivars from two harvest years were studied. Rheological testing included two empirical rheological methods, <b>alveograph</b> and extensograph. Principal component {{analysis on the}} studied rheological parameters showed that the <b>alveograph</b> and extensograph parameters are influenced by entirely different factors. The first component was responsible solely for the extensograph parameters, primarily for the resistance properties of dough samples. The second component affected the extensograph extensibility (E) and <b>alveograph</b> tenacity (P) parameters as well, {{in spite of the}} fact that these parameters refer to different properties of dough. The third component explained only <b>alveograph</b> parameters, such as P, L and G values. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients showed that the extensograph area parameter primarily depends on the maximum resistance to extension of dough (r= 0. 91). The extensibility and resistance at a constant extension of 5 cm properties did not show such strong relationship with the area parameter (r= 0. 56 and 0. 65, respectively).

40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of seventeen pure European wheat cultivars were analyzed and evaluated {{in relation to}} the bread volume. Rheological testing included two empirical rheological methods, farinograph and <b>alveograph,</b> and more fundamental creep-recovery experiments at shear stresses of 100 and 250 Pa. Principal component analysis on the farinograph and <b>alveograph</b> results showed that a wide range of {{rheological properties}} was present among the wheat cultivars. Correlation analysis pointed out that creep-recovery parameters showed significant correlations with protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value, farinograph water absorption, <b>alveograph</b> extensibility and bread volume. Amongst the rheological parameters, maximum recovery strain at a shear stress of 250 Pa showed the highest significant correlation with the bread volume (r= 0. 790 **). By multiple linear regression variables were combined to predict the bread volume. A combination of protein content, farinograph water absorption and <b>alveograph</b> P/L showed the best prediction (r²= 0. 80).

40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to predict Chopin <b>alveograph</b> or French {{bread-making}} tests, using tree-based models and PLS regressions. Data came from three sets of trials, involving 130, 214 and 103 different genotypes, which were described for HMW-GS, LMW-GS and small-scale tests currently used in breeding programs. Segmentation trees and PLS regressions indicated that HMW-GS and LMW-GS were not sufficient to explain alone the variability of bread wheat quality. This could be partly due to “allele × environment” and “locus × locus” interactions. For HMW-GS, Glu-B 1 was the predominant locus for <b>alveograph</b> and French bread-baking, and some differences in the alleles hierarchy were demonstrated according to the end-use parameter considered. For LMW-GS, Glu-B 3 seemed to be preponderant, with alleles b′, c and g being favourable and allele c′ unfavourable. Joint use of the information brought by glutenin subunits and technological tests did not enable to predict satisfactorily, neither the different parameters of French bread-baking, nor the extensibility L of <b>alveograph.</b> Only the prediction of the strength W proved reliable, and robust PLS equations were proposed for this <b>alveograph</b> parameter.

40|$|Protein {{content and}} quality {{determine}} flour quality, {{as well as}} the success of bread-baking. The stability of wheat quality characteristics is of great importance to the milling and baking industry, who have to produce an end product of acceptable and consistent quality to the consumers. It is, therefore important to classify cultivars and production regions according to their ability to produce high quality wheat grain. Seven spring wheat cultivars were grown at nine localities for the period 1992 to 1995 {{for the purpose of this}} study. The effect of cultivar, environment and their interaction on water absorption, <b>Alveograph</b> characteristics and loaf volume were described by AMMI (Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction) analyses. Environment was found to be by far the most important contributor to variance for all the characteristics determined. Except for water absorption, where the effect of cultivar was not significant, cultivar, environments, as well as cultivar x environment interaction, significantly affected all these characteristics. SST 16 showed considerable cultivar x environment interaction for water absorption, <b>Alveograph</b> W-value and loaf volume, indicating a lack in stability for these parameters. Adam Tas, on the other hand, showed sensitivity for the <b>Alveograph</b> characteristics. This tendency may be ascribed to the effect of cultivar x environment interaction on grain protein content.

According to the results of <b>alveograph</b> parameters, they decrease with the rate of incorporation of potato starch. This decrease can be corrected by adding vital gluten. The results of physicochemical analysis showed a decrease in protein levels, an increase in moisture content (about 2 %) and carbohydrates levels due to the composition of potato starch.

40|$|Most objectively, {{the dough}} {{rheological}} methods can characterize {{the quality of}} winter wheat.

40|$|Bread-making {{quality is}} one of the most {{important}} targets in the genetic improvement of wheat. Although extensive analyses of quality traits such as farinography, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sedimentation, alveography, and baking are made in breeding programs, these analyses require high amounts of seeds which are obtained only in late generations. In this experiment the statistical correlations between the high molecular weight subunit of glutenin and bread-making quality measured by <b>alveograph,</b> farinograph and SDS sedimentation were evaluated. Seventeen wheat genotypes were grown under the same conditions, each producing about 1 kg of seeds for the evaluations. The high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Statistical correlations were highly significant between HMW glutenin subunits and <b>alveograph</b> and SDS sedimentation. These results indicate the possibility of manipulating major genes for wheat seed quality by coupling traditional breeding with non-destructive single seed analysis. Only half seed is necessary to perform the SDS-PAGE analysis. Therefore, the other half seed can be planted to generate the progeny.

40|$|The {{effects of}} drought and heat stress on quality {{parameters}} of wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars were studied {{under field conditions}} in a 2 -year trial (2009 - 2010) in northwest Mexico. Under no stress conditions, rapid small-scale parameters [protein (GP; FP) content, SDS sedimentation (SDSS), mixograph peak time (MPT), swelling index of glutenin (SIG), and lactic acid retention capacity (LARC) ] showed significant relationship with gluten strength (<b>alveograph</b> energy, W) and bread loaf volume (LV). SIG and LARC were better than SDSS and MPT for predicting W, while SDSS was better than W and SIG for predicting bread LV. Most quality traits were primarily controlled by genotype (G), although environment (E) and G x E also had significant effects. Heat and drought stress showed contrasting effects on LARC, MPT, <b>alveograph</b> parameters [tenacity (P), extensibility (L), P/L ratio, W] and LV. Increase in P and decrease in L resulted in higher tenacity (larger P/L), which may explain the smaller loaf volume under drought stress. In contrast, decrease in P and increase in L, may explain the improved bread volume observed under heat stress. It is advisable to select for wheat quality under both favorable and abiotic stress conditions to identify genotypes with quality stability across environments. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Several parameters (mixograph width parameters before and after peak time, <b>alveograph</b> dough tenacity and extensibility, near infrared measurements, like those for protein content, and absorbance measurements of palmitic acid and linoleic acid content) made it easier to discriminate between the cultivars. The largest ranges of variation were found in landraces and old cultivars rather than in more recent varieties.

During storage grain can experience variations in composition and quality, especially if ambient conditions are unfavorable. In this study, we have assessed the effects of i) two temperatures (15 °C and 30 °C) and two ambient relative humidities (55 % and 75 % r. h.) during a storage period of 240 days and ii) the same two r. h. levels but with a decreasing temperature gradient to simulate the typical storage conditions prevailing in a Mediterranean region during a storage period of 180 days. Effects were assessed on grain moisture, test weight, <b>alveograph</b> parameters, falling number and gliadin and glutenin contents (extracted from white flour and quantified by RP-HPLC). Grain moisture reached equilibrium contents similar to those predicted by several isotherm sorption equations (modified Chung-Pfost, modified Oswin and modified Henderson). Test weight decreased as grain moisture increased, although the most marked variation was caused by a joint effect of high temperature and high r. h. Dough tenacity and strength tended to decrease, except when grain was stored at higher temperatures and r. h. levels, while extensibility showed an opposite response. Falling number increased with time, especially at high temperatures. Variations in gliadin and glutenin contents were observed, although they were probably related to changes in protein aggregation and solubility. Grain stored under the typical storage conditions prevailing in a Mediterranean region conditions experienced only minor changes in <b>alveograph</b> parameters after 180 days of storage; however, variations in moisture content, test weight and falling number were more relevant. In general terms, although high temperature and r. h. constitute unfavorable conditions for grain conservation, they caused an increase of dough strength properties that could be favorable for the bread making process. Therefore, they could be taken into consideration provided that grain soundness is secured. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
