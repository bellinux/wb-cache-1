5|$|An 1891 Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} that the arm on the Rochdale Canal had been filled in and the complex's canal basin had been retitled as <b>a</b> <b>reservoir,</b> {{suggesting}} that the canal had ceased {{to be used as}} a way of transporting goods to and from the complex.

30|$|The As {{evaporation}} experiments {{establish that}} the amount of As stored in <b>a</b> surface <b>reservoir</b> depends on T and t. For LDE processes without overheating, a 60 -s pre-growth annealing step at T< 660 °C will not empty the <b>As</b> <b>reservoir.</b> That means that the temperature during droplet etching influences not only the dynamics of kinetic processes but also the amount of As on the surface. On the other hand, overheating at 670 °C completely empties the <b>As</b> <b>reservoir</b> within <b>a</b> few seconds.|$|R

5|$|Energy {{from the}} Sun should have {{converted}} {{all traces of}} methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared {{to the age of}} the Solar System.

5|$|In {{order for}} the heated water to form a geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required.

The water mains are preinsulated and electrically heated to supply the residents during the winter months. The water supply network is capable of producing some 882,000 cubic meters of water per year; two water-supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7.2 million cubic meters.|$|E

5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} {{works very}} well in conjunction with solar power, water can be held back or released from <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.|$|E
