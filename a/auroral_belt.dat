40|$|The {{morphology}} of the "discrete" and "diffuse" auroral belts in {{the southern}} polar region is statistically examined {{as a function of}} geomagnetic Kp-index, using USAF-DAPP auroral photographs. Results of the statistical analyses are summarized in Fig. 9,which indicates the following characteristics of the two auroral belts. (a) The discrete <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> is always located on the poleward side of the diffuse auroral one. (b) The discrete auroras are observed mostly in the evening-to-midnight sectors, whereas the diffuse auroras are dominant in the midnight-to-early morning sectors. (c) The discrete auroras are observable in the evening sector even when Kp-index is very low; the discrete <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> in such a case is identified to the so-called auroral oval. (d) The discrete <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> approaches to a circular shape along 71 °- 72 ° in geomagnetic latitude when Kp-index approaches Kp≧ 5. (e) The diffuse <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> is confined to the night-side sectors during the geomagnetically quiet period, but it expands towards the evening sector along a geomagnetic latitude circle of 68 °- 69 °, accompanied by a rapid expansion of width, in association with increasing Kp-index. Comparisons of DAPP auroral photographs and all-sky camera ones with scanning auroral spectrophotometric data on ground for H_β 4861 Å and OI 5577 Å emission lines have identified the discrete and diffuse auroral belts to the electron and proton auroral belts respectively...|$|E

The amplitude of variations of the components over the maps are between 10 and 15 nT, well above the noise in the data. Averaged data, in 2 -by- 2 deg blocks, exhibit standard errors of the mean of about 1 nT {{over most of the}} X and Z maps, and about 2 nT over most of the Y maps. Errors rise to about twice these amounts near the <b>auroral</b> <b>belts.</b> Most of the anomalies in the component data are consistent with a crustal magnetization model which incorporates dipoles aligned only {{in the direction of the}} main field.

40|$|Measurements {{of neutral}} densities, {{temperatures}} and ion density and temperature by the Atmosphere Explorer C and E satellites exhibit fluctuations {{made up of}} coherent waves of scale size from hundreds to thousands of kilometers. The fluctuations in the AE-C data are found at times of low magnetic activity to extend from the auroral region in one hemisphere across the equator to the corresponding region in the other hemisphere with little change in apparent wavelength. The fluctuations in the AE-E data similarly exhibit at times of low magnetic activity nearly uniform wave structure encircling the equatorial belt. Typical examples of waves of more than 1000 km apparent wavelength in both the AE-C and AE-E data are presented. These observations during quiet times {{may be explained by}} a system of quasi-stationary waves excited by the <b>auroral</b> <b>belts</b> that are distributed about the Earth possibly with tidal or sub-tidal periods and scale lengths determined by the structure of the belts. According to this interpretation, Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID's) are manifestations of transient wave systems moving past a ground observatory that result from changes in magnetic activity with periods and scale sizes associated with the regions of enhanced auroral activity. Some evidence suggesting tidal-like stationary waves from the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar is presented...|$|R

40|$|The OGO- 6 {{electric}} field measurements {{make it clear}} that the general pattern of high latitude {{electric field}}s in magnetic time-invariant latitude coordinates is not highly variable and that when unusual variations, or field distributions, occur they are relatively isolated in time and spatial extent. Thus, electric field changes on a global scale cannot, in general, be evoked as a direct cause of substorms. Polar traverses along the 18 (h) to 6 (h) magnetic time meridian show that the sum of potential drops across the evening <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> and morning <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> approximately equals the potential drop across the polar cap. The integrated polar cap potential drop ranges from 20 to 100 keV and values in the center of this range are most common under conditions of moderate magnetic disturbance. Roughly near 18 (h) magnetic local time, a latitudinally narrow strip at the transition between <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> and polar cap fields exhibits unusually large field fluctuations immediately following the sudden onset of a negative bay at later magnetic local times. It appears likely that this spatially isolated correlation is related to an effect rather than a cause of substorm enhancement...|$|E
40|$|An {{agreement}} of averaged temperatures with mass spectrometer incoherent scatter radar looked reasonable for several nights, {{but for many}} nights there are differences: (1) midnight period of cooling, and (2) temperature increases associated with overhead crossings of the <b>auroral</b> <b>belt.</b> The observed rise of the temperature before dawn {{in conjunction with the}} high 6300 A intensities suggests a connection between the two effects: soft particle precipitation most likely candidate but frictional heating perhaps also a possibility. A comparison with the thermospheric general circulation model calculations also needed. The technique for formulating neutral wind vectors performs well in most cases. The observed patterns show evidence for abatement in the midnight sector in the meridional wind component at the separatix between the two cells with a frequency of the order of 20 to 25 %, also observed in radar observations at Sondre Stromfjord.

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} some of {{the methodology}} and results for studies of the earth's mantle and crust. Mantle conductivity studies can be made either by studying signals impressed on the earth from outside, e. g., the ionosphere or magnetosphere, or by studing signals originating in the core and transmitted through the mantle. Crustal field studies begin with a careful selection of the data and subsequent removal of core and external fields by some sort of filtering. Average maps from different local times sometimes differ, presumably due to the remaining presence of fields of external origin. Several techniques for further filtering are discussed. Where large-area aeromagnetic maps are available, crustal maps derived from satellite data can be compared with upward continued data. In general, the comparisons show agreement, with some differences, particularly in and near the <b>auroral</b> <b>belts.</b> The satellite data are further reduced by various methods of inverse and forward modeling, sometimes including reduction to the pole. These techniques are generally unstable at the equator. Common methods of stabilizing the inversions include principle components analysis and ridge regression. Because {{of the presence of}} the core field, the entire crustal contribution from the field is not known. Also, there is a basic nonuniqueness to the inverse solutions.

A two-dimensional planar ionosphere with an enhanced conductivity <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> and field-aligned currents {{at the edges}} is employed. The postulate that the electric field and currents adjust self-consistently to minimize the global Joule dissipation rate defines a theoretical relation between the primary and secondary field-aligned currents. This so-called minimal dissipation configuration is examined using several input field-aligned current models, and graphical solutions for the electric field and ionospheric current are shown.

40|$|The {{behavior}} {{of a number of}} solar wind, radiation <b>belt,</b> <b>auroral</b> and geomagnetic parameters is examined during the recent extended solar minimum and previous solar cycles, covering the period from January 1972 to July 2010. This period includes most of the solar minimum between Cycles 23 and 24, which was more extended than recent solar minima, with historically low values of most of these parameters in 2009. Solar rotational periodicities from S to 27 days were found from daily averages over 81 days for the parameters. There were very strong 9 -day periodicities in many variables in 2005 - 2008, triggered by recurring corotating high-speed streams (HSS). All rotational amplitudes were relatively large in the descending and early minimum phases of the solar cycle, when HSS are the predominant solar wind structures. There were minima in the amplitudes of all solar rotational periodicities near the end of each solar minimum, {{as well as at the}} start of the reversal of the solar magnetic field polarity at solar maximum (approx. 1980, approx. 1990, and approx. 2001) when the occurrence frequency of HSS is relatively low. Semiannual equinoctial periodicities, which were relatively strong in the 1995 - 1997 solar minimum, were found to be primarily the result of the changing amplitudes of the 13. 5 - and 27 -day periodicities, where 13. 5 -day amplitudes were better correlated with heliospheric daily observations and 27 -day amplitudes correlated better with Earth-based daily observations. The equinoctial rotational amplitudes of the Earth-based parameters were probably enhanced by a combination of the Russell-McPherron effect and a reduction in the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling efficiency during solstices. The rotational amplitudes were cross-correlated with each other, where the 27 -day amplitudes showed some of the weakest cross-correlations. The rotational amplitudes of the > 2 MeV radiation belt electron number fluxes were progressively weaker from 27 - to 5 -day periods, showing that processes in the magnetosphere act as a low-pass filter between the solar wind and the radiation belt. The A(sub p) /K(sub p) magnetic currents observed at subauroral latitudes are sensitive to proton auroral precipitation, especially for 9 -day and shorter periods, while the A(sub p) /K(sub p) currents are governed by electron auroral precipitation for 13. 5 - and 27 -day periodicities...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of {{energetic}} particle precipitation on the stratospheric nitrogen budget, ozone abundances and net radiative heating using results from three global chemistry-climate models considering solar protons and geomagnetic forcing due to <b>auroral</b> or radiation <b>belt</b> electrons. Two of the models cover the atmosphere up to the lower thermosphere, the source region of auroral NO production. Geomagnetic forcing in these models is included by prescribed ionization rates. One model reaches up to about 80  km, and geomagnetic forcing is included by applying an upper boundary condition of auroral NO mixing ratios parameterized {{as a function of}} geomagnetic activity. Despite the differences in the implementation of the particle effect, the resulting modeled NO y in the upper mesosphere agrees well between all three models, demonstrating that geomagnetic forcing is represented in a consistent way either by prescribing ionization rates or by prescribing NO y at the model top. Compared with observations of stratospheric and mesospheric NO y from the MIPAS instrument for the years 2002 – 2010, the model simulations reproduce the spatial pattern and temporal evolution well. However, after strong sudden stratospheric warmings, particle induced NO y is underestimated by both high-top models, and after the solar proton event in October 2003, NO y is overestimated by all three models. Model results indicate that the large solar proton event in October 2003 contributed about 1 – 2  Gmol (10 9  mol) NO y per hemisphere to the stratospheric NO y budget, while downwelling of auroral NO x from the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere contributes up to 4  Gmol NO y. Accumulation over time leads to a constant particle-induced background of about 0. 5 – 1  Gmol per hemisphere during solar minimum, and up to 2  Gmol per hemisphere during solar maximum. Related negative anomalies of ozone are predicted by the models nearly in every polar winter, ranging from 10 – 50  % during solar maximum to 2 – 10  % during solar minimum. Ozone loss continues throughout polar summer after strong solar proton events in the Southern hemisphere and after large sudden stratospheric warmings in the Northern hemisphere. During mid-winter, the ozone loss causes a reduction of the infrared radiative cooling, i. e., a positive change of the net radiative heating (effective warming), in agreement with analyses of geomagnetic forcing in stratospheric temperatures which show a warming in the late winter upper stratosphere. In late winter and spring, the sign of the net radiative heating change turns to negative (effective cooling). This spring-time cooling lasts well into summer and continues until the following autumn after large solar proton events in the Southern hemisphere, after sudden stratospheric warmings in the Northern hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|Initial {{results of}} the {{electric}} and magnetic field observations from the DE- 2 satellite show a remarkably good correlation between the north-south component of the electric field and the east-west component of the magnetic field in many passes of the field-aligned current regions. For a dayside cusp pass on August 15, 1981 the coefficient of correlation between these components was 0. 996. A preliminary inspection of the available data from the first 6 months of the DE operation indicates that the similarity between the electric and magnetic field signatures of the field-aligned currents is a commonly observed feature at all local times. This high correlation is interpreted to be {{an indication that the}} closure of the field-aligned current is essentially meridional. When the correlation between these components is not good, the closure current is likely to be flowing along the <b>auroral</b> <b>belt.</b> When the correlation between the electric and magnetic fields is high, it is possible to estimate the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity from the observed field components...|$|E
40|$|Assuming {{that the}} cooling-to-space of the {{atmosphere}} in the mesopause region around 100 km altitude is caused by CO_ 2 15 μm band radiation, the efficiency is reduced to one twentieth or less that calculated on the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium (J. T. HOUGHTON : The Physics of Atmospheres, 2 nd ed., Cambridge, Cambridge Univ. Press, 57, 1986). The amount of joule heating in this region of <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> during substorm period is calculated from ground based magnetometer observations (Y. KAMIDE and A. D. RICHMOND : Geophys. Monogr., 28, 67, 1984). Combining the above mentioned cooling and heating effects one can calculate the amount of net heating. The result shows that 1. 3 °K warming, which should require one day before cooling, may be attained by only one hour substorm duration.

The basic pattern of anti-solar convection across the polar cap and night toward day convection in both the evening and morning sectors at <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> latitudes persists at all levels of activity. The dawn-dusk potential drop across the polar cap (anti-solar convection) ranges from 20 to 100 kilovolts with the most typical values in the center of this range.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} high-latitude electric fields and currents, using analytic Fourier analysis methods, is conducted. A two-dimensional planar {{model of the}} ionosphere with an enhanced conductivity <b>auroral</b> <b>belt</b> and field-aligned currents at the edges is employed. Two separate topics are treated. A field-aligned current element near the cusp region of the polar cap is included to investigate the modifications to the convection pattern by the east-west component of the interplanetary magnetic field. It is shown that a sizable one-cell structure is induced near the cusp which diverts equipotential contours to the dawnside or duskside, depending on {{the sign of the}} cusp current. This produces characteristic dawn-dusk asymmetries to the electric field that have been previously observed over the polar cap. The second topic is concerned with the electric field configuration obtained in the limit of perfect shielding, where the field is totally excluded equatorward of the auroral oval. When realistic field-aligned current distributions are used, the result is to produce severely distorted, crescent-shaped equipotential contours over the cap. Exact, analytic formulae applicable to this case are also provided...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first ever {{comprehensive}} statistical study of the spatiotemporal characteristics of field-aligned currents in the terrestrial magnetosphere-ionosphere system using multi point measurements. We determine how the FAC density, variability and scale size are coupled. The three ST 5 satellites were in a pearls-on-a-string formation making measurements of the magnetic field with variable inter-spacecraft separations ranging from {{a few seconds to}} about 10 min. More than 4700 sets of satellite passes are analyzed using a robust correlation analysis aimed at determining the variability of the FAC system as a function of scale size and satellite spacing. We find significant differences between the FAC characteristics on the dayside and on the nightside in terms of dynamics of the current systems. On the dayside the FAC characteristics are found to be independent of IMF Bz and geomagnetic activity while the nightside indicates increased variability during disturbed conditions. The boundary separating highly and poorly correlated FACs can be fitted by a linear line for satellite separations shorter than 60 s (dayside) and 160 s (nightside). We interpret this as the dayside and nightside magnetospheric reconfiguration times respectively. For times exceeding this the FAC characteristics are suggested to be controlled by the solar wind (dayside) and plasma sheet (nightside) dynamics. Finally, the characteristics of FAC system with scale sizes larger than ~ 200 km (at ionospheric altitude) appear to be stable and repeatable on time scales of the order of a minute (i. e. comparable to the low-altitude orbiting satellite's traverse time across the <b>auroral</b> <b>belt).</b> In this sense, our results effectively validate the Iijima and Potemra (1978) assumption that on average the large-scale currents with scale sizes of the Region 1 and Region 2 are quasi-persistently significant in the transport of energy and momentum between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere...|$|E
40|$|Using the Tsyganenko {{magnetic}} field model (TSYGANENKO, Planet. Space Sci., 37, 5, 1989) we make {{an attempt to}} determine the outer boundary of the closed region when the interplanetary {{magnetic field}} (IMF) is southward. As a simple magnetic field model including the effect of IMF B_z< 0, the B_z component of a constant value of minus a few nanoTeslas {{is added to the}} magnetic field in the Tsyganenko model with low K_p values. In this paper, if the magnetic field strength, B, is not less than 2 nT in the whole range of a field line (namely the minimum B along a field line is greater than 2 nT), this field line is judged to be "firmly" closed. The firmly closed field lines are thought to be definitely closed as long as the fluctuation amplitude of B_z (around its average level) in the interplanetary (solar wind) magnetic field is less than 2 nT. The outer boundary of the firmly closed region is then constituted by field lines with the minimum B of 2 nT. This boundary is found to be close to (just inside of) the open-closed boundary, which can be determined with accuracy of 0. 01 ° in latitude of the foot point of a field line. It is found that a circle with the center at a latitude of about 85 ° on the midnight meridian can be fitted to the outer boundary of the firmly closed region, as it is projected to the ionosphere. Interestingly this circle coincides with a typical auroral circle; the auroral circles are those delineating the poleward boundary of the quiet <b>auroral</b> <b>belt,</b> which were earlier identified from the statistical analysis of satellites 2 ̆ 7 auroral images by MENG et al. (J. Geophys. Res., 82, 164, 1977). Importantly we find that the outer boundary of the firmly closed region is "distorted" on the nightside {{in the sense that the}} ionospheric projection of the average magnetic drift velocity of a plasma with isotropic pressure is not parallel to the boundary; more specifically, that of an isotropic ion fluid has an equatorward component on the duskside boundary and a poleward one on the dawnside boundary, respectively. This kind of the boundary distortion may be one of the possible causes of the generation of the nightside region 1 field-aligned current, which has been first suggested by HRUSKA (J. Geophys. Res., 91, 371, 1986) and recently, further studied by YAMAMOTO and INOUE (Proc. NIPR Symp. Upper Atmos. Phys., 11, 106, 1998) ...|$|E
