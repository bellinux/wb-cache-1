30|$|Extraction using {{pressurized}} liquid such as subcritical water (SW) {{constitutes an}} attractive technique, {{because it allows}} rapid extraction and reduced solvent consumption. Hot compressed water or subcritical water (SW) is a common designation for water occurring when water is pressurized to a temperature and pressure under its critical level conditions (100 – 374  °C and up to 22  MPa). One of the main advantages of this technique is that the selectivity of SW allows for the manipulation of extracts profile by changing the operating parameters, since the more polar ones are extracted at lower temperatures and the less polar compounds are extracted at higher temperatures (Mazza and Pronyk 2015). Procedures have already performed and evaluated for different kinds of extractions for recovery of catechins or anthocyanins and flavan- 3 -ols from red grape pomace, even more to obtain sugars from grape seeds (García-Marino et al. 2006; Vergara-Salinas et al. 2013). Recent works with promising results are also reported. Therefore, Pedras et al. (2017) focused on valorization of white wine grape pomace testing different water temperature, leading to higher carbohydrate and phenolic compounds recovery. They <b>also</b> obtained <b>different</b> <b>extracts</b> exhibiting ten times enhanced antioxidant activity than grape pomace extracts obtained by hydro-alcoholic extraction. Tian et al. (2017) optimized SW procedure for resveratrol recovery from grape seeds and apart from the higher extraction rate, the authors stated that extraction time was significantly reduced meaning less energy consumption together with the high added value of resveratrol extraction by SWE.|$|R
40|$|Gemstone Team ANTIDOTEHepatitis C virus (HCV) is {{a public}} health crisis, {{affecting}} over 170 million people by 2011. Conventional treatment, interferon alpha with ribavirin, can often be ineffective and may lead to severe side effects, and this lack of effective treatment poses significant challenges to patients, healthcare providers, and public health officials. As a result, our team investigated the therapeutic potential of medicinal plant extracts from Phyllanthus niruri as an alternative treatment for HCV. Molecular barcoding of chloroplast genes rbcl and matk was used to document the genetic identity of our plants. Phytochemicals were then extracted from dried plant material to isolate potential active compounds. We applied the extraction products to HCV-infected cell lines, specifically Huh 7. 5 liver cancer cells with J 6 JFH virus, to determine their effects on viral load and cell toxicity. Our extracts significantly decrease the number of viral copies per cell with no significant toxicity. Viral load suppression was strongest 24 hours after treatment. This effect either declined (extracts 3 and 4) or was sustained (extracts 1 and 2) over time. Extract 4 at 1 μg/ml at 24 hours and 5 at 10 μg/ml at 96 hours reached near 100 % suppression, demonstrating significant potent effect comparable to interferon-alpha, but the effect of Extract 4 is not sustained. It <b>also</b> demonstrates <b>different</b> <b>extracts</b> may exhibit <b>different</b> kinetics, suggesting different mechanisms of action.
