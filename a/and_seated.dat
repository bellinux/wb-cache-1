5|$|Following Germany's {{defeat in}} World War I, hyperinflation, mass unemployment, poverty, crime and civil unrest plagued the country. During that time, Heiden {{served in a}} Freikorps unit. Also in 1919, a small right-wing {{political}} party known as the German Workers' Party (DAP) was created <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> in Munich. In 1920, it {{changed its name to}} the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party; NSDAP). It rejected the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and advocated antisemitism and anti-Bolshevism.|$|E

5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid {{it in his}} sock {{to use as a}} weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E

More than NIS 100 million was invested in the makeover, which has added 500 square meters of floor space and three new rehearsal rooms. The building's four auditoriums were completely rebuilt. Each is a different size and color: Rovina is blue <b>and</b> <b>seats</b> 930 people; Meskin is lavender <b>and</b> <b>seats</b> 320; Bertonov (also known as Bamartef) is green <b>and</b> <b>seats</b> 220; <b>and</b> Habima 4 (formerly known as Heineken) is wood panelled <b>and</b> <b>seats</b> 170.|$|R
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner {{proved to}} be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked him so much they burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E

The cat disposes of his master's clothing beneath a rock. As the royal coach nears, the cat begins calling for help in great distress. When the king stops to investigate, the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing. The king has the young man brought from the river, dressed in a splendid suit of clothes, <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> in the coach with his daughter, {{who falls in love}} with him at once.|$|E

40|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} resurfacing is {{the most}} commonly utilized rehabilitation practice used by the Iowa Department of Transportation. The major problem with asphalt concrete resurfacing is the reflective cracking from underlying cracks and joints in the portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement. Cracking <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> the PCC prior to an asphalt overlay was the construction method evaluated in this project. There was cracking <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> on portions {{of the project and}} portions were overlaid without this process. There were also different overlay thicknesses used. Comparisons of crack <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> to the normal overlay method and the different depths are compared in this report.

5|$|There {{are several}} notable Beaux-Arts {{buildings}}, {{such as the}} Veterans' Administration building, the Newark Museum, the Newark Public Library, and the Cass Gilbert-designed Essex County Courthouse. Notable Art Deco buildings include several 1930s era skyscrapers, such as the National Newark Building and Eleven 80, the restored Newark Penn Station, and Arts High School. Gothic architecture {{can be found at}} the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart by Branch Brook Park, which is one of the largest gothic cathedrals in the United States. It is rumored to have as much stained glass as the Cathedral of Chartres. Newark also has two public sculpture works by Gutzon Borglum—Wars of America in Military Park <b>and</b> <b>Seated</b> Lincoln in front of the Essex County Courthouse. Moorish Revival buildings include Newark Symphony Hall and the Prince Street Synagogue, one of the oldest synagogue buildings in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia's fate after Emesa is uncertain, since ancient historians left {{conflicting}} accounts. Zosimus {{wrote that}} she died before crossing the Bosporus {{on her way}} to Rome; according to this account, the queen became ill or starved herself to death. The generally unreliable chronicler, John Malalas, wrote that Aurelian humiliated Zenobia by parading her through the eastern cities on a dromedary; in Antioch, the emperor had her chained <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> on a dais in the hippodrome for three days before the city's populace. Malalas concluded his account by writing that Zenobia appeared in Aurelian's triumph and was then beheaded.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E

40|$|Seating comfort is {{becoming}} increasingly important for the automotive industry. Car manufacturers use seating comfort to distinguish their products from those of competitors. However, the development and design of a new, more comfortable seat is time consuming and costly. The introduction of computer models of human <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> will accelerate this process. The contact interaction between human <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> {{is an important factor}} in the comfort sensation of subjects. This paper presents a finite element (FE) model of the human buttocks, able to predict the pressure distribution between human <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> surface by its detailed and realistic geometric description. A validation study based on volunteer experiments shows reasonable correlation in pressure distributions between the buttocks model and the volunteers. Both for simulations on a rigid and a soft cushion, the model predicts realistic seat pressure distributions. A parameter study shows that a pressure distribution at the interface between human <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> strongly depends on variations in human flesh <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> cushion properties...|$|R

5|$|Carte {{had been}} {{planning}} {{to build a new}} theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace, which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter, Count of Savoy. It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).|$|E
5|$|Somairle first {{appears on}} record in 1153, when he rose in {{rebellion}} with his nephews, {{the sons of}} the royal pretender Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair (fl. 1134), against the recently enthroned Máel Coluim IV, King of Scots (died 1165). In the same year, Somairle's father-in-law was murdered after ruling the Kingdom of the Isles about forty years. Óláfr was succeeded by his son, Guðrøðr; and sometime afterwards, Somairle participated in a coup within the kingdom by presenting Dubgall as a potential king. In consequence, Somairle and his brother-in-law fought a naval battle in 1156, after which much of the Hebrides appear to have fallen under Somairle's control. Two years later, he defeated Guðrøðar outright and took control of the entire island-kingdom. In 1164, Somairle again rose against the King of Scots, and is recorded in various early sources to have commanded a massive invasion force of men from throughout the Isles, Argyll, Kintyre, and Scandinavian Dublin. Somairle's host sailed up the Clyde, and made landfall near what is today Renfrew, where they were crushed by the Scots, and he himself was slain. Following Somairle's demise, Guðrøðr returned to the Isles <b>and</b> <b>seated</b> himself on Mann, although the Hebridean-territories won by Somairle in 1156 were retained by his descendants, the meic Somairle.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{connection}} are generally {{considered in the}} design of steel structures in practice. These are classified as completely rigid (fixed) and simple (pin) connections. In theory, completely rigid connections cannot undergo rotation and simple connections cannot transfer moment. Nevertheless, in reality, rigid connections have a relative flexibility which makes them to rotate and simple connections have some reserve capacity to transfer moments. However, in an effort {{to increase the amount of}} data on the rotational stiffness of top <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> angle available to researchers, this thesis presents the modeled and non linear analysis of different theoretical top <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> angle connections. The finite element modeling software, ABAQUS, is used to create moment-rotation curves for these theoretical connections such as top <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> angle connection with bracket <b>and</b> top <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> angle connection with gusset plate. To demonstrate finite element modeling’s ability to accurately predict the response of the theoretical connections, the results of several experiments performed on top <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> connections are reproduced in ABAQUS. The result of this study shows that initial stiffness of top <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> angle connection increased when attached bracket or gusset plate in connection zone. It is also found that this type of connection can be classified as rigid connection...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the lived experience of children who have specialised wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> needs from a family perspective with a view to facilitating family-centred practice in wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> services. Concepts of acceptance and adjustment for the family, integration into the home and community environments, experiences with service providers, perceptions of family-centred practice, and general views and opinions regarding wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> services were of interest in this study. Participants were recruited under the Enable Ireland remit. An interpretative phenomenological approach was used and data was gathered through semi structured interviews with three families. The research provided an insight into how family members viewed the impact of the phenomenon and adjusted to life with a child who has specialised wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> needs. Four main themes emerged from the data: Acceptance and adjustment, learning new ways of doing, being independent and interactions with service providers. Findings from the study suggest that caring for a child with specialised wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> needs is a family affair and affects the entire family unit. Using a holistic approach to wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> service provision which encompasses the philosophy of family centred care is optimal to support family health and wellbeing...|$|R
