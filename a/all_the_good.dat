25|$|Several of Ayckbourn's {{observations}} about celebrity culture have obvious influences in the play. One notable quote was his opinion that a dangerous mistake celebrities can make is to believe <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> things said about them, both in publicity and {{what other people}} (particularly agents) say. He also suggested that {{in an age of}} increasing anonymity, some are increasingly desperate to be noticed. The play also follows the theory that when one quickly rises to the top, one can fall just as quickly and mercilessly.|$|E
25|$|When kept as a talisman, a {{horseshoe}} is said {{to bring}} good luck.

Others believe that the horseshoe should be hung the other way (with the ends pointing down), as it will then release its luck to the people around it. A stylized variation of the horseshoe is used for a popular throwing game, horseshoes.|$|E

Some of William Penn's agents hired lawyer Andrew Hamilton to {{represent}} the Penn family in this replevin case. Hamilton's success led to an established relationship of good will between the Penn family and Andrew Hamilton. Penn had grown weary of the politicking back in Pennsylvania and the restlessness with his governance, but Logan implored him not to forsake his colony, for fear that Pennsylvania might {{fall into the hands of}} an opportunist who would undo <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> that had been accomplished. During his second attempt to sell Pennsylvania back to the Crown in 1712, Penn suffered a stroke. A second stroke several months later left him unable to speak or take care of himself. He slowly lost his memory.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{in desperation}} {{he used his}} hands. Miaoshan, {{realising}} the fate that the executioner would meet at her father's hand should she fail to let herself die, forgave the executioner for attempting to kill her. It is said that she voluntarily took on the massive karmic guilt the executioner generated for killing her, thus leaving him guiltless. It is because of this that she descended into the Hell-like realms. While there, she witnessed first-hand the suffering and horrors that the beings there must endure, and was overwhelmed with grief. Filled with compassion, she released <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that Yama, the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent the utter destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.|$|E
