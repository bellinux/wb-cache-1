The producers and actors have instead labeled him as [...] "ambiguous", and a man who wants to see [...] "evidence through logic" [...] and not superstition. When describing his character to The Hollywood Reporter, Elwes said he [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a little more buttoned up, a little more polished; he represents a different kind of FBI." ...|$|E

[...] The show deals with the theme of death, which Tsamere said is [...] "a bit strange, but it has the virtue of attracting the public's attention". He said that he and his co-authors thought that [...] "the most irrefutable reason to go on stage ... was to talk about something strong". Tsamere {{has described}} how the show changed as the size of its audiences grew and he incorporated improvisations.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} {{track on}} the album, [...] "I'm Going Bananas", is a Carmen Miranda-ish song {{done in a}} Spanish accent. A salsa rhythm is predominant, with Madonna squeezing her vocal cords while singing, backed by percussion and brass. In the fifth track, [...] "Crybaby", Madonna mimics the vocals of Betty Boop. The melody is heard over the interlining synth strings, horns and trumpets, and a bass. Rooksby explained that Madonna sang about <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> [...] "too sensitive and soft", and the chorus employs a chromatic chord sequence. The next track [...] "Something to Remember" [...] deals with her failed marriage to Penn and {{was the source of}} inspiration for naming her 1995 compilation album. Musically, it has melancholy chords and rambling melody, which according to Taraborrelli made it the most compelling song by Madonna.|$|E

On August 27, 2010, however, {{on the advice of}} doctors who refused to clear him to play, Kariya announced that he would sit out the 2010–11 season with post-concussion syndrome. While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat, the same doctors advised Kariya that it was too risky to try to play again, and Kariya officially announced his retirement from hockey on June 29, 2011, through the NHLPA. He continued to be outspoken regarding the prevalence of concussions among hockey players; {{in an interview with the}} Globe and Mail, he commented, [...] "The thing I worry about is that you'll get <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> playing with a concussion, and he gets hit, and he dies at centre ice." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Bartley and ÓBriain {{had been}} promised [...] "exclusive access" [...] to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, [...] "We had... this notion of {{investigating}} Chávez—was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here is <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began {{to see him as}} more transparent—what {{you see is what you}} get." [...] Bartley and ÓBriain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÓBriain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to [...] "press the right buttons" [...] to gain his support, so they presented [...] him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, irish who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright Seán O'Casey.

Stan Lee, creator or co-creator {{of many of the}} characters seen in the MCU, has cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush. His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War. This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with writer and director James Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher.

500|$|The {{developers}} {{felt that}} creating another {{game in the}} series with the same style of gameplay had limited potential. In an attempt to imbue the game with {{the feel of a}} horror film where the protagonist is a regular person and the antagonist is powerful, they avoided the common survival horror gameplay feature of a player character who is skilled in the use of weapons. Instead they generated an unarmed player character; and examined the survival horror gameplay staple of difficult combat and sluggish opponents, inspired by zombie films and modelled after the video games Alone in the Dark (1992) and Resident Evil (1996). They also analyzed around 50 chase sequences from various films, including horror films, and the structure of slasher films, in which a powerful and intelligent antagonist pursues the protagonists. The developers drew inspiration from common childhood nightmares about running away from an unknown threat, and decided to incorporate an intelligent enemy capable of trailing and outrunning the protagonist. The chase sequences were designed to evoke a brief sense of tension and fright for the player, although the developers did not want to prolong the tension with the constant presence of monsters, and were concerned that this would become overwhelming and spoil the player's immersion in the game and interest in the story. The constant presence of monsters was also thought to be irrelevant to Shattered Memories; director Mark Simmons said, [...] "this Harry Mason is not <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> constantly under attack from monsters. It's not a story of surviving a zombie apocalypse." [...] Additionally, to make information-gathering in the game realistic and corresponding to modern life standards, the developers substituted text in scattered documents, a common element in survival horror games, for the player's interaction with the in-game environment and use of the cell phone.|$|E

2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky, {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Daredevil and Jessica Jones, serves as costume designer for Luke Cage as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that {{was introduced in}} Jessica Jones. Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the [...] "rich and colorful history" [...] of Harlem, and Coker's own vision. In looking {{to pay homage to}} Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> trying to keep his identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.|$|E
2500|$|In {{much the}} same way as Buffy had been both a homage and parody of {{traditional}} horror films, Angel gave the same treatment to the classical film noir.

[...] Angel is <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> one drink away from going back to his evil roots" [...] He attempts to find redemption through helping the helpless of Los Angeles in a fashion similar to that of noir detectives. [...] The first episode even included a Philip Marlowe-style voiceover. [...] Angel filled the role of the reluctant, streetwise detective who has dealings with a variety of underworld characters. [...] In this case, the [...] "underworld" [...] is a literal underworld of demons and supernatural beings. [...] In one instance, Angel is explicitly compared with fictional noir private-detective Marlowe. [...] Many traditional noir stories and characters were explored in earlier episodes, including the ditzy but attractive secretary, the cagey but well-informed partner, and clashes with crooked lawyers, femme fatales and meddlesome, too-good-for-their-own-good cops. [...] These were usually given a modern or supernatural twist.|$|E

2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Stephanie Maslansky {{returned from}} the same role on Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Like the main characters of those shows, Cage has his own wardrobe evolution throughout the season after his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket was introduced in Jessica Jones. The series opted to depict Cage in a Trayvon Martin-inspired hoodie, but introduces the character's classic costume for a brief flashback. Colter said that the costume, designed in the blacksploitation era, [...] "is not made for serious moments", but the series was able to poke fun {{at it in the}} brief scene, with Cage saying [...] "You look like a damn fool" [...] to himself when wearing it. In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> trying to keep his identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. In contrast to Cage's hoodie, with jeans and T-shirts, many of the series' villains wear well-tailored suits. Stokes does this because he wants to present himself as [...] "a wealthy, successful businessman", and wears a lot of suits from Dolce & Gabbana and Zegna. One of his suits for the show was custom made. To pay homage to the comic character, Maslansky dressed Ali in a green suit for his introduction, using a [...] "subtle shade of green" [...] to avoid being [...] "flamboyant". The character subsequently is always wearing a [...] "subtle piece of green", like emerald earrings for one costume. The designer noted that many of these elements would not be noticed by the audience, but they made a difference to Ali when he was getting into character. For the character Shades, brands such as Hugo Boss, Helmut Lang, Prada, and Ferragamo were used [...] "because he wasn't trying to hide who he was", while Misty Knight, in her final shot of the season, is shown wearing a version of her own iconic comic costume. That look includes leather pants and an [...] "interesting cold-shoulder"-shaped top; a cream-colored top that fit that shape was found and dyed red for the scene.|$|E
