25|$|The {{second game}} was between France and Scotland. After {{starting}} slowly, France steadily extended their lead, but were still three points short of their target when, with time running out, Elvis Vermeulen scored a try in injury-time, which was converted, to give France a 27-point victory {{and put them}} in the lead in the tournament. The referee referred the try to the Television Match Official (TMO), an Irishman, asking if there was <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the try should not be awarded. The TMO advised that there was no reason, and the referee awarded the try.|$|E
25|$|In November 2015, provincial rugby sponsor ITM {{has been}} red-carded for the 2016 series. The {{building}} supplies company began its involvement in 2006, backing the national provincial series and the Heartland Championship. That sponsorship rose to competition-naming rights in 2010 {{when the company}} stepped up as major sponsor after the previous group withdrew. The ITM Cup, as it became known, started its six-season schedule. That deal ended for the 2016 season but the company wanted to renew its sponsorship. ITM put in a bid but {{had been told by}} the New Zealand Rugby Union that it had not been successful. ITM did not get a chance to match the investment from the new sponsor and had not been given <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> it was overlooked for the twin provincial series for the next year.|$|E

GameSpot's Frank Provo found that it became boring quickly, also criticizing the mathematics problems for being either too easy for young children or too boring for older ones.

500|$|Kosterman, who {{has played}} law {{enforcement}} officials before, initially turned down the role. After his agent informed him {{it would be a}} recurring role, and the producers were willing to pay him more than he made on any previous show, Kosterman decided to take the job. To executive producers Mark Verheiden and Greg Beeman, making Ethan the villain in [...] "Suspect" [...] was the ultimate [...] "red herring" [...] for audiences. Sheriff Ethan was originally going to take a nurse hostage, but the ending was rewritten to leave Ethan as more of a sympathetic character. Mitchell prefers the filmed ending, as he could not see <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> his character would suddenly become evil.

Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the Tsipras' second cabinet. Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an Alternate Minister of Finance. Later in September, {{in an interview with the}} Financial Times, Tsakalotos said that it was [...] "absolutely critical that we get something on debt relief." [...] He added: [...] "By the second quarter of 2016, if we get a positive review, bank recapitalisation and debt relief, I don’t see <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> there shouldn’t be a return to growth."

He said once the band finished its upcoming album, which was the final record in their contract, the band would sit down and discuss its future. King was optimistic that the band would produce at least another two albums before considering a split: [...] "We're talking of going in the studio next February [...] and getting the next record out so if we do things in a timely manner I don't see there's <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> we can't have more than one album out."

500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E
500|$|Presiding {{over the}} trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and {{respected}} judge in his early sixties. [...] The prosecution was directed by King's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. [...] Turpin had no defence barrister; {{during this period of}} English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. [...] Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. [...] Turpin offered {{little in the way of}} questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy, he replied [...] "I cannot say anything, for I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. [...] When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. [...] He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. [...] When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said [...] "Turpin". [...] Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. [...] Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. [...] Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: [...] "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." [...] The judge replied: [...] "Why was you not? [...] You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." [...] Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: [...] "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{among the}} poems {{ascribed}} to Petronius is an oracle predicting {{travels to the}} Danube and to Egypt. Edward Courtney notes that the prominence of Egypt in the ancient Greek novels might make it plausible for Petronius to have set an episode there, but expresses some doubt about the oracle's relevance to Encolpius's travels, [...] "since {{we have no reason}} to suppose that Encolpius reached the Danube or the far north, and we cannot suggest <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> he should have." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hayek {{also wrote}} that the state {{can play a role}} in the economy, and specifically, in {{creating}} a safety net.

2500|$|Following that denial, Overland {{moved to}} [...] the search {{warrants}} {{that had been}} executed on Lazarus' home, vehicle and spaces she utilized at work, and suppress the evidence obtained from them. They were, he argued, based on stale information and did not sufficiently establish a nexus between the places searched {{and the likelihood of}} finding evidence there; Lazarus had not moved to her present residence, he observed, until 1994, eight years after the murder, and the affidavit in support of the warrant did not provide <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> evidence might be found there. At times the affidavit, Overland claimed, was even deceptive, with the submitting detective asserting that the murder weapon might be found there, when Nuttall and Barba had already theorized that Lazarus had reported it stolen two weeks after the murder and irretrievably disposed of it.|$|E
2500|$|Nor {{is there}} <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> {{the state should}} not assist... {{individuals}} in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, {{as in the case}} of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance – where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks – the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.... there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make the provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.|$|E

2500|$|Betty Riess, a {{spokeswoman}} for Bank of America, told MintPress News via email, [...] "We do not close accounts {{on the basis of}} nationality, nor do we close accounts without notice to customers." [...] However, account holders believe there could be a relationship between this action and their national origin. Although most account holders say they did not receive any notification prior their accounts being frozen, Bank of America insists that they do not freeze any account without prior notification. When it was reported that Bank of America was closing the accounts of Iranians living in the U.S. and Iranian-Americans, there was speculation that the bank did so on the basis of discriminatory ideology, since Bank of America did not give these individuals <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> their accounts were being closed. The bank responded to these accusations, arguing that it was only following the rules put forth by the U.S. federal government regarding economic relations between the U.S. and Iran.|$|E

In June, Wilson asserted to MTV News that he {{was kicked out of}} the band via a phone call. [...] "It was done as a phone call and the only person who spoke was Spencer. Apparently, Brendon and Ryan were on the speakerphone too, but they didn't say a word. They never even said they were sorry," [...] explained Wilson. Smith wrote a lengthy e-mail back to James Montgomery of MTV News, stating, in part, [...] "We made the decision based on Brent's lack of responsibility {{and the fact that he}} wasn't progressing musically with the band," [...] and revealed that Wilson did not write nor play any bass present on Fever: Instead, Urie recorded these parts. Wilson demanded a cut in royalties, and threatened to take his former band to court.|$|E
2500|$|Gimblett's own words, {{quoted in}} the Foot biography, tell the story. [...] "I couldn't take much more. I was taking {{sleeping}} pills to make me sleep and others to wake me up. By the end of 1953 the world was closing in on me. I couldn't offer <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> and I don't think the medical profession knew either." [...] In the winter of 1953-54, Gimblett spent 16 weeks in Tone Vale Hospital, a psychiatric institution, where he was given electro-convulsive therapy, and was released in time to join the Somerset team {{for the start of}} the 1954 season. He played in the first two county matches of the new season, but was not fit enough mentally to continue and– though the details vary– Somerset agreed to give him time off. He did not appear in first-class cricket again. Later in the 1954 season, according to Gimblett's own report, he went to Somerset's Taunton ground to watch some of the cricket, and was [...] "ordered out of the ground".|$|E
