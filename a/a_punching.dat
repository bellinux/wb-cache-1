500|$|Seldom hesitating to use {{herself as}} the butt of her own jokes, Fey is also well known for {{practicing}} self-deprecating humor, as demonstrated throughout her performance as Liz Lemon in 30 Rock. In an article ranking Fey's six greatest jokes, David Renshaw of The Guardian wrote that the performer's work continues to feature her [...] "trademark mix of snark, self-deprecation and pop-culture smarts." [...] Fey's self-deprecating comedic style inspired Ashley Fetters of The Atlantic to recognize her as comedian Phyllis Diller's successor because of their similar humor. Critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of Fey's use of self-deprecating humor, {{and its effect on}} women as a female comic; while blogger Kate Harding disapproved of Fey's performance in 30 Rock because [...] "I'm torn between being sad that she apparently doesn't see [...] in herself and being pissed off that she's reinforcing the idea that having brown hair, glasses, and a figure that's maybe a size 2 instead of a 0 actually equals ugly", Jessica G. of Jezebel defended the actress, writing that Fey's performance is [...] "supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy." [...] Writing that Harding misunderstood Fey's intentions, the author concluded that her self-deprecation [...] "is precisely what makes her relatable", elaborating that [...] " [...] have many moments of self-doubt, and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self-deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect." [...] Sophie Caldecott of Verily defended Fey's modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance: [...] "She mocks her own appearance, sure, but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look, as if that’s the most interesting thing about us ... Her comic persona on 30 Rock, Liz Lemon, can be laughed at for many things, but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them." [...] Caldecott concluded, [...] "In reality, self-deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in ... In fact, I defy you to find a good male comedian who isn’t a master of self-deprecation. Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons, mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one." [...] Observing that Fey's material lacks [...] "whining", Gina Barreca of the Hartford Courant wrote that Fey's comedy [...] "is not simply an iteration of self-deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor. In itself, this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told, more or less, to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as <b>a</b> <b>punching</b> bag for insults." [...] Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect, but she defends her right to write borderline jokes, saying that she has chosen to [...] "opt out" [...] of the culture of demanding apologies.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "Last week, I was pretty miffed about Once Upon A Time and its {{treatment}} of Regina (Lana Parrilla). While I ultimately liked the episode, {{it felt like the}} show was continuing to use her as <b>a</b> <b>punching</b> bag to move the plot forward. Need something bad to happen to one of our characters? Just take it out on Regina! Granted, it’s a formula that has served Once Upon A Time in the past, but at this point, it just felt repetitive. That’s why “Only You” and “An Untold Story” provided such a fresh change of pace for a season finale that not only sets up the next phase of the story, but also promises to put Regina in a more central role." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{production}} mixer, Michael Evje, the film began shooting at the Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium on April 16, 1979. Grips hung huge curtains of black duvetyne on all four sides of the ring area to contain the artificial smoke used extensively for visual effect. On May 7, {{the production}} moved to the Culver City [...] Studio, Stage 3, and filmed there {{until the middle of}} June. Scorsese made it clear during filming that he did not appreciate the traditional way in films of showing fights from the spectators' view. He insisted that one camera operated by the Director of Photography, Michael Chapman, would be placed inside the ring as he would play the role of an opponent keeping {{out of the way of}} other fighters so that viewers could see the emotions of the fighters, including those of Jake. The precise moves of the boxers were to be done as dance routines from the information of a book about dance instructors in the mode of Arthur Murray. <b>A</b> <b>punching</b> bag in the middle of the ring was used by De Niro between takes before he aggressively came straight on to do the next scene.

[...] Simulating the CG liquid, which was meant to be an ambiguous reference to poison and blood that behaved like [...] "something in between liquid chocolate and tar", was difficult, with Clair saying [...] "It's hard to make an algorithm act [...] "insidious"". CG Lead Andrew Romatz elaborated that [...] "Developing the right consistency and behavior of the fluids was definitely a tricky process. Getting the scale to feel right was something that we had to play with quite a bit in simulation and also in lighting and texturing. Patrick wanted the sculptures we were forming to feel like miniatures, so we did a lot of experimenting with scene scale and with camera settings, simulating depth of field to achieve that look." [...] Fluids Lead Miguel A. Salek stated that [...] "Each shot required custom flow maps to be painted on the sculptures, along with small attraction fields and thousands of tiny adjustments to achieve the shapes and behavior Patrick was looking for. In the end I simulated hundreds of tests and thousands of frames of fluids to achieve just the right balance for each shot." [...] Due to time constraints, references to Murdock's boxing history such as <b>a</b> <b>punching</b> bag and boxing ring were cut from the final sequence. The final sequence was animated to a temp track—"an old piece of 90s trip hop"—before John Paesano's music for the sequence was completed.|$|E
