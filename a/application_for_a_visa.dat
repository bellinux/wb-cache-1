500|$|Since Al-Kateb's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>visa</b> was rejected, he was {{classified}} as an unlawful non-citizen. Section 196 of the Migration Act provides that unlawful non-citizens can only be released from immigration detention if they are granted a visa, deported, or removed from Australia. Section 198(6) of the Act requires immigration officials to [...] "remove [...] as soon as reasonably practicable an unlawful non-citizen".|$|E
500|$|Al-Kateb then {{applied to}} the Federal Court for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus, {{demanding}} that immigration officials comply with section 198 of the Migration Act which required that Al-Kateb, because his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>visa</b> had been rejected, {{be removed from the}} country [...] "as soon as reasonably practicable". However, those applications were dismissed. Al-Kateb then sought writs of habeas corpus and mandamus on the basis that he was being unlawfully detained, and although the judge found that [...] "removal from Australia is not reasonably practicable at the present time as there is no real likelihood or prospect of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future", his application was dismissed. However, a case with substantially identical facts, decided twelve days later by a Full Court of the Federal Court, resulted in the release of another detainee, Akram Al Masri.|$|E

Impressed by Fr.

5000|$|On March 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Administrative Appeals Office ruled Zündel {{inadmissible}} to the United States, rejecting his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> immigrant <b>visa</b> {{which he}} has sought {{in order to be}} reunited with his wife. He was classified as inadmissible, because he has been convicted of foreign crimes for which the sentence was five years or more and a waiver deemed unwarranted due to Zündel's [...] "history of inciting racial, ethnic, and religious hatred". Legal writer and law professor Eugene Volokh expressed the opinion that while his exclusion from the United States on hate speech grounds was not a violation of the First Amendment, it may be an incorrect application of current immigration law.|$|R

With Hayden Mullins suspended and Jonathan Spector injured for the visit of Crystal Palace on 15 December, Diop made his first start for Birmingham, alongside League debutant Callum Reilly in central midfield. He scored the equalising goal, a powerful header from Rob Hall's corner, as Birmingham came back from 2-0 down to draw, and was rewarded with another month's contract. He injured a hamstring soon afterwards, and despite his imminent return to fitness, the club's financial difficulties meant they could not offer him a further contract extension.

5000|$|According to History of U.S. Table Tennis by American {{table tennis}} players and Tim Boggan, {{who went to}} China along with the U.S. Table Tennis Team, three {{incidents}} may have triggered the invitation from China. Welshman H.

Further, the American player Leah [...] "Miss Ping" [...] Neuberger, the 1956 World Mixed Doubles Champion and nine-time U.S. Open Women's Singles Champion, was traveling at the time with the Canadian Table Tennis Team that had been invited by China to visit the country. China diplomatically extended its approval of Leah Neuberger's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>visa</b> to the entire American team. The third incident, perhaps the most likely trigger, was the unexpected but dramatic meeting between the flamboyant American player Glenn Cowan and the Chinese player Zhuang Zedong, a three-time world champion and winner of many other table tennis events. Zhuang Zedong described the incident in a 2007 talk at the USC U.S.-China Institute.|$|E
