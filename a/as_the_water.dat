5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E

5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E

5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam {{and water to}} the surface through the geyser's internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army {{training}} planes {{standing in}} for Messerschmitt Bf-109s. He built a device {{based on an}} internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer and less expensive than firing blanks. Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> from the Grail washes it away.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> cools, and can cause environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E

Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested. Plants such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{hyacinth}} {{are killed by}} low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline transport: The ancient Chinese {{made use}} of {{channels}} and pipe systems for public works. The Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang.

The sudden inrush of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E

5|$|The bunker complex was self-contained. However, as the FÃ¼hrerbunker {{was below}} the water table, {{conditions}} were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater. A diesel generator provided electricity, and well water was pumped in <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> supply. Communications systems included a telex, a telephone switchboard, and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated {{at the end}} of the war, Hitler received much of his war news from BBC radio broadcasts and via courier.|$|E

5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} {{tourist facilities}} in Death Valley were {{a set of}} tent houses built in the 1920s where Stovepipe Wells is now located. People flocked to resorts built around natural springs thought to have curative and restorative properties. In 1927, Pacific Coast Borax turned the crew quarters of its Furnace Creek Ranch into a resort, creating the Furnace Creek Inn and resort. The spring at Furnace Creek was harnessed to develop the resort, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> was diverted, the surrounding marshes and wetlands started to shrink.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the bay where the pirates were said to be, Alligator dispatched boats to engage the enemy vessels, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> was too shallow for the warship to engage them directly. With Allen personally commanding one of the boats, the Americans assaulted the schooner Revenge. Although the Navy was able to force the pirates into abandoning Revenge, the buccaneers managed to fight {{their way out of}} the bay and inflict seven casualties. With their commander mortally wounded, the boats ceased pursuit of the pirates, but were able to recover the vessels that had been held in the bay.|$|E

50|$|According to the Book of Exodus, Meribah was a {{location}} in Rephidim, while {{according to the}} Book of Numbers, Meribah was located at Kadesh-Barnea. Textual scholars attribute the difference to the different sources from which these passages derive, and regard both mentions of Meribah <b>as</b> referring to <b>the</b> same place. The Septuagint, Targums, and the Vulgate {{deal with the issue}} by regarding the Meribah in the Book of Numbers as simply being a common noun, rather than a place-name, rendering Me Meribath-Kadesh <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of strife in Kadesh rather than <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of Meribah in Kadesh.|$|R

5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates in the same direction <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E
5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E
5|$|After completion, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to Rear Admiral David Porter's Mississippi Squadron and patrolled the Mississippi River against Confederate raids and ambushes. During the Red River Campaign Osage was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr. She supported the Union Army when it captured Fort DeRussy and captured Alexandria, Louisiana by herself on 15 March 1864 without firing a shot. She successfully defended the navy transports attacked during the Battle of Blair's Landing on 12 April, driving off the Confederate forces with heavy losses after having run aground and freed herself. After {{the end of the}} campaign in May she was assigned to patrol the Mississippi River. During that month she grounded on a sandbar near Helena, Arkansas and could not be refloated due to the rapidly falling water level even when some of her armor was removed. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> receded Osage began to hog at the ends because only her middle was supported by the sand. This caused her longitudinal bulkheads to split and broke many rivets in her hull and on her deck. She was repaired in place before being refloated at the end of November.|$|E
