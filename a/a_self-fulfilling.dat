25|$|The social {{stigma of}} the drug also {{complicated}} studies of PCE; researchers labored under the awareness that their findings would have political implications.

25|$|Intended to paralyse black {{opposition}} and prevent political violence, {{the state of}} emergency proved <b>a</b> <b>self-fulfilling</b> prophecy. State repression deepened black alienation from the regime and suggested to some that peaceful political organising was a dead end. With the black leadership in detention, the political vacuum was filled by the more militantly inclined. In July and October 1960 large-scale demonstrations and rioting broke out in black townships.|$|E
25|$|There can {{be unique}} {{challenges}} {{in the treatment of}} BPD, such as hospital care. In psychotherapy, a client may be unusually sensitive to rejection and abandonment and may react negatively (e.g., by harming themselves or withdrawing from treatment) if they sense this. In addition, clinicians may emotionally distance themselves from individuals with BPD for self-protection or due to the stigma associated with the diagnosis, leading to <b>a</b> <b>self-fulfilling</b> prophecy and a cycle of stigmatization to which both patient and therapist can contribute.|$|E
500|$|As {{lawyer for}} the UGG, Brownlee began to sympathize with the {{prevailing}} farmers' view that the eastern Canadian business establishment was hostile to their interests (for example, when the UGG wanted to sell twine, no manufacturer would supply it). [...] He recommended that the UGG reduce farmers' reliance on the eastern establishment by expanding its operations into insurance, investment, and real estate. [...] The result was the United Grain Growers Securities Ltd. [...] He also helped the UGG quietly sell the stock it held in the Home Bank of Canada when UGG directors began to doubt the bank's soundness; this subtlety was considered essential, as the directors were concerned that airing their doubts publicly would make the bank's failure <b>a</b> <b>self-fulfilling</b> prophecy. [...] When UGG Assistant General Manager J. R. Murray found an interested buyer, Brownlee advised Murray against insisting on an intricate written sales contract for fear that the buyer would sense the directors' concerns. [...] His advice was heeded, and the sale was concluded December 29, 1919. [...] The bank failed less than four years later.|$|E
25|$|Standardized tests also remove teacher bias in assessment.

50|$|The Golem {{effect is}} a {{psychological}} phenomenon in which lower expectations placed upon individuals either by supervisors or the individual themselves lead to poorer performance by the individual.

25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the brevity of REBT is that the therapist seeks to empower the client to help himself through future adversities. REBT only promotes temporary solutions if more fundamental solutions are not found. An ideal successful collaboration between the REBT therapist and a client results in changes to the client's philosophical way of evaluating himself or herself, others, {{and his or her}} life, which will likely yield effective results. The client then moves toward unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance and life-acceptance while striving to live <b>a</b> more <b>self-fulfilling</b> and happier life.|$|R
500|$|In {{the latter}} {{portion of the}} book Fenwick {{discusses}} comparisons of the est training to brainwashing and psychotherapy, potential harmful effects of the course, and the extent that positive benefit from the course {{may be attributed to}} <b>a</b> <b>self-fulfilling</b> prophecy. [...] Fenwick sees est as a form of psychotherapy that utilizes [...] "in" [...] therapies, and questions its suitability for certain individuals. [...] Fenwick writes that the est training draws influences from Synanon, Gestalt therapy, encounter groups, and Scientology. [...] She discusses the potential positive and negative psychological effects that can occur subsequent to taking the est training. [...] She analyzes the rules of the training, and the behavioral tools used by the trainers, and points out that the est personnel are not qualified to assess psychopathology. Fenwick asserts that tactics including sensory deprivation and the large group setting of 250people at a time help to make the training [...] "work". [...] She describes this as a [...] "compression chamber effect", and asserts that it leads to the [...] "hysterical confessions and the euphoric testimonials" [...] she observed in the course.|$|E
500|$|Much {{has been}} made of the {{fragmented}} editing of Don't Look Now, and Nicolas Roeg's work in general. Time is presented as 'fluid', where the past, present and future can all exist in the same timeframe. [...] John's premonitions merge with the present, such as {{at the start of the}} film where the mysterious red-coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides, and when he 'sees' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present, but in fact it is a vision of the future. [...] The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene, in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner. After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments, the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback, which may be perceived as his life flashing before his eyes. At a narrative level the plot of Don't Look Now can be regarded as <b>a</b> <b>self-fulfilling</b> prophecy: it is John's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death. According to the editor of the film, Graeme Clifford, Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his [...] "exercise in film grammar".|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] <b>a</b> <b>self-fulfilling</b> prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E

(Bank runs occurred when a large number of customers withdrew their deposits because they believed the bank might become insolvent.

2500|$|Mares are {{considered}} easier to handle than stallions.

However, there is considerable evidence that much [...] "marish" [...] behavior is mostly the result of humans expecting or allowing the mare to misbehave.

5000|$|His {{distinction}} between social groupings {{is based on}} the assumption that there are only two basic forms of an actor's will, to approve of other men.

Following his [...] "essential will" [...] ("Wesenwille"), an actor will see himself as a means to serve the goals of social grouping; very often it is an underlying, subconscious force. Groupings formed around an essential will are called a Gemeinschaft. The other will is the [...] "arbitrary will" [...] ("Kürwille"): An actor sees a social grouping as a means to further his individual goals; so it is purposive and future-oriented.
