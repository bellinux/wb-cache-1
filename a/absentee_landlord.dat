The latter, who was an Arabized Kurd, Ottoman World War veteran and <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord</b> from Aleppo, met Mustafa Kemal in Gaziantep {{in the late summer}} of 1920. During their meeting, an agreement was concluded to launch a propaganda campaign funded by the Turks against the French occupation. The campaign began in Aleppo in December 1920.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} seen Swift as hopeless {{in regards to}} actual change for Ireland. The rich could never change from their <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord</b> mentality that has {{stripped}} Ireland of its economic independence, {{and that is why}} Swift spends the majority of his sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E
5|$|Though an <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord,</b> Leicester, who {{was also}} Baron of Denbigh, {{regarded}} the lordship {{as an integral part}} of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley. He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would not only have been the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher was to take the centre instead of the altar, thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.|$|E

A slightly more stylish example from later in the district's development can be found at 190–94 Grand Street.|$|E
25|$|Cattle were {{concentrated}} {{in the southern part}} of East Falkland, an area that became known as Lafonia. Lafone was an <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord</b> and never actually set foot on the islands. His activities were not monitored by the British and rather than introducing more British settlers as he promised, he brought large numbers of Spanish and Indian gauchos to hunt cattle. In 1846, they established Hope Place on the south shores of Brenton Loch and in 1849 a sod wall (the Boca wall) was built across the isthmus at Darwin to control the movement of cattle.|$|E
25|$|Lord Shackleton's {{report was}} {{delivered}} in 1977 and documented the economic stagnation in the islands.

The report was largely ignored at the time, as it was felt that acting upon it would sour relations with Argentina. A reprise of the report by Lord Shackleton in 1982 following the Falklands War became the blueprint for subsequent economic development of the islands.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 19th century, the Al Fadl became semi-sedentarized; {{they settled}} in various Golan villages, but {{continued}} to shepherd their flocks, while their emir settled in Damascus and effectively became an <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord</b> who collected rent from his tribesmen. The Al Fadl were displaced from their homes in the Hula Valley and Golan during the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars, respectively, and most settled in and around Damascus. As a result of the wars and Syrian agrarian reforms that stripped the emir of much of his land, his relationship with the tribe shifted from benevolent landlord to symbolic leader and political representative. By the 1990s, there were up to 30,000 Al Fadl tribesmen in Syria (not counting those who were affiliated with the Mawali) along with a significant population in eastern Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} T. W. Moody disputes this theory, {{claiming that}} {{this view is}} based on Michael Davitt's faulty recollection before the 1889 Times-Parnell Commission and his 1904 The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland, repeated by Sheehy-Skeffington in 1908; and that no contemporary accounts of the events mention a Canon Bourke as an issue. Moody claims that, in fact, Geoffrey James Bourke, the canon of Tuam Cathedral {{had nothing to do}} with the 'Bourke Estate', and that the tenants' dispute, if indeed there was one, would have been with the <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord,</b> his nephew Joseph Bourke; that Daly himself denounced the whole story and Davitt for his 'crass ignorance' of Mayo affairs and in fact the rents on the Bourke estate had been fixed in 1855 for 31 years and hence there could not have been any rack-renting; that Canon Bourke in fact supported the land movement and was on the platform and seconded John Dillon's resolution at the July 1879 Claremorris meeting; and remained to his death a much respected parish priest.|$|E
25|$|By 1887, {{peace was}} {{established}} between the Al Fadl and their Circassian and Druze rivals {{as a result}} of Ottoman recognition of the tribe's pasture rights and territorial boundaries. As a result, the territory of the Fa'our branch of the Al Fadl included large parts of the Golan Heights, part of the Hauran plain, and the eastern Hula Valley. These lands were registered {{in the name of the}} emir, who thereafter collected rent from its tenants. Most of the tenants were Fadl tribesmen who had shifted from a nomadism to a semi-sedentism that combined agriculture and grazing. The emir, who resided in Damascus, was in effect an <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord,</b> and he and his immediate family became wealthy members of the Damascene social elite. The emir married a woman from the well-known Kurdish Damascene family, Buzu. Some Kurdish families, including the Buzu, were afterward incorporated into Al Fadl. Despite the absence of blood relations, the newer households held great pride and respect for their association with the tribe's leading household, the Fa'our.|$|E

25|$|Seven weeks later, on 21 September a {{party of}} Defenders was routed by a smaller but better armed {{coalition}} of 'wreckers' at the Diamond, 4 miles from Drumcree. The 'wreckers' were {{under the command of}} a Captain Giffard from Dublin. William Blacker, a member of the landed gentry and commander of the Seagoe Yeomanry, was later attributed a role in the affray. He is said to have stripped lead from the roof of his house to make ammunition in preparation for the ambush of Catholic Defenders at the Diamond. However, we could find nothing to support this and it may be no more than a piece of Orange legend that helped establish an affinity with the aristocracy {{in the minds of the}} Protestant peasantry. It was after the Diamond skirmish that the name 'Orange Boys' was adopted. This was changed to 'the Orange Order' as the ‘wreckers’ became more organised under the leadership of Blacker and James Verner, an attorney and agent for the Armagh estates of <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord,</b> Lord Charlemont.|$|E

An <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord,</b> he contracted {{the construction of a}} [...] "boerderij" [...] (house with attached barn).

His {{great-grandfather}} Charles Blair was a wealthy country gentleman in Dorset who married Lady Mary Fane, daughter of the Earl of Westmorland, and had income as an <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord</b> of plantations in Jamaica. His grandfather, Thomas Richard Arthur Blair, was a clergyman. Although the gentility passed down the generations, the prosperity did not; Eric Blair described his family as [...] "lower-upper-middle class". His father, Richard Walmesley Blair, worked in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service. His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (née Limouzin), grew up in Moulmein, Burma, where her French father was involved in speculative ventures. Eric had two sisters: Marjorie, five years older, and Avril, five years younger. When Eric was one year old, his mother took him and his sister to England. His birthplace and ancestral house in Motihari has been declared a protected monument of historical importance.|$|E

This was named Camberry later Canberry Cottage. A creek that ran through the middle of the property originating from the side of Mount Ainslie was named Canberry Creek. On 12 October 1828, a deed for a further [...] to the west was issued to Moore in consideration of £250. Moore was always an <b>absentee</b> <b>landlord</b> and took no interest in running the property.
