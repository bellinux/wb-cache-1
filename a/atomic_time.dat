5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other <b>atomic</b> <b>time</b> source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of the atomic clock in the early 1960s, it was decided to use <b>atomic</b> <b>time</b> as the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.|$|E
25|$|A leap {{second is}} a one-second {{adjustment}} that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{in order to}} keep its time of day close to the mean solar time, or UT1. Without such a correction, time reckoned by Earth's rotation drifts away from <b>atomic</b> <b>time</b> because of irregularities in the Earth's rate of rotation. Since this system of correction was implemented in 1972, 27 leap seconds have been inserted, the most recent on December 31, 2016 at 23:59:60 UTC.|$|E
25|$|However, for {{the past}} several centuries, the length of the mean solar day has been {{increasing}} by about 1.4–1.7 ms per century, depending on the averaging time. By 1961, the mean solar day was already a millisecond or two longer than 86,400 SI seconds. Therefore, time standards that change the date after precisely 86,400 SI seconds, such as the International <b>Atomic</b> <b>Time</b> (TAI), will get increasingly ahead of time standards tied to the mean solar day, such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).|$|E
50|$|Prominently, {{the field}} of {{interferometric}} gravitational wave detection depends critically on enhanced sensitivity afforded by optical cavities.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{fundamental}} function of providing astronomers with a reference frame {{to report their}} observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like celestial mechanics, stellar dynamics and galactic astronomy. In observational astronomy, astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that UTC is basically the <b>atomic</b> <b>time</b> synchronized to Earth's rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry {{is an important step}} in the cosmic distance ladder because it establishes parallax distance estimates for stars in the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{has kept}} {{a version of the}} UTC <b>atomic</b> <b>time</b> scale since the 1990s, but Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) {{remained}} the formal basis for the standard times of all of the states through 2005. In November 2004, the state and territory attorneys-general endorsed a proposal from the Australian National Measurement Institute to adopt UTC as the standard of all Australian standard times, thereby eliminating the effects of slight variations in the rate of rotation of the Earth that are inherent in mean solar time. All states have adopted the UTC standard, starting on 1 September 2005.|$|E
25|$|Arguments {{against the}} {{proposal}} include the unknown expense {{of such a}} major change {{and the fact that}} universal time will no longer correspond to mean solar time. It is also answered that two timescales that do not follow leap seconds are already available, International <b>Atomic</b> <b>Time</b> (TAI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) time. Computers, for example, could use these and convert to UTC or local civil time as necessary for output. Inexpensive GPS timing receivers are readily available, and the satellite broadcasts include the necessary information to convert GPS time to UTC. It is also easy to convert GPS time to TAI, as TAI is always exactly 19 seconds ahead of GPS time. Examples of systems based on GPS time include the CDMA digital cellular systems IS-95 and CDMA2000. In general, computer systems use UTC and synchronize their clocks using Network Time Protocol (NTP). Systems that cannot tolerate disruptions caused by leap seconds can base their time on TAI and use Precision Time Protocol. However, the BIPM has pointed out that this proliferation of timescales leads to confusion.|$|E

40|$|We use an {{optically}} dense, anisotropic magneto-optical trap {{to study}} recoil-induced resonances (RIRs) in the transient, high-gain regime. We find that two distinct mechanisms govern the atomic dynamics: the finite, frequency-dependent <b>atomic</b> response <b>time,</b> and momentum-space population redistribution. At low input probe intensities, the residual Doppler {{width of the}} atoms, combined with the finite <b>atomic</b> response <b>time,</b> result in a linear, transient hysteretic effect that modifies the locations, widths, and magnitudes of the resulting gain spectra depending on {{the sign of the}} scan chirp. When larger intensities (i. e., greater than a few μW/cm^ 2) are incident on the atomic sample for several μs, hole-burning in the atomic sample's momentum distribution leads to a coherent population redistribution that persists for approximately 100 μs. We propose using RIRs to engineer the atomic momentum distribution to enhance the nonlinear atom-photon coupling. We present a numerical model, and compare the calculated and experimental results to verify our interpretation. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
2500|$|The {{other time}} scale has two parts. Ephemeris time (ET) is the {{independent}} variable in the equations of motion of the solar system, in particular, the equations in use from 1960 to 1984 [...] That is, {{the length of the}} second used in the solar system calculations could be adjusted until the length that gives the best agreement with observations is found. With the introduction of atomic clocks in the 1950s, it was found that ET could be better realized as <b>atomic</b> <b>time.</b> This also means that ET is a uniform time scale, as is <b>atomic</b> <b>time.</b> ET was given a new name, Terrestrial Time (TT), and for most purposes ET = TT = International <b>Atomic</b> <b>Time</b> + 32.184 SI seconds. [...] TT is ahead of UT1 by 69.184 seconds (International Earth Rotation Service 2017; [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this process, the mean solar day, which is {{nominally}} 86,400 seconds long, is actually getting longer when measured in SI seconds with stable atomic clocks. (The SI second, when adopted, was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time.) The small difference accumulates over time, which leads to an increasing difference between our clock time (Universal Time) on the one hand, and <b>Atomic</b> <b>Time</b> and Ephemeris Time on the other hand: see ΔT. This led to the introduction of the leap second in 1972 [...] to compensate for differences in the bases for time standardization.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{several years}} of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, England) and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) {{determined}} {{the relationship between the}} hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second. [...] Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV, they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. [...] They found that the second of ephemeris time (ET) had the duration of 9,192,631,770 ± 20 cycles of the chosen caesium frequency.

2500|$|The other {{consequence}} of tidal acceleration is the deceleration of {{the rotation of}} Earth. The rotation of Earth is somewhat erratic on all time scales (from hours to centuries) due to various causes. The small tidal effect cannot be observed in a short period, but the cumulative effect on Earth's rotation as measured with a stable clock (ephemeris time, <b>atomic</b> <b>time)</b> of a shortfall of even a few milliseconds every day becomes readily noticeable in a few centuries. Since some event in the remote past, more days and hours have passed (as measured in full rotations of Earth) (Universal Time) than would be measured by stable clocks calibrated to the present, longer length of the day (ephemeris time). This is known as ΔT. Recent values {{can be obtained from}} the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

40|$|It {{is usually}} {{assumed that the}} t {{parameter}} in the equations of dynamics can be identified with the indication of the pointer of a clock. Things are not so simple, however. In fact, because the equations of motion can be written in terms of t but {{also in terms of}} t' = f(t), f being any well-behaved function, any one of those infinite parametric times t' is as good as the newtonian one to study classical dynamics in hamiltonian form. Here we show that, as a consequence of parametric invariance, one of the foundations of classical dynamics, the relation between the mathematical parametric time t in the equations of dynamics and the physical dynamical time sigma that is measured with a particular clock (which is itself a dynamical system) requires the characterization of the clock that is used to achieve a complete treatment of dynamical systems. These two kinds of time, therefore, must be carefully distinguished. Furthermore, we show that not all the dynamical clock-times are necessarily equivalent and that the observational fingerprint of this nonequivalence has, curiously, the same form as that of the Pioneer anomaly. This suggests, therefore, that an acceleration to one another of the astronomical and the <b>atomic</b> <b>times,</b> t(astr) and t(atom), can contribute to the total amount of the anomaly...|$|R
