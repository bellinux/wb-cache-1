5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Hristo Matanov conjectures {{that after}} 1355, John may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside the inner Balkans. He bases this theory {{on a new}} reading of several Latin-language coin inscriptions as Monita despoti Ioanni instead of Monita despoti Oliveri, as previously thought.

5|$|The <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> {{the panel}} {{reflects}} the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art.

As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Previous {{research}} has identified a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>attributions</b> for negative but preventable health outcomes (e. g. HIV/AIDS), from control, through responsibility, to blame, which becomes increasingly reliant upon subjective biases. This study investigated whether <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> control, responsibility and {{credit for a}} positive outcome followed a comparably influenced systematic sequence. Design: A vignette-based questionnaire design was implemented. Primary outcome variables were scores on measures <b>of</b> <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> control, responsibility and credit {{in response to the}} positive outcome described in a vignette. Additional variables were measured in order to investigate the reliance <b>of</b> <b>attributions</b> on pre-existing affective, behavioural, and attitudinal biases. Methods: Following their reading of a vignette describing an active pursuit of well-being, a self-selected sample of 144 adults completed online questionnaires measuring <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> control, responsibility and credit. Measures of happiness, social acceptance, behaviour change, mental health locus of control, and just world beliefs were also completed. Results: <b>Attributions</b> <b>of</b> credit were significantly greater than those of control (p<. 001) or responsibility (p<. 001), whereas control and responsibility did not differ significantly. Happiness and mental health locus of control uniquely predicted <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> control (ps<. 05) and responsibility (ps<. 005), whereas happiness (p=. 002) and behaviour change (p=. 049) uniquely predicted <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> credit. Although a hierarchy for positive attributions was evidenced, findings suggest that biases, which deviate from systematic cognitive processing, are inherent to attributional reasoning. Conclusions: Future research is warranted to advance theories <b>of</b> positive <b>attribution</b> processes, with anticipated research impact for informing public policy and promoting observable behaviours that characterise psychological well-being...|$|R

5|$|The {{director}} {{of the film is}} not known, but two possibles exist. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J.

Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company until moving to the Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. Q. David Bowers says that the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> these early directors often comes from a collection of contemporary publications or interviews.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{two studies}} we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} degree of collective failure in a public good dilemma (near miss vs. large miss) on group members' negative reactions (negative affect, <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> responsibility for the failure, and intention to leave the group). The results show that upward counterfactual thinking has more impact on members' negative responses when experiencing a near miss rather than a large miss. In Experiment 1, {{the results show that}} in the case of a near miss (and not a large miss), negative affect and <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> responsibility were higher when other-focused counterfactuals rather than self-focused counterfactuals were elicited. Negative affect was found to mediate the effect on <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> responsibility. Experiment 2 replicates these findings on a wider range of negative responses and reveals that the effect of counterfactual thought on willingness to leave the group in the case of a near miss is mediated by <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> responsibility...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of the diagnostic label ‘antisocial personality disorder’ on health care staff’s causal <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> challenging behaviour, their emotional responses to that challenging behaviour, their optimism about treatment and behavioural change and their propensity to help. Of additional interest was how three aspects of burnout might impact on the above variables. This study employed a between subjects questionnaire methodology. There were 62 participants that comprised of healthcare staff working in low and medium secure mental health settings. Participants were given a case vignette describing a challenging behaviour. In one group, the character in the case vignette was described as having a diagnosis of ‘antisocial personality disorder’, in another group he was described as having a diagnosis of ‘schizophrenia’ and in the third group no diagnosis was provided. Participants then rated the causal attributions, emotional responses, optimism and helping behaviour. All ratings were taken on seven point bipolar scales. Finally they completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (1996). Participants who were given the vignette with the ASPD diagnosis gave higher ratings for causal <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> control. The no label group responded with the highest ratings of anger. On the sample as a whole, <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> controllability and internality were correlated. Controllability was correlated with emotional responding and helping behaviour. Optimism was correlated with helping behaviour. Emotional exhaustion was associated with <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> controllability and internality. Depersonalisation was also associated with <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> controllability. Diminished personal accomplishment was associated with optimism. The label antisocial personality disorder may influence how staff make causal <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> control. This may have implications for how staff respond to such patients. <b>Attributions</b> <b>of</b> control were associated with more anger, less sympathy and less helping behaviour. In addition staff that are experiencing high levels of stress may also have been more vulnerable to making <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> control. This study found that qualified nursing staff were more likely to experience stress. These findings are discussed in relation to current literature and the clinical implications are described particularly in relation to the formulation of interventions for healthcare staff.

5|$|In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain {{separated}} Marignac's ytterbia {{into two}} components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later {{became known as}} the element ytterbium, and lutecia {{became known as the}} element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact that}} the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain.

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
5|$|The International Commission on Atomic Weights, {{which was}} then {{responsible}} for the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact}} that the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium. Until the 1950s, some German-speaking chemists called lutetium by Welsbach's name, cassiopeium; in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. The reason for this was that Welsbach's 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure, while Urbain's 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium. This later misled Urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72, which he named celtium, which was actually very pure lutetium. The later discrediting of Urbain's work on element 72 led to a reappraisal of Welsbach's work on element 71, so that the element was renamed to cassiopeium in German-speaking countries for some time. Charles James, who stayed out of the priority argument, worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time. Pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953.|$|E

5|$|The first {{generations of}} artists were active {{during the height}} of Burgundian {{influence}} in Europe, when the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority were destroyed during waves of iconoclasm in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive. Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century.
