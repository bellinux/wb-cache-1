5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanlinessâ€”all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E

25|$|Static {{triggered}} {{spark gap}} - Commercial and industrial circuits often apply a DC voltage from <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{to charge the}} capacitor, and use high voltage pulses generated by an oscillator applied to a triggering electrode to trigger the spark. This allows control of the spark rate and exciting voltage. Commercial spark gaps are often enclosed in an insulating gas atmosphere such as sulfur hexafluoride, reducing the length and thus the energy loss in the spark.|$|E
25|$|Electronic analog PID {{control loops}} were often found within more complex {{electronic}} systems, for example, the head positioning of a disk drive, the power conditioning of <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> {{or even the}} movement-detection circuit of a modern seismometer. Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using microcontrollers or FPGAs, to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is <b>an</b> electronic <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{that incorporates}} <b>a</b> switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> <b>an</b> SMPS transfers <b>power</b> from <b>a</b> DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike <b>a</b> linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, <b>a</b> switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, <b>a</b> linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of <b>a</b> switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|R

25|$|Examples of {{non-linear}} loads on a {{power system}} are rectifiers (such {{as used in}} <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply),</b> and arc discharge devices such as fluorescent lamps, electric welding machines, or arc furnaces. Because current in these systems is interrupted by a switching action, the current contains frequency components that are multiples of the power system frequency.

25|$|An {{electret}} microphone {{is a type}} of condenser microphone, which eliminates the need for <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> by using a permanently charged material. Electret materials have been known since the 1920s, and were proposed as condenser microphone elements several times, but were considered impractical until the foil electret type was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1962 by Jim West, using a thin metallized Teflon foil. This became the most common type, used in many applications from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones.|$|E
25|$|A smoke {{detector}} is {{a device that}} detects smoke and issues a signal. Most {{smoke detector}}s work either by optical detection or by physical process, {{but some of them}} use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> backup in case the mains power fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of Thomas Alva Edison, although {{there is no evidence that}} Edison contributed to this invention.|$|E

25|$|If {{a purely}} {{resistive}} load {{is connected to}} <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> current and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. Inductive loads such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume reactive power with current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as capacitor banks or buried cable generate reactive power with current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device's magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source {{during the rest of}} the cycle.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Board took {{delivery}} of a Ransomes trolley bus in 1931, they conducted trials with it on the Hills portion of the Cashmere route. The objective was to determine how trolley buses would perform on such terrain, though not intending to actually convert the route to trolley bus operation. The following year, buses temporarily replaced trams on this route during the tramway strike {{because of concerns about}} the replacement motormen the Board had taken on to operate the trams were not sufficiently skilled to safely operate a tram on the Hills section, and those supporting the strike had taken to sabotage to disrupt tram operation on the Hills section. Tram services were again temporarily replaced with buses during <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> crisis from June to August 1947.|$|E
25|$|The Zune 80 was {{announced}} on October 2, 2007, {{along with the}} smaller Zune 4 and Zune 8 to compete with Apple's iPod nano line. These were {{to be known as}} the second generation of Zune devices. The Zune 80 featured a 3.2inch screen, while the Zune 4 and 8 come with an 1.8inch screen. Both come with a new touchpad-style input device ("squircle") and new software. Additional file support for H.264 and MPEG-4 formats was also included, whereas the older Zune 30 requires these formats to be transcoded to WMV prior to sync. The ability to sync wirelessly (automatically if connected to <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply),</b> podcast support, and an upgraded song-sharing licensing became available on all models. The new software also allowed a Zune device to communicate with other Zune devices to share pictures and songs.

25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that it takes some time for the {{customers}} {{to get used to the}} idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.|$|E
25|$|The Fridge Gate {{method is}} a {{theoretical}} application {{of using a}} single logic gate to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates {{on the fact that}} there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with the fridge gate. The first is on the interior of the fridge, the second on the outside and the third is connected to <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of the fridge, the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of the fridge where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.|$|E

500|$|Another {{change was}} due to {{every part of the}} {{equipment}} having different power requirements.
