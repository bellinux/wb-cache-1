Supporters of Victor IV, <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> they were in minority, justified their action {{by the fact that}} the opposite faction broke the rule of unanimity and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid. The opposite party claimed that the principle of unanimity had been breached by the obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of the Imperial faction, who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired by the rest of the Sacred College.|$|E

5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself.

Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E
