500|$|Although the sea {{had been}} growing rougher all day, the nearby {{cyclonic}} disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach. Each of the carriers in the Third Fleet had a weatherman aboard, and as the fleet flagship New Jersey had a highly experienced weatherman: Commander G. F. Kosco, {{a graduate of the}} <b>aerology</b> course at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had also studied hurricanes in the West Indies; despite this, none of these individuals or staffs were able to give Third Fleet due warning of the impending typhoon. On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught {{near the center of the}} storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers—, [...] and —capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage. Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars, and some 146 planes on various ships were lost or damaged beyond economical repair by fires, impact damage, or by being swept overboard. As with the other battleships of TF 38, skillful seamanship brought New Jersey through the storm largely unscathed. She returned to Ulithi on Christmas Eve to be met by Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz.|$|E

50|$|<b>Aerology</b> film {{production}} was supervised by naval aviation experts and {{some members of}} Disney's team learned how to fly {{to better understand the}} problems the Army Air Forces encountered. Victory Through Air Power (1943) is one of the propaganda films Disney produced for air warfare. This film is an attempt to sell Major Alexander de Seversky's theories about the practical uses of long range strategic bombing. The animated film humorously tells about the development of air warfare and then switches to the Major illustrating how his ideas could win the war for the Allies.|$|E
50|$|Léon Philippe Teisserenc de Bort (5 November 1855 in Paris, France - 2 January 1913 in Cannes, France) was a French {{meteorologist}} and {{a pioneer}} in the field of <b>aerology.</b> Together with Richard Assmann (1845-1918), he is credited as co-discoverer of the stratosphere, as both men announced their discovery during the same time period in 1902. Teisserenc de Bort pioneered the use of unmanned instrumented balloons and was the first to identify the region in the atmosphere around 8-17 kilometers of height where the lapse rate reaches zero, known today as the tropopause.|$|E
50|$|Seilkopf Peaks (Seilkopfberge) is a {{group of}} mainly {{ice-free}} peaks and ridges between Portalen Pass and Nalegga Ridge in the Borg Massif, Queen Maud Land. The feature was photograph air by the German Antarctic Expedition (1938-39) and named for Heinrich Seilkopf, head of the marine <b>aerology</b> section of the Deutsche Seewarte (German Hydrographic Office) in Hamburg. Although rudely mapped by German Antarctic Expedition, the Seilkopf Peaks are clearly shown and identified in air photos published by the expedition. The peaks were mapped in detail by the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) (1949-52).|$|E

Magnetic, ionosphere, ice and other observations are also carried out there. Regular measurements of the ice flow coordinates provide the data on the direction and speed of its drift.|$|E

50|$|But “Reich” {{was a man}} {{of action}} and volunteered to become a naval aviator. As such, he not only thought about observing and {{forecasting}} the weather, but also realized that understanding {{it was a matter of}} life and death for the aviation community. He flew in dirigibles, fixed wing aircraft, and even as a competitive hot air balloonist. Because of his meteorological and aviation experience, he became Chief of Navy <b>Aerology</b> in 1922 and served in that capacity until 1928. He worked in a corner of the main Weather Bureau offices in Washington, D.C., drawing up maps, comparing them to official forecasts, and pondering the weather.|$|E
5000|$|Building 6 was the Operations building. All flight {{operations}} were controlled from an air conditioned observation {{room in the}} control tower of this building, which had windows overlooking the runway and landing mat areas. Signalling, radio sending sending and receiving equipment, and switches controlling the electric lighting of the runways were operated from this room. Communications, radio and weather reporting offices were located on the second floor, with offices of the operating personnel, <b>aerology</b> department and record department on the first floor. The building was [...] "L" [...] shaped, , containing the reinforced concrete control tower, that was [...] by [...] high. Two small partial basements enclosed pump and heater rooms. There was also a motor driven electric beacon and meteorological instruments.|$|E
50|$|Sable Island is {{the subject}} of {{extensive}} scientific research. A wide range of manual and automated instruments are used at the Station, including the Automated Weather Observing System operated by the Meteorological Service of Canada, an <b>aerology</b> program measuring conditions in the upper atmosphere using a radiosonde carried aloft by a hydrogen-filled weather balloon to altitudes beyond 40 km, and a program collecting data on background levels of carbon dioxide, which began there in 1974. Research is done to monitor the long-range transport of pollution aerosols. Fog chemistry is studied, examining the transport and composition of atmospheric toxins it carries. Tropospheric ozone is measured and analyzed by researchers in Canada and the United States along with 20 other North American sites.|$|E
