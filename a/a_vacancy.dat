40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically {{the effect}} of nearby <b>As</b> (arsenic) <b>vacancies</b> on the magnetic properties of substitutional Mn (manganese) impurities on the GaAs (110) surface, using a microscopic tight-binding model which captures the salient features of the electronic structure of both types of defects in GaAs. The calculations show that the binding energy of the Mn-acceptor is essentially unaffected {{by the presence of}} <b>a</b> neutral <b>As</b> <b>vacancy,</b> even at the shortest possible V_ As [...] Mn separation. On the other hand, in contrast to a simple tip-induced-band-bending theory and in agreement with experiment, for a positively charged <b>As</b> <b>vacancy</b> the Mn-acceptor binding energy is significantly reduced as the <b>As</b> <b>vacancy</b> is brought closer to the Mn impurity. For two Mn impurities aligned ferromagnetically, we find that nearby charged <b>As</b> <b>vacancies</b> enhance the energy level splitting of the associated coupled acceptor levels, leading to an increase of the effective exchange interaction. Neutral vacancies leave the exchange splitting unchanged. Since it is experimentally possible to switch reversibly between the two charge states of the <b>vacancy,</b> such <b>a</b> local electric manipulation of the magnetic dopants could result in an efficient real-time control of their exchange interaction.

40|$|We {{have studied}} vacancy defects in {{chalcopyrite}} semimagnetic semiconducting mixed Zn 1 −x(Mn,Co) xGeAs 2 bulk crystals with alloy composition x varying between 0. 052 to 0. 182 using positron annihilation spectroscopy. We identified <b>As</b> <b>vacancies,</b> potentially complexed with the transition metal alloying elements, {{in all the}} studied samples, while no cation vacancy related defects were detected. The positron lifetimes for the bulk ZnGeAs 2 lattice and neutral <b>As</b> <b>vacancy</b> were determined to be τB= 220 – 230  ps and τAs= 300 ± 10  ps, respectively. Our results also show that the p-type conductivity in the samples is not due to cation vacancy related acceptor centers. The <b>As</b> <b>vacancies</b> {{were found to be}} present at such low concentrations that they cannot be responsible for the compensation of the p-type conductivity or the reduction of mobility in the Zn 1 −x(Mn,Co) xGeAs 2 samples.

5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor is elected {{on the same}} election ticket as the Governor in a statewide election held every four years, concurrent with United States presidential elections. Should a {{lieutenant governor}} die while in office, resign, or succeed to the governorship, the constitution specifies no mechanism by which to fill vacancies in the lieutenant governor's office. Historically, the position has generally remained vacant during such events. The last attempt to fill such <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> in 1887 led to the outbreak {{of violence in the}} state legislature known as the Black Day of the General Assembly. However, in recent years the Governor has appointed a Lieutenant Governor if <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> arises.|$|E

Some years previously he had indicated his interest in becoming an officer of arms, should <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> arise, to the Duke of Norfolk, who as Earl Marshal is responsible for the College of Arms. Planché was also an acquaintance of Charles Young, Garter King of Arms, the principal officer of arms at the College.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} and electronic properties of vacancies in GaAs {{have been studied}} using ab initio molecular dynamics. The atomic structures of vacancies in different charge states have been optimized by using a simulated-annealing procedure. The neighbor-atom relaxations are modest for neutral, singly negative, and doubly negative Ga vacancies {{as well as for}} the neutral <b>As</b> <b>vacancy.</b> In the case of singly and doubly negative <b>As</b> <b>vacancies,</b> very strong inward relaxations are found. These inward relaxations almost recover the fourfold coordination of the neighboring Ga atoms of the vacancy. The analysis of recent positron-annihilation experimental data is discussed in the light of these results. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of water with}} titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanosheets has been studied under the framework of density functional theory plus Hubbard model. Particularly, the effect of <b>an</b> oxygen <b>vacancy</b> and <b>a</b> titanium <b>vacancy</b> on the dissociation of water has been investigated. It is found that molecular adsorption is favored on perfect TiO 2 nanosheets and <b>a</b> titanium <b>vacancy,</b> while over <b>an</b> oxygen <b>vacancy</b> water prefers to dissociate spontaneously due to the strong bonding between water and unsaturated titanium and oxygen. With the formation of water-water hydrogen bonds, dissociated water can be further stabilized. The role of titanium and oxygen vacancies is further discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} electronic structure...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{identification}} of native vacancies in GaAs by positron annihilation with a special emphasis on As vacancy-related defects. In annealed highly Si-doped GaAs, we observe <b>a</b> neutral <b>vacancy</b> defect with <b>a</b> positron lifetime tau of 280 - 285 ps and a high intensity of the core annihilation, in contrast to Ga <b>vacancies</b> which exhibit <b>a</b> lifetime of similar to 260 ps and a lower intensity of the core annihilation. This defect is identified by scanning tunneling microscopy measurements to be <b>an</b> <b>As</b> <b>vacancy</b> Si-Ga donor complex. We find that the same defect is also present in low it-doped GaAs, where it was earlier assigned to <b>a</b> neutral <b>As</b> <b>vacancy.</b> The high positron lifetime is explained by a large outward lattice relaxation. Theoretical calculations of the momentum distribution employing free atomic wave functions are in good agreement with the experimental results, provided only relative changes are considered and an outward lattice relaxation is included which yields the experimental positron lifetime. These calculations also yield annihilation parameters for Ga vacancies, in good agreement with the experiment. Our results demonstrate that vacancies in both sublattices of GaAs can directly and unambiguously be identified by positron annihilation once the annihilation characteristics are calibrated by a complementary method. On {{the basis of this}} identification, the abundance of <b>As</b> <b>vacancies</b> in GaAs is discussed in terms of stoichiometry and formation energies...|$|R

Allowing for correlated unobserved heterogeneity in a joint statistical model for choice of of training and duration of search renders this effect insignificant. However, a somewhat more complicated model yields a less clear picture. Training; Duration Data; Correlated Random Effects; Non-parametric mixture; Simulated Annealing; Experimental Data...|$|R

5|$|Combs {{began his}} {{political}} career with his election {{to the office of}} city attorney in Prestonsburg in 1950. Later that year, Governor Lawrence Wetherby appointed him to fill <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> in the office of Commonwealth's Attorney for Kentucky's 31st Judicial District. Combs announced, however, that he would serve only until a new election could be held. In April 1951, Governor Wetherby appointed Combs to fill <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> on the Kentucky Court of Appeals caused by the death of Judge Roy Helm. Later that year, he sought a full eight-year term on the court. His opponent was Simeon S. Willis, a popular former Republican governor who had previously sat on the court. Combs won the election by a vote of 73,298 to 69,379. In George Robinson's oral history, Combs attributed his victory to Willis's advanced age (68) and {{the fact that many of}} Willis' supporters assumed that their candidate would win and did not vote.|$|E

5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh. Though he {{was made}} a lieutenant-general, both of British and Hanoverian forces, he {{remained}} in England, and, with {{a seat in the}} House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views, and soon became a leader of the right of the party. King George had feared that Ernest, like some of his elder brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which {{led to the formation of}} the Addington Government. In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> developed. <b>A</b> <b>vacancy</b> promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{luminescence}} colors is often unclear and not unique. Blue emission from type IIa and IIb diamonds is reliably identified with dislocations by directly correlating the emission with dislocations in an electron microscope. However, blue emission in type Ia diamond could be either due to dislocations or the N3 defects (three nitrogen atoms bordering <b>a</b> <b>vacancy).</b> Green emission in natural diamond is usually due to the H3 center (two substitutional nitrogen atoms separated by <b>a</b> <b>vacancy),</b> whereas in synthetic diamond it usually originates from nickel used as a catalyst (see figure). Orange or red emission {{could be due to}} various reasons, one being the nitrogen-vacancy center which is present in sufficient quantities in all types of diamond, even type IIb.|$|E
