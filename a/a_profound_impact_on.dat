5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain probably had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> {{the structure of}} marine communities. The fossil record indicates {{that it had a}} cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> biological thinking. In the early 19th century, {{a number of}} biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell.

Thanks {{to the work of}} Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what {{came to be known as}} cell theory.|$|E

Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the Battle of the Somme, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air.

5|$|Banagher was {{extensively}} {{planted by}} the English, {{particularly during the}} periods 1621–1642 and 1650–1690. The plantations had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Ireland in several ways. The first was {{the destruction of the}} native ruling classes and their replacement with the Protestant Ascendancy, of British-origin (mostly English) Protestant landowners. Their position was buttressed by the Penal Laws, which denied political and land-owning rights to Roman Catholics. The dominance of this class in Irish life persisted until the late 18th century, and it voted for the Act of Union with Britain in 1800. As a result, by the early 20th century, Banagher had a mix of Irish of native descent and Irish of English descent and supported two churches, one Catholic and one Protestant, both of which still exist.|$|E
5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the plasma {{polymerisation}} of two siloxane precursors, [hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) and tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) ] with an atmospheric pressure pseudoglow dielectric barrier discharge operated in argon and an argon-air mixture. The influence of gas composition and precursor type on the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the deposited films is examined in detail using contact angle measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results clearly show that precursor type as well as gas composition has <b>an</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> film growth rate and chemical composition of the deposited films. Plasma polymerisation of both siloxane precursors in argon leads to the formation of hydrophobic polymers consisting of a Si-O-Si backbone, while for deposition in an argon-air mixture, hydrophilic inorganic silica-like coatings are obtained...|$|R
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by groups like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He always had an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E

Ramasamy {{felt compelled to}} enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> world {{politics}} and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves {{over how to}} interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's orbit has <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> {{the region}} {{directly}} beyond it, {{known as the}} Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way}} that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} of this period that would have <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Kannada literature even into the modern age was {{the birth of the}} Haridasa ("servants of Hari or Vishnu") movement. This devotional movement, although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12thcentury (which produced Vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god Shiva), was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme God. The inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of Madhvacharya of Udupi. Naraharitirtha (1281) is considered the first well-known haridasa and composer of Vaishnava devotional songs in Kannada. Before his induction into the Madhva order, he had served as a minister in the court of Kalinga (modern Orissa). The Vaishnava poetry however disappeared for about two centuries after Naraharitirtha's death before resurfacing as a popular form of folk literature during the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire. Only three of Naraharitirtha's compositions are available today.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, {{his first}} cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a son, Sandip, {{who is now}} a film {{director}}. In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> him.

5|$|Modern historians hold widely varying {{opinions}} of the Crusaders. To some, their conduct was incongruous with the stated aims and implied moral authority of the papacy, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that on occasion the Pope excommunicated Crusaders. Crusaders often pillaged as they travelled, and their leaders generally retained control of captured territory instead of returning it to the Byzantines. During the People's Crusade, thousands of Jews were murdered in what is now called the Rhineland massacres. Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade. However, the Crusades had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Western civilisation: they reopened the Mediterranean to commerce and travel (enabling Genoa and Venice to flourish); they consolidated the collective identity of the Latin Church under papal leadership; and they constituted a wellspring for accounts of heroism, chivalry, and piety that galvanised medieval romance, philosophy, and literature. The Crusades also reinforced the connection between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism.|$|E
5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function.
