5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for neutron <b>activation</b> <b>analysis</b> to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{indicates}} causality as {{the tool}} that unifies the <b>analysis</b> of both <b>activations</b> and connectivity of brain areas, obtained with fMRI data. Causality analysis is commonly applied to study connectivity, so this work focuses on demonstrating that also {{the detection of}} activations can be handled with a causality analysis. We test our method on finger tapping data, in which GLM and Granger Causality approaches are compared in finding activations. Granger causality not only performs the task well, but indeed we obtained a better localization (i. e. precision) of activations. As a result we claim that causality must be the main tool to investigate activations, since it {{is a measure of}} "how much" the stimulus influences the BOLD signal, and since it unifies connectivity and <b>activations</b> <b>analysis</b> under the same area...|$|R

Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and <b>activation</b> <b>analysis</b> (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E

In SF 126 glioblastoma cells, however, EGF and PDGF synergistically activated JNK, while neither PDGF nor EGF stimulated PKD activity. In this cell line, overexpression of PKD blocked EGF- and PDGF-induced JNK <b>activation.</b> Mutational <b>analysis</b> further revealed that the EGFR mutant (T 654 / 669 E) was incapable of activating JNK and provided evidence that PKD-mediated dual phosphorylation of these critical threonine residues leads to suppression of EGF-induced JNK activation.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{processes by}} which information is incorporated and distributed within a cell are termed signal transduction. These pathways allow cells to {{interact with each other}} and with their environments and are critical to the proper cellular function in a variety of contexts. Previously developed methods for analyzing signaling networks have been largely ignored, most likely due to their mathematical complexity and difficulty in application. A novel analysis framework was developed to assist in the examination of signaling networks, both to facilitate the reconstruction of previously undetermined pathways as well as to quantitatively characterize interactions between components. This approach, termed <b>activation</b> ratio <b>analysis,</b> involves the ratio between active and inactive forms of signaling intermediates at steady state. The activation ratio of an intermediate is shown to depend linearly upon the concentration of the activating enzyme. The slope of the line is defined as the activation factor, and is determined by the kinetic parameters of activation and inactivation. The mathematical functionality of the activation ratio changes for other signaling network arrangements. It is therefore possible to extract the original network structure from a set of measured activation ratios, with activation factors yielding a measure of activation potential between intermediates. This framework was tested using computational simulations of a small-scale interconnected network, cascades with feedback, and in the presence of experimental noise. In the process, additional tools were developed to automate and evaluate the analysis. (cont.) The theoretical concepts were also applied to examine the modification cycles of the protein Erk 2 by the kinase Mekl and phosphatases PTP 1 B and PP 2 A in vitro. Limitations in the accuracy of measurements and experimental setup resulted in high uncertainty in the calculated distribution of Erk states, preventing a quantitative analysis of this system. Nevertheless, qualitative predictions from <b>activation</b> ratio <b>analysis</b> were verified, in particular, the influence of component concentrations on the Erk distribution at steady state. While these issues indicate considerations for future experimental studies, they do not override the ability of <b>activation</b> ratio <b>analysis</b> to investigate signaling networks, where description of interactions in the whole system is more important than detailed examination of the individual steps. by Francisco Javier Femenia.
