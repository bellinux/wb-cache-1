5|$|The {{tropical}} depression {{traveled to the}} northwest across the southwest Gulf of Mexico. It strengthened rapidly, and there was evidence of deep convection as it passed over warm waters. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beryl late on August 14 with surface winds of 50mph (85km/h), based on reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> <b>observation.</b> Six hours later, the storm accelerated to near 9mph (15km/h), meaning that landfall would happen sooner than expected, preventing the time for Beryl to strengthen to a hurricane. However, Beryl failed to undergo significant intensification as was forecast, as it maintained an intensity of 50mph (85km/h). The lack of intensification {{could be due to}} moderate wind shear and entrainment over the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical Storm Beryl continued to track to the northwest toward the Rio Grande Valley area in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Texas. The storm made landfall early on August 15 along the Mexican coast about 105mi (165km) south of Brownsville, Texas, 35mi (55km) north La Pesca, Tamaulipas and about 115mi (185km) north of Tampico. Beryl was downgraded to a {{tropical depression}} about five hours after landfall. The Brownsville radar showed that the circulation center of the storm became elongated parallel to the mountain ranges of northeastern Mexico, so the system was no longer declared a tropical depression late on August 15, while located near Monterrey.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) during warm-air advection over sea ice in the Fram Strait is investigated. A hierarchy of numerical models is applied {{and the results are}} validated against <b>aircraft</b> <b>observations.</b> Operational HIRLAM (HIgh Resolution Limited Area Model) runs suffered from inaccurate information on the location of the sea ice edge. When this was improved, together with improving the horizontal resolution, the HIRLAM results became much better. Two-dimensional model runs with inflow boundary conditions prescribed according to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>observations</b> demonstrated that the contribution of thin ice (re-frozen leads) is important.

40|$|Satellite and <b>aircraft</b> <b>observations</b> {{made during}} the 2006 Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS) {{detected}} strong urban, industrial and power plant plumes in Texas. We simulated these plumes using the Weather Research and Forecasting – Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model with input from the US EPA's 2005 National Emission Inventory (NEI- 2005), in order to evaluate emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x = NO + NO 2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the cities of Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. We compared the model results with satellite retrievals of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) columns and airborne in-situ observations of several trace gases including NO x {{and a number of}} VOCs. The model and satellite NO 2 columns agree well for regions with large power plants and for urban areas that are dominated by mobile sources, such as Dallas. However, in Houston, where significant mobile, industrial, and in-port marine vessel sources contribute to NO x emissions, the model NO 2 columns are approximately 50 %– 70 % higher than the satellite columns. Similar conclusions are drawn from comparisons of the model results with the TexAQS 2006 <b>aircraft</b> <b>observations</b> in Dallas and Houston. For Dallas plumes, the model-simulated NO 2 showed good agreement with the <b>aircraft</b> <b>observations.</b> In contrast, the model-simulated NO 2 is ~ 60 % higher than the <b>aircraft</b> <b>observations</b> in the Houston plumes. Further analysis indicates that the NEI- 2005 NO x emissions over the Houston Ship Channel area are overestimated while the urban Houston NO x emissions are reasonably represented. The comparisons of model and <b>aircraft</b> <b>observations</b> confirm that highly reactive VOC emissions originating from industrial sources in Houston are underestimated in NEI- 2005. The update of VOC emissions based on Solar Occultation Flux measurements during the field campaign leads to improved model simulations of ethylene, propylene, and formaldehyde. Reducing NO x emissions in the Houston Ship Channel and increasing highly reactive VOC emissions from the point sources in Houston improve the model's capability of simulating ozone (O 3) plumes observed by the NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft, although the deficiencies in the model O 3 simulations indicate that many challenges remain for a full understanding of the O 3 formation mechanisms in Houston...|$|R

Here we provide an overview of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>observations</b> in DYNAMO, which captured an MJO initiation event from November-December 2011. The NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft was stationed at Diego Garcia and the French Falcon- 20 aircraft on Gan Island in the Maldives.
