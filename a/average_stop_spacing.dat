40|$|In practice, {{the design}} of bus routes and stop {{placement}} involves calculated trade-offs between service frequency, quality, and access. Increased stop density improves access but contributes to slow operating speeds and increased operating costs. In this thesis, a optimized bus stop spacing model is applied using the high resolution archived stop-level bus performance data from the Bus Dispatch System (BDS) provided by TriMet, the regional transit provider for the Portland metropolitan area. Two cost components are considered in the stop spacing model including passenger access cost and in-vehicle passenger stopping cost, and are combined and optimized to minimize total cost. A case-study is presented using one year 2 ̆ 7 s stop-level data from one bus route 19 in Portland, Oregon. The analysis considered both inbound and outbound stop spacing and determined the optimal <b>average</b> <b>stop</b> <b>spacing</b> based on an all-day, peak and off-peak time periods. Based on the analysis considering inbound trips over the entire day, the theoretical optimized bus stop spacing was about 1, 200 feet, {{as compared to the}} current value of 890 feet. This paper also builds on the all day analysis and focuses on inbound and outbound trips during peak periods, resulting in optimized spacing of about 1, 300 feet. The peak hour demand has {{a significant impact on the}} transit operation. A bus stop consolidation scheme is proposed for the analyzed bus route considering the peak hour transit demand. Finally, the thesis discusses trade-offs and presents an estimate of transit operating cost savings based on the optimized spacing. Given the growing availability of high-resolution archived data, the thesis illustrates that this modeling tool can be applied in a routine way across multiple routes as part of an ongoing service planning and performance measurement process...|$|E

For the evaluation we chose a reference scenario defining two distinct traffic flows through an urban area that provides four crossings with traffic light controls.

40|$|Many transit {{agencies}} run both limited-stop {{and local}} service along {{some of their}} heavy ridership corridors. The primary benefit of limited-stop bus service is higher speed which results in reduced running time and thus reduced travel time for passengers. This reduced travel time can improve the service quality for existing passengers and can increase ridership on the route and thus both passengers and the agency can benefit from limited- stop service. However, this strategy also results in increased access time, and in increased wait time for some passengers. This thesis develops a model to evaluate limited stop bus service and then applies the model to develop general design guidelines for limited-stop service. The model created evaluates a specific service configuration including both the local and limited-stop headways and stops. The model calculates travel times, and assigns existing demand to limited and local stops and to limited and local routes, based on minimum passenger (weighted) travel time. This assignment is applied at the origin-destination pair level. The model then calculates several measures of effectiveness, which are used to compare different configurations, including market share (local preferred, limited preferred, and choice passengers), stop and route assignment (number of passengers selecting the limited service stops and limited-stop service), net change in passenger travel time (weighted and un-weighted), and finally productivity (passengers per trip and per vehicle hour for the local and limited-stop service). The model was used to analyze two CTA cases: Western Avenue local Route 49 and limited-stop Route X 49, and the Madison Avenue Route 20. (cont.) The analysis of Western Avenue and Madison Avenue involved testing alternative frequency configurations; alternate <b>stop</b> <b>spacing</b> configurations were analyzed only for Madison Avenue. The specific findings on these routes show that the existing <b>stop</b> <b>spacing</b> on Route X 49 is effective, but to improve the overall effectiveness of the route the limited-stop frequency share should be increased to at least 60 % of all service on the corridor. Limited-stop service on Madison Avenue was found not to be effective under any configuration due to short trip lengths and evenly distributed demand along the route. The results of the analysis were used to develop two sets of guidelines: corridor (or route) potential for limited stop service and limited-stop service design. The corridor potential guidelines suggest that high concentrations of origins and destinations and long passenger trips are both critical {{to the effectiveness of}} limited-stop service. Additional factors that affect the corridor potential for limited-stop service are the existing headway and ridership and the potential for route level running time savings. Limited-stop service design guidelines were developed for setting <b>stop</b> <b>spacing</b> and frequency share. The <b>stop</b> <b>spacing</b> on the limited-stop service should be decided by placing stops at the highest demand points and at all transfer points, and is guided by the distribution of origins and destinations, with the goal of attaining a wide enough <b>stop</b> <b>spacing</b> to achieve significant route level travel time savings. One of the major findings of this thesis is that limited-stop service is generally most effective at greater than 50 % frequency share. by Stacey Schwarcz. Thesis (S. M.)

A great deal of {{research has been done}} to provide tools for determining optimal <b>stop</b> <b>spacing,</b> but tools are still needed to help service planners determine the optimal stops to remove. Stop-level bus performance data provide the information needed to develop a method for assessing the total benefits and costs to riders of removing individual stops. This tool compares the benefit to through-riders in terms of travel time savings with the additional access cost to riders using the stop. The tool was applied to a bus route in Portland, Oregon, using stop-level ridership data from TriMet, the regional transit agency. The case study identifies three stops with very high benefit-cost ratios and discusses the effects of removing those stops. A sensitivity analysis is performed to show the effect of changing the value of time factor or the assumed time savings from each stop removal. Further research needs are identified and tradeoffs are discussed regarding the use of this tool. Overall, the assessment tool provides a relatively simple way for transit service planners to identify ideal stops for removal or consolidation. [URL]...|$|R
