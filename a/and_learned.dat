40|$|This paper {{discusses}} effective {{leadership in}} online teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> involving capacity building, so that leadership occurs at multiple levels {{in order to}} sustain <b>and</b> transform <b>learning.</b> Literature conceptualising leadership as capacity building is examined. The paper considers practical examples of leadership as capacity building in online teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning,</b> <b>and</b> poses questions for further investigation. Effective leadership in online teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> must involve a significant element of capacity building, so that leadership occurs at multiple levels in an organization in order to sustain, renew and transform teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> for the future. As Lambert (1998, p. 75) points out, “increasing leadership capacity over time is the most productive way to bring about improvements that can be sustained”. Building leadership capacity in online teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> is an issue {{because it does not}} always happen. Individuals who have taught online may leave the organization and capacity is thereby lost. Online <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> teaching is affected, as finding staff to teach in online papers can be a challenge. Paradoxically, online teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> may hold the solution to its own dilemma, as the key to <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> lead in online teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> lies within the online settings: one builds capacity for leadership in online teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> by engaging in <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> leading with a mentor or team within these settings. Leadership obligations in online teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> therefore include the need for those who teach <b>and</b> <b>learn</b> online to work together, ensuring benefits to students, reciprocal learning for teachers involved, as well as a measure of accountability, and ultimately building of leadership capacity...|$|R
