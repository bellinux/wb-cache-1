5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> It stressed that {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E

In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 2.5 million in its initial broadcast.|$|E

Soon after, Peter returns to find the dance almost abandoned except for Mary Jane, who is dancing with another boy. Downtrodden, he is reassured when Mary Jane walks up to him and tells him that she saved the last dance for him.|$|E
5|$|From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni {{organised}} {{a series}} of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to and above the Western Wall. The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> The Jews protested and tensions increased.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} such an area became {{apparent}} when in 1989, after repeated attacks by haredim, activists belonging to a group called Women of the Wall petitioned to secure the right of women to pray <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> without restrictions. In a 2003 directive, Israel's Supreme Court disallowed any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional prayer shawls at the plaza itself, but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson's Arch to host such events. The site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall. In May 2013 a judge ruled that the 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> should not be deemed as disturbing the public order.|$|E
5|$|To {{film the}} scenes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> the {{production}} built a {{set on the}} abandoned quarry of Magheramorne, a few minutes north of Belfast. The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry {{as the basis for}} the ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond. They also made a real elevator to lift the rangers to the top of the Wall.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} special worship events {{have been held}} since the renovation. They have taken {{advantage}} of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security. However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{a status}} quo {{agreement}} {{issued by the}} mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall. The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the Chacham Bashi. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, Edward Keith-Roach, acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible modus vivendi had emerged and such screens had been put up {{from time to time}} when large numbers of people gathered to pray.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the ninth}} inning, Tigers' center fielder Austin Jackson {{executed}} an over-the-shoulder catch on the run to retire Cleveland's Mark Grudzielanek for the first out and preserve the perfect game, a play that has been compared to DeWayne Wise's leaping catch <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in the ninth-inning that preserved Mark Buehrle's perfect game in 2009. Mike Redmond grounded out to make the second out of the inning. Jason Donald then hit a soft ground ball that first baseman Miguel Cabrera had to range far to his right to retrieve. Donald was ruled safe, giving him an infield single, but video replay showed that Cabrera's throw to Galarraga, who was covering first base, beat Donald to the bag. Donald advanced to second and third base on defensive indifference during Trevor Crowe's at-bat, until Crowe grounded out to Brandon Inge, ending the game in a 3–0 victory for the Tigers.|$|E

Aemon knows this very well because he is actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown. Aemon advises Jon that he must choose either his duty to the Night's Watch or his family, but also warns that {{the consequences of his}} choice will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{uses the}} {{situation}} to host a sex education class {{in order to learn}} if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy {{that he is going to}} let this whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous flow velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Hebrew {{linguist}} {{and publisher}} Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort {{to purchase the}} Western Wall and lost all his assets. Even the attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition. In {{the first two months}} following the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure.|$|E
