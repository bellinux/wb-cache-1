40|$|Aim. This study {{focuses on}} the {{experience}} of healthcare staff with regard to patient <b>and</b> <b>visitor</b> violence in a general hospital. The occurrence of patient <b>and</b> <b>visitor</b> violence, staffs' interventions and the consequences of violence for different professions are investigated. Background. There is a lack of studies describing the factors influencing the occurrence of patient <b>and</b> <b>visitor</b> violence, intervention strategies and consequences. Existing studies often focus on nurses' experiences and single interactive factors between staff and patients/visitors involved. Design. A cross-sectional survey. Method. The survey was conducted in 2007 including 2495 staff working on different wards in a Swiss university general hospital. The questionnaire used was the Survey of Violence Experienced by Staff German Version-Revised. Findings. Half of the staff experienced patient <b>and</b> <b>visitor</b> violence in the past 12 months and 11 % in the past week. The age of the staff and the length of experience in their present workplace influenced the exposure to patient <b>and</b> <b>visitor</b> violence. Violence occurred mainly when staff carried out tasks involving close personal contact. Only 16 % of the staff was trained in aggression management. The feeling of confidence in managing patient <b>and</b> <b>visitor</b> violence depended significantly on the organizational attitude towards violence. The principal interventions used were calming and informative discussion. Conclusion. To prevent patient <b>and</b> <b>visitor</b> violence <b>and</b> improve management strategies, training which focuses on communication skills, which is specific to the professional context and which emphasizes patient centeredness, need to be designed and implemented. A strong organizational commitment is imperative to reduce violence...|$|R
