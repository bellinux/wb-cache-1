5|$|Travelling to a South Pacific island, Lara {{encounters}} a wounded soldier who gives her hints {{about the existence}} of a powerful deity. While pursuing the deity, Lara learns that one of Darwin's sailors brought one of the artefacts to the island. She then infiltrates a temple and defeats the deity, who has immense power granted by the second <b>artefact,</b> the Ora Dagger. In London, Lara searches for the third <b>artefact,</b> the Eye of Isis, now in the possession of Sophia Leigh, the head of a cosmetics corporation. Lara learns that the corporation has performed sick experiments on humans in order to achieve immortality and eternal youth for Sophia's personal gain. Lara confronts Sophia in her office and ultimately obtains the <b>artefact.</b> In Nevada, Lara makes her way through a desert canyon and tries to enter Area 51, where the fourth <b>artefact,</b> Element 115, is located in an alien spacecraft guarded by the US government. However, she is taken as a prisoner after her attempted break-in ends disastrously. Freeing herself, she escapes the security compound and stows away in a truck to Area 51, where she eventually obtains the <b>artefact.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age <b>artefact</b> depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An <b>artefact</b> is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E
30|$|Radiologists must {{be aware}} of these special Compressed SENSE-related <b>artefacts</b> in order to make correct MRI-based {{radiological}} diagnoses. According to our personal experience the <b>artefacts,</b> especially the starry-sky <b>artefacts</b> and the wax-layer <b>artefacts,</b> were only slightly disturbing the image quality and did not affect the image assessment. Streaky <b>artefacts</b> were even less disturbing because of their regular appearance as already described in the literature [1, 7, 9]. Most probably, the unique <b>artefacts</b> encountered using Compressed SENSE were caused by a combination of <b>artefacts</b> already known from the SENSE technique (ghosting <b>artefacts)</b> {{as well as from the}} CS technique.|$|R
30|$|These <b>artefacts</b> {{were only}} present in {{sequences}} acquired with Compressed SENSE {{and could be}} seen on images with or without additional motion <b>artefacts.</b> <b>Artefacts</b> were enhanced by patient motion. <b>Artefacts</b> looked identical on sequences obtained on 1.5 -T and 3 -T MR scanners.|$|R
30|$|To our knowledge, {{these special}} <b>artefacts</b> are a finding not yet {{reported}} in Compressed SENSE technique. <b>Artefacts</b> appeared in sequences obtained with and without contrast agent administered and thus were independent of a possible contrast agent administration. Common <b>artefacts</b> encountered with echo planar imaging (EPI) techniques, such as chemical shift <b>artefacts</b> in the phase encoding direction, susceptibility <b>artefacts,</b> EPI ghosting <b>artefacts,</b> EPI distortions and saturation arfefacts [8], are not present in sequences obtained with Compressed SENSE as Compressed SENSE is not compatible with the EPI technique.|$|R
5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base {{defined by a}} physical example or <b>artefact.</b> Moreover, after the 1996–1998 recalibration a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E

5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. <b>Artefact</b> remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from <b>artefact</b> manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E
40|$|Context: Agile {{software}} development (ASD) uses ‘agile’ <b>artefacts</b> such as user stories and product backlogs {{as well as}} ‘non-agile’ <b>artefacts,</b> for instance designs and test plans. Rationales for incorporating especially non-agile <b>artefacts</b> by an agile team mainly remain unknown territory. Goal: We start off to explore influences on <b>artefacts</b> usage, and state our research question as: To what extent does maturity relate to the usage of <b>artefacts</b> in ASD in software product organizations? Method: In our multiple case study 14 software product organizations were visited where software product management maturity was rated and their <b>artefacts</b> usage listed. Results: We found maturity to be negatively correlated with the non-agile/all <b>artefacts</b> ratio. In other words, the more mature software product management is, the fewer non-agile <b>artefacts</b> are used in ASD. Conclusions: This suggests that an organizational factor influences an agile team in its <b>artefacts</b> usage, contradictory {{to the concept of}} self-organizing agile teams...|$|R
30|$|Several <b>artefacts</b> {{share this}} mutual rationale. Burndown chart, Definition of done, Definition of ready, Epic, Product backlog, Retrospective (report), Source code (Increment), Sprint backlog, Status board, Task, and User story: They all {{come with the}} {{adoption}} of ASD. This is also the reason for referring to them as agile <b>artefacts,</b> as opposed to non-agile <b>artefacts</b> which are then in fact all other <b>artefacts</b> from Table 3, pre-development <b>artefacts</b> excluded.|$|R

5|$|The {{definition}} of the kilogram is undergoing a fundamental change—the current definition defines the kilogram as being {{the mass of the}} international prototype kilogram which is an <b>artefact,</b> not a constant of nature while the new definition relates it to the equivalent energy of a photon via the Planck constant.|$|E

30|$|Two other {{mechanisms}} {{are known to}} cause unique Compressed SENSE-related <b>artefacts</b> as well. First, if the reconstruction voxel is smaller than the acquisition voxel, streaky linear <b>artefacts</b> type A occur as demonstrated in Fig. 3 g-i. Second, if the knee is scanned without a directly adjacent rest slab and without oversampling, then streaky-linear <b>artefacts</b> type C are produced as shown in Fig. 5. These <b>artefacts</b> can be avoided if the reconstruction voxel has at least {{the same size as}} the acquisition voxel for type-A streaky-linear <b>artefacts</b> and if a directly adjacent rest slab is added together with a 10 % oversampling rate in type C streaky-linear <b>artefacts.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an <b>artefact</b> known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the <b>artefact</b> from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} the research station, Joanna agrees {{to work with}} the Carrington Institute to stop dataDyne. Daniel Carrington contacts her and explains that Zeigler had been working on an algorithm capable of decoding extraterrestrial glyphs at a dig site in South America. Traveling to Peru, Joanna learns that the glyphs are leading dataDyne to search for an ancient <b>artefact</b> which acts as a power-source for the Graal, a device which endows individuals with superhuman powers. Joanna plants a tracking device onto the <b>artefact</b> before sneaking aboard a dataDyne dropship. The dropship takes her to Africa, where Zhang Li has located the Graal buried under the African sands. The Carrington Institute plans an offensive on dataDyne forces with the battle taking place on a large bridge. Joanna rescues several Carrington Institute agents before avenging her father's death by killing Mei Hem. Joanna infiltrates an arena and faces off against Zhang Li, who dispatches Sekhar after using the Graal. Despite the advantage, Joanna defeats Zhang Li in a final battle. Daniel Carrington commends her efforts, informing her that she did “Perfect”.|$|E

After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sentient <b>artefacts</b> are our {{everyday}} life objects augmented with various sensors for value added services. We {{have been exploiting}} these <b>artefacts</b> for perceiving user context and proving proactive context aware services while keeping their natural appearances and roles intact. From our observations of these <b>artefacts</b> we have identified two passive advantages besides their explicit value added functionalities. The first is a profile-based participation of the <b>artefacts</b> in the application scenarios thus making the <b>artefacts</b> generalized, independent of the applications and reusable in various scenarios. The second one {{is the role of}} the static <b>artefacts</b> in identifying the location of the mobile <b>artefacts</b> thus eliminating the requirement of any dedicated location infrastructure for proactive services. In this paper we have discussed these two issues with illustrations of our findings. ...|$|R

30|$|Agile {{software}} development (ASD) promotes working software over comprehensive documentation. Still, {{recent research has}} shown agile teams to use {{quite a number of}} <b>artefacts.</b> Whereas some <b>artefacts</b> may be adopted because they are inherently included in an ASD method, an agile team decides itself on the usage of additional <b>artefacts.</b> However, explicit rationales for using them remain unclear. We start off to explore those rationales, and state our primary research question as: What are rationales for agile teams to use <b>artefacts?</b> Our research method was a multiple case study. In 19 agile teams we identified 55 <b>artefacts</b> and concluded that they in general confirm existing research results. We introduce five rationales underlying the usage of <b>artefacts</b> in ASD: (1) Adoption of ASD leads to agile <b>artefacts,</b> (2) team-internal communication leads to functional and technical design <b>artefacts,</b> (3) quality assurance leads to test-related <b>artefacts,</b> (4) agile teams impose governance on their own activities, and (5) external influences impose user-related material. With our contribution we substantiate the theoretical basis of the Agile Manifesto in general and contribute to the current research with regard to the usage of <b>artefacts</b> in ASD in particular. Agile teams themselves may from this research extract guidelines to use more or less comprehensive documentation.|$|R
5|$|Most {{researchers}} have {{disagreed with the}} identification of the structures as collagen or other structural fibres. Notably, the team of scientists that reported the presence of pigmentation cells in the structures argued that their presence proved the structures were feathers, not collagen, because collagen does not contain pigment. Gregory S. Paul reidentified what the collagen hypothesis's proponents consider a body outline outside of the fibres as an <b>artefact</b> of preparation: breakage and brushed-on sealant have been misidentified as the outline of the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} {{changes from}} extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, {{based on the}} extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial <b>artefact,</b> or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact.|$|E

This article aims to discuss the most prominent <b>artefacts</b> identified in the scientific literature and review the existing knowledge on these <b>artefacts.</b> We also briefly review the basic three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction concept applied by today’s CBCT scanners, as all <b>artefacts</b> are more or less directly related to it...|$|R
5|$|A flint dagger was {{discovered}} on the site. This type of <b>artefact</b> {{is rare in}} Greater Manchester; the nearest comparable site is in Saddleworth. Its presence has been taken as an indication that during the Bronze Age the site was used for funerary practices.

Also dating from the Bronze Age and found on the site was a rare high-status amber necklace. Amber does not occur naturally in Britain the nearest source is the Baltic.

5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft.
