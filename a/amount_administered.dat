50|$|Cyanide is {{naturally}} present in human tissues in very small quantities. It is metabolized by rhodanese, a live enzyme {{at a rate}} of approximately 17 µg/kg*min. Rhodanese catalyzes the irreversible reaction forming thiocyanate from cyanide and sulfane which is non-toxic and can be excreted through the urine. Under normal conditions, availability of sulfane is the limiting factor which acts as a substrate for rhodanese. Sulfur can be administered therapeutically as sodium thiosulfate to accelerate the reaction. A lethal dose of cyanide is time-dependent because of the body’s ability to detoxify and excrete small amounts of cyanide through rhodanese-sulfate catalysis. If an amount of cyanide is absorbed slowly, rhodanese-sulfate may be able to biologically render it non-toxic through catalysis to thiosulfate whereas the same <b>amount</b> <b>administered</b> over {{a short period of time}} may be lethal.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we propose to model {{chemotherapy}} {{taking into account}} the mutual interaction between tumour growth and the development of tumour vasculature. By adopting a simple model for this interaction, and assuming that the efficacy of a drug can be modulated by the vessel density, we study the constant continuous therapy, the periodic bolus-based therapy, and combined therapy in which a chemoterapic drug is associated with an anti-angiogenic agent. The model allows to represent the vessel-disrupting activity of some standard chemotherapic drugs, and shows, in the case of constant continuous drug administration, the possibility of multiple stable equilibria. The multistability suggests an explanation for some sudden losses of control observed during therapy, and for the beneficial effect of vascular "pruning" exherted by anti-angiogenic agents in combined therapy. Moreover, in case of periodic therapies in which the drug <b>amount</b> <b>administered</b> per unit time is constant ("metronomic" delivery), the model predicts a response, as function of the bolus frequency, significantly influenced by the extent of the anti-angiogenic activity of the chemotherapic drug and by the dependence of the drug efficacy on the vessel density...|$|E

30|$|The {{methodology}} that we {{have developed}} and previously reported for quantitative SPECT [2, 7 – 9] has been adapted for imaging the 177 Lu distribution in vivo, with appropriate modifications for the radionuclide. This uses the CT scan with conversion from Hounsfield units to attenuation coefficients for attenuation correction and for transmission-dependent scatter correction [10]. An iterative reconstruction algorithm (ordered subset estimation maximisation (OSEM)) [11] {{was used for the}} SPECT image reconstruction. This methodology, while originally developed for diagnostic studies, is well-suited to imaging therapeutic levels of 177 Lu in vivo as, in spite of the relatively low gamma photon abundance for the 208 -keV photon from 177 Lu, the <b>amount</b> <b>administered</b> (~GBq) readily lend these studies to producing images of high quality with a satisfactory event rate for detection.

40|$|Previously {{administered}} {{diagnostic and}} therapeutic radiopharma-ceuticals {{may interfere with}} performance of the Schilling test for prolonged periods of time. Additionally, presence of confounding radionuclides in the urine may not be suspected if baseline urine measurements have not been performed before the examination. Methods: We assumed that a spurious contribution of counts corresponding to 1 % of the administered Schilling dose would begin to contribute clinically significant interference. Based on the typical amounts of radiopharmaceuticals administered, spectra of commonly used radionuclides and best available pharmacokinetic models of biodistribution and excretion, we estimated the interval required for 24 -hr urinary excretion of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals to drop below this threshold of significant interference. Results: For previously administered ""Tc-based radiopharmaceuticals and 123 l-Nal, the interval required for urinary levels of activity to fall below thresholds of allowable interference arebetween 2 - 5 days. For 67 Ga-citrate, several 111 ln compounds, 131 I-MIBG and 201 TI-thallous chloride, periods of 12 - 44 days are estimated.
