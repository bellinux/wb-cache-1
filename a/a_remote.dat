40|$|Concerning {{measurements}} with {{dynamic pressure}} sensors, {{one of the}} most interesting aspects is the influence of <b>a</b> <b>remoting</b> system interposed between the sensor and the measurement point. This mounting system, once correctly characterized, allows one to use the same sensor for different measurement points, reducing the total number of sensors used. In addition, in all the applications involving high temperatures (e. g. combustion chamber), <b>a</b> <b>remoting</b> system allows the use of cheaper dynamic pressure sensors with lower operating temperature capability. <b>A</b> <b>remoting</b> system for dynamic pressure sensors made up by <b>a</b> <b>remoting</b> duct, between the sensor and the measurement point, followed by a damping duct has been characterized for different tube lengths. Tests were carried out with two kinds of sources: a diaphragm-less shock tube for the first set of tests and an acoustic speaker for the second. Results are here reported and commented...|$|R
