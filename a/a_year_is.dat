5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{argue that}} actual energy savings are inconclusive, that DST {{increases}} health risks such as heart attack, that DST can disrupt morning activities, {{and that the}} act of changing clocks twice <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> economically and socially disruptive and cancels out any benefit. Farmers have tended to oppose DST.|$|E
5|$|Regardless {{of a horse}} or pony's actual birth date, {{for most}} {{competition}} purposes <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> added to its age each January1 of {{each year in the}} Northern Hemisphere and each August1 in the Southern Hemisphere. The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.|$|E

50|$|There {{are times}} when <b>a</b> common <b>year</b> <b>is</b> 353 days, or <b>a</b> leap <b>year</b> <b>is</b> 383 days; these are called the Defective <b>Years.</b> When <b>a</b> common <b>year</b> <b>is</b> 355 days, or <b>a</b> leap <b>year</b> <b>is</b> 385 days, these are called the Excessive Years. In Defective years, the {{regularly}} 30-day Kislev is made 29 days; in Excessive Years, the regularly 29-day Heshvan is made 30 days.|$|R

5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds a neat {{cup-shaped}} nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple; they are typically 2.7x2.0 centimetres (0.79x1.06in) in size and weigh 6.0grammes (0.21oz), of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10years 8months.|$|E
5|$|The town's harbour, beaches, nature {{reserves}} and historically important buildings have made Christchurch a popular tourist destination attracting some 1.5 million visitors a year. Bournemouth Airport, an international airport which handles approximately 800,000 passengers <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>is</b> {{located within the}} borough boundary at Hurn. The airport's industrial park contains a number of aerospace and engineering businesses {{and is one of}} the largest employment sites in Dorset. Christchurch is a popular destination for retirees and has one of the oldest populations in the country with 30 per cent of residents aged over 65.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, it was {{reported}} that 300,000 women <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>were</b> hospitalized for complications of unsafe abortion.

25|$|Given {{the length}} of the year, {{the length of}} each month is fixed as {{described}} above, so the real problem in determining the calendar for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> determining the number of days in the year. In the modern calendar, this is determined in the following manner.|$|E

25|$|Whether <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> deficient, regular, or {{complete}} {{is determined by}} the time between two adjacent Rosh Hashanah observances and the leap year.

25|$|J. R. R. Tolkien {{invented a}} number of {{calendars}} for his fantasy-world of Middle-earth. Middle-earth is set on the Earth in a fictional prehistoric era, so <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> the same length as our year. Appendix D of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (published 1955) gives details of his invented calendars.|$|E
25|$|Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand also {{provides}} international aid and development funding to help stimulate sustainable {{economic development in}} underdeveloped economies. The New Zealand Aid Programme, allocated about $550m <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>is</b> focused primarily on promoting development in the Pacific.
