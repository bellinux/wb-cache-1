40|$|To {{investigate}} cooling {{strategies of}} the avionics ventilation system full-scale experiments have been performed in the Fraunhofer IBPs flight test facility. A test infrastructure of the <b>avionic</b> <b>compartment</b> equivalent to the racks, blowing and extraction system of a long-range aircraft architecture has been integrated into a wide-body aircraft segment within the low pressure vessel of the flight test facility. With this setup experiments on cooling performance of the system at different ground and flight conditions have been performed. Failure cases were simulated, such as total loss of blowing, loss of extraction or total loss of avionics ventilation system...|$|R
5000|$|The CFTs {{are mounted}} above the wing, {{on both sides}} of the {{fuselage}} and are easily removable. They provide 440 US gallons or approximately 3000 lb of additional fuel, allowing increased range or time on station and free up hardpoints for weapons instead of underwing fuel tanks. All two-seat [...] "Plus" [...] aircraft have the enlarged <b>avionics</b> dorsal spine <b>compartment</b> which is located behind the cockpit and extends to the tail. It adds 30 cu ft (850 L) to the airframe for more avionics with only small increases in weight and drag.|$|R

50|$|The first prototype, {{acting as}} an {{aerodynamic}} testbed only, flew on 21 October 1960. The first fully equipped aircraft followed it on 19 April 1961, and entered service with the US Navy as the E-2A in January 1964. By 1965 the major development problems delaying the E-2A Hawkeye {{got so bad}} that the aircraft was actually cancelled after 59 aircraft had already been built. Particular difficulties were being experienced due to inadequate cooling in the closely packed <b>avionics</b> <b>compartment.</b> Early computer and complex avionics systems generated considerable heat; without proper ventilation this would lead to system failures. These failures continued long after the aircraft entered service {{and at one point}} reliability was so bad the entire fleet of aircraft was grounded. The airframe was also prone to corrosion, a serious problem in a carrier based aircraft.|$|E
40|$|In all {{commercial}} and non-commercial airplanes, {{there is no}} fire detection or fire extinguishing system in the avionics bay. Racks, are cooled by ambient or conditioned air. Each rack will include several circuit boards, which in case of overheat, can burn with the risk of igniting the surrounding components and structures, thus jeopardizing flight safety. It becomes therefore important to provide fire detection and fire extinguishing capabilities in the aircraft <b>avionics</b> <b>compartment.</b> The approach proposed in this paper, extracts nitrogen from ambient air by mean of the Air Separator Module, then nitrogen is routed to the <b>avionics</b> <b>compartment</b> racks, and enters inside the component and extinguishes the fire. The temperature of the nitrogen is adjusted to be around 25 Â°C to prevent thermal shock effects on the circuit boards before being injected in the <b>avionics</b> <b>compartment.</b> A series of experiments conducted, aimed at gathering information by using dry nitrogen under different pressure values to extinguish different size of fire. The analysis of the experiment research showed that increasing nitrogen pressure, resulted in quicker extinguishing time. This is because nitrogen under higher pressure, quickly decrease the oxygen concentration {{in the air for}} the fire already in the process of combustion. Nitrogen does not conduct electricity thus cause no short circuits during and after the extinguishing process, therefore, they are ideal for use in the electronic systems...|$|E
