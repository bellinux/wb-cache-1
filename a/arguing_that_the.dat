5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|In his 2005 book Active Liberty, Breyer {{made his}} first attempt to {{systematically}} lay out his views on legal theory, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> judiciary should seek to resolve issues {{in a manner that}} encourages popular participation in governmental decisions.|$|E

5000|$|Some critics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel champions {{middle classes}} over the lower orders; others, however, find this claim [...] "too simplistic" [...] and <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel [...] "highlights the {{shortfalls}} inherent to bourgeois masculinity." [...] Sally Mitchell <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel simultaneously upholds and undermines middle-class values.|$|R
50|$|Deterrence theory <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of}} {{punishment}} {{should be the}} minimum required to achieve the desired amount of deterrence. Most versions of retributive justice <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amount of punishment should be proportional {{to the amount of}} harm caused. Reform theory <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amount of punishment should be enough to cause reform in the offender.|$|R
50|$|PNU <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{contract}} {{was at an}} end. <b>The</b> Ansleys <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contract only ended due to PNU not pursing the consent in a proper manner.|$|R
5|$|Western historians such as A.J. Wensinck and Denis Gril, {{reject the}} historicity of the miracle <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an itself denies miracles, in their {{traditional}} sense, {{in connection with}} Muhammad.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> book <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> primary {{weakness}} of the United States in military matters is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US views revolution in military thought solely in terms of technology. <b>The</b> book further <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> to <b>the</b> US, military doctrine evolves because new technology allows new capabilities. As such, <b>the</b> book <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States does not consider the wider picture of military strategy, which includes legal and economic factors. The book proceeds to <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States is vulnerable to attacks along these lines.|$|R
50|$|Nixon <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statute {{violated}} the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. <b>The</b> defendants <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court lacked {{jurisdiction over the}} issue, {{as it was a}} political question.|$|R

5|$|In 1789 President George Washington {{appointed}} Gore {{the first}} United States Attorney for Massachusetts {{as a reward}} for his support. Gore controversially refused to resign from the state legislature, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state constitution's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts. He eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because of pressure from his fellow legislators.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, M. C. Rajah, a Justice Party leader {{from the}} Dalit {{community}} protested {{against the government}} order <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> act did not guarantee adequate representation of Dalits who he felt deserved 30% reservation in {{the administration and the}} services. When the Justice Party failed to respond, he resigned from the primary membership of the party.|$|E
25|$|In their brief, the Bar of Human Rights Committee and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{shackling}} of Deck was a {{human rights}} violation. It was also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles violated due process and common law and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles diminished courtroom dignity. Additionally, it was <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles contributed to self-incrimination, and prevented Deck from confronting witnesses against him.|$|R
2500|$|Rodrigue Tremblay has <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quran {{commands}} <b>that</b> non-Muslims under a Muslim regime, should [...] "feel themselves subdued" [...] in [...] "a political {{state of}} subservience" [...] He also <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quran may assert freedom within religion.

40|$|The {{existence}} of potential collections {{has been the}} object of different philosophical debates. I discuss three of those debates. I <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> collection of all natural numbers need not {{be understood as a}} potentially infinite collection. I <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> collection of all sets need not be understood as an indefinitely extensible collection. Finally, I <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> collection of everything needs to be understood as an unlimited collection...|$|R
5|$|In September, Paul {{stated that}} the United States should avoid {{military}} intervention in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. In an op-ed, Paul disputed the Obama administration's claims {{that the threat of}} military force caused Syria's government to consider turning over its chemical weapons, instead <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> opposition to military action in Syria, and the delay that it caused, led to diplomatic progress.|$|E
5|$|Many {{planters}} {{refused to}} comply with their provisions. The confrontation continued as the planters challenged on several occasions the right of British government to pass laws binding on the colony, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court of Policy has exclusive legislative power within the colony. Plantation owners who controlled the voting of the taxes disrupted administration by refusing to vote the civil list.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{played a}} leading role in {{blocking}} a treaty with Switzerland that would enable the IRS to conduct tax evasion probes, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> treaty would infringe upon Americans' privacy.

5000|$|... ==Overview== His book Hadith: A re-evaluation <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quran is {{complete}} and the hadith {{is a human}} invention. He further <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hadith were a product of human politics. He also states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hadith often contradict themselves, contradict the Quran and often contradict scientific facts. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quran is the sole source of legislation and <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> use of <b>the</b> hadith in an authoritative way is a sinful bid‘ah (innovation). His public lectures on hadith were subsequently cancelled in late 1985, and his book was banned in Malaysia.|$|R

50|$|Both parties <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequels were {{transformative}} at {{the trial}} and first appellate level. Whereas Hugo's estate <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transformative nature diluted the protected essential personality of <b>the</b> work, Plon <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transformative nature was made it less likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work borrowed the essential, protected personality. While this issue was not addressed by the Cour de Cassation, it is an argument which may bear fruit in subsequent droit moral litigation.|$|R
5|$|Responding to the book's publication, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry {{issued a}} {{statement}} in 2012 <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> examples the book offers were historical, that the concerns had been addressed, that the industry {{is among the most}} regulated in the world, and that it discloses all data in accordance with international standards.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Epirote {{representatives in}} the {{following}} Panepirotic Assembly of Delvino {{had to take the}} final decision on whether to accept the Protocol.

5|$|The {{second volume}} {{represents}} the ethical stage.

The difference is that the pursuit of pleasure is tempered with ethical values and responsibilities.|$|E
50|$|Nationwide News <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Act infringed {{the implied}} freedom of {{political}} communications, while <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Act was valid under section 51(xxxv) (conciliation and arbitration power), {{as well as}} section 51(xxxix) (express incidental power).|$|R
50|$|The {{mayor of}} Whitefish, Montana, John Muhlfeld, <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bill would protect the town's water supply indefinitely {{and said the}} city fully {{supported}} the bill. Supporters also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bill {{would be good for}} tourism.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of uniform {{protection}} against SLAPPs has encouraged forum shopping; proponents of federal legislation have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty about one's {{level of protection}} has likely magnified the chilling effect of SLAPPs.|$|R
5|$|With the cap {{on growth}} {{in the town of}} Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve {{increasing}} demands of tourists.

5|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, their {{population}} was feared to have declined {{past the point}} of recovery in Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos, and possibly no males, survived. Conservationists debated whether or not the Vietnamese rhinoceros had any chance of survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> population could recover.|$|E
40|$|Conflict is so {{vital and}} complex {{an issue that}} it invites disagreement. Nehemia Friedland <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{cooperative}} and competitive approach focuses {{too much on the}} cognitive at the expense of motivation, whereas Jorn Rognes <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> framework needed to be supplemented by cognitive approaches.
