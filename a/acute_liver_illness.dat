Aim: To examine whether paracetamol-induced <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure increases long-term mortality. Methods: We followed all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> injury hospitalized in a Danish national referral center during 1984 - 2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from one year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury {{led to an}} <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure and those in whom it did not. Results: We included 641 patients. On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol-induced liver injury had caused an <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 2. 85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure died from liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. These observations speak against long-term effects of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure. Conclusions: Paracetamol-induced <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure did not affect long-term mortality. Clinical follow-up may be justified by {{the cause of the}} liver failure, but not by the liver failure itself...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure has {{not been}} fully elucidated. The present study investigated {{the effects of the}} serum from patients with hepatitis E virus (HEV) -related <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure on human liver cell survival and apoptosis, and evaluated the protective effects of anti-lipopolysaccharide(LPS) antibody recognizing core poly-saccharide against <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure serum-induced apoptosis. Serum was collected from patients with HEV-related <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure. The levels of endotoxin (LPS) in the serum were measured using a quantitative tachypleus amebocyte lysate endotoxin detection kit with a chromogenic endpoint. Serum with a mean concentration of LPS was incubated with L 02 human liver cells and the rate of apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The apoptotic rate was also evaluated in liver cells incubated with antibody and the HEV-related <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure serum. The results indicated that the concentration of LPS in the serum of patients with HEV-related <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure was 0. 26 ± 0. 02 EU/ml, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (P 0. 05). These results indicate that the serum of patients with HEV-related <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure induces the apoptosis of human liver cells. LPS may be directly involved in the apoptosis of human liver cells. Moreover, the presence of the antibody did not significantly reduce the level of apoptosis of liver cells exposed to HEV-related <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure serum...|$|R

40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>liver</b> {{failure is}} {{a major cause of}} death in the world, and {{effective}} treatments are greatly needed. Liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) {{play a major role in}} the pathology of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure, and drug delivery vehicles that can target therapeutics to Kupffer cells have great therapeutic potential for treating <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure. Microparticles, formulated from biodegradable polymers, are advantageous for treating <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure because they can passively target therapeutics to Kupffer cells. However, existing biomaterials are not suitable for the treatment of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure because of their slow hydrolysis and acidic degradation products. In this dissertation, I present the development of a new class of biodegradable materials, termed aliphatic polyketals, which have considerable potential as drug delivery vehicles for the treatment of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure because of their neutral degradation products and tunable hydrolysis kinetics. The anti-inflammatory enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD), was delivered using polyketal microparticles to the <b>liver</b> for treating <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> Failure. Our results demonstrated that polyketal microparticles significantly improved the efficacy of SOD in treating LPS-induced <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> damage in vivo, as evidenced by decreased levels of serum alanine transaminase, which corresponds to the extent of damage in the liver, and serum level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which corresponds to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The completion of this thesis research demonstrates the ability of polyketal-based drug delivery systems for treating acute inflammatory diseases and creates a potential therapy for enhancing the treatment of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure.

40|$|Massive hepatic {{necrosis}} {{is a key}} event underlying <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure, a serious clinical syndrome with high mortality.

40|$|A {{major concern}} in therapy of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure is {{protection}} of hepatocytes to prevent apoptosis and maintain liver function. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{is a powerful}} tool to silence gene expression in mammalian cells. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of siRNA in vivo we used different mouse models of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure. We directed 21 -nt siRNAs against caspase 8, which is a key enzyme in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Systemic application of caspase 8 siRNA results in inhibition of caspase 8 gene expression in the liver, thereby preventing Fas (CD 95) -mediated apoptosis. Protection of hepatocytes by caspase 8 siRNA significantly attenuated <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> damage induced by agonistic Fas (CD 95) antibody (Jo 2) or by adenovirus expressing Fas ligand (AdFasL). However, in a clinical situation the siRNAs most likely would be applied after the onset of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure. Therefore we injected caspase 8 siRNA at a time point during AdFasL- and adenovirus wild type (Adwt) -mediated liver failure with already elevated liver transaminases. Improvement of survival due to RNA interference was significant even when caspase 8 siRNA was applied during ongoing <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure. In addition, it {{is of particular interest}} that caspase 8 siRNA treatment was successful not only in <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure mediated by specific Fas agonistic agents (Jo 2 and AdFasL) but also in <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure mediated by Adwt, which is an animal model reflecting multiple molecular mechanisms involved in human acute viral hepatitis.

30|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>liver</b> {{failure is}} a fatal {{syndrome}} attributed to massive hepatocyte apoptosis that is resistant to conventional medical therapies. Consequently, liver transplantation {{is required in}} many cases. An experimental liver failure model induced by galactosamine (Gal) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mimics clinical <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure. In this model, LPS stimulates macrophages to release TNFα, which induces apoptosis in Gal-sensitized hepatocytes, causing <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure.

Previously, we reported that H 2 S attenuates liver dysfunction arising from LPS-induced systemic inflammation [1]. It has also been reported that H 2 S reduces hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibition of apoptosis in the liver [2].

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure or serious liver injury in diabetic patients {{is needed to}} evaluate the safety of hypoglycemic drug therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5 health maintenance organizations. Study patients were 171, 264 health plan members 19 years or older when they received oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin between April 1, 1997, and June 30, 1999. We searched for hospital discharge diagnoses and procedures potentially indicative of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> injury and reviewed the full-text medical records. <b>Acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure was defined as <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> disease and (1) hepatic encephalopathy, (2) prothrombin time prolongation greater than 3 seconds or international normalized ratio greater than 1. 5, and (3) a total bilirubin level greater than 3. 0 mg/dL (3 ̆e 51 micro mol/L). <b>Acute</b> <b>liver</b> injury was diagnosed in individuals who did not meet 1 {{or more of the}} criteria for <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure but had alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase levels greater than 500 U/L. RESULTS: We identified 35 cases of <b>acute</b> <b>liver</b> failure or injury not clearly attributable to a known cause other than use of hypoglycemic agents. The age- and sex-standardized incidence per 1000 person-years was 0. 15 for insulin users, 0. 08 for sulfonylurea users, 0. 12 for metformin users, and 0. 10 for troglitazone users.
