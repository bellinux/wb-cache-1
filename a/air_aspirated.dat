However, common bedside methods of {{differentiating}} tracheal from gastric feeding tube placement are neither accurate nor practical. Therefore, we conducted an animal study to verify feeding tube placement by syringe aspiration test. Methods: A total of 26 pigs were anesthetized and intubated with tracheal tubes in the trachea and the esophagus. The animals {{were divided into two}} groups. The animals in the mechanical ventilation group were paralysed and received mechanical ventilation. The animals in the spontaneous breathing group maintained spontaneous breathing. The feeding tubes were then inserted through the tracheal tubes, into the trachea and esophagus, so that the anterior openings of the feeding tubes were located in the trachea and esophagus. A feeding syringe was then attached and 30  ml of <b>air</b> was <b>aspirated</b> into the syringe. The ability to <b>aspirate</b> <b>air</b> without resistance was defined as a positive syringe aspiration test.

JHE RESULTS of blood glucose determinations and, {{to a lesser}} extent, of blood urea nitrogen determinations by an automatic analysis de-vice * have been observed to be significantly {{lower than those of}} the commonly used routine methods (1, 2). A cause of these discrepan-cies was the gradually increasing sedimentation of cells in blood samples during an hour of processing, with resultant pick-up of blood suspensions progressively richer in cells and with lower glucose and urea nitrogen concentrations. This problem was solved by the use of a bubble mixing device that produces uniform blood suspensions. Methods The glucose method in use is a ferricyanide reduction method* adapted to automation (3, 7).

The sample tubing connects with a reagent tubing so that the samples are mixed with saline-cyanide diluting fluid aspirated from a reagent bottle.

40|$|Pesticides can {{be present}} in the {{atmosphere}} either as vapours and/or in association with suspended particles. High-volume air sampling, in which air is aspirated first through a glass fibre filter to capture pesticides associated with atmospheric particulates and then polyurethane foam (PUF), often in combination with an adsorbent resin such as XAD- 2, to capture pesticides present as vapours, is generally employed during atmospheric monitoring for pesticides. However, the particulate fraction may be underestimated because some pesticides may be stripped or desorbed from captured particulates due to the pressure drop created by the high flow of air through the filter. This possibility was investigated with ten herbicide active ingredients commonly used on the Canadian prairies (dimethylamine salts of 2, 4 -D, MCPA and dicamba, 2, 4 -D 2 -ethylhexyl ester, bromoxynil octanoate, diclofop methyl ester, fenoxaprop ethyl ester, trifluralin, triallate and ethalfluralin) and seven hydrolysis products (2, 4 -D, MCPA, dicamba, bromoxynil, diclofop, clopyralid and mecoprop).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} how British Thoracic Society (BTS) {{guidelines for the}} management of spontaneous pneumothorax have been implemented over a four year period in a large district general hospital with a specialised respiratory unit. To assess the validity of the guidelines in the management of spontaneous pneumothorax. METHODS: A retrospective case notes study over a four year period for all patients with spontaneous pneumothoraces attending the accident and emergency (A&E) department of a large district general hospital. RESULTS: 115 episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax were identified. Overall 20. 8 % of episodes were treated correctly by BTS guidelines. Decisions made by A&E staff {{were significantly more likely to}} be correct than decisions made by on call medical teams (39. 4 % v 13. 4 %, p = 0. 002). There was a non-significant trend towards better compliance with BTS guidelines over the four year period. The management decision was made by A&E staff only in 28. 7 % of episodes. Patients without chronic lung disease could be safely observed as outpatients. Forty three pneumothoraces were aspirated: 23 (58 %) successfully; eight (18. 6 %) with little or no improvement; and 12 (27. 9 %) initially successfully but developing increased size of pneumothorax within a period of 72 hours. Three patients had repeat aspirations, two successfully.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} simple, practical, quantitative, and {{reliable}} field test method for measuring air leakage into enclosed cab filtration systems {{with the goal}} of making enclosed cabs a healthy and safe work environment. Background: Enclosed cabs are an engineering control that can provide a safe, comfortable, and healthy work environment for equipment operators. Most modern day enclosed cabs have heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems for maintaining a comfortable temperature and a breathable quantity of air for its occupants. Various levels of filtration can be incorporated into the HVAC system to improve the ventilation quality of the air inside the cab by removing outside airborne pollutants such as dusts, aerosols, and vapors. However, outside air leakage around the intake filter into the HVAC system can notably diminish the effectiveness of the cab's filtration system. A poorly sealed cab HVAC/filtration system can be difficult to recognize because of its concealed system components and the invisible nature of some airborne pollutants that can penetrate the cab. Researchers have previously measured airborne particulates in either ambient air or generated particulates inside a chamber surrounding the vehicle to quantify the particulate penetration into the enclosed cab. Several cab penetration studies have indicated that inconsistent and low particulate concentrations can yield unreliable cab performance results among replicated cab tests. Internal cab particulate generation such as dirty floors, interior surfaces, and abraded blower motor brushes can also interfere with measuring external particle penetration into the cab. Approach: A desirable air leakage test method would use a relatively constant airborne tracer gas level around a vehicle's cab which would pose minimal health and safety risks to the user. Atmospheric gases have these desirable attributes and were considered for the air leakage tracer gas. The technique involves replacing the HVAC intake particulate filter with a tracer gas filter, measuring tracer gas concentrations inside and outside the cab filtration system, and then applying a mathematical formula to calculate leakage. NIOSH partnered with the Clean Air Filter (CAF) Company of Defiance, Iowa under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop this air leakage test method for evaluating the environmental integrity of enclosed cabs. This research focused on developing a timely stationary vehicle cab leak test inside an unoccupied cab. Cab leakage testing research was ultimately conducted using the carbon dioxide (CO 2) in ambient air as the tracer gas given that CO 2 instrumentation and gas-absorbent media were readily available for filtration and methodology development. Figure 1 shows the typical CO 2 filter configurations constructed by CAF for leak testing enclosed cab filtration systems. Initial laboratory testing indicated that the CO 2 absorbent media bed thickness (T) needed to be greater than 2 inches (5. 1 cm) inside the filter for efficient CO 2 removal. Three different types of CO 2 instruments were also examined in the laboratory for their suitability for the proposed leak test. It was apparent that all the instrument types examined can drift and would need daily CO 2 gas calibrations to ensure their accuracy for a multiple-instrument cab test method. Because maintaining instrument accuracy during field testing can be challenging, a single-instrument cab testing methodology was developed to eliminate instrument bias errors and field calibration. This method measures relative CO 2 concentration differences inside and outside the cab filtration system using the same instrument at or near steady-state cab conditions. The equation shown below was developed to quantify air leakage around the CO 2 intake test filter by measuring CO 2 concentrations inside the cab, immediately after the intake filter, and outside the cab by using the same instrument. Air leakage is defined as the percentage of cab intake air that bypasses the filter media and is unfiltered. Laboratory tests were conducted with controlled air leakages of 0 %, 5. 5 %, and 11. 5 % into an unoccupied enclosed cab test stand. The leakage opening was downstream of two stacked block-style intake filters, which were 98 % effective for removing CO 2. A mass airflow meter was used to measure the quantity of air leakage into the filtration system, and a hot wire anemometer was used to measure the intake airflow into the cab. The CO 2 instruments were located outside the unoccupied cab enclosure and sequentially sampled the air inside the cab, immediately after the intake filter, and outside the cab through sampling hoses routed to these locations. A Sable CA- 10 a CO 2 instrument (Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV) used during the laboratory testing was an active sampling instrument with an internal air pump and was suitable for this type of cab sampling procedure. Several Vaisala GM 70 CO 2 instruments (Helsinki, Finland) used during the laboratory testing were passive handheld sampling instruments and had to be <b>air</b> <b>aspirated</b> by separate air sampling pumps to move the air from the various cab locations to the instrument's sensing chamber via calibration hood. The best cab leak test procedure devised in the laboratory was the measurement of the inside cab concentrations for 3 minutes after they stabilize from the filtration system startup. Then, after 2 minutes of stabilization time between the sampling location changes, the CO 2 concentrations were measured for 3 minutes at the other two sampling locations. This sampling procedure was sequentially repeated three times at all the sampling locations for each leakage condition. This procedure was replicated twice on two different days in the laboratory. Finally, this CO 2 leak test method was performed on a John Deere 7820 series tractor cab to demonstrate its application on an end-use vehicle cab. A round-style cartridge filter, as shown in Figure 1, was used for the test. Results: Laboratory test results showed that the CO 2 leak test method similarly quantified the cab leakage as compared to the directly measured airflow leakage into the filtration system. Figure 2 shows the measured CO 2 leakages as compared to the airflow leakage measurements into the cab enclosure. The unity line on the figure illustrates good correlation of the CO 2 leakage test method with the airflow measurements using the Sable and Vaisala instruments. Table 1 shows the data collected on the John Deere tractor cab for both the Sable and the Vaisala 1 instruments. The round-style CO 2 intake test filter provided better than 96 % removal efficiency. This table illustrates the consistent measurement biases between the two instruments at the various sampling locations. However, each instrument measured comparable air leakages because relative CO 2 concentration differences in the cab filtration system were used to calculate leakage. This test method provides cab manufacturers, cab service personnel, and industrial hygienists with a measurement tool to ensure environmental cab integrity and minimize worker exposure to outside airborne substances.

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the effects of two factors: the granular material feed rate and the <b>aspirating</b> <b>air</b> flow-rate. The study was conducted with mm-size ABS and HIPS particles, two granular materials originating from genuine information technology wastes. The tribo-charging processes in PVC and Al pipes were modeled using the response surface method of experimental design. An induction type sensor, connected to an electrometer has been employed for the measurement of the charge imparted to a well-defined section of the duct, which is equal to the charge transferred to the particles passing through that section of the pneumatic transport system. The measured data were processed by a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW and then analyzed using a commercial software (MODDE 5. 0, Umetrics, Sweden). Under the specific conditions of the experiments described in this paper, the charge/mass ratio of the processed particles was found to increase with the <b>aspirating</b> <b>air</b> speed, but was less affected by the granular material feed rate.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a {{comparison}} between the heat transfer enhancements obtained by small pulsating <b>air</b> jets, respectively <b>aspirated</b> or expired, is carried out. These air jets go in or out an aluminum vertical wall, heated by Joule effect, {{in the presence of}} air. Experimental measurements have been conducted with three temperature drops between wall and air (25, 40 and 70 K respectively) with or without pulsating and continuous expired and aspirated jets. The thickness of the boundary layer near the wall is locally reduced due to the presence of the aspirated jets or the boundary layer is destabilized near the holes by means of expired jets: both of these phenomena improve the heat transfer coefficient. The experimental results have demonstrated that the pulsating expired jets are more efficient than the aspirated ones with lower differences wall-to-air temperature; the opposite occurs when that difference is greater then 40 K. Also the time intervals of presence and absence, the air velocity and the jets array maximizing the heat transfer coefficient have been computed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} reports the {{experimental}} investigations carried and upgradation of 395 cc {{air cooled engine}} to dual fuel (CNG/Gasoline) application. The original 395 cc direct injection naturally <b>aspirated,</b> <b>air</b> cooled diesel engine was first converted to run on Gasoline by addition of electronic ignition system and reduction in compression ratio to suit both gasoline and CNG application. CFX software has been employed to calculate and improve the cooling capacity of engine {{with the use of}} CNG. Materials of major engine components were reviewed to suit CNG application. The engine was subsequently tuned with dual multi-mapped ignition timing for bi-fuel stoichiometric operation on engine dynamometer and then fitted on a 3 -Wheeler vehicle. The vehicle was optimized on a chassis dynamometer to meet the proposed Bharat Stage-III norms. The engine has passed current BS-II emission norms with 48 % margin in CO emission and 76 % margin in NMHC (Non-Methane Hydrocarbons) and Extensive trials were conducted on engine and vehicle to optimize with CNG kit and minimum loaded three way cat-con to finally to met proposed BS-III norms...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{performed}} on the aspiration of fluid in the thoracic cavity after pulmonary resection, from the points of tube and mode for suction. Following results were obtained. 1) For aspiration, two tubes (one from the axilla to upper median, another from posterior axilary line in 7 th or 8 th intercostal space to diaphragm posteriorly) were preferably nsed as compared with one tube. 2) In general, the upper tube is mainly to <b>aspirate</b> <b>air</b> and the lower exudate. The effect of fluid aspiration it invariably related to air leak from the lung and relating reexpansion of the lung. 3) It is better in the result that {{the length of the}} tube is about three cantimeters in the upper and nine to twelve in the lower. when a difficulty in expansion is presumed the upper tube is to be six to eight centimeters for getting better aspiration of the fluid. 4) It is better to leave about 200 cc of warm saline solution in the thoracic cavity immediately after operation. 5) Horizontal recumbent position is best after opertion...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} fast ammonia (NH 3) {{measurements}} with chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS) {{based on a}} commercial Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) is presented. It uses electron transfer reaction as ionisation pathway and features a drift tube of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and silica-coated steel. Heating the instrumental inlet and the drift tube to 180 °C enabled an effective time resolution of ~ 1 s and {{made it possible to}} apply the instrument for eddy covariance (EC) measurements. EC fluxes of NH 3 were measured over two agricultural fields in Oensingen, Switzerland, following fertilisations with cattle slurry. <b>Air</b> was <b>aspirated</b> close to a sonic anemometer at a flow of 100 STP L min − 1 and was directed through a 23 m long 1 / 2 " PFA tube heated to 150 °C to an air-conditioned trailer where the gas was sub-sampled from the large bypass stream. This setup minimised damping of fast NH 3 concentration changes between the sampling point and the actual measurement. High-frequency attenuation loss of the NH 3 fluxes of 20 to 40 % was quantified and corrected for using an empirical ogive method. The instrumental NH 3 background signal showed a minor interference with H 2 O which was characterised in the laboratory. The resulting correction of the NH 3 flux after slurry spreading was less than 1 ‰. The flux detection limit of the EC system was about 5 ng m − 2 s − 1 while the accuracy of individual flux measurements was estimated 16 % for the high-flux regime during these experiments. The NH 3 emissions after broad spreading of the slurry showed an initial maximum of 150 μg m − 2 s − 1 with a fast decline in the following hours...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the experimental program undertaken {{to test the}} performance of a novel firefighting foam against the current Class B foam technology. The novel foam involved the use of a chemical reaction between dissolved species to generate inert nitrogen gas in situ. It was theorised that the performance of this in-situ nitrogen foam (ISNF) would likely exceed that of current compressed air (CAF) systems given the inert nature of the incorporated nitrogen gas. The experimental program encompassed the utilisation of the DEF(AUST) 5706 test standard for measuring the suppression and burnback performance of the ISNF {{as well as that of}} compressed <b>air</b> and <b>aspirated</b> foam technologies. All tests were performed using the same two types of surfactant concentrates in order to accurately determine the effect of the generation technology on the foam performance. The three kinds of foam (i. e., aspirated, CAF and ISNF) were also characterised in terms of their bubble size distributions and drainage rates. Bubble size analysis placed the size distribution of the ISNF midway between those of <b>aspirated</b> and compressed <b>air</b> foams, whilst drainage performance was found to be comparable to that of compressed air foam, though slightly faster. The suppression tests identified a substantial improvement in the performance of the ISNF in comparison to traditional aspirated foam systems in some areas. It was found, however, that there was no significant difference between the suppression results obtained using the ISNF and those achieved using compressed air foam. Owing to the chemical requirements of ISNF, the cost of the technology is higher than regular compressed nitrogen foam and as such its deployment would be limited to niche applications in which the use of compressed air/nitrogen systems is undesirable...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} combustion, {{performance}} and emission {{characteristics of a}} partial Premixed Charge Compression Ignition-Direct Injection (PCCI-DI) Engine with premixed fuels ethanol and gasohol (90 % gasoline and 10 % ethanol by volume) along with direct injection of diesel fuel into the combustion chamber. The experiments were conducted in a four stroke, naturally <b>aspirated,</b> <b>air</b> cooled, constant speed diesel engine with 20 % premixed fuels from no load to full load condition. The addition of premixed fuel enhances the air fuel mixture strength and for that the combustion duration is decreased in dual fuel operation. From this experiment it was observed the 70 % and 67 % reduction in smoke emission from premixed gasohol and ethanol fuel when compared to neat diesel operation. In addition to that, the oxides of nitrogen emissions were reduced to 30 % and 24 % for premixed gasohol and ethanol fuel. In particular, premixed gasohol reduces the smoke and oxides of nitrogen emissions more than the ethanol and also, significant increase in brake thermal efficiency was noted in 20 % premixed gasohol and ethanol in dual fuel mode, when compared to neat diesel operation...|$|R
