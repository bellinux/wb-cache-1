40|$|High {{frequency}} <b>acceleration</b> <b>enveloping</b> {{is one of}} many {{tools that}} vibration analysts have at their disposal for the diagnosis of bearing faults in rotating machinery. This technique is believed to facilitate very early detection of potential failures by detecting low amplitude repetitive impacts in frequency ranges above conventional condition monitoring. One traditional enveloping method uses a mathematical operation known as the Hilbert transform along with other signal processing procedures such as band-pass filtering and full-wave rectification. For comparison, another method uses a proprietary algorithm included in National Instruments? LabVIEWTM add-on package: Sound and Measurement Suite. Enveloping?s inherent problem with noise introduction is also addressed herein. A controlled, three-stage fault was induced and diagnosed utilizing both <b>acceleration</b> <b>enveloping</b> methods and traditional fast Fourier transformation (FFT) described herein. A performance assessment of the enveloping process with respect to FFT as well as the performance between individual enveloping methods is presented. In summary, several high frequency <b>acceleration</b> <b>enveloping</b> methods exist that can be effective tools in detection of bearing faults earlier than FFT alone...|$|E

These are extremely important components of the paper machine as {{they are responsible for}} guiding the paper through the press nips. Any deterioration in the felts may result in paper breakage and machine shut-downs with a resulting fall in productivity. The need for tighter control of the manufacturing process is thus the main motivation for this work. The system developed makes use of spectral analysis of the raw vibration signals. This involves the technique of <b>acceleration</b> <b>enveloping</b> for isolating the spectral components that reflect the process defects. Since visual examination of the spectra for detecting subtle changes in the early stages is both difficult and impractical, a peak detection algorithm has been designed. Its purpose is to extract the relevant features from each spectrum. These are then fed into a neural network classifier for discriminating between the fault and the no-fault conditions. The system is demonstrated to be successful for detecting felt deterioration in its early stages when assessed on industrial data. Other benefits include the ease of on-line implementation and its possible extension {{to a wide range of}} mechanical and rotating equipment...|$|E

Fusion 57, 016007 (2017) ] is extended {{to investigate the}} sources of super-hot electrons at intense circularly polarized (CP) laser solid interactions. It is found that {{in the presence of}} large scale pre-formed plasmas, super-high energetic electrons can be generated. For laser of intensity 10 (20) W/cm(2) and pre-plasma of scale-length 10 mu m, the cut-off energy of electrons by CP laser can be as high as 120 MeV compared with 100 MeV by linearly polarized laser. This unexpected acceleration can be also explained by the two-stage <b>acceleration</b> model. The <b>envelop</b> modulation of reflected CP laser is figured out, and a modified scaling law of the maximal-possible energy gain when including the modulation effect is obtained.
