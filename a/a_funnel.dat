5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} <b>a</b> <b>funnel</b> cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, <b>a</b> <b>funnel</b> cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes often {{begin as}} funnel clouds with no {{associated}} strong winds at the surface, {{and not all}} funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so {{it is difficult to}} discern the difference between <b>a</b> <b>funnel</b> cloud and a tornado from a distance.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, a large band of {{thunderstorms}} {{associated with}} the hurricane brought strong winds and spawned three tornadoes. <b>A</b> <b>funnel</b> cloud formed in Albemarle County evolved into an F3 tornado after crossing into Greene County. It destroyed two houses and uprooted several trees, inflicting $250,000 in damage (1985USD, $470,000 2006USD). F0 tornadoes were also generated in Goochland County and Hanover County; the two tornadoes damaged a total of ten houses. Funnel clouds were sighted throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.|$|E

5|$|Seasons {{begins as}} the Triforce {{calls out to}} Link from within Hyrule Castle. Link {{approaches}} it, and is transported to a dark forest where he encounters a traveling group led by a dancer named Din. After Din welcomes Link to Holodrum, the sky becomes covered in black clouds. A voice from the clouds calls Din the Oracle of Seasons and refers to himself as Onox, General of Darkness. <b>A</b> <b>funnel</b> cloud drops from the sky, taking Din into its dark heights. As the tornado dissipates, the seasons of Holodrum fall into disarray and change rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The {{west coast}} of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like <b>a</b> <b>funnel</b> and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, {{creating}} good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks {{along the coast of}} Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.|$|E
5|$|Completed {{in early}} 1883 and 1884, respectively, Dingyuan and Zhenyuan {{were to be}} sailed to China by a German crew, but delays—primarily from France {{following}} {{the outbreak of the}} Sino-French War in 1884—kept the ships in Germany. A German crew took Dingyuan out for a firing test at sea, causing glass to shatter around the ship, along with damage to <b>a</b> <b>funnel.</b> After the war ended in April 1885, the two ironclads were permitted to depart for China, along with Jiyuan. The three ships arrived in China in October and they were formally commissioned into the Beiyang Fleet. Dingyuan was the flagship of the new formation, and {{by the time of the}} First Sino-Japanese War, she was under the command of Commodore Liu Pu-chan, while Admiral Ding Ruchang was also stationed on board. Zhenyuan was under the command of Captain Lin T'ai-tseng. With the war breaking out in 1894, both ships of the Dingyuan class first saw combat at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September.|$|E

5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with <b>a</b> <b>funnel,</b> increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E
5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, <b>a</b> <b>funnel</b> cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
5|$|The octopus is bilaterally {{symmetrical}} {{along its}} dorso-ventral axis; {{the head and}} foot are {{at one end of}} an elongated body and function as the anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot has evolved into a set of flexible, prehensile appendages, known as arms, that surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The bulbous and hollow mantle is fused {{to the back of the}} head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs. The mantle cavity has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by <b>a</b> <b>funnel</b> or siphon. The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard beak.|$|E

5|$|While {{the local}} townspeople believe all Carno's wives {{died of natural}} causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in {{grotesque}} ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is force-fed animal entrails through <b>a</b> <b>funnel</b> until she chokes to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, revealing {{in the form of a}} green ectoplasm the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again.|$|E
5|$|Gardanne's men gave a good {{account of}} themselves, {{holding up the}} Austrian {{deployment}} for a considerable time. When Gardanne's division was exhausted, Victor pulled it back behind the Fontanone and committed his second division under GdD Chambarlhac (this officer soon lost his nerve and fled). The French held Marengo village and {{the line of the}} Fontanone until about noon, with both flanks in the air. First, at 8 am, Melas hurled FML Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak's division (four battalions) at Victor's defenses, supported by Frimont’s advance guard battery along the stream. Forced into <b>a</b> <b>funnel</b> by the bad ground and Fontanone stream, Hadik’s attack came under fire from two sides and failed, with Hadik being killed. The Austrian commander then committed FML Konrad Valentin von Kaim's division but this attack was also thwarted by 11 am. Finally, as the French position was reinforced by François Étienne de Kellermann's cavalry and Jean Lannes's formation was on the way, FML Ferdinand Johann von Morzin's elite grenadier division was sent in to attack Marengo village. Melas also committed a serious tactical blunder, detaching Generalmajor (GM) Nimptsch's brigade of 2,300 hussars and two artillery batteries back over the Bormida bridge to block the corps of General Louis Gabriel Suchet, which was mistakenly reported around 9 am from Acqui Terme to be approaching Alessandria from the south. Besides delaying the crossing of the Austrian left wing, this also meant that, being 30 kilometers away, Nimptsch's brigade would play no part in the battle.|$|E
