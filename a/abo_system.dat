The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually immunoglobulin M, abbreviated IgM, antibodies.

50|$|Histo-blood group <b>ABO</b> <b>system</b> {{transferase}} is {{an enzyme}} with glycosyltransferase activity, which is encoded by the ABO gene in humans.

Variations in the sequence of the protein between individuals determine the type of modification and the blood group. The ABO gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{negative}} effects of cigarette smoking on human reproduction and on birth weight are well documented. On the other hand <b>ABO</b> <b>system,</b> encoding for glycosyltransferases, contributes to biosynthesis of antigens and oligosaccharide structures involved in blastocyst adhesion and intrauterine selection. In this paper we have searched for possible interaction between <b>ABO</b> <b>system</b> and smoking concerning their effects on maternal age at child bearing and on birth weight. STUDY DESIGN: We have studied 395 consecutive healthy puerperae from the White Caucasian population of Rome. ABO blood group was determined by standard laboratory methods. Three-way contingency table analysis was performed according to Sokal and Rohlf and Chi square test of independence by SPSS programs. RESULTS: The proportion of smokers is higher in A phenotype than in other ABO types among young puerperae (‚â§ 24 years) while it is lower in A phenotype than in other types among older women. The {{negative effects}} of smoke on birth weight is much more evident in women with A blood group than in women carrying other ABO phenotypes. The interaction between smoking and ABO blood groups concerning their effects on birth weight is influenced by gender of newborn and by maternal age. CONCLUSION: ABO blood groups and smoking could have a joint influence on maternal age at child bearing and on birth weight...|$|E
