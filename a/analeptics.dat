50|$|An {{analeptic}}, in medicine, is {{a central}} nervous system stimulant. The term analeptic typically refers to respiratory <b>analeptics</b> (for example, doxapram). <b>Analeptics</b> are central nervous system stimulants that include {{a wide variety of}} medications used to treat depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and respiratory depression. <b>Analeptics</b> can also be used as convulsants, with low doses causing patients to experience heightened awareness, restlessness and rapid breathing.The primary medical use of these drugs is as an anesthetic recovery tool or to treat emergency respiratory depression.Other drugs of this category are prethcamide, pentylenetetrazole, and nikethamide. Nikethamide is now withdrawn due to risk of convulsions. <b>Analeptics</b> have recently been used to better understand the treatment of a barbiturate overdose. Through the use of agents researchers were able to treat obtundation and respiratory depression. Various <b>analeptics</b> contain epononymous names. E.g. Etamivan has the tradname of Analepticon & synephrine is called Analeptin.|$|E
50|$|After their {{introduction}} in {{the early}} 20th century, <b>analeptics</b> were used to study the new life-threatening problem of barbiturate overdose. Prior to the 1930s naturally occurring stimulants such as camphor and caffeine were utilized {{in the treatment of}} barbiturate overdose. Between 1930 and 1960 synthetic <b>analeptics</b> such as nikethamide, pentylenetetrazol, bemegride, amphetamine, and methylphenidate replaced the naturally occurring compounds in treating barbiturate overdose. Recently, <b>analeptics</b> have been turned to the treatment of ADHD due to more efficient ways to treat barbiturate overdoses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Analeptics</b> are {{a diverse}} group of {{medications}} which work through a variety of chemical pathways; however, there are four main mechanisms which analeptic medications work through in order to stimulate respiration. <b>Analeptics</b> can act as potassium channel blockers, ampakines, and serotonin receptor agonists, and adenosine antagonism.|$|E

50|$|<b>Analeptics</b> {{can be used}} to {{increase}} the speed of recovery from propofol, remifentanil, and sevoflurane.

50|$|<b>Analeptics</b> {{have been}} used {{throughout}} history for two main purposes. One purpose is to help patients recover from anesthesia more efficiently. Another purpose is the management of respiratory distress and apnea, particularly in infants.|$|E
50|$|The third common {{mechanism}} which <b>analeptics</b> {{take advantage}} of is to act as serotonin receptor agonists. Buspirone and Mosapride successfully increased respiration in animals by binding to serotonin receptors which are G protein coupled receptors which, upon activation, induce a secondary messenger cascade {{and in this case}} that cascade leads to an analeptic response.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} widely used <b>analeptics</b> was strychnine, which causes CNS {{excitation}} by antagonizing the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine. Strychnine is subcategorized as a convulsant along with picrotoxin and bicuculline, though these convulsants inhibit GABA receptors instead of glycine. Strychnine was used until the early 20th century, when it {{was found to be}} a highly toxic convulsant. Strychnine is now available as a rodenticide as well as an adulterant in drugs such as heroin. The other two convulsants antagonize GABA receptors, but neither are commonly accessible today.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{drugs have}} been used as {{supportive}} therapeutic intervention such as lidocaine, naloxone, thiamine, lorazepam, vecuronium, etomidate, propofol, tolazoline, yohimbine, atropine, naloxone, orciprenaline, metoclopramide, ranitidine, metoprolol, enoxaparin, flucloxacillin, insulin, and irrigation of both eyes with saline. Effects of xylazine are also reversed by the <b>analeptics</b> 4-aminopyridine, doxapram, and caffeine, which are physiological antagonists to central nervous system depressants. Combining yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine in an effort to antagonize xylazine is superior as compared to the administration of either of these drugs individually due to reduction of recovery time. Research initiatives may be necessary in order to standardize treatment and determine effective measures for identifying chronic xylazine usage and intoxication.|$|E

50|$|Two common {{potassium}} channel blockers are Doxapram and GAL-021. Both act on {{potassium channel}}s in Carotid Bodies. These cells {{are responsible for}} sensing low concentrations of oxygen and transmitting information to {{the central nervous system}} ultimately leading to an increase in respiration. Blocking the potassium channels on the membranes of these cells effectively depolarizes the membrane potential, which in turn leads to opening of voltage gated calcium channels and neurotransmitter release. This begins the process of relaying the signal to the central nervous system. Doxapram blocks leak potassium channels in the Tandom pore domain family of potassium channels while GAL-021 blocks BK channels, or big potassium channels, which are activated by a change in membrane electron potential or by an increase in internal calcium.Ampakines are the second common form of <b>analeptics</b> which elicit a different mechanism for an analeptic response. They bind to AMPA receptors, or amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, within the pre-Bötzinger complex. The pre-Bötzinger complex is part of the ventral respiratory group and the induction of long term potentials in the postsynaptic membrane of these neurons leads to an increased respiratory rate. The endogenous AMPA receptor ligand is glutamate and ampakines mirror glutamate's interaction with the receptors. Ligand binding causes AMPA receptors to open and allow for sodium ions to flow into the cell, leading to depolarization and signal transduction. At this time, CX717 is the most successful ampakine in human trials and has very few side effects.|$|E

40|$|In Part 1 of {{the present}} paper, the author {{reported}} that no marked relations had been found between anesthetics and <b>analeptics</b> in their influences on {{the activities of the}} nerves as determined by cholinesterase levels which usually were comparatively stable. Then the author performed investigations on the influences of these two kinds of drugs on free acetylcholine levels in the brain. The results {{of the present}} experiments are summarized, as follows: (1) Anesthesia resulted in the rise in the levels of free acetylcholine in the cortex of the cerebrum and the brain stem. The degree of rise was in direct proportion to how deep the anesthesia induced by each drug was. (2) Free acetylcholine levels were changeable in the early stage of the administration of <b>analeptics</b> and just when convulsions induced by the drugs began to be produced, but they showed a tendency to be lowered as the time elapsed. (3) The ligation of common carotid arteries on both sides resulted in no variations in free acetylcholine levels in the cortex of the cerebrum.

40|$|The author {{performed}} investigations on the acetylcholine-cholinesterase system, one of {{the chemical}} systems assumed {{to be responsible for}} the activities of the nerves. The experiments were carried out in the rat; the drugs used for experiments were injected into the internal and external carotid arteries by closed arterial injection method and the brain was extirpated just when paralysis or excitation of the sensory nerves had been induced; and the cholinesterase activities in the cortex of the brain, the brain stem and the cerebellum were measured. At the same time, serum cholinesterase activities were measured in chronological sequence on blood samples obtained from the jugular vein. Then the data thus collected were compared with the results of in vitro experiments on the behaviors of these drugs against brain and serum cholinesterase. The results of the present experiments are summarized as follows: (1) The results of in vitro experiments showed that chloral hydrate, urethane, caffeine, cardiazol and vitacarnphor inhibited the activities of both serum cholinesterase and brain cholinesterase. (2) The results of in vitro experiments showed that phenobarbital and picrotoxin had no influence on the activities of serum cholinesterase and brain cholinesterase, while evipan natrium and strychnine had no influence on the activities of serum cholinesterase.

40|$|A {{double-blind}} study {{is described in}} which the analgesic and <b>analeptic</b> properties of methylphenidate were investigated in 63 patients following surgery. No effect of methylphenidate on postoperative pain was observed. However, methylphenidate reduced sedation up to 30 min after operation, and improved respiratory function up to 180 min in patients receiving halothane. No conclusive evidence of improvement in mood was obtained, and occasional undesirable behavioural effects of methylphenidate were seen. Methylphenidate, an <b>analeptic</b> agent with a pot-ency mid-way between those of caffeine and the amphetamines (Meier, Gross and Tripod, 1954), has central nervous system, cardiac and respi-ratory stimulant activity. It {{has been used to}} decrease waking time after general anaesthesia (Christensen, 1958; Gale, 1958) and to reverse coma resulting from drugs or minor degrees of brain injury (Hoagland, 1965). Brichard and Johnstone (1970) described its use in the preven-tion of the shivering associated with halothane anaesthesia and Johnstone (1974), reporting on its analgesic properties, suggested its use for the relief of pain after operation. Since any drug which combines <b>analeptic</b> with analgesic properties could be useful in the post-operative period, a double-blind trial was carried out to assess further the analgesic and other effects of methylphenidate when administered i. v. at the end of anaesthesia.
