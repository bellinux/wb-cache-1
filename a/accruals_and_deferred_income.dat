The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to present the {{influence}} of provisions and <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> on the financial leverage and the capital structure of an enterprise. Each of this categories has a complex character and it is shaped under an influence of different factors. Their common characteristic is the fact that they are shown in the company’s balance - sheet and they have been established to accomplish definite goals in the future. The provisions are composed primarily of provisions for the deferred income tax, retirement and other benefits and the remaining provisions, which include, for instance, reserves due to the past events caused by restructuring. The main goal of provisions is updating the company’s debt value. These provisions are, thus, connected with a future outlay, which is probable enough on the balance - sheet day to be shown in the balance - sheet. Provisions are classified according to the type of a liability they concern among the remaining and even the main operating costs, financial costs or extraordinary losses. Provisions connected with main operating costs should be established only in exceptional circumstances and, hence, when they concern the really incurred costs. In this case such provision is used to cover a change in deferred cost and accruals. Zadanie pt.

40|$|Purpose: Firstly, {{this paper}} investigates the {{sourcing}} strategy {{of small and}} medium sized companies (SMEs) in terms of accounting tasks. Secondly, this paper also attempts to find motivations for the sourcing strategy of accounting. Thirdly, this paper investigates whether the sourcing strategy is related to firm size, industry and familiarity with outsourcing of other support tasks. The following accounting tasks are considered in this study: (1) entry of invoices and financial transactions, (2) preparation of interim {{profit and loss account}} (e. g., monthly profit calculation), (3) period-end accounting (e. g., depreciations, interest accruals, stock changes, loans, <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>income),</b> (4) preparation of financial statements (Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss Account, Notes), (5) Belgian VAT compliance and (6) Belgian corporate income tax compliance. Design/Methodology/Approach: A survey was developed and sent out to 1 200 randomly selected SMEs in Belgium. We used the criteria of the European Commission, defining SMEs as companies employing between 10 and 250 employees. From this group, we excluded financial and governmental companies. The survey was developed after in-depth interviews with experts in the field (accounting service providers) and revised three times based on the comments of six CEOs, not included in the final sample. The results of this study are based upon answers from 126 respondents. Findings: To get an idea of the degree of outsourcing in each of the six accounting tasks, we used the framework of Lacity and Willcocks (1998) and made a distinction among total insourcing (less than 20 per cent of the task is done by the external accountant), selective outsourcing (between 20 per cent and 80 per cent of the task is performed by the external accountant) and total outsourcing (more than 80 per cent of the task is performed by the external accountant). The results show that SMEs prefer to a large extent a total insourcing strategy for regularly recurring tasks like the entry of the invoices and the VAT compliance. For less frequent tasks, like the period-end accounting and the preparation of the financial statements, a selective outsourcing strategy is regularly used, where the workload is more or less equally divided between the SME and the external accountant. A total outsourcing strategy is mainly used for corporate income tax compliance (63 per cent of the respondents). Contrary to most prior studies that identified cost reductions as the principal driver to choose for outsourcing, our study within Belgian SMEs indicated that cost is not the main concern when deciding whether or not to outsource accounting tasks. SMEs especially select a total outsourcing strategy because of the external expertise and high confidence in the external accountant. SMEs especially select a total insourcing strategy because they want the accounting information at hand and prefer a direct follow-up of the financial situation. SMEs especially select for a selective outsourcing strategy for the expertise and specialized knowhow of the external accountant. Finally, we found a relationship between sourcing strategy and firm size. Larger SMEs prefer to keep their accounting tasks internally. The smaller the SME, the more it relies on an external accountant by choosing for a selective or total outsourcing strategy. Industry did not have an influence. SMEs that are familiar with outsourcing of other support tasks seem to prefer a total insourcing strategy for their accounting tasks. Research limitations/implications: Most outsourcing research to date has concentrated either on outsourcing or insourcing. Future research on outsourcing should focus on the degree of outsourcing, because the results show that many SMEs are using a selective outsourcing strategy. Furthermore, the results also show that cost reduction is not a reason to outsource accounting, so future research might investigate the difference in reasons to (or not to) outsource, depending on the business function. Finally, there is no link with performance in this study. Future research might explore the conditions in which total insourcing, selective or total outsourcing (of accounting or other functions) might be appropriate. Practical implications: Service providers (in this study limited to external accountants) need to stress their “expertise” to attract SMEs to (selectively) outsource accounting activities. The most important reason why SMEs do not outsource is that the accounting information would no longer be readily available in the company and there would be fewer possibilities for direct follow-up. External accountants {{have to take into account}} these arguments when further improving their services for SMEs, for instance by offering web-based applications. Originality/Value of the paper: We examined outsourcing of accounting in more detail than previous studies in this area by specifying six different accounting tasks and including the degree of outsourcing for each of these accounting tasks. This made it possible to investigate the different sourcing strategies (total insourcing, selective outsourcing, total outsourcing) and to link this with reasons to outsource and company characteristics. outsourcing, accounting, SME, Belgium...|$|E

40|$|Estimates of {{stranded}} commitments for US investor-owned {{electric utilities}} range widely, from {{as little as}} $ 20 billion {{to as much as}} $ 500 billion (more than double the shareholder equity in US utilities). These potential losses are a consequence of the above-market book values for some utility-owned power plants, long-term power-purchase contracts, <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> taxes, regulatory assets, and public-policy programs. Because of the wide range of estimates and the potentially large dollar amounts involved, state and federal regulators need a clear understanding of the methods used to calculate these estimates. In addition, they may want simple methods that they can use to check the reasonableness of the estimates that utilities and other parties present in regulatory proceedings. This report explains various top-down and bottom-up methods to calculate stranded commitments. The purpose of this analysis is to help regulators and others understand the implications of different analytical approaches to estimating stranded-commitment amounts. Top-down methods, because they use the utility as the unit of analysis, are simple to apply and to understand. However, their aggregate nature makes it difficult to determine what specific assets and liabilities affect their estimates. Bottom-up methods use the individual asset (e. g., power plant) or liability (e. g., power-purchase contract, fuel-supply contract, <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> taxes) as the unit of analysis.

50|$|<b>Accrual</b> {{accounting}} <b>and</b> <b>deferring</b> implies timewise matching(synchronization) {{of income}} and expenses: an incurred cost is capitalized and does not become an expense until it is recognized in the financial statements of the company. In an accounting sense, it is the amortization of that cost, and not the original cost itself, that becomes the expense. Hence, certain costs which are incurred to acquire insurance contracts should not be recognized as an expense in the accounting period {{in which they are}} incurred but should be capitalized as an asset on the balance sheet and gradually amortized over the lifetime of the insurance contracts. Such costs are called Deferred Acquisition Expenses (DAE) and capitalization of DAE results in setting up of an asset called Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC).|$|R
30|$|Corporate {{taxable income}} {{is based on}} the income {{disclosed}} in the financial statements and accounting records, adjusted in accordance with tax principles. The 2007 Spanish General Accounting Plan approved by Royal Decree 1514 / 2007, of November 16 th differentiates between the current income tax expense (<b>income)</b> <b>and</b> the <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax expense (income). The total tax expense or income is the sum of these two items, which should nonetheless be quantified separately. On the one hand, the current income tax expense is the amount payable by the company as a result of income tax settlements for a given year. Conversely, the <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax expense reflects in essence the recognition <b>and</b> settlement of <b>deferred</b> tax assets <b>and</b> liabilities. A <b>deferred</b> tax asset or liability represents the increase or decrease in taxes payable or refundable in future years as a result of temporary differences and any net operating loss or tax credit carry-forwards that exist at the reporting date. Its value is computed with reference to financial reporting standards for book income and tax rules for taxable <b>income.</b> For instance, <b>deferred</b> tax assets can be created by the tax authority recognizing revenues and/or expenses outside of the times set out in the accounting standards. In Spain “tax effect accounting”, which includes the concept of net tax deferred assets, was first introduced in fiscal year 2007.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Portugal, {{the general}} {{adoption}} of the International Accounting Standards was made under the SNC-Accounting Normalization System, in 2010. The SNC carried out new bookkeeping rules concerning the way government grants related to assets. While in the past these grants were treated as liabilities during the economic life of the asset, now the Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards n. ° 22 (NCRF n. ° 22) report them as an item of equity capital. This procedure is {{an exception to the}} rules stated in IAS. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze whatever the accounting for government grants impact on equity capital and, consequently on financial ratios, of Portuguese companies in the agricultural sector. We collect financial information of 2009, from 124 enterprises operating in the agricultural sector, which had report subsidies for investment. The sample was draw from SABI data base. Our model used the amounts reported as “Accrued <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> - Income taxes - Subsidies for Investments” (old bookkeeping rules), at 31 / 12 / 2009, and estimates the values of the equity capital and financial ratios. We found a positive variation in equity capital, which corresponds to an increase of nearly 4. 5 %. Consequently it caused an increase of 4. 7 % in the indicator of financial autonomy, and also had a positive impact on the solvency ratio, with an average variation greater than 11 %. Our research shows that the new bookkeeping rules have important implication in the values of some financial ratios of Portuguese companies. Even though the new bookkeeping procedures are different from those stated in IAS n° 20, Portugal opted by the same rules as those that Spain and France follow since long time ago and thus Portuguese companies are in equal competition condition to apply European Programs for financial support of investment projects, since it requires some minimum values at certain ratios...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aimed at providing higher quality financial statements has undoubtedly {{been one of}} the most critical changes in the field of accounting in the European Union (EU). However, under the presence of incentives for earnings management, the adoption of high-quality accounting standards may not provide an adequate set of conditions for the improved quality of financial reporting (Ball et al., 2003; Holthausen, 2003, Kothari et al., 2010). The present thesis examines the adoption of IAS 12 : Income Taxes in Greece, which is a country that does not offer the ideal conditions for the {{implementation of}}, quality accounting standards (Li, 2010). The research analysis examines (a) the level of compliance with the disclosure requirements of IAS 12 and the associated factors that affect it, (b) the value relevance of tax components and (c) the likely discretionary use of deferred tax components for earnings management purposes in Greece. The results of the thesis reveal a number of interesting findings. First, the level of conformity to IAS 12 by Greek companies is increasing and seems to be affected by firm characteristics. To be specific, growth, auditing firm (Big 4 vs. non-Big 4) and size are useful in explaining changes in the level of conformity, while leverage and profitability are also useful; however, only for some of the disclosures. Second, tax components seem to be value relevant. Current tax is significant under every research setting examined and has a positive coefficient, while net deferred tax liabilities are significant and have a negative coefficient. On the other hand, the results on deferred tax expenses are mixed and show that they have a negative slope coefficient, yet they are significant for some particular procedures employed for correcting the standard errors. Third, the relation between discretionary <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> tax expenses is further examined. The results show that deferred tax expenses seem to be related to earnings management under some research settings. However, the main finding of the thesis is that even under a severe institutional setting that does not offer ideal circumstances for implementation, the adoption of a new standard that ensures high-quality accounting helps in providing high-quality accounting information to investors, even though under some research settings the presence of incentives may lead to the discretionary use of deferred tax components.

40|$|Utilizing {{a random}} sample of 80 Canadian public companies, this thesis {{establishes}} that {{a significant increase in the}} number <b>and</b> magnitude of <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax drawdowns occurred in the recessionary period of the early 1980 s. The behaviour of <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax expense is then investigated to determine if the observed increase in drawdowns related to a reduction in fixed asset additions or was the result of accounting losses.;The existing literature on <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> taxes implicitly assumes that drawdowns are the result of involuntary reversals of timing differences that result in a sacrifice of economic resources. However, the data gathered from financial statements leads one to believe that many drawdowns, and in particular the larger ones, are the result of accounting losses.;It was not possible to determine the exact proportion of drawdowns resulting from losses as current Canadian accounting standards do not require that the reason for a drawdown be provided. For this reason, the researcher contacted management of 13 of the companies experiencing drawdowns in the early 1980 s. The result was a substantiation of the belief that losses were a very important factor underlying the increase in drawdowns. It is believed that this has the potential to mislead a financial statement reader as a company 2 ̆ 7 s consolidated financial statements can indicate a profit, yet the drawdown can relate to losses in one or more subsidiaries. This is due to a Canadian requirement that each legal entity file its own separate tax return and therefore each separate legal entity in the consolidated group must individually determine its <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax.;In addition, a review of companies notes relating to loss carryforwards indicated potential departures from the CICA Handbook and a lack of data that the researcher believes is necessary for a usesr to make an assessment of the potential benefit that may be associated with these loss carryforwards.;Partial tax allocation, using the deferral method, is recommended for rapid write-off assets such as Class 29 assets, but the critical recommendations relate to disclosure. Current Canadian accounting standards do not require disclosure of the reasons for changes in <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> taxes, yet the data analyzed shows that it is not possible to make accurate inferences about this behaviour from companies 2 ̆ 7 financial statements.

40|$|Tax-effect {{accounting}} {{has been}} controversy since its origin in allocation {{has generally been}} adopted the subject in the 1940 s. Tax across the English speaking world, even though underlying basic issues have not been resolved. A {{review of the literature}} shows that issues such as: whether income tax is an expense; whether the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax is a liability and whether the provision for future income tax benefit is an asset have not been resolved because of differing opinions as to what is an expense, liability or an asset. The development of a conceptual framework in Australia, which provides definitions of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, has provided an opportunity to reexamine some of the unresolved issues mentioned above. Since the conceptual framework, in SAC 4, defines an expense in terms of whether it increases a liability or reduces an asset the re-examination was directed at ascertaining whether the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax satisfies the definition and recognition criteria for a liability. The results were inconclusive. However, it was possible to conclude that the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax does not readily satisfy the criteria in SAC 4. An empirical investigation was then undertaken to ascertain whether selected user groups treat the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax as a liability. The investigation surveyed investment houses, company secretaries, auditors and the parties to trust deeds. Evidence gathered suggest that investment houses and company secretaries treat the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax all a liability.

No evidence was found that the parties to trust deeds treat the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax In a systematic way.

40|$|Borehole radar is a short-range, {{high-resolution}} geophysical {{technique that}} can be used to delineate the position of the Merensky platinum reef in underground mines situated in the Western Bushveld Complex. In this study, borehole radar is used in reflection mode from four boreholes drilled sub-parallel to the expected position of the Merensky Reef within an underground mining block bounded by two cross-cuts and a haulage. This study relates the stratigraphic column at Amandelbult Section to borehole radar reflectivity. The radar illumination line coordinates produced along the Merensky Reef surface are used to construct a three-dimensional surface of the reef within the defined mining block. The geophysical interpretation presented here shows how a slump in the Merensky Reef, called a pothole, is imaged using borehole radar. This study analyses the increase in geological confidence related to the improved delineation of the elevation of the Merensky Reef. The financial impact of using borehole radar to delineate this pothole is analysed at the various mining steps, namely: orebody definition, mine planning, mine development, ore extraction and ore processing. The information gained by conducting borehole radar is compared with the information acquired using only standard geological drilling. This study concludes that the application of borehole radar significantly increases the confidence in the geological model prior to mining. Conducting borehole radar prior to mining improves mine planning and development, ensures that less waste is mined, facilitates the effective deployment of labour crews, prevents waste being sent to the processing plant <b>and</b> avoids <b>deferring</b> <b>income</b> until a later date. Recommendations are made on how to plan for and include borehole radar in the mining process. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Geologyunrestricte...|$|R

40|$|Long overdue {{changes to}} {{negative}} gearing and {{capital gains tax}} would save the Commonwealth Government about $ 5. 3 billion a year. Summary The interaction of a fifty per cent capital gains tax discount with negative gearing distorts investment decisions, makes housing markets more volatile and reduces home ownership. The two measures in combination allow investors to reduce <b>and</b> <b>defer</b> personal <b>income</b> tax, at an annual cost of $ 11. 7 billion to the public purse. Other taxes, which often drag more on the economy than {{a capital gains tax}} does, must be higher as a result. And like most tax concessions, these tax breaks largely benefit the wealthy. The capital gains tax discount should be reduced from 50 to 25 per cent, and negatively geared investors should no longer be allowed to deduct losses on their investments from labour income. A smaller discount would save about $ 3. 7 billion a year, while the change to negative gearing would raise $ 2 billion a year in the short term, falling to $ 1. 6 billion as losses start to be written off against positive investment income. The reforms would provide relief to the Budget in tough times and slightly improve housing affordability with little impact on how much people save. Property prices would be up to two per cent lower under these reforms than they would be otherwise. Contrary to urban myth, rents won’t change much, nor will housing markets collapse. The effects on property prices would be small compared to factors such as interest rates and the supply of land. The reforms should be phased in, to make them easier to sell and to prevent a rush of investors selling property before the changes come into force. While other proposals, such as restricting negative gearing to new properties or limiting the dollar value of deductions, would improve the current regime, they nevertheless leave too many problems in place and introduce unnecessary distortions. These two sensible reforms won’t hurt private savings much but will save the government a lot of money...|$|R

It is assumed that immediate income recognition is not appropriate due to the facts and circumstances. The payment to the investor and the future revenue or income on which the payment is based may be denominated in a foreign currency. The issues are: 1.
