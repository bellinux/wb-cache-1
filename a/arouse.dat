In 2003, Usher started working on the album which would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and <b>arouse</b> fans' curiosity about {{how much of the}} infidelity story was Usher's own confession. The unintended result of this was to <b>arouse</b> Thomas's suspicions about Usher. They broke up in December 2003.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThermoregulatory {{uncoupling}} of {{oxidative phosphorylation}} {{has been studied}} in heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria of ground squirrels. The respiratory rate of mitochondria {{in the presence of}} oligomycin was found to be much higher in winter (in hibernating, <b>arousing,</b> or <b>aroused</b> animals) than in summer. This additional respiration is strongly (<b>arousing</b> animals) or completely (hibernating and <b>aroused</b> animals) inhibited by carboxy-atractylate (CAtr) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The CAtr- and BSA-induced decreases in the rate of respiration are accompanied by membrane potential increases. The rate of the CAtr- and BSA-sensitive respiration is proportional to the content of free fatty acids which, in the heart, decreases in the order: <b>arousing</b> > <b>aroused</b> = hibernating > summer animals. Maximal respiratory rates observed in the presence of dinitrophenol (<b>arousing</b> > <b>aroused</b> > summer > hibernating animals) do not parallel the fatty acid level. It is assumed that some heat production in the winter animals is due to fatty acid-induced, ATPIADP-antiporter-mediated uncoupling in heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria. The peak of heat production during arousal after hibernation also includes some other stimulatory effect on mitochondrial respiration...|$|R
50|$|Arousal is {{involved}} in the detection, retention, and retrieval of information in the memory process. Emotionally <b>arousing</b> information can lead to better memory encoding, therefore influencing better retention and retrieval of information. Arousal is related to selective attention during the encoding process by showing that people are more subject to encode <b>arousing</b> information than neutral information. The selectivity of encoding <b>arousing</b> stimuli produces better long-term memory results than the encoding of neutral stimuli. In other words, the retention and accumulation of information is strengthened when exposed to <b>arousing</b> events or information. <b>Arousing</b> information is also retrieved or remembered more vividly and accurately.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the effects of affective valence and arousal on the {{reasoning}} process. Reasoning was measured using a semantic verification task and the influence of valence and arousal was tracked using the affective priming paradigm. Primes were photographs varied on two dimensions - emotional valence (positive, neutral, negative) and arousal (high, low). Forty-nine psychology students participated in the experiment. Results showed that reaction time needed for semantic verification was significantly faster for positive-high <b>arousing</b> in comparison to positive-low <b>arousing</b> condition and for neutral high <b>arousing</b> in comparison to neutral-low <b>arousing</b> condition, but there were no significant differences in negative low and high <b>arousing</b> conditions. Also, significant differences were found among all three valences in high <b>arousing</b> conditions and there were no such differences in low <b>arousing</b> conditions. These results reveal the importance of both arousal and valence in the research on the influence of emotions on the reasoning process. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 179033...|$|R
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to <b>arouse</b> sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E

40|$|Showing an <b>arousing</b> central {{stimulus}} {{in a scene}} {{often leads}} to enhanced memory for the <b>arousing</b> central information and impaired memory for peripheral details. However, {{it is not clear}} from previous work whether <b>arousing</b> stimuli impair memory for all non-arousing nearby information or just background information.

5|$|Since beetles form such a {{large part}} of the world's biodiversity, their {{conservation}} is important, and equally, loss of habitat and biodiversity is essentially certain to impact on beetles. Unfortunately, with exceptions for groups such as ladybirds and fireflies, beetles as a whole have a less positive image than other insect groups like the butterflies: many are indeed pests, and others <b>arouse</b> disgust. Many species of beetles have very specific habitats and long life cycles that make them vulnerable. Some species are highly threatened while others are already feared extinct. Island species tend to be more susceptible as in the case of Helictopleurus undatus of Madagascar which is thought to have gone extinct during the late 20th century. Conservationists have attempted to <b>arouse</b> a liking for beetles with flagship species like the stag beetle, Lucanus cervus, and tiger beetles (Cicindelidae). In Japan the Genji firefly, Luciola cruciata, is extremely popular, and in South Africa the Addo elephant dung beetle offers promise for broadening ecotourism beyond the big five tourist mammal species. Popular dislike of pest beetles, too, can be turned into public interest in insects, as can unusual ecological adaptations of species like the fairy shrimp hunting beetle, Cicinis bruchi.|$|E

30|$|Music {{choices for}} the {{situations}} were characterized along two dimensions, namely <b>arousing</b> and aesthetic. When considering how music {{choices for the}} situations are characterized, the <b>arousing</b> and aesthetic dimensions highlight {{the differences in the}} preferred music in various situations. The <b>arousing</b> dimension suggests that preferred music was characterized in part on the basis of arousal goals. Specifically, because the pattern of results showed that high arousal situations were associated with music rated as highly <b>arousing</b> (and low arousal situations were associated with preferred music that was significantly less <b>arousing),</b> it demonstrates that listeners are using arousal-optimization strategies, rather than necessarily using arousal-moderation strategies. Moreover the evidence from the BPM analysis reiterates the same pattern of preferring music with a higher BPM rate (equated to more <b>arousing</b> music) in high arousal situations and slower music (lower BPM/less <b>arousing</b> music) in low arousal situations. Participants were apparently choosing music to polarize their degree of arousal to a level that is consistent with the goals of the listening situation, rather than attempting to moderate their level of arousal.|$|R

40|$|Emotion {{regulation}} involves several brain {{areas such}} as prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and insular cortex. However, considering different levels of <b>arousing</b> elicitations, how such a brain dynamics is affected by emotional pleasant/unpleasant (valence) elicitation is not fully understood. To this aim, we propose an Electroencephalographic (EEG) -based preliminary study in which 22 healthy subjects were elicited through affective pictures gathered from the International Affective Picture System. Considering 4 <b>arousing</b> levels, each of which including two valence levels (pleasant and unpleasant), we investigated EEG power spectra and functional connectivity. Focusing on gamma oscillations (> 32 Hz), because of their known sensitivity to valence changes, results revealed no significant changes between pleasant/unpleasant elicitation when lower and higher <b>arousing</b> level occurred. Conversely, valence changes in the intermediate <b>arousing</b> sessions were associated with changes in the prefrontal and occipital regions. Additionally, different <b>arousing</b> levels of pleasant elicitations affected short-range connectivity over the right hemisphere, whereas different <b>arousing</b> levels of unpleasant elicitations affected medium-range connectivity over the left hemisphere...|$|R

William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt. In response, Swift represented Ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of Britain in the Drapier's Letters. Since the subject was politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym M. B., Drapier, to hide from retaliation.|$|E

5|$|Hambro {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1958 with the non-fiction book Frankrike ("France"), and released {{his first novel}} two years later. The novel, entitled De frafalnes klubb ("The Club of the Estranged"), was favourably commented upon by contemporary critics, but failed to <b>arouse</b> much subsequent interest from scholars. Hambro's reputation as a novelist rests more on his trilogy about the fictional character Nico Dietmeyer, deemed a Bildungsroman by academics. That work, serialised in the 1960s, was Hambro's first major commercial success, and has been reviewed in detail both by contemporaneous commentators and modern literary scholars. After a few unsuccessful novels in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hambro turned his writings towards non-fiction, especially focusing on linguistics and politics, fields of interest that he had inherited from his father, who became fascinated by Sanskrit and East Asian poetry during his philology studies. The younger Hambro's most well-known and successful book within linguistics was the 1969 Ting, tanke, tale ("Thing, Thought, Speech"), followed by Språket i funksjon ("Language in Operation") in 1972.|$|E
