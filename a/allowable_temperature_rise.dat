Several problems have been experienced related to the coupling capacitor of the radio frequency system including its sever burning during commissioning of the cyclotron. Making of the dissimilar joints between alumina ceramic and copper of the coupling capacitor demands the usage of vacuum furnace to avoid the cracking of the ceramic.

50|$|From {{the basic}} {{principles}} that electric current leads to thermal heating and thermal power transfer to the ambient environment requires some temperature difference, {{it follows that the}} current leads to a <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> in the conductors. The ampacity, or maximum allowable current, of an electric power cable depends on the <b>allowable</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the cable and any adjacent materials such as insulation or termination equipment. For insulated cables, the insulation maximum temperature is normally the limiting material property that constrains ampacity. For uninsulated cables (typically used in overhead installation), the tensile strength of the cable (as affected by temperature) is normally the limiting material property. The Neher-McGrath method is the electrical industry standard for calculating cable ampacity, most often employed via lookup in tables of precomputed results for common configurations.|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft {{historically}} have had sub- 1 kW(sub e), electrical requirements for GN&C, science, and communications: Galileo at 600 W(sub e), and Cassini at 900 W(sub e), for example. Because most missions {{have had the}} same order of magnitude power requirements, the Power Distribution Systems (PDS) use existing, space-qualified technology and are DC. As science payload and mission duration requirements increase, however, the required electrical power increases. Subsequently, this requires a change from a passive energy conversion (solar arrays and batteries) to dynamic (alternator, solar dynamic, etc.), because dynamic conversion has higher thermal and conversion efficiencies, has higher power densities, and scales more readily to higher power levels. Furthermore, increased power requirements and physical distribution lengths are best served with high-voltage, multi-phase AC to maintain distribution efficiency and minimize voltage drops. The generated AC-voltage must be stepped-up (or down) to interface with various subsystems or electrical hardware. Part of the trade-space design for AC distribution systems is volume and mass estimation of high-power transformers. The volume and mass are functions of the power rating, operating frequency, the ambient and <b>allowable</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise,</b> the types and amount of heat transfer available, the core material and shape, the required flux density in a core, the maximum current density, etc. McLyman has tabulated the performance of a number of transformers cores and derived a "cookbook" methodology to determine the volume of transformers, whereas Schawrze had derived an empirical method to estimate the mass of single-phase transformers. Based on the work of McLyman and Schwarze, it is the intent herein to derive an empirical solution to the volume and mass estimation of three-phase, laminated EI-core power transformers, having radiated and conducted heat transfer mechanisms available.

40|$|In {{order to}} absorb a large {{reflected}} power from RF cavities, {{we have developed}} CW high power water-loads {{for the use of}} KEKB. The loads can absorb a CW power of up to ~ 1. 2 MW and an operational frequency range is 508. 9 ± 5 MHz. They are filled with water as an RF absorber, which is sealed with an RF window made of alumina ceramics. We have developed two types of water-loads: one is a rectangular waveguide made of a stainless steel, and the other a cylindrical tank made of aluminum. We made the high power test of all the loads at KEK when they were delivered. A load absorbed a maximum power of ~ 1. 1 MW. We also measured RF properties of tap water using a network analyzer with a dielectric probe. Cooling water as an RF power absorber is circulated with a pump and exchanges heat with facility cooling water using a heat exchanger at each power-supply room of KEKB. The heat exchange systems for LER have been built for KEKB, while those for HER are the reuse of TRISTAN components. The flow rate of the LER heat exchanger is 1, 200 l/min and the <b>allowable</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> of water is ~ 23 ˚C. Power handling capability of the heat exchanger is about 1. 8 MW, which is well over a maximum reflected power from four cavities. The flow rate and the temperature rise of the HER heat exchanger are about 1, 500 l/min and 25 ˚C respectively. At an early stage of the KEKB operation, we used the tap water as an absorber material for its high absorption rate and easy handing. We found out later that an inside surface of the aluminum tank suffered corrosion by interaction with impurities in the water. We changed the cooling water for the cylindrical tank type from the tap water to the deionized water, while the waveguide-type load made of stainless steel still uses tap water. ...|$|E
