Former Governor Douglas cautioned Milne against waging a legislative campaign for Governor, {{saying that it was}} [...] "unlikely" [...] to be an effective strategy and that Milne should seek to preserve the [...] "good will that he has accrued" [...] and [...] "acknowledge the result <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> fight another day." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing his {{decision}} to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, [...] "I told my manager if I can keep my family there and I can spend time with them <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth, I would {{do that in a}} second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't." [...] Burton was happy with the flexibility of his [...] "short term" [...] contract, [...] "I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I can get back to Nashville. I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH", he said during a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!. In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Black {{joined the}} cast {{full-time}} in season 10. Had Stargate SG-1 not {{been picked up}} for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series. To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and {{tried to find a}} suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship. Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful complement to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in [...] "Beachhead", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy. The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer Damian Kindler later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler Lando Calrissian from Star Wars, a [...] "former swindler who's gone legit". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala [...] "as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. But definitely the sort of character who could come in for a couple of seasons, spice things up and then move on <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth." [...] Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them [...] "end up in a motel room bed together" [...] in the episode [...] "Memento Mori", involving underwear, [...] "handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies". A scene in the milestone episode [...] "200" [...] also parodied the show's connection to Farscape. In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period. Her relocation to Vancouver and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low. She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character [...] "and not go for the cheap laugh".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the fire force, the four Commandos were often used in patrolling actions, mostly inside Rhodesia but sometimes in Zambia and Mozambique. [...] In these operations troopies were required to carry well over 100lbs of equipment for five to tens days for one patrol <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> repeat, for weeks, sometimes months. Also, they participated in many attacks on enemy camps in above countries. In {{a few of these}} attacks most or all of the battalion was involved.|$|E
2500|$|Each one-hour {{programme}} {{follows the}} team of grifters as they practise the [...] "long con", an extended deception practised against one or more [...] "marks" [...] (targets). Speaking in a documentary video, Adrian Lester described {{the difference between the}} long con and more common confidence tricks: [...] "where you take a mark and convince them of a certain situation or a lie, and you send them away to get more money <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> give it to you". In the first series, Stacie explains to Danny the reason such long cons tend to work: unlike the more obvious short cons, [...] "most marks don't report a con because they think they've done something illegal, or better still, they don't know they've been conned in the first place".|$|E
2500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed among historians that English, Anglo-Saxons, did migrate to Constantinople {{in these years}} and joined the Varangian Guard, something which can be shown beyond question from other sources. A more reliable source, closer to the events in question, is the Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis. Orderic, after {{an account of the}} Norman conquest of England and the failure of the northern rebellion, summarised the responses of the defeated English as follows:And so the English groaned aloud for their lost liberty and plotted ceaselessly to find some way of shaking off a yoke that was so intolerable and unaccustomed. Some sent to Sveinn, king of Denmark, and urged him to lay claim to the kingdom of England ... Others went into voluntary exile so that they might either find in banishment freedom from the power of the Normans or secure foreign help <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> fight a war of vengeance. Some of them who were still in the flower of their youth travelled into remote lands and bravely offered their arms to Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, a man of great wisdom and nobility. Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia, had taken up arms against him in support of Michael whom the Greeks — resenting the power of the Senate — had driven from the imperial throne. Consequently the English exiles were warmly welcomed by the Greeks and were sent into battle against the Norman forces, which were too powerful for the Greeks alone. The Emperor Alexius laid the foundations of a town called Civitot for the English, some distance from Byzantium; but later when the Norman threat became too great he brought them back to the imperial city and set them to guard his chief palace and royal treasures. This is the reason for the exodus of the English Saxons to Ionia; the emigrants and their heirs faithfully served the holy empire, and are still honoured among the Greeks by the Emperor, nobility, and people alike. Beyond this account, the details of the story of New England are impossible to verify; the sources in question are late, and many of the elements are, {{in the words of one}} historian, [...] "fantastic".|$|E
