The lion’s share {{of the volume of}} imports for processing and of the value-added of processed exports came from other East Asian countries. We investigate how <b>a</b> unilateral <b>appreciation</b> of the RMB and <b>a</b> joint <b>appreciation</b> of countries supplying intermediate inputs would affect China’s exports. To do this we estimate a panel data model including ordinary and processed exports from China to 33 countries. Results obtained using generalized method of moments techniques indicate that <b>a</b> joint <b>appreciation</b> would significantly reduce China’s processed exports while <b>a</b> unilateral <b>appreciation</b> would not...|$|R

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they {{had to be able to}} read the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
