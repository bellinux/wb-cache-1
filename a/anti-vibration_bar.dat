40|$|Abstract. Finite element {{method to}} analyze the {{fretting}} wear characteristics based on Hertz theory, Coulomb friction law and a modified Archard wear equation, {{has been applied to}} a cylinder-on-flat configuration for typical steam generator tube material Inconel 690 alloy and typical <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>bar</b> material Inconel 600 alloy (Cr plating) in the nuclear power plant, under gross slip and partial slip conditions. The evolutions of contact profile, surface contact variables with increase in wear cycles are predicted. The slip regime is predicted to have significant effects on the fretting wear behavior. Under the gross slip regime, it is found that the peak contact pressure occurs {{at the center of the}} contact scar, and the actual relative slip is slightly smaller than the applied value. The contact width increases, and the peak pressure decreases gradually with increase in wear cycles. Whereas under the partial slip regime, the peak contact pressure occurs at the stick-slip boundary, the actual relative slip is much smaller than the applied value, and no relative slip occurs in the stick zone. The contact width increases gradually, and the peak pressure increases rapidly with increase in wear cycles...|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{fretting}} damages {{exist at}} {{various parts of}} nuclear power systems [7], such as reactor fuel assembly, control rod assembly [8], reactor component, steam generator, pressure vessel [9], main pump, and coolant pump. The steam generator is a key equipment in nuclear power systems, and fretting damage {{is one of the}} main reasons [10] causing its failure. With high thermal strength, good corrosion resistance, anti-oxidation, and other characteristics, alloy 690 is extensively used in the nuclear power and aerospace fields. In nuclear power plants, U-tubes in the steam generator are supported by structures called egg crates. Flow-induced vibration of the U-tubes causes wear to occur on the zone of contact and generates combinations of impacting and sliding motions between the U-tube against the support [11 – 14]. Recently, most of the domestic and foreign studies on wear have concentrated on the sliding wear or bending behavior of the steam generator tubes. In another study, bending (four-point or three-point bending) has been used to determine the damage behavior of tubes or rods [15]. Gueout, et al [16] report that wear of pure sliding is larger than impact wear in the case of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>bar</b> testing. In particular, the wear amount of impact sliding increase more than that of pure sliding or impact wear test. Jeong, et al [17], indicate that the friction coefficient in air is higher than that in water. The friction coefficient and wear rate increased as the temperature of water increase in the water environment. Chung, et al [18], conclude that the wear coefficient in ambient room temperature is lower than 80  °C in water conditions and explain that the protective nature of the tribologically transformed layers could decrease the wear volume. Most of study focus on the tangential fretting wear of alloy 690 tubes, and research on impact fretting wear of alloy 690 tubes is limited. The impact fretting wear behavior of alloy 690 is significant in the evaluation of the life of steam generator tubes in nuclear power plants and in better understanding the wear mechanisms of steam generator tube materials.|$|E

The report described the changes made in the replacement steam generator including the removal of a support cylinder, changes to the tube support plates and <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>bars,</b> and addition of about 400 tubes.|$|R
