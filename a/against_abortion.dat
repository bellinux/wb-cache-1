25|$|Abortion: Badnarik {{personally}} opposes abortion, but {{believes that}} decisions regarding abortion rights {{should be made}} {{at the state and}} not the federal level. He recognizes that there is significant controversy surrounding when life begins, and argues that therefore the state should not legislate <b>against</b> <b>abortion,</b> since a fetus is arguably not a human life in and of its own.|$|E

25|$|Various rabbinic {{sources have}} {{different}} {{positions on the}} way the seven laws are to be subdivided in categories. Maimonides', in his Mishneh Torah, included the grafting of trees. Like the Talmud, he interpreted the prohibition against homicide as including a prohibition <b>against</b> <b>abortion.</b> David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra, a commentator on Maimonides, expressed surprise that he left out castration and sorcery which were also listed in the Talmud.|$|E

25|$|Flaherty {{also promised}} to {{implement}} further tax cuts, carry through {{with plans to}} create a tax credit for parents sending their children to private school, and privatizing the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Flaherty also emerged as a social conservative in this campaign, particularly a staunch stance <b>against</b> <b>abortion</b> and his association with pro-life groups. On April 15, 2002, Eves demoted him to the less-prominent position of Minister of Enterprise, Opportunity and Innovation. Flaherty retained this position until the Tories were defeated in the provincial election of 2003. Flaherty himself was re-elected by a reduced margin.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, the Second Vatican Council led to {{reforms of}} the Church's liturgy and practices, {{described}} as [...] "opening the windows" [...] by defenders, but criticised by traditionalist Catholics. In the face of increased criticism from both within and without, the Church has upheld or reaffirmed at various times controversial doctrinal positions regarding sexuality and gender, including limiting clergy to males, and moral exhortations <b>against</b> <b>abortion,</b> contraception, sexual activity outside of marriage, remarriage following divorce without annulment, and against same-sex marriage.|$|E

He also emphasised the dignity of work and natural rights of labourers to have fair wages and safe conditions in Laborem exercens, and also emphasised several church teachings, including moral exhortations <b>against</b> <b>abortion,</b> euthanasia, and against widespread use of the death penalty, in Evangelium Vitae.|$|E
500|$|Yancey {{writes that}} Christians should be {{politically}} active and should, for example, oppose abortion, [...] "but {{you have to}} find a way to do it with grace...

[...] Yancey recounts Jesus's Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, concluding that God is only willing to forgive us if we are willing to forgive those who have wronged us. In a similar vein, he quotes William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice: [...] "How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?" ...|$|E
500|$|Sixteen-year-old Minnesota high-schooler Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) discovers she is {{pregnant}} by {{her friend and}} longtime admirer, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). She initially considers an abortion. Going to a local clinic run by a women's group, she encounters a schoolmate outside who is holding a one-person protest for pro-life vigil. [...] Once inside, however, {{a variety of factors}} lead Juno to leave. She decides <b>against</b> <b>abortion,</b> and she decides to give the baby up for adoption. With the help of her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), Juno searches the ads in the Pennysaver and finds a couple she feels will provide a suitable home. She tells her father, Mac (J.K. Simmons), and stepmother, Bren (Allison Janney), who offer their support. With Mac, Juno meets the couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), in their expensive home and agrees to a closed adoption.|$|E

40|$|In any event, all {{abortion}} laws [...] {{especially the}} newer laws [...] are rather elastic. I presume {{that they will}} be applied rigidly or leniently depending upon the attitude of the physician. Given a liberal attitude, I suppose the deciding factor would be whether the woman concerned wishes to have the baby or prefers to terminate the pregnancy. I have a feeling that any woman in the United States today who takes the latter attitude will have an abortion, therapeutic or non-therapeutic, medical or lay. In the long run, legislation <b>against</b> <b>abortions</b> is like any legislation against sin; it is commendable but ineffectual...|$|R
500|$|Though 15 delegates of her {{parliament}} (16%) were women, few {{advances in}} women's rights were made during Chamoro's administration. Chamorro {{was not a}} feminist, since her beliefs prevented her from advocating many {{of the goals of}} traditional feminism. She was <b>against</b> <b>abortion</b> and questioned cohabitation, contraception and divorce. Cutbacks in public services during her regime, like child care and centers for rehabilitation, led to an increase in low-income women being forced into prostitution and crime. According to a United Nations study, the financial insecurity forced women and adolescents into [...] "street professions", elevating security risks and increasing the rate of drop outs, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and prostitution. In addition, austerity measures that eliminated free health care made it difficult for the poor to afford care. The Sandinista Workers Central ( [...] , CST) stepped in to offer health care and child care to women who could not afford the new government plan. She did support women's rights to become property holders, and saw such ownership as a protection when divorce or widowhood deprived women of a husband's support. Her administration did not actively prepare or encourage women's participation in political life, nor did she appoint women to governmental positions.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Kemp {{remained}} outspoken on political issues: he {{was critical of}} Clinton's International Monetary Fund lax policies toward South Korea. In early 1998, he was a serious contender for the 2000 United States presidential election, but his campaign possibilities faltered, and he instead endorsed eventual winner George W. Bush. [...] Kemp continued his political advocacy for reform of taxation, Social Security and education. When a 1997 budget surplus was earmarked for debt repayment, Kemp opposed the plan in favor of tax cuts. Along with John Ashcroft and Alan Krueger, he endorsed reform of payroll taxes to eliminate double taxation. In addition to his fiscal and economic policies, Kemp advocated <b>against</b> <b>abortion</b> when Congress was considering a bill banning intact dilation and extractions. He also advocated for retired NFL veterans {{on issues such as}} cardiovascular screening, assisted living, disability benefits, and the 2007 joint replacement program. He argued in support of reforming immigration laws. In the late 1990s, Kemp also was a vocal advocate for free market reform in Africa, arguing that the continent had great economic growth potential if it could shed autocratic and statist governmental policies.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{national}} [...] politicians recognized that {{a focus on}} reducing access to abortion was not a winning political strategy. Some anti-abortion activists grew more aggressive and violent {{in the face of}} political abandonment, culminating with the murder of Dr. David Gunn in 1993 and the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1994. With direct action discredited, anti-abortion organizations, including the National Right to Life Committee, came to the forefront of the movement. These focused on legal tactics, including lobbying against late-term abortions and access to mifepristone and demanding legislation based on the purported ABC link. More recently, anti-abortion organizations have turned to lobbying to increase obstacles to abortion, such as mandated counseling, waiting periods, and parental notification, and some feel that anti-abortion advocates treat ABC as simply another tactic in their campaign <b>against</b> <b>abortion.</b> There have been ongoing and incremental legal challenges to abortion in the United States by anti-abortion groups. In 2005, a Canadian anti-abortion organization put up billboards in Alberta with large pink ribbons and the statement: [...] "Stop the Cover-Up," [...] in reference to the ABC hypothesis. The Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation was concerned by the misrepresentation of the state of scientific knowledge on the subject.|$|E
