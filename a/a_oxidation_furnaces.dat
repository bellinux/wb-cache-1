After the deposition of the Ni films, they were placed in <b>a</b> thermal <b>oxidation</b> <b>furnace</b> at different temperatures (400, 500, 600, 700, and 1000 °C), resulting in mean crystallite sizes between 6 nm and 40 nm.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 106 - 110). The increased {{usage of}} titanium and its alloys in {{the aerospace industry}} and for biomedical applications {{has been attributed to}} its good strength to weight ratio, exceptional corrosion resistance and high melting point. In this research the titanium alloy that was focused on is the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (by weight) alloy. With these good properties the alloys are also susceptible to poor tribological property behaviour. Surface engineering processes help improve these poor properties and one such process is known as Oxygen Boost Diffusion Hardening (OBDH). The OBDH process is a two-step process. The first step involves oxidation of the samples in air at elevated temperatures and the second step is carried out in order to diffusion treat the pre-oxidised specimens in a vacuum or argon environment. This was done using different oxygen and diffusion step temperatures and times. A comparison of the different fatigue lives after the treatments was made using the untreated specimen as the yardstick. The specimens were heat treated, in <b>an</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>furnace</b> for the first stage and a controlled atmosphere furnace for the second stage. Thereafter, a rotational bending machine was used for the fatigue testing where fatigue failure data was obtained. For assistance in fully analysing the fatigue data; hardness tests, microstructural analysis and fracture morphology were undertaken and quantified...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{performed}} in the NASA Glenn Research Centers Heated Tube Facility to study the heat transfer and thermal stability behavior of RP- 2 under conditions {{similar to those found}} in rocket engine cooling channels. It has long been known that hydrocarbon fuels, such as RP- 2, can decompose at high temperature to form deposits (coke) which can adversely impact rocket engine cooling channel performance. The heated tube facility provides a simple means to study these effects. Using resistively heated copper tubes in a vacuum chamber, flowing RP- 2 was heated to explore thermal effects at a range of test conditions. Wall temperature (850 - 1050 F) and bulk fluid temperature (300 - 500 F) were varied to define thermal decomposition and stability at each condition. Flow velocity and pressure were fixed at 75 fts and 1000 psia, respectively. Additionally, five different batches of RP- 2 were tested at identical conditions to examine any thermal stability differences resulting from batch to batch compositional variation. Among these tests was one with a potential coke reducing additive known as 1, 2, 3, 4 -Tetrahydroquinoline (THQ). While copper tubes were used for the majority of tests, two exploratory tests were performed with a copper alloy known as GRCop- 42. Each tube was instrumented with 15 thermocouples to examine the temperature profile, and carbon deposition at each thermocouple location was determined post-test in <b>an</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>furnace.</b> In many tests, intermittent local temperature increases were observed visually and in the thermocouple data. These hot spots did not appear to correspond with a higher carbon deposition...|$|R
50|$|Bomb liner {{material}} received from Plant 5 in mobile hoppers was emptied at an unloading station and elevated to a surge hopper. Material as needed was sent from the surge hopper through a jaw crusher and into <b>a</b> shelf type <b>oxidation</b> <b>furnace.</b> Here the metallic uranium was oxidized to triuranium octoxide (U3O8). The material {{discharged from the}} furnace was lifted to a surge hopper and then as needed was sent through a roll mill and ground to -325 mesh size. It was then fed into carbon brick digestion tanks where the uranium was dissolved in hydrochloric acid containing a little sodium chlorate. The undissolved solids were filtered off and dumped into a truck, which hauls the spent material to a scrap dump. Uranium in the filtrate {{was sent to a}} precipitation tank and precipitated with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), in presence of phosphoric acid to form UAP (uranyl ammonium phosphate). The resulting slurry was filtered and the uranium bearing cake was introduced to a drying furnace. The dried UAP was sent to the refinery. In addition to the wet system described, several furnaces were installed in the plant for massive metal oxidation, pyrohydrolysis, drying, chip and sludge combustion, etc. Most of the furnaces can be used for more than one of the above operations.|$|R

40|$|A new on-line {{analytical}} {{setup for}} N- 15 measurements of total dissolved nitrogen (MN) {{has been developed}} through the coupling of a high-temperature catalytic (Ce(IV) O- 2) <b>oxidation</b> <b>furnace,</b> <b>a</b> Cu reduction furnace, and an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The detection limit for accurate delta N- 15 measurements is 20 mg of N L- 1. For N-containing compounds dissolved in water, a standard deviation on N concentration measurements of 0. 2 mg of N L- 1, independent of N concentration, has been found. Reproducibility on delta N- 15 increased with increasing N concentration, with standard deviations varying from 0. 8 to 0. 1 %o {{in the range of}} 20 - 100 mg of N L- 1. Salt matrixes, in which the N species might be dissolved, could influence the analysis capacity and continuity, mainly at concentrations above 0. 1 M.

Potential applications are large and are believed to result in an increased insight in N cycling and dissolved organic nitrogen behavior in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} the oxidation method by atomic oxygen for the gate oxide formation in the SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. A mixture gas of oxygen (O 2) / ozone (O 3) molecules is introduced into the <b>oxidation</b> <b>furnace,</b> where the atomic oxygen was formed by thermal decomposition of the O 3 molecules at elevated sample temperatures. Oxide growth rate (rox) during the oxidation process by the O 3 admixing gas {{is found to be}} the maximum around 5 Torr at 950 - 1200 oC, although the rox by pure O 2 gas reveals the negligible rox value below 50 Torr at the same temperatures. This indicates that only atomic oxygen can contribute to form the oxide layer below 50 Torr. Based on these results, MOS capacitors were fabricated at various temperatures maintaining the constant ambient pressure of 5 Torr. Interface trapped density (Dit) evaluated by high-low capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements is found to largely depend on the oxidation temperature. The oxidation at 1200 oC results in the significant reduction of the Dit. Consequently, the Dit near conduction band edge was reduced in the oxidation of atomic oxygen with compared to that of O 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} ageing for thin Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) using active thermography. As TBCs undergo ageing during their service life, sintering changes the porosity, elements migrate from the substrate, and micro-cracks build up {{in the structure of}} the material, exhibiting a change in thermal conductivity and diffusion properties. As the material ages and these properties change over time, it is possible to exploit trends in this change for characterisation of coating ageing, which would provide a diagnostics tool to estimate remaining useful life. In this study, through-depth diffusivity measurement has been applied to thin EB-PVD coatings which are artificially aged via <b>oxidation</b> <b>furnace</b> cycles. In order to address the difficulties of capturing a fast thermal event in a thin coating, a novel parametric study approach has been carried out to optimise data capture and analysis, maximising available frames for the model fitting step. Through-depth diffusivities have been measured during ageing for six samples, yielding a repeatable trend in thermal diffusivity measurements, with three features, which can be exploited for ageing characterisation of thin EB-PVD TBCs, and used as an alarm of imminent failure...|$|R
