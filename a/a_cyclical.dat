This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs <b>a</b> <b>cyclical</b> pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing on their own (or blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the long period of neglect of Schubert's piano sonatas seems to be their {{dismissal}} as structurally and dramatically inferior to the sonatas of Beethoven. In fact, the last sonatas contain distinct allusions and similarities to works by Beethoven, a composer Schubert venerated. However, musicological analysis has shown that they maintain a mature, individual style. Schubert's last sonatas are now praised for that mature style, manifested in unique features such as <b>a</b> <b>cyclical</b> formal and tonal design, chamber music textures, and a rare depth of emotional expression.|$|E

5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes <b>a</b> <b>cyclical</b> process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} their individual fitness, workers will try to reduce the reproduction of other wasps. This is known as worker policing. As previously mentioned, workers will attempt to suppress other workers. Worker policing also plays {{a large role in}} modulating the number of queens per colony. <b>As</b> <b>cyclical</b> oligogyny progresses, new queens will attempt to assert their dominance after the death of the old queens. Any worker could be morphologically able to function as a new queen, but the number of new queens is restricted by workers as they aggressively interact with potential new queens. This suppresses the development of the female’s ovaries, preventing her from becoming queen.|$|R
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants <b>a</b> <b>cyclical,</b> weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

25|$|One dispute {{which has}} never been finally {{resolved}} is whether the TRPF should be interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>cyclical</b> tendency, or as a secular long run trend.

In contrast to this view, Anwar Shaikh from the New School in New York City has argued that Marx meant the TRPF as a secular long run trend. <b>A</b> <b>cyclical</b> tendency and a long-run tendency could also be combined in one theory, where a series of cycles shows a gradual fall in the average rate of profit, despite an upturn in each cycle.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend our {{understanding}} of government behavior in the area of regional economic policy for the case of the Netherlands. The study seeks to investigate systematically the role of economic and political factors in determining changes in the implementation of regional economic policy. It is concluded that political circumstances did not play any discernible role in regional policymaking, and that the influence of economic circumstances on regional policymaking has been dominated by a secular trend. <b>A</b> short-run <b>cyclical</b> influence is found for qualitative changes in the policy package; for quantitative changes in the amount of financial resources devoted to policymaking only the actual expenditures appear to possess <b>a</b> consistent <b>cyclical</b> component...|$|R

25|$|There is a {{complicated}} relationship between prospective memory and time management skills which include making lists, scheduling activities, and avoiding interruptions. Studies have not identified distinct cause and effect relationships between prospective memory and time management, but many consistent correlations have been observed. For example, people who reported better prospective memory according to the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) also indicated a higher likelihood of setting goals and priorities and being more organized. There may be <b>a</b> <b>cyclical</b> effect between prospective memory and time management: better memory may lead to better organization, and better organization may further lead to better memory.|$|E
25|$|In younger women, {{during a}} normal menstrual cycle the ovaries produce estradiol, {{testosterone}} and progesterone in <b>a</b> <b>cyclical</b> pattern {{under the control}} of FSH and luteinising hormone (LH) which are both produced by the pituitary gland. During perimenopause (approaching menopause), estradiol levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular. The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by inhibin. Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{children}} forced into begging primarily receive little to no education, with upwards of sixteen hours a day dedicated to time on the streets. With education being a leading method in escaping poverty child beggars {{have been shown to}} engage in <b>a</b> <b>cyclical</b> process of continuing this practice cross-generationally. Interviews conducted by UNICEF show that children who beg have little hope for the future and do not believe their circumstances will improve. Children who work on the streets typically have little or no knowledge of their rights, leaving them especially susceptible to exploitation both as juveniles and later as adults. Children who beg have also been found by UNICEF to have much higher instances of HIV-infection due to lack of awareness and supervision on the streets.|$|E
