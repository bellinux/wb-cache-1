40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of John Loving's search for God <b>and</b> <b>love</b> in Eugene O'Neill's play, Days Without End. Through John's efforts to search for God <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> <b>and</b> his {{multiple}} personality, the writer {{is trying to find}} out his need of God <b>and</b> <b>love.</b> The writer is curious about the way he searches God <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> <b>and</b> how he finds Him <b>and</b> his <b>love.</b> The writer is also interested in John's attitude towards God <b>and</b> <b>love</b> after he has multiple personality. From the analysis, it can be seen clearly that he fails to get a lasting faith since he is not capable of getting the truth outside the Truth' of God's love. He also tries to express his <b>love</b> <b>and</b> his need of Father Baird's love through all his letters to him, <b>and</b> get Elsa's <b>love</b> <b>and</b> restore her faith in <b>love</b> <b>and</b> marriage through his idea of the ideal marriage. Meanwhile, as his split off personality, Loving, born from John's disappointment, anger and hatred of the loss of God of <b>Love</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> does anything to kill John's faith in Him <b>and</b> His <b>love,</b> <b>and</b> destroy John's <b>love</b> <b>and</b> ones whom he loves. After his realization, he fights against Loving's evil and hateful spirit in order to find Him <b>and</b> <b>love</b> again. Therefore, through his efforts to find Him <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> John's need of God <b>and</b> <b>love</b> is vividly revealed...|$|R

He is represented in Scripture as being primarily concerned with people and their salvation.|$|E
