25|$|At Briarcliff, Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) takes Lana's secret {{notes about}} the asylum. Lana retorts {{that she can}} still {{remember}} {{what has happened to}} her, prompting Sister Jude to <b>ask</b> <b>Dr.</b> Arden (James Cromwell) to give Lana electroshock treatment. Asked to assist in administering the electroshock, Sister Jude is disturbed by the violence of the resulting treatment. In the woods, Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe) asks Dr. Arden to tell her the identity of the creatures in the woods who savagely eat the meat she prepares for them. Later, Shelley (Chloë Sevigny) offers herself to Dr. Arden in return for fifteen minutes outside. He rebuffs her, calling her a slut and a whore, leading Shelley to argue that women face a double standard with their sexuality, and that she was committed by her promiscuous husband who hypocritically forbade her from engaging in extramarital sex.|$|E
500|$|According to Vox writer Lauren Williams, the {{character}} reinforces [...] "that pursuing such a demanding career {{and having a}} family were not mutually exclusive", seldom hesitating to challenge anyone who doubts her ability to maintain both. For example, in the season one episode [...] "How Ugly Is He?", Clair responds to a sexist statement made by Denise's then-boyfriend David about Clair's decision to work as opposed to remaining home to raise the children with [...] "Why don’t you <b>ask</b> <b>Dr.</b> Huxtable that question?" [...] This exchange {{would serve as a}} preface to future, more prominent confrontations Clair would have with Sondra's chauvinistic boyfriend Elvin, who is introduced in the following season in the episode [...] "Cliff in Love", during which Elvin wrongly perceives Clair offering him and Cliff a cup of coffee as an act of servitude. Clair promptly corrects Elvin {{in the form of a}} rant that explains the equal roles of a married husband and wife; Jason Bailey of Slate compared Clair's speech to Gloria Stivic arguing about feminist politics with her father Archie Bunker in the sitcom All in the Family. However, when Cliff voices his preference for Daryl, a young man competing for Sondra's affection, over Elvin due to the former's more progressive opinions about women, Clair defends Elvin, reminding Cliff that he once shared Elvin's views and ideas before Clair ultimately changed him for the better. Despite their differences, Clair is willing to accept Elvin with confidence that his primitive opinions about women will eventually change, and is never shown to be mistreating him. Bailey concluded, [...] "If The Cosby Show’s racial politics were merely implied, its gender politics were clear, pointed, and decidedly progressive." ...|$|E
