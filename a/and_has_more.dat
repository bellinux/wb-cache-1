5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Akodon boliviensis group, {{including}} A.caenosus, {{are generally}} similar {{and difficult to}} separate, but they differ in relative cranial measurements and some other characters. A.spegazzinii is larger than A.caenosus; A.sylvanus is darker and has less contrast between the upper- and underparts and less well-developed eye-rings; A.polopi has a squared interorbital region and more well-developed ridges on its skull; and A.boliviensis is paler <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> densely furred ears.|$|E

5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of {{the sites}} where fossils of A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> roots under the molars, {{as shown by the}} preserved alveoli.|$|E

5|$|Another {{mushroom}} {{that grows}} on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, which {{is distinct from}} C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith has noted a general similarity in appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea is larger than C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> distantly spaced gills.|$|E
5|$|De sacramento altaris, {{dealing with}} the eucharist and passover, is Baldwin's longest {{surviving}} work, in 12manuscripts. It also includes a discussion of martyrdom that reads much like a vindication of Becket's status as a martyr. It was first printed in 1662, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> recently been edited and published in the series Sources Chrétiennes, as volumes 93 and 94, in 1963. Others works include 22 sermons, and a work on faith, De commendatione fidei, that only survives in two manuscripts, although another five {{are known to have}} existed. One of the missing manuscripts survived until at least the mid-1600s, as it formed the basis of the first printed edition of De commendatione fidei in 1662. The modern critical edition of De commendatione was published, along with the sermons, in 1991 as Balduini de Forda Opera: Sermones, De Commendatione Fidei. with the De commendatione fidei translated into English in 2000.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth.

5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E
5|$|Le Carrefour de l'Arbre (or Pavé de Luchin) is {{the last}} section of pavé of the hardest level of difficulty, five stars. The {{crossroads}} (carrefour) is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The route departs westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the rue de Cysoing towards Camphin de l'Arbre. The first half {{is a series of}} corners, then along irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half finishes at the Café de l'Arbre restaurant <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> even pavé. This 2.1km sector has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix (15km) and cumulative difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus tao is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus from the Pleistocene of Zhoukoudian in China. It is known {{from a number}} of mandibles (lower jaws), which were {{initially}} identified as the living species Miniopterus schreibersii in 1963 before being recognized as a separate species, M. tao, in 1986. Miniopterus tao is larger than living M. schreibersii <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> closely spaced lower premolars and more robust talonids (back groups of cusps) on the lower molars. The back part of the mandible is relatively low and on it, the coronoid and condyloid processes are about equally high. The average length of the mandible is 12.0mm.|$|E

5|$|Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata) is also rufescent {{and very}} similar to M. rufobrunnea. It is found in mountainous forests and maquis and forms a marked sinus at the {{attachment}} of the cap with the stem, which is pure white. At maturity, it develops more or less parallel, ladderlike interconnecting ridges. Microscopically, it often has moniliform paraphyses with septa extending in the upper half <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> regularly cylindrical or clavate 'hairs' on the stem, up to 100 μm long. M.guatemalensis, found in Central America, has a color ranging from yellow to yellowish-orange, but never grey, {{and it has a}} more distinct reddish to wine red bruising reaction. Microscopically, it has smaller paraphyses, measuring 56–103 by 6.5–13µm. The New Guinean species M.rigidoides has smaller fruit bodies that are pale ochre to yellow, without any grey. Its pits are less elongated than those of M.rufobrunnea, and it has wider paraphyses, up to 30µm.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} tyres {{for passenger}} cars, SUVs, and vans. Nokian branded tyres {{are sold in}} over 60 countries. Nokian Tyres designed the first winter tyres in 1934 <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> winter tyre patents than any other manufacturer. Nokian Tyres {{is known for its}} winter tyres, {{not to be confused with}} all-season tyres. Nokian winter tyres have been described as a favourite of critics and have been well received in winter test results by several publications. Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance, offering lower fuel consumption. Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year-round use by having different tread patterns on the lateral and medial aspect of the tread. One pattern is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all-season pattern.|$|E
5|$|Observations of the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} in life {{indicate that}} they were highly territorial. They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists. Fractures in their wing bones also {{indicate that they}} were used in combat. It has also been suggested that these fractures {{may have been the}} result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries. But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} been called both a {{platform}} game and an action-adventure game. GameSpot asserts that it combines elements of ToeJam & Earl and its platformer sequel, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, while GameNOW and Electronic Gaming Monthly liken it to the former game. The game features both single- and two-player modes; in both, players control {{one of the three}} protagonists. ToeJam moves quickly and jumps high, but has weak attacks; Earl is tougher <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> powerful attacks, but is slow and jumps lower than ToeJam; Latisha ranks between the two in terms of athleticism, and gains additional power-ups later in the game. In the game's two-player mode, the camera moves between single and split-screen as players maneuver their characters away from each other. Characters can share power-ups when in close proximity.|$|E
