5|$|Christchurch's {{town centre}} {{encompasses}} {{a mixture of}} traditional public houses, restaurants, coffee shops, antiquated cottages and historic listed buildings. The older part of the town dates from Saxon times and retains its Saxon street layout. The Grade II listed Mayor's Parlour was built as the market hall in 1745 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the High Street but was moved to its present position in 1849. It was enclosed and extended, and used as the town hall until the civic offices {{were built in the}} mid-1970s. It was restored to its former condition circa 1982 when the Saxon Square shopping precinct was built.|$|E
5|$|The Arch of Caracalla {{is one of}} Volubilis' most {{distinctive}} sights, situated {{at the end of}} the city's main street, the Decumanus Maximus. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city's governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome's provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper.|$|E

5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads {{of male and female}} flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona I {{planted a}} pair of royal fig trees <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade {{are believed to be}} imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away the sins of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{along the}} lower Little Tennessee, lower Tellico, and lower Hiwassee rivers, the Overhill towns rose to {{prominence}} within the Cherokee Nation {{in the early}} 18th century, when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists. In {{the early part of}} the century, the Overhill towns' remote location <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Trading Path meant they were reached only by those traders and explorers adventurous enough to make the difficult journey to the interior over the mountain range. By the middle of the century, the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries, as the two powers struggled for the control of the continent and the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
5|$|The five division-size bridgeheads {{consolidated}} {{themselves on}} Monday, October 8 into two army-size bridgeheads: the Second Army with its three divisions occupied El-Qantarah {{in the north}} to Deversoir in the south, while the Third Army with two divisions occupied {{the southern end of}} the Bitter Lakes to a point southeast of Port Tawfiq (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the canal). These two bridgeheads incorporated a total of 90,000 men and 980 tanks, dug in and entrenched. Each division deployed, in accordance with Operation Badr, two infantry brigades in its forward echelon, and one mechanized infantry brigade in the second echelon. In reserve was one armored brigade. The Egyptians had established anti-tank defences along their lines employing Sagger ATGMs, RPGs, B-10 and B-11 anti tank recoilless rifles.|$|E

5|$|The {{gardens are}} Grade II* {{listed on the}} Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The gardens of the house were also created {{in line with the}} Arts and Crafts movement, {{providing}} food for the house. Influenced strongly by Margaret Bidulph, who had studied at Studley Horticultural College, where she had met her future head gardener William Scrubey. Scrubey and Margaret Biddulph would go on to plant the gardens together. The terrace and gardens south to the south of the house include yew hedges to create specific spaces, mixed with Portuguese laurels and roses, giving the impression of exterior rooms next to the house. Nearby is an area of topiary, clipped in domes and tiers. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the south terrace is a ha-ha, leading to a cherry orchard and tennis courts, although only one tennis court remains, the others have been converted in a croquet lawn and a swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, 1862, Colonel Crook's 3rd Brigade routed rebel {{infantry}} in {{a conflict}} where the shooting lasted for only 27 minutes. Rebel casualties were 72 men killed, over 100 wounded, and 157 men taken prisoner. They also lost four cannon, 300 small weapons, and 25 horses. Crook's brigade lost 13 killed, 50 wounded (including Crook, who {{was shot in the}} foot), and 6 missing. The feat was accomplished by taking advantage of aggressive rebel soldiers and a hostile town. Crook had learned that a large rebel infantry under the command of General Henry Heth was moving toward Lewisburg. Crook positioned his brigade <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the town, and sent a small group of pickets to the opposite end where the rebels would approach. Heth's rebels raced into town after the pickets, urged on by the pro-rebel local population. The rebels were quickly ambushed in a short action that ended after a charge by Union infantry and cavalry. The 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry battalion had been held out of the fighting, but was used to chase the fleeing rebels. The rebels escaped by burning the Greenbrier Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The North Mere is 5.6-acres (2.25 ha) large, and {{is blocked}} off on its {{northern}} end by a sod-cast bank, {{adjacent to the}} site of the North Gate. The southern half takes the form of a 331-foot (101 m) long moat, which was recorded as being 18-foot (5.5 m) deep in the medieval period, terminating in the West Gate. The northern part of this mere occasionally floods in the 21st century, creating a temporary lake, and the moated section usually still contains some standing water. The West Mere, covering 2.25-acres (1 ha), stretches away from the location of West Gate and is blocked at the far end by a small, stone dam. Three rectangular fishponds were built alongside the West Mere, the smallest, probably a stew pond for raising young fish, being fed with water from the lake. A protective earthen bank, probably originally reinforced by a timber palisade, ran for approximately 490 feet (150 m) along either side of the West Gate, where a gatehouse was probably built. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the lake complex was the South Mere, 2.25-acres (1 ha) in size, with the South Gate positioned in its eastern corner.|$|E
