5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east. The state did not add traffic lights to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> route number until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> route at its south end.|$|E
5|$|After {{having been}} {{temporarily}} incapacitated by several severe health problems, President Dwight D. Eisenhower attempted to clarify procedures through <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon, drafted by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr.. However, this agreement {{did not have}} legal authority. Eisenhower {{suffered a heart attack}} in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each time until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public that the situation was under control. However, Nixon never made any effort to formally assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E
5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E

5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, botany {{had been taken}} up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence. On the recommendation of John Lindley, Darwin wrote to Lady Dorothy Nevill, who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> photograph of him to hang in her sitting room next to portraits of her other notable friends, including Hooker.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|Crofts {{is a fan}} of Chelsea and at {{one time}} shared a flat with the club's future captain John Terry. During his time as captain of Gillingham, he was {{involved}} with a number of charity events, including acting as a celebrity waiter at a Gillingham pub and presenting <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> shirt to a brain damaged teenage fan. In January 2005, he dedicated a match-winning goal to his grandmother Lily, who had died several months earlier.|$|E

5000|$|Lester S. King, {{author of}} Medical Thinking, argues that an [...] "essential feature" [...] of <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> {{is that there}} is both <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "signifier" [...] and a [...] "thing signified". And, because [...] "the essence of <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> is to convey information", it can only be <b>a</b> <b>sign,</b> {{properly}} speaking, if it has meaning. Therefore, [...] "a sign ceases to be <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> when you cannot read it". A person, who has and exercises the knowledge required to understand the significance or indication or meaning of the sign, is necessary for something to be <b>a</b> complete <b>sign.</b> <b>A</b> physical phenomenon that is not actually interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> pointing to something else is, in medicine, merely a symptom. Thus, King rejects [...] "these present-day views signs from symptoms based on patient-subjective versus clinician-objective, however widely accepted, as quite faulty, at variance not only with ordinary usage but with the entire history of medicine." ...|$|R
5|$|Enterprise {{has also}} been {{released}} as part of model lines. These include a 350:1 scale replica of the CGI model by QMx. It features more than 150 LEDs, sound effects and <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> plaque by Doug Drexler. Each QMx model takes 150 hours to make and was limited to a production run of 1,000 units. QMx also produced the models seen in Star Trek Into Darkness, including the one of Enterprise. Enterprise {{has also been}} released as a model kit by Round 2 Models {{as part of their}} Polar Lights line. These include both the version seen in the television series, and the refit design intended for season five.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Elbridge to Rochester via Fairport. Initially, Route20 entered the village on High Street and followed Main Street south across the Erie Canal to Church Street, where it turned west toward Rochester. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to enter Monroe County on modern NY31. At {{the junction of}} Palmyra and Moseley Roads, Route20 turned north, following SH1290 into Fairport. It rejoined its original alignment at the junction of Church and Main Streets. None of SH1290 received <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> designation when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew {{himself from}} all {{political}} activities {{and went into}} hiding at Chandannagar {{in the house of}} Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E

5|$|Medical fitness to dive is {{the medical}} and {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> statement by the diver {{that he or she}} does not suffer from any of the disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.|$|E

5|$|Most of NY13 between Caton and Big Flats was county-maintained {{as part of}} CR120 in Steuben County and as CR7 in Chemung County. East of the Fitch Bridge, {{however, the}} road had been state-maintained since 1912 as part of SH946. In the early 1940s, NY13 was {{truncated}} on its southern end to downtown Elmira, leaving the Caton–Big Flats highway without <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> state route designation. The county-maintained parts of the road remained designated as CR120 in Steuben County and CR7 in Chemung County, while the short state-owned segment in Big Flats eventually became part of an unsigned reference route extending from Golden Glow Heights Drive to Water Street (modern NY352).|$|E
5|$|NY185 was {{assigned}} on April4, 2008, as <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> replacement for New York State Route910L, an unsigned reference route.

NY185 originally connected to the Champlain Bridge on its east end; however, that structure was closed and demolished in late 2009. Its replacement opened to traffic in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|NY192 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to an alignment extending from Paul Smiths to Bloomingdale.
