5|$|Darryl Sutter {{engineered}} <b>a</b> <b>seven</b> player {{trade at}} the end of January that sent Dion Phaneuf and Fredrik Sjostrom to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for four players led by Matt Stajan, Ian White and Niklas Hagman. The deal ended weeks of speculation about the Calgary defenceman's future amid reports that Phaneuf had requested a trade – a claim he had denied. One day later, the Flames sent Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust to the New York Rangers in exchange for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins. The deals resulted in the change of over one third of the roster in the period of a day, moves that were seen as a sign of panic as the Flames hovered around the final playoff spot. While rumours circulated that Phaneuf was dealt because he was a divisive influence in the locker room, Jokinen later blamed the fans in Calgary for the defenceman's departure. Jokinen admitted that he was traded because he failed to produce in Calgary, while in Kotalik, the Flames received a player who was having a similarly disappointing season in New York.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas studied an AH-64B, {{featuring}} {{an updated}} cockpit, new fire control system and other upgrades. In 1988, funding was approved for a multi-stage upgrade program to improve sensor and weapon systems. Technological advance {{led to the}} program's cancellation {{in favor of more}} ambitious changes. In August 1990, development of the AH-64D Apache Longbow was approved by the Defense Acquisition Board. The first AH-64D prototype flew on 15 April 1992, prototype testing ended in April 1995. During testing, six AH-64D helicopters were pitted against a numerically superior group of AH-64A helicopters; the results demonstrated the AH-64D to have <b>a</b> <b>seven</b> times increase in survivability and four times increase in lethality compared to the AH-64A. On 13 October 1995, full-scale production was approved; a $1.9-billion five-year contract was signed in August 1996 to rebuild 232 AH-64As to AH-64D standard.

5|$|From the 1885 season, all of Newton's {{first-class}} appearances {{were made}} for either Middlesex or the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's in St John's Wood, London. Having {{been a member of}} the MCC since 1878, Newton made his debut for the club in first-class competition against Nottinghamshire in May 1885. He appeared for the club five times during 1885. In contrast to his time at Somerset, he did not restrict himself to playing only during late-July and August. Playing for the side against Lancashire, Newton made his highest total in first-class cricket, scoring 86 in the second-innings of the match. This score was the only half-century that Newton scored for a side other than Somerset. Newton appeared three times for Middlesex during 1885, for whom he qualified under the residential criterion. He averaged 5.33 for the county with the bat, and did not appear again after 1885. He appeared once for the MCC in first-class cricket in each of the 1887, 1888, 1889 and 1890 seasons, after which he did not play first-class cricket again. His final first-class match was in May 1890 when he scored 1 and 21 during <b>a</b> <b>seven</b> wicket loss to Lancashire.|$|E

It was called De Vegetabilibus (c. 1256 AD) and even though based on original observations and plant descriptions it bore a close resemblance to the earlier Greek, Roman and Arabic herbals.

On March 6, 2000, the Boston Bruins traded future Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk to Colorado for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Samuel Pahlsson and a first round draft pick. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since 1979, requested a trade to a contender for a chance to win the Stanley Cup.

Poor performances from Botham and Mike Gatting's injury ensured an easy series win for the West Indies. England’s attitude also {{played a part in}} their defeat with big players such as Gower and Botham showing a certain reluctance to net training. The then chairman of selectors Peter May questioned the team's attitude and called for greater resolve, a view that seemed to be shared by the general public at the time.|$|E
