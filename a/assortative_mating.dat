25|$|White Kermode {{bears are}} not albinos. Rather, a single, non-synonymous {{nucleotide}} substitution in the MC1R gene causes melanin {{to not be}} produced. This mutant gene is recessive, so Kermode bears with two copies of this mutant, nonfunctional gene appear white, while bears with one copy or no copies appear black. It is possible for two black bears to mate and produce a white cub if both of these black bears are heterozygous, carrying one copy of the mutant MC1R gene, and both mutant genes are inherited by the cub. Additional genetic studies found that white Kermode bears breed more with white Kermode bears, and black Kermode bears breed more with black Kermode bears, in a phenomenon known as positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> One hypothesis is that this happens because young bears imprint on their mother's fur color.|$|E
40|$|Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) exhibit extreme {{differences}} in coloration of skin, eggs and flesh due to genetic polymorphisms affecting carotenoid deposition, where colour {{can range from}} white to bright red. A sympatric population of red and white Chinook salmon occurs in the Quesnel River, British Columbia, where frequencies of each phenotype are relatively equal. In our study, we examined evolutionary mechanisms responsible {{for the maintenance of}} the morphs, where we first tested whether morphs were reproductively isolated using microsatellite genotyping, and second, using breeding trials in seminatural spawning channels, we tested whether colour <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> choice could be operating to maintain the polymorphism in nature. Next, given extreme difference in carotenoid assimilation and the importance of carotenoids to immune function, we examined mate choice and selection between colour morphs at immune genes (major histocompatibility complex genes: MHC I-A 1 and MHC II-B 1). In our study, red and white individuals were found to interbreed, and under seminatural conditions, some degree of colour <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> choice (71 % of matings) was observed. We found significant genetic differences at both MHC genes between morphs, but no evidence of MHC II-B 1 -based mate choice. White individuals were more heterozygous at MHC II-B 1 compared with red individuals, and morphs showed significant allele frequency differences at MHC I-A 1. Although colour <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> choice is likely not a primary mechanism maintaining the polymorphisms in the population, our results suggest that selection is operating differentially at immune genes in red and white Chinook salmon, possibly due to {{differences in}} carotenoid utilization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBehavioural {{processes}} such as species {{recognition and}} mate attraction signals enforce and reinforce the reproductive isolation required for speciation. The earthworm Lumbricus rubellus in the UK is deeply differentiated into two major genetic lineages, ‘A’ and ‘B’. These are often sympatric at certain sites, {{but it is not}} known whether they are to some extent reproductively isolated. Behavioural tests were performed, in which individually genotyped worms were able to choose between soils previously worked either by genetically similar or dissimilar individuals (N =  45). We found that individuals (75 %) were significantly (P <  0. 05) more likely to orientate towards the soil conditioned by worms of their own lineage. Further testing involved a choice design based on filter papers wetted with water extracts of soils worked by a different genotype on each side (N =  18) or extracts from worked soil vs. un-worked control soil (N =  10). Again, earthworms orientated towards the extract from their kindred genotype (P <  0. 05). These findings indicate that genotype-specific water-soluble chemicals are released by L.  rubellus; furthermore, they are behaviour-modifying, and play a role in reproductive isolation between sympatric earthworm lineages of cryptic sibling species, through pre-copulatory <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> choice...|$|R

Thus the two species can viably hybridize, and occasionally do so at the contact zone, but the all-black carrion crows on the one side of the contact zone mate almost exclusively with other all-black carrion crows, while the same occurs among the hooded crows {{on the other side of}} the contact zone.

40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) {{plays a crucial role}} in the immune system, and in some species, it is a target by which individuals choose mates to optimize the fitness of their offspring, potentially mediated by olfactory cues. Under the genetic compatibility hypothesis, individuals are predicted to choose mates with compatible MHC alleles, to increase the fitness of their offspring. Studies of MHC-based mate choice in wild mammals are under-represented currently, and few investigate more than one class of MHC genes. We investigated mate choice based on the compatibility of MHC class I and II genes in a wild population of European badgers (Meles meles). We also investigated mate choice based on microsatellite-derived pairwise relatedness, to attempt to distinguish MHC-specific effects from genomewide effects. We found MHC-assortative mating, based on MHC class II, but not class I genes. Parent pairs had smaller MHC class II DRB amino acid distances and smaller functional distances than expected from random pairings. When we separated the analyses into within-group and neighbouring-group parent pairs, only neighbouring-group pairs showed MHC-assortative mating, due to similarity at MHC class II loci. Our randomizations showed no evidence of genomewide-based inbreeding, based on 35 microsatellite loci; MHC class II similarity was therefore the apparent target of mate choice. We propose that MHC-assortative mate choice may be a local adaptation to endemic pathogens, and this <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> choice may have contributed to the low MHC genetic diversity in this population...|$|R
40|$|While many {{models have}} {{investigated}} the role of competitive mate selection processes in human marriage, few have addressed the potential for assortative processes to explain the observed demographics, as well as simultaneously investigating divorce. To explore the possibility that <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> selection processes may explain patterns of both marriage and divorce, we developed an agent-based model, MADAM (Marriage and Divorce Annealing Model), based on homophilic trait matching, in which individuals search for mates similar to themselves, but relax these expectations as they age. MADAM assumes individuals {{live in a world}} with N mate-relevant traits, where each individual chooses a set of k traits from those N to represent his or her identity. Individuals seek marriage partners with some number of identical traits, but over time relax their expectations for this desired threshold number of matching traits. Divorce is allowed when individuals find a partner who shares more traits with them than their current partner. With this implementation, we explored how population heterogeneity and individual differences affect population-level demographic trends, finding that increasing population heterogeneity and a reduction in the rate of relaxing expectations can both increase the mean age at first marriage. MADAM also accurately predicts demographic marriage and divorce data across cultures, with quantitatively accurate predictions for length of first marriage, likelihood of first marriage ending in divorce, and percent of population married {{by the end of the}} lifespan.

40|$|Mitochondrial {{and nuclear}} DNA {{information}} was analysed among four subspecies of the African Queen butterfly, Danaus (Anosia) chrysippus sensu lato (s. l.), along {{with four other}} Danaus species drawn from all three subgenera (D. (Danaus) plexippus, D. (Salatura) genutia, D. (A.) gilippus, D. (A.) eresimus) and two outgroup species from the same tribe, Tirumala septentrionis and Amauris niavius. A mitochondrial phylogeny derived from the 12 S rRNA (347 bp) and COI (537 bp) loci indicates two very distinct haplotypes for subspecies D. (A.) c. dorippus, dorippus- 1 and dorippus- 2. Interestingly, dorippus- 1, on the one hand, and all other D. (A.) chrysippus haplotypes, on the other, are the most distantly related clades within the genus and have different most recent ancestors from different subgenera, though sharing the common ancestor of the monophyletic genus. A phylogeny based on the EF 1 - nuclear locus (400 bp) shows that the two well-separated mitochondrial lineages of dorippus are identical for this gene and reciprocally monophyletic to the other D. (A.) chrysippus lineages. Thus, nuclear and cytoplasmic phylogenies are not only discordant, but also suggest that both D. (A.) chrysippus s. l. and subspecies dorippus are polyphyletic. Paradoxically, four African subspecies, chrysippus-orange, chrysippus-brown, alcippus and dorippus, though substantially vicariant, hybridize extensively in East Africa wherever the ranges {{of two or more}} of them overlap. Linkage disequilibrium, and hence sexual isolation, in sympatry between colour (nuclear) genes and unlinked mitochondrial (cytoplasmic) loci is consistent across populations and therefore indicates the operation of positive natural selection. Together with data from previous experimental and field work, our results suggest that extensive hybridization occurs among once allopatric or parapatric lineages, that are now nascent species. We deduce that hybridism among lineages in sympatry is currently enforced, in the face of <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> choice, by a bacterial symbiont, Spiroplasma, a male-killer that forces females in female-biased populations to pair with heterotypic males.

40|$|For {{a sexually}} {{reproducing}} species, {{the two major}} decisions facing all individuals are when and with whom to reproduce. When scaled to the population level, the outcome from all individual decisions determines reproductive variance, and age-class contribution to population growth rate. Both of these attributes determine a population‟s effective size (Ne), which is directly correlated with its fitness, persistence probability, and adaptability. The questions of when and with whom to reproduce, and their subsequent effects on Ne and age-at-maturity were assessed for wild brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations. Mating pairs were significantly size-assortative, with individual length accounting for 37 % of the variation. This pattern of size <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> choice resulted in a reproductive strategy closer to monogamy than polygamy. Of all reproducing adults (n= 157), 80 % (n= 126) produced only one full-sibling family, and only 6 % (n= 9) contributed to more than two full-sibling families. The number of families and offspring contributed increased with length {{for both males and}} females. Comparison of the effective population size estimate to the adult census size (Nc) estimate returned an Ne:Nc ratio of 0. 49 averaged over both populations. This value is nearly five times greater than the average reported across 165 (0. 14) and 102 (0. 10) different species. Age-at-maturity ranged from 0 to 2 years, with the proportion of age- 0 and age- 1 individuals maturing in a given year dependent upon growth opportunities determined primarily by environmental conditions. Mature fish were significantly larger than immature fish within an age-class, however, survival rates of mature and immature fish were similar. Furthermore, parental length did not influence offspring survival. These data suggest that the cost of early maturation is instead manifested through a reduction in egg number for females, and a reduced ability to acquire mates for males, both determined by an individual‟s size. Indeed, fecundity predicted by mean length of immature and mature fish within an age-class would result in mature fish producing an average of 38 % (age- 0) and 33 % (age- 1) more eggs than immature fish. These findings are discussed in the context of population persistence given the trend of increasing habitat fragmentation and looming climate change...|$|R
40|$|Mating success {{tends to}} be skewed toward {{dominant}} males, though female mate preferences may not always correlate with male dominance. In this study, we investigated the mating preferences of female zebrafish, Danio rerio, {{in the absence of}} male [...] male competition. We paired females sequentially with males of known dominance rank, using a nested, repeated measures design, with egg production as a measure of female mate preference. We predicted that females would spawn more frequently and produce larger clutches when paired with males of higher dominance rank. We found significant differences among females in the size of clutches produced and among males in the size of clutches received, but these differences were independent of male dominance rank. Male body size was not related to either dominance rank or clutch size received. These results indicate that females vary clutch size in relation to the males with which they are paired but that they do not favor dominant males.

The four populations, Jonkershoek (Rhabdomys pumilio), Goegap (R. pumilio), Irene (R. dilectus dilectus) and Suikerbosrand (R. d. chakae), represent the two putative species, R. pumilio (Sparrman, 1784) and R. dilectus De Winton (1897), {{as well as the}} two sub-species, R. d. dilectus (Wroughton, 1905) and R. d. chakae (Wroughton, 1905), of Rhabdomys. The populations occur > 900 km apart, except for the Irene and Suikerbosrand populations which are approximately 80 km apart. Inter- and intrapopulation breeding experiments and behavioural studies were used to test for pre- and/or postzygotic reproductive barriers. In breeding experiments, most intrapopulation pairs produced offspring. In the interpopulation breeding tests, except for one litter produced by an Irene-Jonkershoek pair, which did not survive, only the Jonkershoek-Goegap pairings produced offspring, which were fertile and had growth rates similar to those of offspring produced in intrapopulation pairings. However, the smaller litter size of the Jonkershoek-Goegap pairings compared to intrapopulation pairings, suggests post-zygotic failure between these two R. pumilio populations. In the behavioural experiments, I tested the responses of females to the soiled bedding of homotype (same population) and heterotype (different population) males. Two experiments were conducted: habituation-discrimination and habituation-generalization tests were used to investigate within- and between-taxon variations in male odour quality and female perception; and choice tests were used to test female preference. The results of the behavioural experiments indicate that there is variation within the R. pumilio (Jonkershoek and Goegap) taxon in odour quality, perception and preference. The Jonkershoek females could discriminate between their own population males and those of Goegap, and preferred their own males, while the Goegap females were unable to distinguish between their own population scent and the Jonkershoek population scent and therefore were unable to display a preference for their own population scent when a Jonkershoek/Goegap scent choice was presented. The two subspecies of R. dilectus perceived the scent of males from their own population as being more similar to each other than to that of R. pumilio, and Irene females perceived the two R. pumilio populations as different. All four populations displayed <b>assortative</b> <b>mate</b> preference and preferred their own population’s scent over all the others, {{with the exception of the}} Goegap population.

Heterostyly enhances disassortative pollination through reciprocal placement of stigmas and anthers of morphs and appropriate pollinators. Stylar dimorphism {{in which there}} is not reciprocal anther placement may compromise disassortative mating, particularly when there is not intra-morph incompatibility. Variable rates of disassortative mating along with differential female fecundity or siring success among floral morphs could lead to variation in morph ratio. We investigated mating patterns, female fecundity and siring success of style-length morphs in Narcissus papyraceus, a self-incompatible but morph-compatible species with dimorphic (long- and short-styled) and monomorphic (long-styled) populations in central and north regions of its range respectively. We established experimental populations in both regions and exposed them to ambient pollinators. Using paternity analysis, we found similar siring success of morphs and high disassortative mating in most populations. Female fecundity of morphs was similar in all populations. Although these results could not completely explain the loss of dimorphism in the species’ northern range, they provided evidence for the evolutionary stability of stylar dimorphism in N. papyraceus in at least some populations.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has found a surprising degree of homogeneity in the personal political communication network of individuals but this work has focused largely on the tendency to sort into likeminded social, workplace, and residential political contexts. We extend this line of research {{into one of the}} most fundamental and consequential of political interactions – that between sexual mates. Using data on thousands of spouse pairs in the United States, we investigate the degree of concordance among mates on a variety of physical, social, and political traits. Our findings show that physical and personality traits display only weakly positive and frequently insignificant correlations across spouses. Conversely, and perhaps surprisingly, political attitudes display interspousal correlations that are among the strongest of all social and biometric traits. Further, it appears the political similarity of spouses derives in part from initial mate choice rather than persuasion and accommodation over the life of the relationship. Such <b>assortative</b> political <b>mating</b> holds important implications for the dynamics of political opinion and for the political views of offspring. After languishing for a time in the face of predominately individualistic approaches to politics, the study of context is making a strong comeback.

For instance, {{in the case of}} eastern bluebirds, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for territorial aggression increases the probability of the parents obtaining and securing a nest site for their offspring. This in turn increases the likelihood of survival of the offspring and consequently fitness of the individuals. In birds whose coloration represents well being and fecundity of the bird, positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for color increases the chances of genes being passed on and of the offspring being in good condition.

The goal of the chapters herein are to investigate the genetic structure of these natural hybrid zones overall and the genetic structure of the populations within them {{in an effort to}} better understand the factors producing and maintaining spatial genetic patterns among this species pair and their hybrids. Using informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in one mitochondrial and three nuclear intron loci, I show that hybrid zones occur in replicated fashion in multiple stream reaches along a gradient from high to low elevation. Tests of FIS and linkage disequilibrium (LD) revealed significant genetic structure within a small subset of populations. Specifically, parentals and hybrids all three occur in some locations while other locations appear to be hybrid swarms. I then investigated a behavioral mechanism of reproductive isolation - social association, which might affect population structure. In clean water, individuals shoaled significantly more closely with conspecifics. Additionally, genotyping of females and their embryos revealed signatures of non-random mating in structured populations. Taken together, assortative social grouping, which may translate to <b>assortative</b> female <b>mate</b> choice, likely plays a role in maintaining population structure.

We do this by constructing a two-sex integral projection model to explore ways in which altering the mating behavior from random to nonrandom <b>mating</b> (<b>assortative,</b> disassortative, or selection for size) and altering demographic parameters in one or both sexes (growth, survival, and parental contribution to offspring phenotype) affect the population growth rate. We demonstrate our framework using data from a population of Columbian ground squirrels. Our results suggest that the population growth rate is substantially affected when nonrandom mating is linked to sex differences in demographic parameters or parental contributions to offspring phenotype, but interestingly, the effect of the mating pattern alone is rather small. Our results also suggest that the population growth rate of Columbian ground squirrels would increase with the degree of disassortative mating and with the degree of the mating advantage of large individuals...|$|R

The second common type of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> occurs with respect to coloration. This type of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> is more common in socially monogamous bird species such as the eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) and western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana). In both species more brightly colored males mated with more brightly colored females and less brightly colored individuals paired with one another. Eastern bluebirds also mate assortatively for territorial aggression due to fierce competition for a limited number of nesting sites with tree swallows. Two highly aggressive individuals are better equipped to protect their nest, encouraging <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> between such individuals.|$|E

40|$|In our {{seasonal}} world, animals face {{a variety}} of environmental conditions {{in the course of}} the year. To cope with such seasonality, animals may be phenotypically flexible, but some phenotypic traits are fixed. If fixed phenotypic traits are functionally linked to resource use, then animals should redistribute in response to seasonally changing resources, leading to a ‘phenotype-limited’ distribution. Here, we examine this possibility for a shorebird, the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica; a long-billed and sexually dimorphic shorebird), that has to reach buried prey with a probing bill of fixed length. The main prey of female bar-tailed godwits is buried deeper in winter than in summer. Using sightings of individually marked females, we found that in winter only longer-billed individuals remained in the Dutch Wadden Sea, while the shorter-billed individuals moved away to an estuary with a more benign climate such as the Wash. Although longer-billed individuals have the widest range of options in winter and could therefore be selected for, counterselection may occur during the breeding season on the tundra, where surface-living prey may be captured more easily with shorter bills. Phenotype-limited distributions could be a widespread phenomenon and, when associated with <b>assortative</b> migration and <b>mating,</b> it may act as a precursor of phenotypic evolution...|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1990. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 117 - 124). Microfiche. ix, 124 leaves, bound 29 cmThe {{main objective}} {{of this study is}} to explain two counter-intuitive behavior patterns: the elevated aspiration for female higher education and the low employment rate of highly educated married women in Korea. For this purpose, a testable hypothesis is presented to explain the behavior pattern in terms of total household income, including the marital output of <b>assortative</b> educational <b>mating,</b> instead of using conventional analyses in terms of individual earnings or wage rate. In the model formulated, the overall schooling effect of a married woman on her employment decision is analyzed. The major findings of this study are: first, as the educational level of married women increases, their employment rate tends to decline, and the schooling and earnings of the husband have a consistent positive relation to the wife's educational attainments. Second, as is to be expected, the educational mating between marital spouses indicates a very high correlation (0. 7282), and the husband I s earnings are strongly positive correlated, not only to his own education, but also to his wife's education. Third, when the non-employed wife group is compared with the employed group, the mean of the wife's educational attainment in the non-employed group is higher, and the mean schooling and earnings of the husband of the non-employed wife are higher than those of the husband of the employed wife. Fourth, as results of probit estimation on the employment of married women show, the schooling and earnings of the husband, and the employment of other family members are all negatively related to the work of the wife, and their coefficients are all significant. The predicted wage of the wife and the region dummy variable for large city size reveal a strong positive sign. Fifth, the regression result for the husband's earnings equation indicates that the wife's education is an especially important component in the semi-log earnings function of the husband. Sixth, the analysis of the overall schooling effect of the wife on her employment decision reflects that the negative factors of household income dominate the positive wage effect...|$|R
40|$|Sex-specific {{ornamentation}} {{is widely}} known among male animals, but even among sex-role reversed species, ornamented females are rare. Although several hypotheses for this pattern exist, too few systems featuring female ornaments {{have been studied}} in detail to adequately test them. Empidine dance flies are exceptional in that many species show female ornamentation of wings, abdomens, or legs. Here we compare sexual selection in males and females of the long-tailed dance fly, Rhamphomyia longicauda Loew (Diptera: Empididae), a sex-role reversed fly in which swarming females aggregate in competition for the nuptial gifts provided by males during mating. Females in this species possess several secondary sex characters, including eversible abdominal sacs, enlarged wings, and decorated tibiae that may all function in mate attraction during swarming. Males preferentially approach large females in the swarm, but the strength and shape of selection on females {{and the degree to}} which selection is sex-specific are unknown. We estimated linear and nonlinear sexual selection on structures expressed in both male and female flies, and found contrasting patterns of sexual selection on wing length and tibia length in males and females. In females, long wings and short tibiae were associated with mating success, whereas selection on males was significantly different: males with short wings and long tibiae were most likely to mate (although tibia length was a marginally non-significant predictor of male mating success). We found no evidence for <b>assortative</b> or disassortative <b>mating.</b> Although the largest females occupied positions within the swarm closest to the entry point for choosy males, in contrast to selection for mating success these females tended to have larger tibiae than rivals. We discuss our findings in the context of the mating biology of R. longicauda compared to other empidine dance flies, and its relevance to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in general...|$|R
