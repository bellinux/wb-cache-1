To his four stepchildren he was <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> and generous stepfather. The Dudleys' domestic life is partly documented in the Earl's accounts; Lettice Dudley financed her personal expenses and servants out of her revenue as Dowager Countess of Essex, remaining largely excluded from society life.|$|E
5|$|The comic's popularity, {{as well as}} {{the fact}} that Livingston stated he does not intend to {{continue}} the comic through , led to the appearance of an unofficial sequel to Concerned, entitled Concerned 2: <b>A</b> <b>Concerned</b> Rip-Off: The Continuing Adventures of Gordon Frohman, and created by Norman N. Black, although it is currently on an undisclosed hiatus since November 28, 2010.|$|E

Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack {{at a party in}} third class.|$|E

5|$|Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Stephen Lewis for the Massey Lectures. Lewis wrote it in early to mid-2005 and House of Anansi Press {{released}} {{it as the}} lecture series began in October 2005. Each of the book's chapters was delivered as one lecture in a different Canadian city, beginning in Vancouver on October 18 and ending in Toronto on October 28. The speeches were aired on CBC Radio One between November 7 and 11. The author and orator, Stephen Lewis, {{was at that time}} the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa and former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations. Although he wrote the book and lectures in his role as <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> Canadian citizen, his criticism of the United Nations (UN), international organizations, and other diplomats, including naming specific people, was called undiplomatic and led several reviewers to speculate whether he would be removed from his UN position.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{data from}} the Public Concern at Work advice line in the UK, to find out to what extent trade unions are recipients of whistleblower concerns, and whether raising <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> with <b>a</b> trade union is successful. We consider that successful whistleblowing involves both {{where it has been}} safe for the whistleblower and effective in stopping wrongdoing. Our findings show that trade unions are not the first choice recipient for workers who want to raise <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> about wrongdoing. Workers tend to raise <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> with other recipients first, if they raise their concern at all with a union. Our findings suggest that it is safer for a whistleblower to raise <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> with <b>a</b> union than it is with other recipients. However, our findings also suggest that raising <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> with <b>a</b> union is less effective in stopping wrongdoing than using other external or internal recipients...|$|R

Whence these leagues arrived in Tuscany, <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> Ferdinand requisitioned an Austrian garrison, from his brother Emperor Francis of Austria, for the defence of the state.

Already in January 1966 a schism occurred and the two splinters registered separately at the Election Council (Kiesraad) in October, although they were already negotiating a reconciliation by then. Eventually, they decided {{not to participate in}} the 1967 general election.|$|E
25|$|Although she {{had left}} Smith briefly because of {{arguments}} with him, in November 1995 she was once more living with him at Furnival Road. Her parents had noticed bruising on her, something she explained away as being the results of accidents. She became increasingly withdrawn and in December 1995 resigned from her part-time job. In March 1996 her parents received cards purportedly from her for their anniversary and a birthday, but only Smith had written in them. When Bates' brother tried to see her at the house, Smith said she was not at home. When <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> neighbour asked after her, she was briefly shown at an upstairs window.|$|E
25|$|Caddy and {{teammate}} Billie Smedts were {{embroiled in}} controversy in April {{as a result}} of an attempted prank gone wrong. The pair were arrested at gunpoint by local police after they were spotted wearing balaclavas and attempting to enter a local house in the Geelong suburb of Kardinia Park. They received a warning from police after it was revealed they were attempting to scare teammate Jackson Thurlow and had simply approached the wrong house. <b>A</b> <b>concerned</b> neighbour had called police reporting an armed robbery when she saw the players knock on the door of the neighbouring property. The incident was resolved without further action by police or disciplinary action by the club.|$|E
40|$|Intentional {{action is}} widely {{held to be}} an {{important}} element in a theory (often called 'folk psychology') whose function lies chiefly in the prediction and explanation of behavior. The author argues that, in fact, people's concept of intentional action has also been shaped in a fundamental way by <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> with specifically *moral* issues. Thus, the concept might be best understood as a kind of multi-purpose tool [...] shaped by <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> with prediction and explanation but also by <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> with moral praise and blame...|$|R

25|$|The Irgun sent {{warnings}} by telephone, {{including one}} to the hotel's own switchboard, which, possibly because hoax bomb warnings were rife at the time, the staff decided to ignore, but none directly to the British authorities. From {{the fact that a}} bomb search had already been carried out, it appears that a hoax call or tip-off had been received at the hotel earlier that day. Subsequent telephone calls from <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> Palestine Post staff member and the police caused increasing alarm, and the hotel manager was notified. In the closing minutes before the explosion, he called an unknown British officer, but no evacuation was ordered. Controversy has arisen over the timing and adequacy of the warnings and, based on the not necessarily true assumption that {{the number of people in}} the blast zone would have been reduced, the reasons why the hotel was not evacuated.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, The Program for the Conservation of Migratory Bats between Mexico and the United States {{was started}} by <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> group of {{international}} bat specialists {{in response to a}} decline of multiple bat species in Mexico. PCCM has been valuable in conducting censuses of the greater long-nosed bats in Cueva del Diablo. To reduce vandalism in Cueva del Diablo and promote appreciation of bats, PCCM created a series of children's books, educational activities, and TV reports. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation. There is evidence that the population in the United States has increased since 1984, with the population in Arizona one hundred times greater in 2000 than it was in 1984. Because it is a highly colonial species, disturbance at a single cave can have a significant negative impact on the entire species.|$|E
500|$|The film's success {{spawned a}} number of imitators, who sought to {{saturate}} the market with genre imitations. [...] In particular, Street Corner recycled Babb's plot, substituting <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> physician for <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> teacher. [...] In 1948, Universal produced a similar film, The Story of Bob and Sally, {{but was unable to}} screen it due to the production code, and eventually sold the rights.

A brief for the PEN American Center and the Authors Guild expressed the publishing industry's [...] "confusion, consternation and concern" [...] at the outcome. The American historian Arthur M.

500|$|The webcomic derives {{its name}} {{from one of the}} {{propaganda}} broadcasts by Wallace Breen in Half-Life 2, in which he is reading a letter supposedly written by a citizen, signed 'Sincerely, <b>a</b> <b>concerned</b> citizen', and begins his response with 'Thank you for writing, Concerned'. Throughout the comic the main character, Gordon Frohman, sends several similar letters to Dr. Breen, Livingston's intention being to suggest that Frohman was the author of the letter read by Breen in Half-Life 2. The name [...] "Frohman" [...] is derived from the last name of Gordon Freeman, the protagonist of the Half-Life series. According to the credits on the comic's website, this name was suggested to Livingston by Sam Golgert, an acquaintance of his.|$|E
