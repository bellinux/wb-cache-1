5|$|The {{green algae}} {{are a large}} group of {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not <b>always</b> <b>with</b> two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Walpole {{moved into}} a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to {{maintain}} his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, {{on the slopes of}} Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home {{for the rest of his}} life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic James Agate commented that one might think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost <b>always</b> <b>with</b> him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.|$|E
