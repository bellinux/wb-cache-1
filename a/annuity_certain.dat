40|$|There are {{two kinds}} of annuity, <b>annuity</b> <b>certain</b> and life annuity. <b>Annuity</b> <b>certain</b> does not depend on life probability, for example, mortgage. Life annuity depends on time until death and life probability, for example, pension payment from {{insurance}} company. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss further about life annuity and the relationship with life probability that is influences by time until death and the assumption of interest which is used. Time until death (T) is a random variable, because it is unpredictable. To determine the value of distribution, assumption values on tqx will be used. These values are generated by T simulation which depends on Uniform distribution (0, 1) random values. A few cases of determining life annuity using tpx distribution values by T simulation will be discussed...|$|E

50|$|Annuities {{that provide}} {{payments}} {{that will be}} paid over a period known in advance are <b>annuities</b> <b>certain</b> or guaranteed <b>annuities.</b> Annuities paid only under certain circumstances are contingent annuities. A common example is a life annuity, which is paid over the remaining lifetime of the annuitant. <b>Certain</b> and life <b>annuities</b> are guaranteed {{to be paid for}} a number of years and then become contingent on the annuitant being alive.|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} moment {{generating}} function of the <b>annuity</b> <b>certain</b> with stochastic interest rate written {{by means of a}} time discretization of the Wiener process as an n-fold integral, a straightforward evaluation of the corresponding distribution function is obtained by letting n tend to infinity. The advantage of the present method consists in the direct calculation technique of the n-fold integral, instead of using moment calculation or differential equations, and in the possible applicability of the present method to varying annuities which could be applied to IBNR results, as well as to pension fund calculations, etc. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} various investment strategies in immunizing a 50 -year level <b>annuity</b> <b>certain.</b> Each investment strategy is analyzed over 100 paths of interest rates generated from the one-factor Cox-Ingersoll-Ross stochastic model. It is found that using Macaulay-type risk indexes, such as duration (first order) and convexity (second order), achieves good immunization. An improvement in immunization effectiveness is obtained by using risk indexes that measure price responses to orthonormal-polynominal-based shocks to the term structure of interest rates. It is shown why these new risk indexes, which are not derived from any particular model of interest rate dynamics, {{are expected to be}} particularly useful in managing the interest rate risk for long-term liabilities...|$|E
40|$|The Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWBs) are {{optional}} riders {{provided by}} insurance companies in variable annuities. They guarantee the policyholders' ability to get the initial investment back by making periodic withdrawals regardless {{of the impact of}} poor market performance. With GMWBs attached, variable annuities become more attractive. This type of guarantee can be challenging to price and hedge. We employ two approaches to price GMWBs. Under the constant static withdrawal assumption, the first approach is to decompose the GMWB and the variable annuity into an arithmetic average strike Asian call option and an <b>annuity</b> <b>certain.</b> The second approach is to treat the GMWB alone as a put option whose maturity and payoff are random. Hedging helps insurers specify and manage the risks of writing GMWBs, as well as find their fair prices. We propose semi-static hedging strategies that offer several advantages over dynamic hedging. The idea is to construct a portfolio of European options that replicate the conditional expected GMWB liability in a short time period, and update the portfolio after the options expire. This strategy requires fewer portfolio adjustments, and outperforms the dynamic strategy when there are random jumps in the underlying price. We also extend the semi-static hedging strategies to the Heston stochastic volatility model...|$|E

50|$|Valuation of life annuities may be {{performed}} by calculating the actuarial present value of the future life contingent payments. Life tables are {{used to calculate the}} probability that the annuitant lives to each future payment period. Valuation of life annuities also depends on the timing of payments just as with <b>annuities</b> <b>certain,</b> however life <b>annuities</b> may not be calculated with similar formulas because actuarial present value accounts for the probability of death at each age.|$|R

50|$|A {{hybrid of}} these is when the {{payments}} stop at death, but also after a predetermined number of payments, if this is earlier: known as a temporary life annuity. The difference with the period <b>certain</b> <b>annuity</b> is that the period <b>certain</b> <b>annuity</b> will keep paying {{after the death of}} the nominee until the period is completed.|$|R
50|$|In 1671 De Witt {{conceived}} {{of a life}} annuity as a weighted average of <b>annuities</b> <b>certain</b> where the weights were mortality probabilities (that sum to one), thereby producing the expected value of {{the present value of}} a life annuity. Edmond Halley’s (of comet fame) representation of the life annuity dates to 1693, when he re-expressed a life annuity as the discounted value of each annual payment multiplied by the probability of surviving long enough to receive the payment and summed until there are no survivors. De Witt's approach was especially insightful and ahead of its time. In modern terminology, De Witt treats a life annuity as a random variable and its expected value is what we call the value of a life annuity. Also in modern terminology, De Witt's approach allows one to readily understand other properties of this random variable such as its standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, or any other characteristic of interest.|$|R
5000|$|A pure {{life annuity}} ceases to make {{payments}} {{on the death of}} the annuitant. A guaranteed annuity or life and <b>certain</b> <b>annuity,</b> makes payments for at least a certain number of years (the [...] "period certain"); if the annuitant outlives the specified period <b>certain,</b> <b>annuity</b> payments then continue until the annuitant's death, and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain, the annuitant's estate or beneficiary is entitled to collect the remaining payments certain. The tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the life-with-period-certain annuity is that in exchange for the reduced risk of loss, the annuity payments for the latter will be smaller.|$|R

50|$|Companies and {{individuals}} who make certain types of payments to foreign persons must withhold Federal income tax on those payments. Foreign persons include nonresident aliens, foreign corporations, and foreign partnerships. Payments subject to withholding include compensation for services, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, <b>annuities,</b> and <b>certain</b> other payments. Tax is withheld at 30% of the gross amount of the payment. This withholding rate may be reduced under a tax treaty. This tax withheld is usually considered a final determination and payment of tax, requiring no further action or tax return by the foreign person.|$|R
50|$|After Allstate Life {{stopped taking}} new annuity {{business}} in 2013, other structured sale opportunities arose. In lieu of annuities, United States Treasury obligations {{held in a}} trust (treasury funded structured settlements) are used to fund the future cash flows. Some companies use Key Man Life Insurance Policies in place of annuities, which provide the added protection of a death benefit to the seller and a payout that continues long after the seller passes. This arrangement may preferable when the seller is interested in passing wealth to the seller's beneficiaries after death. A Key Man Policy may also pay out more than an <b>annuity</b> in <b>certain</b> circumstances.|$|R

40|$|Defined {{contribution}} (DC) retirement systems pose special {{challenges for}} decumulation policy. Because DC plans expose individuals to investment and inflation risk, governments mandating such accumulations often provide {{some form of}} guarantee on pension fund benefits. This government support influences not only the accumulation strategy, but also the choice of retirement product. This paper uses a stochastic numerical simulation approach to investigate a number of retirement income instruments {{in the presence of}} two alternative forms of government support: a “pension guarantee”, which is withdrawn dollar for dollar for the private payout; and a flat rate “first pillar” which is provided irrespective of the value of private retirement resources (a universal pension).

40|$|Variable <b>annuities</b> {{represent}} <b>certain</b> unit-linked {{life insurance}} products offering {{different types of}} protection {{commonly referred to as}} guaranteed minimum benefits (GMXBs). They are designed for the increasing demand of the customers for private pension provision. In this paper we analytically price variable annuities with guaranteed minimum repayments at maturity and in case of the insured’s death. If the contract is prematurely surrendered, the policyholder is entitled to the current value of the fund account reduced by the prevailing surrender fee. The financial market and the mortality model are affine linear. For the surrender model, a Cox process is deployed whose intensity is given by a deterministic function (s-curve) with stochastic inputs from the financial market. So, the policyholders’ surrender behavior depends on the performance of the financial market and is stochastic. The presented pricing scheme incorporates the stochastic surrender behavior of the policyholders and is only based on suitable closed-form approximations...|$|R
5000|$|De Witt calculates {{the value}} of an annuity in the {{following}} way. Assume that annuities on 10,000 lives each ten years of age, which satisfy the Hm mortality table, have been purchased. Of these nominees 79 will die before attaining the age of 11, and no annuity payment will be made in respect of them; none will die between the ages of 11 and 12, so that annuities will be paid for one year on 9921 lives; 40 attain the age of 12 and die before 13, so that two payments will be made with respect to these lives. Reasoning in this way we see that the annuities on 35 of the nominees will be payable for three years; on 40 for four years, and so on. Proceeding thus {{to the end of the}} table, 15 nominees attain the age of 95, 5 of whom die before the age of 96, so that 85 payments will be paid in respect of these 5 lives. Of the survivors all die before attaining the age of 97, so that the annuities on these lives will be payable for 86 years. Having previously calculated a table of the values of <b>annuities</b> <b>certain</b> for every number of years up to 86, {{the value of}} all the annuities on the 10,000 nominees will be found by taking 40 times {{the value of an}} annuity for 2 years, 35 times the value of an annuity for 3 years, and so on—the last term being the value of 10 annuities for 86 years—and adding them together; and the value of an annuity on one of the nominees will then be found by dividing by 10,000. Before leaving the subject of De Witt, we may mention that we find in the correspondence a distinct suggestion of the law of mortality that bears the name of Demoivre. In De Witt's letter, dated the 27th of October 1671 (Ass. Mag. vol. iii. p. 107), he speaks of a [...] "provisional hypothesis" [...] suggested by Hudde, that out of 80 young lives (who, from the context, may be taken as of the age 6) about 1 dies annually. In strictness, therefore, the law in question might be more correctly termed Hudde's than Demoivre's.|$|R

5000|$|Section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (...) {{reduced the}} annual cost-of-living {{adjustment}} for <b>annuities</b> paid to <b>certain</b> military retirees and survivors {{by up to}} 1 percent.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 exempted disability retirees and certain survivors from this reduction of one percent, which reduced the savings associated with that provision to $5,662 million over that same period. S. 1963 would repeal section 403 of P.L. 113-67. Relative to CBO's February 2014 baseline, we estimate that enacting S. 1963 would increase direct spending by $6,813 million; $5,662 million through 2023, plus $1,151 million in 2024.|$|R

The King surrendered to parliamentary control the hereditary excise duties, post office revenues, and [...] "the small branches" [...] of hereditary revenue including rents of the Crown lands in England (which amounted to about £11,000, or £ today), and was granted a civil list annuity of £800,000 (equal to £ today) for the support of his household, subject to the payment of <b>certain</b> <b>annuities</b> to members of the royal family.|$|R
50|$|In Canadian law all {{lands are}} subject to the Crown, and this has been true since Britain {{acquired}} much of Eastern Canada from France by the Treaty of Paris (1763). However, the British and Canadian authorities recognized that indigenous peoples already on the lands had a prior claim, Aboriginal title, which was not extinguished by the arrival of the Europeans. This is in direct contrast to the situation in Australia where the continent was declared Terra nullius, or vacant land, and was seized from Aboriginal peoples without compensation. In consequence, all of Canada, save a section of southern Quebec exempted by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, is subject to Aboriginal title. Native groups historically negotiated treaties in which they traded tenure to the land for <b>annuities</b> and <b>certain</b> legal exemptions and privileges. Most of Western Canada was secured in this way by the government via the Numbered Treaties of 1871 to 1921, though not all groups signed treaties. In particular, in most of British Columbia Aboriginal title has never been transferred to the Crown. Many native groups, both those that have never signed treaties or those that are dissatisfied with the execution of treaties have made formal Aboriginal land claims against the government.|$|R
50|$|The pure {{life annuity}} can have harsh {{consequences}} for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract. Such a situation, called a forfeiture, can be mitigated {{by the addition of}} a period-certain feature under which the annuity issuer is required to make annuity payments for at least a certain number of years; if the annuitant outlives the specified period <b>certain,</b> <b>annuity</b> payments continue until the annuitant's death, and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain, the annuitant's estate or beneficiary is entitled to the remaining payments certain. The tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the life-with-period-certain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller. A viable alternative to the life-with-period-certain annuity is to purchase a single-premium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity.|$|R

While the privatisation of pension funds can encourage development of capital markets in New Member States, equity investment in transition economies is even more volatile than in the "old" capitalist countries. Privatised pension system coincides with investment risks, higher administrative costs, and inability of private markets to provide retirees with affordable, indexed and <b>certain</b> <b>annuities.</b> Namely, private sector may not provide enough investment projects to efficiently absorb mandated pension savings and the expected pension income is subject to a number of risks: poor and volatile investment returns, longevity, and inflation eroding the purchasing power of pensions.

40|$|Abstract: Asset {{allocation}} {{and consumption}} {{towards the end}} of the life cycle is complicated by the uncertainty associated with the length of life. Although this risk can be hedged with life annuities, empirical evidence suggests that voluntary annuitization amongst the public is not very common, nor is it well understood. This paper develops a normative model of when, and if, one should purchase an immediate life annuity. This problem is particularly relevant given the increasing number of Defined Contribution pension plans in the U. S – for which participants must make this decision – and the corresponding trend away from Defined Benefit guarantees. Specifically, our main qualitative argument is that there is a real option – akin to the corporate finance usage of the word – embedded in the decision to annuitize. A life annuity can be viewed as a project with a positive net present value. However, quite distinct from a fixed-income bond or period <b>certain</b> <b>annuity,</b> once purchased, a lif...|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{immediate}} annuitization, a {{wide variety}} of options are available in the way the stream of payments is paid. If the annuity is paid over a fixed period independent of any contingency, it is known as an <b>annuity</b> with period <b>certain,</b> or just <b>annuity</b> certain; if it is to continue for ever, it is called a perpetuity; and if in the latter case it is not to commence until after a term of years, it is called a deferred perpetuity. An annuity depending on the continuance of an assigned life or lives would commonly be called a life annuity, but also known as a life-contingent annuity or simply lifetime annuity; but more commonly the simple term [...] "annuity" [...] is understood to mean a life annuity, unless the contrary is stated. The payments can also be paid over the lifetime of the nominee(s) or for a fixed period, whichever is longer. This is known as life with period certain.|$|R
50|$|Trusts may {{be created}} to get {{funds to the}} next {{generation}} where there is significant wealth and federal exclusionary gifts have already been used up. A common such vehicle is called the grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT). Federal tax law specifically allows for this vehicle. Here the grantor places an asset in the trustone he expects will grow rapidly during the term of the trust. The document then requires the trustee to pay to the settlor a specific sum of money (the <b>annuity)</b> at <b>certain</b> intervals during the life of the trust. If there are assets in the trust {{at the end of the}} term, those assets go without estate or gift tax to the remaindermen. Here's a typical case: settlor owns large block of low cost basis stock in a publicly traded company. He does not wish to sell the stock and pay capital gains tax. He also has estate tax problems since his net worth when he dies is likely to be $10 million or more. His attorney drafts a GRAT in which he places $2 million of the single company's stock. The document calls for the smallest legal interest rate (published monthly by the Federal Government), which is then paid through the term of the trust. Upon the termination of the trust, the annuity has been paid back to the grantor and the remaining corpus is delivered to the remaindermen (typically children) without tax. Money has now passed from the grantor to his/her children without gift or estate tax. There has been no capital gains tax.|$|R
