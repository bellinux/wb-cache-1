If no Class <b>A</b> <b>appropriate</b> persons can be found then liability passes to the owners or occupiers of the land, even when those persons were not directly responsible for the contamination or were unaware of its existence. These are known as [...] "Class B appropriate persons." [...] In the Bawtry case, the EA identified the gas industry, Kenton Homes Ltd. and Kenneth Jackson Ltd. as potential Class <b>A</b> <b>appropriate</b> persons. The owners/occupiers of the properties would have been liable as Class B appropriate persons but the EA had already decided {{that the costs of}} the remediation would have caused these individuals considerable hardship and that they would not pursue them. As both of the building firms had been dissolved, Kenton in 1983 and Jackson in 1993, the only party left to pursue was Transco, who applied for a judicial review at the High Court of the EA's decision of 13 September 2005 to name them as Class <b>A</b> <b>appropriate</b> persons.|$|R
