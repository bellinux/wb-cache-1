40|$|The UK has {{committed}} to sourcing 15 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 and wind turbines {{have the potential to}} contribute towards this target. Due to the Feed-In-Tariffs introduced by the UK Government in 2010, the potential uptake of micro-generation methods such as small wind is likely to increase. However, many barriers exist which prevent widespread implementation, such as noise concerns. There is little work available in the open literature quantifying the problem because much of the existing research focuses on large scale turbines. The need for an increase in interdisciplinary research in this area has also been called for. This research fills the gap in the literature by seeking to better understand the noise levels generated by small wind systems, the characteristics of the noise and people’s reactions to this noise. The research is interdisciplinary, incorporating engineering, to measure, characterise and model the noise from small wind systems and psychology, to identify the type of people {{who are most likely to}} perceive the noise. Environmental noise measurements have been taken at small wind system installations to quantify and characterise the noise levels. This work included an assessment of the attenuation of the noise. Studies have been carried out on individuals living close to small wind system installations, as well as individuals being played recordings of wind turbine noise to investigate the level and type of noise they perceive and to link this to an individual’s attitude towards wind turbines, personality traits and symptom reporting. CFD has been used to model the flow fields around 2 D blade sections to identify the likely noise mechanisms associated with small wind systems by observing the turbulent regions near the <b>aerofoil</b> <b>wall.</b> Finally, a comparison of the three methods has been carried out to identify that the overall level of small wind system noise is low but it is the nature of the sounds that increase the likely perception of the noise.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution to}} leading-edge noise {{produced by a}} translating two-dimensional flat plate ingesting turbulence in proximity to a hard-wall is presented. This is a relevant problem to calculate the installation noise of open rotors and un-ducted fans. The analytical {{solution to the problem}} is given by using Amiet’s flat plate theory in conjunction with the Method Of Images (MOI) to include the effects of the wall. The low frequency, low Mach number limit of the analytical solution is investigated and it is shown that the flat plate in this limit behaves like a compact vertical dipole. The analytical solution is verified by a Computational AeroAcoustic (CAA) simulation that also uses the MOI to simulate a wall. While the MOI gives an approximation of the wall, it does not model all of the effects, such as diffraction from the edges of the flat plate and acoustic shielding due to the presence of the flat plate. These effects, which are ignored in the MOI are quantified using a CAA simulation that models the wall using a hard-slip-wall boundary condition. It is found that the analytical predictions and the CAA simulations using the MOI compare well. However, when the MOI is compared to the CAA simulation using a hard-slip-wall boundary condition, it is found that the MOI does not capture the effect of the shadow zone that is created due to the shielding effect of the aerofoil. The extent of the shadow zone is modified by changing the height of the <b>aerofoil</b> from the <b>wall,</b> and it shown that as the height of the <b>aerofoil</b> from the <b>wall</b> is increased, the shielding effect decreases...|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] The paper {{describes}} and applies exact {{methods of}} calculating the incompressible flow about thick aerofoils of general shape {{in a free}} stream, and a. bout symmetrical <b>aerofoils</b> between channel <b>walls.</b> One of these methods is extended to an approximate treatment of subsonic compressible flow by making use of yon K~irm~n's transformation. General Introduction. [...] The paper introduces new and exact methods of calculating the inviscid flow about two-dimensional aerofoils. Parts 1, 2 and 3 are concerned with incompressible flow, but with only slight modifications the work is applied,to compressible flow in Part 4. Part 1 deals with a symmetric aerofoil at zero incidence in a channel or free stream, while the asymmetric case {{and the effect of}} circulation aredealt with in Part 2. The method give...|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] This is a {{detailed}} study {{of the effect of}} the presence of walls on the flow past a symmetrical aerofoil at zero incidence. The low-speed case is considered first, followed by solutions at a Mach number of 0. 7. The methods used are essentially arithmetical, but a new approach is used for the compressible case. The manner in which the walls affect the pressure distribution is clearly shown. 1. Introduction. [...] In an earlier paper 1 a study was made of the compressible flow past a cusped body in a channel. The present paper deals with the corresponding case for an aerofoil. The first few sections describe in detail the arithmetical solution of the incompressible flow past an <b>aerofoil</b> between parallel <b>walls</b> by a superposition method which is capable of dealing with a variety of problems. This is followed by a solution at a Mach number of 0 - 70. As this solutio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{closed form}} {{solutions to the}} classical beam elasticity differential equation in order to effectively model the displacement of standard aerodynamic geometries used throughout a number of industries. The models assume that the components are constructed from in-plane generally anisotropic (though shown to be quasi-isotropic) composite materials. Exact solutions for the displacement and strains for elliptical and FX 66 -S- 196 and NACA 63 - 621 <b>aerofoil</b> approximations thin <b>wall</b> composite material shell structures, with and without a stiffening rib (shear-web), are presented for the first time. Each of the models developed is rigorously validated via numerical (Runge-Kutta) solutions of an identical differential equation used to derive the analytical models presented. The resulting calculated displacement and material strain fields are shown to be in excellent agreement with simulations using the ANSYS and CATIA commercial finite element (FE) codes as well as experimental data evident in the literature. One major implication of the theoretical treatment is that these solutions can now be used in design codes to limit the required displacement and strains in similar components used in the aerospace and most notably renewable energy sector...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -A {{two-dimensional}} aerofoil of NACA 0015 {{section was}} tested at zero incidence in the Royal Aircraft Establishment 10 ft x 7 ft High-speed Wind Tunnel and measurements {{were made of}} (a) Static pressure on the aerofoil surface at Reynolds numbers of 1 * 4 x 10 G to 5. 5 x 10 G (b) Static pressure on the aerofoil surface, on the tunnel walls and in the stream between the <b>aerofoil</b> and the <b>walls</b> at R = 2. 8 x 106. All the tests were made at Mach numbers of 0. 7 upwards and were continued past the choking Mach number of 0. 764 until either the maximum permissible fan speed was reached or the maximum available power was being used. The {{results showed that the}} choking Mach number was about 0. 764 at Reynolds numbers from 1 * 4 x 106 to 2. 8 x 106. Above M = 0. 760 the development of the supersonic region towards the walls was extremely rapid in terms of tunnel Mach number. At M = 0 - 761 the sonic line was only about half-way out to the tunnel walls and at M = 0. 764 it had reached them. Before and during choking quite large changes in the aerofoil pressure distributions were producetl by varying the Reynolds number. At M = 0. 73 and 0. 75 the shape of the pressure distribution curves indicated the possibility of a A-shock at the lower Reynolds numbers and a single shock at the higher Reynolds numbers. 1.
