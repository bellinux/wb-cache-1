40|$|Negative thixotropy, {{also called}} <b>antithixotropy,</b> {{is the effect}} of a flow-induced {{increase}} in viscosity that has been observed for many polymer solutions. Here, a simple quantitative model describing the time dependence of the shear stress or viscosity is presented. The model assumes a dynamic gel or network in the polymer solution, whose cross-links are dynamically formed and broken. The cross-links exist with or without deformation or flow of the solution. A second property of the model network is that it cannot be deformed infinitely, which is also true for any real network. The dynamic network solution is characterized by four parameters: its elastic shear modulus, its maximum degree of deformation, the rate with which the dynamic cross-links form and break and the viscous contribution of the polymer solution. The first two parameters can be related to each other, so only three independent parameters enter the model. An analytical solution is obtained which describes the flow-induced increase in viscosity, the minimum shear rate required for negative thixotropy and the dependence of the induction time on the shear rate. The results are shown to be in agreement with reported experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Polyacrylamide {{solutions}} are extensively used as chemical additives or processing {{aids in the}} manufacturing of paper and paperboard products. In addition, they {{have been widely used}} in enhanced oil recovery. In this thesis, an experimental work has been carried out to provide a complete and comprehensive study of the rheological properties of polyacrylamide solutions using cone-and-plate rheometery. Polyacrylamide concentrations in the tested solutions ranged by weight from 2 to 5 %. The scope of the study includes the measurements of steady-state behavior, transient shear stress and yield stress response, thixotropic, creep recovery, and dynamic responses for each concentration. The findings resulted in several conclusions regarding the rheological properties of polyacrylamide solutions. They have shown a strong shear-thinning behavior for all concentrations. The dynamic viscosity showed two different behaviors [...] shear-thinning region and shear-thickening region. Significant transient behavior has been observed for all concentrations of polyacrylamide solutions. The yield stress of PAM solutions increased with increasing concentrations. Three different behaviors of thixotropy test have been observed [...] thixotropy, <b>antithixotropy,</b> and time dependent. Finally, the viscous part of PAM solutions was always higher than the elastic part...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the study on {{rheological}} behaviour of emulsions, stabilized by both differently modified dispersible colloidal Boehmite alumina nanoparticles and a non-ionic emulsifier. Hysteresis loop measurements and dynamic rheological measurements were carried out in linear and non-linear regimes on two different emulsion systems – water-in-oil (W/O) and oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Emulsion stabilized {{by a combination of}} moderately hydrophobic particles and a non-ionic emulsifier is an O/W emulsion. The addition of emulsifier improved the stability, however, did not show a significant influence on the emulsion flow behaviour. The emulsion, stabilized by both – nanoparticles and emulsifier – showed a complicated behaviour, i. e. sometimes it exhibited thixotropy or <b>antithixotropy</b> and sometimes both of them. Emulsion stabilized by rather hydrophobic particles and a non-polar emulsifier is a W/O emulsion. The emulsion is very homogenous and exhibited very weak thixotropy. Dynamic measurements showed that G’ was almost equal to G” and both parameters were frequency-dependent, indicating a viscous liquid-like system with little network structure if any. With addition of emulsifier, the rather elastic solid-like emulsion structure may be changed into the viscous liquid-like structure. In order to get a better understanding of relationships between rheological behaviour and microstructure, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results and optical microscopic images of the emulsions studied were discussed. ...|$|E
