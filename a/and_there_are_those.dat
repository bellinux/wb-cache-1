Upon its initial release, the film {{received}} a certificate stating that it was [...] "Approved" [...] (certificate #19564) under the simple pass/fail system of the Production Code in use at that time. Later, when the MPAA switched to a voluntary letter ratings system in 1968, Psycho was {{one of a number of}} high-profile motion pictures to be retro-rated with an [...] "M" [...] (Mature Audiences). This remained the only rating the film would receive for 16 years, and according to the guidelines of the time [...] "M" [...] was the equivalent of a [...] "PG" [...] rating. Then, in 1984, during the uproar of increased parental concern regarding violence in [...] "PG" [...] films, Psycho was retro-rated again to its current rating of [...] "R".

40|$|Homicide is {{a highly}} {{discussed}} topic nowadays in El Salvador. However, a little known fact is that this crime has been present throughout the country’s history. Noteworthy are the considerable {{number of cases of}} homicide reported at Sonsonate City Hall {{at the end of the}} colonial period. Homicide took place when, on occasion, people’s behavior was altered for different reasons, giving rise to violent attitudes, which came about when individuals felt this act was deserved. The motivations that lead to this conduct were mostly closely related to drunkenness, as a direct cause for homicide. Honor, passion, and self-defense are some of the most outstanding motivations to commit the crime. It cannot be ignored that some crimes were due to debt, and others took place within households – husbands murdering their own wives – <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> that had no motivation: accidents. This crime was considered one of the most serious, and shook society at the time. Indigenous people were considered the most prone to committing homicide, given that authorities attributed ignorance to being the key factor in generating this sort of attitude. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

He indicated that he thought that Cardinal Morone should be pope. This was in accordance with the wishes of the Emperor, and Morone {{had been one of the}} Presidents of the Council of Trent. Farnese seemed friendly and willing to please, which Borromeo (wrongly) took as an agreement to supply votes. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who would never vote for a friend of the Emperor, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who remembered Morone's troubles with the Inquisition, and the bull of Paul IV which had stated that no one who was arrested, imprisoned, or convicted by the Inquisition could ever vote in a papal election, let alone be elected pope. [...] In addition, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who did not like Morone personally. It is alleged that both Alessandro Farnese and Ippolito d'Este had grudges against Morone due to decisions which he had made while Legate in Bologna. [...] His enemies could always muster more than one-third of the College to block his election. When it came to a vote, Morone got twenty-nine votes. Farnese must have realized that he was in somewhat the same situation himself. He could muster between twenty-eight and thirty votes, but not the thirty-five needed to elect.|$|R
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> who declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|R

This offer Scaliger accepted provisionally. Midway through 1593 he set out for the Netherlands, where he would pass the remaining sixteen years of his life, never returning to France. His reception at Leiden was all that he could have wished for. He received a handsome income; he was treated with the highest consideration. His supposed rank as a prince of Verona (a sensitive issue for the Scaligeri; see below) was recognized. Leiden lying between The Hague and Amsterdam, Scaliger was able to enjoy, besides the learned circle of Leiden, the advantages of the best society of both these capitals. For Scaliger was no hermit buried among his books; he was fond of social intercourse and was himself a good talker.|$|R

2500|$|The slogan [...] "Free a Marine to Fight" [...] {{proved to}} be a strong drawing card for the WR, {{stronger}} than any fashioned by the WAC, Waves, or SPARS. Young women were eager to serve in the military during World WarII, often in defiance of their family's wishes. Marian Bauer's parents were so upset when she joined the corps that they did not see her off. Jane Tailor's father, a World War I veteran, gave her this advice: [...] "Don't ever complain to me. You're doing this of your own free will. You weren't drafted or forced. Now, golearn, travel, and do your job {{to the best of your}} ability." [...] <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> parents who asked special consideration for daughters who were too young to enlist. The minimum age of 20 years, set by law, remained the same throughout the war for the WR. Some parents wondered why 18-year-boys were sent into combat and 18-year-old girls could not even serve. Aside from patriotism, Colonel Streeter was interested to learn the reasons why young women joined the WR. A survey of 1,000 new enlistees was conducted at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, which asked this question. The results of this survey showed that the 750 enlistees had had positive reasons for enlisting. Some had male relatives or friends in the armed forces, and some wanted revenge against the enemy, while others wanted the experience it would bring to their lives. The remaining 250 acknowledged they were trying to escape from something: a bad home life, a broken marriage, boredom, or some personal disappointment. Indications were that Streeter was not displeased with the findings. The WR met its recruitment goal by 1June 1944, and then stopped all recruiting. It began again on 20September 1944, but on a limited basis. The peak strength was 17,640 enlisted and 820 officers.|$|R
