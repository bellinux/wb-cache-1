5|$|According to {{the casting}} director, Newt was the most {{difficult}} role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, but many of them had acted in commercials and were <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> smiling after saying their lines. Henn, from Atwater, California was chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to pursue an acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E
5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E

5|$|In AD 39, {{relations}} between Caligula and the Roman Senate deteriorated. The subject of their disagreement is unknown. A number of factors, though, aggravated this feud. The Senate had become <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> ruling without an emperor between {{the departure of}} Tiberius for Capri in AD 26 and Caligula's accession. Additionally, Tiberius's treason trials had eliminated a number of pro-Julian senators such as Asinius Gallus.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism.

5|$|Opponents to the {{shut-down}} {{maintained that}} most of the animals were unable to survive in the wild and would perish, and that the zoo's facilities had become one of the last possibilities for future generations of Navajos to see the sacred creatures and thereby relate to traditional stories, {{due to the fact that}} most younger Navajos are more <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> dealing with domesticated livestock rather than untamed animals.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{imperial}} {{family was}} a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about 50miles (80km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan.

5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{their own}} recording studio, the duo immediately {{started working on}} new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and studio equipment, as they sought to become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. Having dropped out months before graduation, André 3000 also returned to high school to earn his diploma during the recording of ATLiens.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E

He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little regard for the authority of the pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E

5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the revelation}} of the illegal activities, {{expenditures}} had been routinely made on a cash basis, all of the university funding and program money was thrown into a single account, and university bond indentures had been violated.
