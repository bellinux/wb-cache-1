5|$|Anyone who had {{a horrible}} appearance, was missing a finger, or had {{appendages}} {{similar to those of}} an animal was believed to be a vampire. A person who died alone and unseen would become a vampire, likewise if a corpse swelled or turned black before burial. Dogs, cats, plants or even agricultural tools could become vampires; pumpkins or melons kept in the house too long would start to move, make noises or show blood. According to the late Serbian ethnologist Tatomir Vukanović, Roma people in Kosovo believed that vampires were invisible to most people, but could be seen by a twin brother and sister born on a Saturday who wore their clothes inside out. Likewise, a settlement could be protected by finding twins who could <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the vampire outdoors at night, who would have to flee immediately after they spotted it.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment. See also optogenetics which {{involves the use of}} light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels, and <b>also</b> <b>see</b> biophoton, a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum emitted from a biological system.|$|E

To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E

5|$|Each side can {{construct}} {{two types}} of magical buildings, each of which produces one type of spellcaster and researches more advanced spells for that type. These advanced buildings can be constructed only with assistance from other buildings. The Human Cleric and Orc Necrolyte can both defend themselves by magic and <b>also</b> <b>see</b> distant parts of the territory for short periods. The Cleric's other spells are protective, healing the injured and making troops invisible, while the Necrolyte raises skeletons as troops and can make other units temporarily invulnerable, {{at the cost of}} severely damaging them when the spell dissipates. The Human Conjurer and Orc Warlock have energy blasts, wider-range destruction spells and the ability to summon small, venomous monsters. The Conjurer can summon a water elemental, while the Warlock can summon a demonic melee unit.|$|E

5|$|Part II {{begins as}} the narrator reads {{descriptions}} of her father and Helen's travels through Eastern Europe during the 1950s. While on their travels, Helen and Paul conclude that Rossi might have been taken by Dracula to his tomb. They travel to Istanbul to find the archives of Sultan MehmedII, which Paul believes contain information regarding {{the location of the}} tomb. They fortuitously meet Professor Turgut Bora from Istanbul University, who has also discovered a book similar to Paul's and Rossi's. He has access to Mehmed's archive, and together they unearth several important documents. They <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the librarian who was supposedly killed in the United States– he has survived because he is a vampire and he has continued following Helen and Paul. Helen shoots the vampire librarian but misses his heart and consequently, he does not die.|$|E

It was here that steam locomotives from 1896-1953 were repaired. In the first 16 stalls, visitors can walk among the massive locomotives and rail cars on display in an open-air setting. Moving into the enclosed Elmer Lam gallery in stalls 17 through 20, aviation exhibits dominate, with a full size replica Wright Flyer, Piedmont Airlines exhibits, and more. Moving into the restoration shop occupying stalls 21 through 32, visitors may <b>also</b> <b>see</b> volunteers working on various railroad pieces, and even manufacturing parts. The remaining five stalls are dedicated to additional enclosed exhibits.|$|E
5|$|With {{some notable}} exceptions, Reformed Christians baptize infants who {{are born to}} believing parents. Reformed Christians do so {{on the basis of}} the {{continuity}} from the old covenant between God and Israel and the new covenant with the church, since infants were circumcised under the old covenant. They <b>also</b> <b>see</b> God's saving purpose in the new covenant as having to do with families as well as individuals. Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit, they recognize that faith may come later in life rather than preceding baptism. Infants may also be said to possess a seed of faith which will come to fruition later, or baptism may be administered based on a promise of faith offered by their sponsors (usually their parents) which will be kept at a later age.|$|E
5|$|Although {{popular with}} groupies, Chrisye had rarely dated. But in early 1981 he began courting Guruh Sukarnoputra's secretary, Gusti Firoza Damayanti Noor (Yanti). Yanti, of mixed Dayak and Minang ancestry, {{was a former}} singer and came from a musically {{inclined}} family; she would often discuss music with Chrisye {{while he waited for}} Guruh, and he would <b>also</b> <b>see</b> her when visiting her brother Raidy, one of his friends. When she moved to Bali to work at a five-star hotel there for several weeks, Chrisye followed her and told her that he would marry her when she returned to Jakarta; although this was not a formal proposal, Yanti accepted. In 1982 Chrisye converted to Islam, as Islam does not permit interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, and changed his name to Chrismansyah Rahadi; Chrisye at the time had been growing increasingly discontent and disillusioned with Christianity. On 12 December 1982 he married Yanti in a Padang-style wedding.|$|E

5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can <b>also</b> <b>see</b> into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Charles X of Sweden had {{concluded}} the earlier war with Denmark with a stunning victory by succeeding in the bold March across the Belts. Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} into a humiliating peace in the Treaty of Roskilde in which Denmark had to cede Scania, Halland and Blekinge on the Scandinavian Peninsula and the island of Bornholm, and Norway lost the provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag. Europe {{was stunned by the}} quick victory, and Charles proudly publicized his accomplishments. However, peace meant new problems. In the peace treaty of Roskilde, Denmark was obliged to supply the Swedish army with provisions until May 1658, but soon thereafter the army would need to be moved. The Swedish king knew that the army {{would not be able to}} be supplied in Sweden for long, and disbanding it was not desirable with the Poles eager to revenge the 1655 invasion of Poland. Sweden was not in want of enemies to attack: campaigns in Livonia and Estonia were considered, but were rejected due to supply problems. The Swedish King maintained that his main goal was to invade Royal Prussia, but he also wanted to punish Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia. The many enemies in continental Europe, among them Poland and a hostile Dutch would make this a difficult endeavor however. A new attack on Prussia would <b>also</b> <b>see</b> little international support, France was already urging peace. The surprising Swedish solution to this dilemma would be to return to Denmark in an attempt to finish the job.|$|E
5|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 13 January 1798, Sybille and Fox arrived in Manila Bay, slipping unchallenged past the fortress of Corregidor and then sailing across the bay {{on the morning of}} 14 January, anchoring between Manila and Cavite. From his vantage point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in Cavite, the ships of the line San Pedro, Europa and Montañés and the frigates Maria de la Cabeya and Luisa in dock and unfit for action. To Cooke's disappointment he could <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the Manila galleon, Marquesetta being unloaded at the Cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour. The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward Pakenham was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack.|$|E
