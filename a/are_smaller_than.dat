5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production {{rate of the}} comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick.

5|$|Many {{bumblebees}} {{are social}} insects that form colonies {{with a single}} queen. The colonies <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals. Cuckoo bumblebees do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.|$|E

5|$|ZnO is a {{relatively}} soft material with approximate hardness of 4.5 on the Mohs scale. Its elastic constants <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> those of relevant III-V semiconductors, such as GaN.

Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps.

5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E

Tregelles used types originally cast for printing the Codex Alexandrinus, which only approximately represented the shape of the letters of the codex. The hand-written letters <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> the type. Tregelles included one page of typographical facsimile in this edition.

5|$|The Nine Stones {{is part of}} a {{tradition}} of stone circle construction that spread through much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany between 3,300 and 900 BCE, during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. The stone circle tradition was accompanied by the construction of timber circles and earthen henges, reflecting a growing emphasis on circular monuments. The purpose of such rings is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites. At least nine of these stone circles are known to have been constructed near modern Dorset. They <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> those found elsewhere in Britain and are typically built from sarsen stone.|$|E

January and February are usually most commonly described this way, with August and September sometimes included. Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at test screenings, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly horror), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which has fewer entertainment options outside the home.|$|E
