2500|$|Eleven gaily-colored parachutes {{operated}} {{from the}} top of a 250-foot tower, enable visitors to experience all the thrills of [...] "bailing out" [...] without the hazard or discomfort. Each parachute has a double seat suspended from it. When two passengers have taken their places beneath the 'chute, a cable pulls it to the summit of the tower. An <b>automatic</b> <b>release</b> starts the drop, and the passengers float gently to the ground. Vertical guide wires prevent swaying, a metal ring keeps the 'chute open at all times, and shock-absorbers eliminate the impact of the landing. One of the most spectacular features of the Amusement Area, this is also a type of parachute jump similar to that which the armies of the world use in early stages of training for actual parachute jumping.|$|E

Comparing several direct and indirect measuring methods, a dynamic long-range linear displacement precision measuring method for winding system based on magnetic rotary encoder is presented. Conceptual design of longrange linear displacement precision measuring mechanism according to proposed method is carried out. After error pre-analysis of several conceptual design schemes, a long-range linear displacement precision measuring mechanism based upon error avoidance theory is designed. The proposed measuring mechanism {{has been applied to}} conclude that its high accuracy, reliability and adaptability...|$|R

2500|$|Snowboard bindings, unlike ski bindings, do not {{automatically}} release upon impact or after falling over. With skis, this mechanism {{is designed to}} protect from injuries (particularly to the knee) caused by skis torn in different directions. <b>Automatic</b> <b>release</b> is not required in snowboarding, as the rider's legs are fixed in a static position and twisting of the knee joint cannot occur to the same extent. Furthermore, it reduces the dangerous prospect of a board hurtling downhill riderless, and the rider slipping downhill on his back with no means to maintain grip on a steep slope. Nevertheless, some ski areas {{require the use of}} a [...] "leash" [...] that connects the snowboard to the rider's leg or boot, in case the snowboard manages to get away from its rider. This is most likely to happen when the rider removes the board at the top or the bottom of a run (or while on a chairlift, which could be dangerous).|$|E

50|$|The {{major change}} {{found in the}} Talmud's slavery laws was that a single set of rules, with a few exceptions, governs both Jewish slaves and non-Jewish slaves. Another change was that the <b>automatic</b> <b>release</b> of Jewish slaves after six years is {{replaced}} by indefinite slavery, {{in conjunction with a}} process whereby the owner could, under certain situations, release the slave by a written document (a manumission). However, historian Josephus wrote that the seven-year <b>automatic</b> <b>release</b> was still in effect if the slavery was a punishment for a crime the slave committed (as opposed to voluntary slavery due to poverty). In addition, the notion of Canaanite slaves from the Jewish Bible is expanded to all non-Jewish slaves.|$|E

50|$|Automatic release: The most {{advanced}} release, where the rider maintains a soft, elastic, steady rein {{contact with a}} straight line from elbow to bit as the horse jumps. This release results in a great deal of control and communication between horse and rider, allowing the rider to signal to the horse what to do on landing. It allows the rider to better turn while in the air, to correct horses that jump crookedly, and to provide the support that some horses prefer over fences. It is also good on horses that need lots of control after landing. However, the <b>automatic</b> <b>release</b> requires perfect balance from the rider to be executed correctly. An unsteady rider will catch the horse in the mouth, and an incorrect <b>automatic</b> <b>release</b> will spoil a horse's jump and confidence. However, if a rider is able to perform it correctly, it is often best to use this release whenever possible. Very useful in show jumping and eventing, where control is very important.|$|E
