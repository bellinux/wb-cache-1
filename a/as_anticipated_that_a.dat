30|$|Furthermore, {{information}} sharing through credit services can alleviate the moral hazard problem. Klein (1992) showed that {{information sharing}} could motivate borrowers to repay loans. Brown and Zehnder (2007) conducted a lab experiment {{and found that}} information sharing increased repayment rates, <b>as</b> borrowers <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> good credit record improves their access to credit. Padilla and Pagano (2000) argued that sharing default cases among lenders had a disciplinary effect on borrowers, who will consider a default’s impact on their credit rating. However, sharing more detailed information about borrowers can reduce this disciplinary effect.|$|R
40|$|How does {{information}} sharing between lenders affect borrowers repayment behavior? We show-in a laboratory credit market-that {{information sharing}} increases repayment rates, <b>as</b> borrowers <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> good credit record improves {{their access to}} credit. This incentive effect of information sharing is substantial when repayment is not third-party enforceable and lending is dominated by one-shot transactions. If, however, repeat interaction between borrowers and lenders is feasible, the incentive effect of credit reporting is negligible, as bilateral banking relationships discipline borrowers. Information sharing nevertheless affects market outcome by weakening lenders' ability to extract rents from relationships. Copyright 2007 The Ohio State University. ...|$|R
40|$|Much {{of cancer}} {{genetics}} {{research has focused}} on the identification of the most-important somatic mutations ('major drivers') that cause tumour growth. However, many mutations found in cancer might not be major drivers or 'passenger' mutations, but instead might have relatively weak tumour-promoting effects. Our aim is to highlight the existence of these mutations (termed 'mini drivers' herein), as multiple mini-driver mutations might substitute for a major-driver change, especially in the presence of genomic instability or high mutagen exposure. The mini-driver model has clinical implications: for example, the effects of therapeutically targeting such genes may be limited. However, the main importance of the model lies in helping to provide a complete understanding of tumorigenesis, especially <b>as</b> we <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> increasing number of mini-driver mutations will be found by cancer genome sequencing...|$|R
50|$|Among the {{numerous}} responsibilities {{of women in}} Haiti such as employment and domestic work, mothers are also responsible for childcare and family health. The international health planning approach combines interventions that are essential to child survival, such as the GOBI strategies (growth monitoring, oral rehydration therapy, breastfeeding and immunization). The success of this primary health care program is reliant upon the behavior of mothers, <b>as</b> scientists <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> once <b>a</b> mother takes {{on one of these}} strategies she will be more receptive to other strategies.|$|R
50|$|At {{the urging}} of Hernández Mayoral, Ferrer {{converted}} a proposal by Colberg into Government Board Resolution JG-2010-003, which directly rejected free association as an option. After passing on a divided vote, the document was globally panned by soberanistas, who argued that if the liberal wing is excluded <b>that</b> would mean <b>a</b> guaranteed loss for the PPD and questioned its viability without {{the approval of the}} General Council. Hernández Mayoral expresses satisfaction and invited them to leave the party, while the conservative wing justified the move <b>as</b> one <b>that</b> <b>anticipated</b> <b>a</b> future referendum.|$|R
5000|$|The {{support for}} both {{candidates}} was about even {{up until the}} very end, however there was one vital difference. Colley {{had the support of}} virtually the entire Cabinet, while Haughey had the support of the majority of backbench TDs. While Colley believed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> short campaign would take his opponent by surprise, Haughey had been anticipating this moment for many years. A group known as the [...] "gang of five", which consisted of Tom McEllistrim, Mark Killilea, Jnr, Seán Doherty, Jackie Fahey and Albert Reynolds, had tried to whip up support for Haughey within the party for the previous few months, <b>as</b> they had <b>anticipated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> change of leadership was imminent.|$|R
5000|$|On {{learning}} of German-Japanese negotiations, Italy {{also began to}} {{take an interest in}} forming an alliance with Japan. Italy had hoped that due to Japan's long-term close relations with Britain, <b>that</b> <b>an</b> Italo-Japanese alliance could pressure Britain into adopting a more accommodating stance towards Italy in the Mediterranean. In the summer of 1936, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano informed Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura Yotaro, [...] "I have heard <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Japanese-German agreement concerning the Soviet Union has been reached, and I think it would be natural for a similar agreement to be made between Italy and Japan". Initially Japan's attitude towards Italy's proposal was generally dismissive, viewing a German-Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union as imperative while regarding an Italo-Japanese alliance as secondary, <b>as</b> Japan <b>anticipated</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> Italo-Japanese alliance would antagonize Britain that had condemned Italy's invasion of Ethiopia. This attitude by Japan towards Italy altered in 1937 after the League of Nations condemned Japan for aggression in China and faced international isolation, while Italy remained favourable to Japan. As a result of Italy's support for Japan against international condemnation, Japan took a more positive attitude towards Italy and offered proposals for a non-aggression or neutrality pact with Italy.|$|R
2500|$|The {{existence}} of the P-51 Mustang has been credited to Kelsey's dogged determination to see the project to completion. He formulated the specifications for the Curtiss XP-46 and placed an order for two prototypes in September 1939, hoping that the advanced aircraft would replace the P-40 Warhawk which had not demonstrated above-average fighting qualities. Production of the new design was canceled by General Henry [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold <b>as</b> it was <b>anticipated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> four-month delay in Curtiss fighter deliveries would be incurred by the radical change. Kelsey's boss, Colonel Oliver P. Echols, shopped the design to the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission who were told to find <b>an</b> aircraft manufacturer <b>that</b> wasn't busy with war production. Echols and Kelsey made it understood that the NACA airflow research data collected on the XP-46 would {{be made available to}} the new manufacturer. North American Aviation (NAA) expressed interest and was sold the NACA data for $56,000. They produced a new design, the NA-73, which was approved by the British who christened the fighter [...] "Mustang". Echols and Kelsey arranged to get two prototypes out of the British contract, and, on July 7, 1941, even before the prototypes arrived at Wright Field, Kelsey ordered 150 P-51s from NAA. Nine months later Kelsey ordered 500 nearly identical A-36 Apache models {{that he was able to}} purchase with funds intended for attack bombers.|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{population of}} aggressive children {{diagnosed as having}} an oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or a conduct disorder (CD) is heterogeneous, both with respect to behaviour and aetiology. Recently, the following distinction has been proposed that might further clarify this heterogeneity: reactive aggression is an aggressive response to a perceived threat or provocation, whereas proactive aggression is defined <b>as</b> behaviour <b>that</b> <b>anticipates</b> <b>a</b> reward. In this article we examine various aspects of this distinction. We will [1] examine the evidence that reactive and proactive aggression are distinct phenomena by discussing the theories underlying {{the distinction between the}} subtypes in humans and we briefly review evidence for a similar distinction in animals; [2] we critically review the literature on the measurement in children via questionnaires and behavioural observations; we then point out that the correlation observed between the subtypes {{is due to the fact}} that many children show both types of aggression; [3] we review the literature on specific characteristics of the subtypes giving attention to social information processing, peer status, biological correlates and developmental history, and demonstrate that there is some evidence to suggest that reactive and proactive aggression are distinct dimensions; [4] we discuss the relevance of the distinction between reactive and proactive aggression for child and adolescent psychiatry...|$|R
