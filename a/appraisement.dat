25|$|Three of Mayflowers owners {{applied to}} the Admiralty court for an {{appraisal}} of the ship on May 4, 1624, two years after Captain Jones' death in 1622; one of these applicants was Jones' widow Mrs. Josian (Joan) Jones. This appraisal probably was made to determine the valuation of the ship {{for the purpose of}} settling the estate of its late master. The appraisal was made by four mariners and shipwrights of Rotherhithe, home and burial place of Captain Jones, where the Mayflower was apparently then lying in the Thames at London. The <b>appraisement</b> is extant and provides information on ship's gear on board at that time, as well as equipment such as muskets and other arms. The ship may have been laid up since Jones' death and allowed to get out of repair, as that is what the appraisal indicates. The vessel was valued at one hundred and twenty-eight pounds, eight shillings, and fourpence.|$|E
25|$|The Master may, on {{receiving}} {{the statement of}} affairs, specially direct the applicant to have any property mentioned in it valued by a sworn appraiser or a person designated by the Master for this purpose (s 4(4)). The court may, when considering the application for surrender, call for an independent valuation (Ex parte Prins & another 1921 CPD 616). In {{the absence of any}} direction by the Master or the court, the debtor is not legally obliged to obtain an independent valuation in support of the values given in his statement (if he does so unnecessarily, the cost of the <b>appraisement</b> will not be allowed as part of the costs of the sequestration: Ex parte Kruger 1947 (2) SA 130 (SWA)), but he may effectively be compelled to do this if he relies on the anticipated proceeds of a single asset to show that sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors. In Ex parte Anthony en ‘n ander en ses soortgelyke aansoeke 2000 (4) SA 116 (C), it was held that an applicant who relies on {{the fact that he has}} immovable property which can be sold for the benefit of his creditors must include evidence from an expert proving the likely proceeds of the property in a forced sale (see also Ex parte Mattysen et uxor (First Rand Bank Ltd intervening) 2003 (2) SA 308 (T) 312; Ex parte Bouwer and similar applications (supra) 388—9; Investec Bank Ltd & another v Mutemeri & another 2010 (1) SA 265 (GSJ) 271; Naidoo & another v Matlala NO & others 2012 (1) SA 143 (GNP) 155).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Partial {{discharge}} (PD) diagnosis {{for large}} power transformers {{as one of}} the most powerful tools to evaluate insulating quality and characteristics should be carried out as permanent monitoring or onsite measurements with adequate sensitivity. This allows conditioned based maintenance strategies, serves asset <b>appraisements</b> and permits continuous risk assessment. Online/onsite electric PD measuring procedures according to the IEC 60270 standard so far show a limited reachable sensitivity e. g. caused by corona. Since PD also appear as source of mechanical waves in the ultra-sonic range and electromagnetic waves up to the UHF (ultra high frequencies) range additional acoustic or electromagnetic measurements are possible and helpful in online/onsite measurements. Comparative investigations with the acoustic and the UHF method revealed a very moderate damping of the UHF signals in oil and in the solid insulations in contrast to resulting attenuation of the acoustic signals. Thus a significantly higher sensitivity especially for hidden PD defects could be reached with the UHF method. Sensitive electromagnetic UHF PD measurements help to identify and localize faults which are not detectable with acoustic single impulses by simple averaging of the acoustic signals. Furthermore broad-band investigations of UHF spectra revealed cavity resonances which possibly make up the basis for advantageous narrow-band measurements...|$|R

40|$|The thesis aims at {{establishing}} {{what teachers}} of programme specific subjects {{state is the}} foundation for their assessment at the Hotel and Restaurant Programme (HR-programme). The theoretical framework of the thesis is based on social constructionism. The respondents were practising teachers of programme specific subjects at HR-programme. The empirical data based on interviews and video interviews was analyzed with: types of knowledge, key qualifications, specific vocational knowledge and skill and levels of expertise. Seven key qualifications have been discerned: independence, planning skills, problem solving skills, co-operation, customer contact, communication and power of initiative. These can be divided in three dimensions: personal, cognitive, and social/interactive. For the student, the most important to focus on for getting a higher grade is independence. Five categories of programme specific subjects have been identified: understanding the vocational area, skills in working techniques and methods, hygiene and handling work tools, as well {{the ability to see}} the whole and to act simultaneously. Differences in qualifications between levels of expertise can be identified in skills, speed and comprehensive thinking which appear to be valued more by the respondents. Key qualifications include all types of knowledge, theoretical knowledge, practical mastery and appropriate action but also a keen mind for reflection over ones actions. Appropriate action in general is assessed on the level of overall focus, the highest level of expertise, and theoretical knowledge the lowest level of expertise. There’s concordance between respondents on assessment of knowledge and skills. Students have to have a great part of specific vocational knowledge and skills to achieve the degree of Pass. The respondents’ descriptions and <b>appraisements</b> of what is assessed reflect their vocational culture where experience has a master role which could be the main reason why an inexperienced student cannot achieve higher grade levels...|$|R

60|$|In the {{application}} of these principles to purposes of practical criticism, as employed in the <b>appraisement</b> of works more or less imperfect, I have endeavoured to discover what the qualities in a poem are, which may be deemed promises and specific symptoms of poetic power, as distinguished from general talent determined to poetic composition by accidental motives, {{by an act of}} the will, rather than by the inspiration of a genial and productive nature. In this investigation, I could not, I thought, do better, than keep before me the earliest work of the greatest genius, that perhaps human nature has yet produced, our myriad-minded [61] Shakespeare.

6000|$|The speech had for Nanda's companion, however, {{no effect}} of pleasantry or irony, {{and it was}} a mark of the special {{intercourse}} of these good friends that though they showed each other, in manner and tone, such sustained consideration as might almost have given it the stamp of diplomacy, there was yet in it also something of that economy of expression which {{is the result of a}} common experience. The recurrence of opportunity to observe them together would have taught a spectator that--on Mrs. Brook's side doubtless more particularly--their relation was governed by two or three remarkably established and, as might have been said, refined laws, the spirit of which was to guard against the vulgarity so often coming to the surface between parent and child. That they WERE as good friends as if Nanda had not been her daughter was a truth that no passage between them might fail in one way or another to illustrate. Nanda had gathered up, for that matter, early in life, a flower of maternal wisdom: [...] "People talk about conscience, but it seems to me one must just bring it up to a certain point and leave it there. You can let your conscience alone if you're nice to the second housemaid." [...] Mrs. Brook was as [...] "nice" [...] to Nanda as she was to Sarah Curd--which involved, as may easily be imagined, the happiest conditions for Sarah. [...] "Well," [...] she resumed, reverting to the Duchess on a final <b>appraisement</b> of the girl's air, [...] "I really think I do well by you and that Jane wouldn't have anything to say to-day.

60|$|It {{was entirely}} in Marjorie's vein {{in those early}} days that she would want to win on every score and by every {{standard}} of reckoning. If Marjorie had been a general she would have counted no victory complete if the struggle was not sustained and desperate, and if it left the enemy with a single gun or flag, or herself with so much as a man killed or wounded. The people she wanted to impress varied very widely. She wanted to impress the Carmel girls, and the Carmel girls, she knew, with their racial trick of acute <b>appraisement,</b> were only to be won by the very highest quality all round. They had, she knew, two standards of quality, cost and distinction. As far as possible, she would give them distinction. But whenever she hesitated over something on the verge of cheapness the thought of those impending judgments tipped the balance. The Carmel girls were just two influential representatives of a host. She wanted to impress quite a number of other school and college friends. There were various shy, plastic-spirited, emotional creatures, of course, for the most part with no confidence in their own appearance, who would be impressed quite adequately enough by Trafford's good looks and witty manner and easy temper. They might perhaps fall in love with him and become slavish to her after the way of their kind, and anyhow they would be provided for, but there were plenty of others of a harder texture whose tests would be more difficult to satisfy. There were girls who were the daughters of prominent men, who must be made to understand that Trafford was prominent, girls who were well connected, who must be made to realize the subtle excellence of Trafford's blood. As she thought of Constance Graham, for example, or Ottiline Winchelsea, she felt the strongest disposition to thicken the by no means well authenticated strands that linked Trafford with the Traffords of Trafford-over-Lea. She went about the house dreaming a little apprehensively of these coming calls, and the pitiless light of criticism they would bring to bear, not indeed upon her happiness--that was assured--but upon her success.|$|E
6000|$|The second {{definite}} {{matter in}} the Dickens connection is the Smike of Miss Weston--whose prænomen I frivolously forget (though I fear it was Lizzie,) but who was afterwards Mrs. E. L. Davenport and then, sequently to some public strife or chatter, Mrs. Charles Matthews--in a version of Nicholas Nickleby that gracelessly managed to be all tearful melodrama, long-lost foundlings, wicked Ralph Nicklebys and scowling Arthur Grides, with other baffled villains, and scarcely at all Crummleses and Kenwigses, much less Squeerses; though {{there must have been}} something of Dotheboys Hall for the proper tragedy of Smike and for the broad Yorkshire effect, a precious theatrical value, of John Brodie. The ineffaceability was the anguish, to my tender sense, of Nicholas's starved and tattered and fawning and whining protégé; in face of my sharp retention of which through all the years who shall deny the immense authority of the theatre, or that the stage is the mightiest of modern engines? Such at least was to be the force of the Dickens imprint, however applied, in the soft clay of our generation; it was to resist so serenely the wash of the waves of time. To be brought up thus against the author of it, or to speak at all of the dawn of one's early consciousness of it and of his presence and power, is to begin to tread ground at once sacred and boundless, the associations of which, looming large, warn us off even while they hold. He did too much for us surely ever to leave us free--free of judgment, free of reaction, even should we care to be, which heaven forbid: he laid his hand on us in a way to undermine as in no other case the power of detached <b>appraisement.</b> We react against other productions of the general kind without [...] "liking" [...] them the less, but we somehow liked Dickens the more for having forfeited half the claim to appreciation. That process belongs to the fact that criticism, roundabout him, is somehow futile and tasteless. His own taste is easily impugned, but he entered so early into the blood and bone of our intelligence that it always remained better than the taste of overhauling him. When I take him up to-day and find myself holding off, I simply stop: not holding off, that is, but holding on, and from the very fear to do so; which sounds, I recognise, like perusal, like renewal, of the scantest. I don't renew, I wouldn't renew for the world; wouldn't, that is, with one's treasure so hoarded in the dusty chamber of youth, let in the intellectual air. Happy the house of life in which such chambers still hold out, even with the draught of the intellect whistling through the passages. We were practically contemporary, contemporary with the issues, the fluttering monthly numbers--that was the point; it made for us a good fortune, constituted for us in itself romance, on which nothing, to the end, succeeds in laying its hands.|$|E
6000|$|But manifestly the Public Libraries {{ought to}} be {{equipped}} for serious reading. Too {{many of them are}} covers without meat, or, at least, with nothing to satisfy a respectable mind hunger. And the obvious direct method to equip them is to organize an Association, to work, if possible, with the Librarians, and get this [...] "serious" [...] side of the Libraries, this vitally important side, into better order. A few men with a little money to spend could do what is wanted for the whole English-speaking world. The first business of such an Association would be to get [...] "Guides" [...] to various fields of human interest written, guides that should be clear, explicit Bibliographies, putting all the various writers into their relationships one to another, advising what books should be first taken by the beginner in the field, indicating their trend, pointing out the less technical ones and those written obscurely. Differential type might stamp the more or less important works. These Guides ought to go to every Public Library, and I think also that all sorts of people would be eager to buy them if they were known to be comprehensive, intelligent, and inclusive. They might even [...] "pay." [...] Then I would suggest this Association should make up lists of books to present an outline course or a full course corresponding to each Guide. Where books were already published in a cheap edition, the Association would merely negotiate with the publisher for the special supply of a few thousand copies of each. Where books were modern and dear the Association would negotiate with publisher and author, for the printing of a special Public Library Edition. They would then distribute these sets of books either freely or at special rates, three or four sets or more to each Library. In many cases the Association would probably find it preferable to print its editions afresh, with specially written introductions, defining the relationship of each book to the general literature of the subject. [Footnote: In America Mr. George Iles is already organizing the general <b>appraisement</b> of books for the public library reader in a most promising manner. The Bibliography of the Literature of American History, with an appraisal of each book, which has appeared under his direction, is edited by Mr. Larned, and is a most efficient performance; it is to be kept up to date by Mr. P. P. Wells, librarian of the Yale Law School. It includes an appendix by Professor Channing, of Harvard, which is on the lines of the [...] "Guides" [...] I suggest, though scarcely so full as I should like them. This appendix is reprinted separately for five cents, and it is almost all English public librarians and libraries need so far as American history goes. The English Fabian Society, I may note, publishes a sixpenny bibliography of social and economic science, but it is a mere list for local librarians, and of little use to the uninitiated reader.] ...|$|E

A brave, finished, clear-eyed image of such properties as the last-named, in particular, our already-mentioned Alexander Robertson, a faint and diminished replica of whose picture (the really fine original, as I remember it, having been long since perverted from our view) I lately renewed acquaintance with in a pious institution of his founding, where, after more than one push northward and some easy accommodations, he lives on into a world that knows him not and of some of the high improvements of which he can little enough have dreamed. Of the world he had personally known there was a feature or two still extant; the legend of his acres and his local concerns, as well as of his solid presence among them, was considerably cherished by us, though for ourselves personally the relics of his worth were a lean feast to sit at. They were by some invidious turn of fate all to help to constitute the heritage of our young kinsman, the orphaned and administered fils de famille, whose father, Alexander Wyckoff, son of our great-aunt and one of the two brothers of cousin Helen, just discernibly flushes for me through the ominous haze that preceded the worst visitation of cholera New York was to know. Alexander, whom, early widowed and a victim of that visitation, I evoke as with something of a premature baldness, of a blackness of short whisker, of an expanse of light waistcoat and of a harmless pomp of manner, appeared to have quite predominantly [...] "come in" [...] for the values in question, which he promptly transmitted to his small motherless son and which were destined so greatly to increase. There are clues I have only lost, not making out in the least to-day why the sons of Aunt Wyckoff should have been so happily distinguished. Our great-uncle of the name isn't even a dim ghost to me--he had passed away beyond recall before I began to take notice; but I hold, rightly, I feel, that it was not to his person these advantages were attached. They could have descended to our grandmother but in a minor degree--we should otherwise have been more closely aware of them. It comes to me that so far as we had at all been aware it had mostly gone off in smoke: I have still in my ears some rueful allusion to [...] "lands," [...] apparently in the general country of the Beaverkill, which had come to my mother and her sister as their share of their grandfather Robertson's amplitude, among the further-apportioned shares of their four brothers, only to be sacrificed later on at some scant <b>appraisement.</b> It is in the nature of [...] "lands" [...] at a distance and in regions imperfectly reclaimed to be spoken of always as immense, and I at any rate entertained the sense that we should have been great proprietors, in the far wilderness, if we had only taken more interest. Our interests were peculiarly urban--though not indeed that this had helped us much. Something of the mystery of the vanished acres hung for me about my maternal uncle, John Walsh, the only one who appeared to have been in respect to the dim possessions much on the spot, but I too crudely failed of my chance of learning from him what had become of them.|$|E
