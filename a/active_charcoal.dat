30|$|The {{initiation}} of adventitious root formation {{can be difficult}} because it is regulated by internal factors, including plant growth regulators such as auxins and cytokinins, {{as well as the}} genetic background (Haissig 1974; Kozlowski 1992; Friend et al. 1994; Howard 1994). However, the role of auxin on adventitious root is still not well understood. Woody plants, such as grapevine, represent a highly complex system in which endogenous hormone levels, transport, dormancy, storage, and inhibitory compounds influence adventitious root growth, and each of these are dependent on preconditioning treatments (Andersen 1986; Wilson 1994). Spiegel (1955) argued that much of the inconsistency in adventitious root research encountered for Vitis tissues was, in part, due to the existence of compounds that inhibit adventitious root formation.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of novel vehicle cabin air inlet filters to reduce diesel exhaust (DE) -induced symptoms and markers of inflammation in human subjects. METHODS: Thirty healthy subjects participated in a randomized double-blind controlled crossover study where they were exposed to filtered air, unfiltered DE and DE filtered through two selected particle filters, one with and one without <b>active</b> <b>charcoal.</b> Exposures lasted for one hour. Symptoms were assessed before and during exposures and lung function was measured before and after each exposure, with inflammation assessed in peripheral blood five hours after exposures. In parallel, PM were collected from unfiltered and filtered DE and assessed for their capacity to drive damaging oxidation reactions in a cell-free model, or promote inflammation in A 549 cells. RESULTS: The standard particle filter employed in this study reduced PM 10 mass concentrations within the exposure chamber by 46 %, further reduced to 74 % by the inclusion of an <b>active</b> <b>charcoal</b> component. In addition use of the <b>active</b> <b>charcoal</b> filter was associated by a 75 % and 50 % reduction in NO 2 and hydrocarbon concentrations, respectively. As expected, subjects reported more subjective symptoms after exposure to unfiltered DE compared to filtered air, which was significantly reduced by the filter with an <b>active</b> <b>charcoal</b> component. There were no significant changes in lung function after exposures. Similarly diesel exhaust did not elicit significant increases {{in any of the}} inflammatory markers examined in the peripheral blood samples 5  hour post-exposure.

40|$|Benzene is one {{of toxic}} air pollutants. In {{printing}} industry, benzene contained in the ink and solvent. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified benzene in the Group A (carcinogen for humans). Chronic effect of benzene exposure were defect in bone marrow which characterized by changes in blood profile. The purpose {{of this research was}} to analyze the correlation between benzene exposure and blood profile on workers in the printing industry X. The research type was an analytic observational with cross sectional approach. Blood profile includes haemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Samples were 14 workers in production department printing industry X. About 2 - 3 cc venous blood of each workers was taken for blood profile analysis. Inhaled benzene by workers taken by using personal dust sampler and carbon <b>active</b> coconut shell <b>charcoal</b> in accordance NIOSH 1501 method. Data were analyzed by univariate and bivariate using Spearman rank correlation test. The result showed that the average inhaled benzene concentration = 0. 1322 ppm. The average of haemoglobin = 14. 85 gr/dL; erythrocytes = 5. 31 x 106 cells/µL; leukocytes = 6. 8486 x 103 cells/µL; platelets = 265. 7857 x 103 cells/µL; haematocrit = 43. 5143...|$|R
40|$|Among {{numerous}} Streptomyces-strains {{isolated from}} soils, F 1001, so-called in our laboratory, exhibited the widest inhibition zone against pathogenic {{bacteria in the}} course of our screening-tests. The fact suggests that this strain has an ability to produce the antibiotic in a large amount. Spirals are formed at the ends of hyphae only on the agarmedia extremely poor in nutrients. The hyphae excrete brown pigments that diffuse into the media, when a protein component such as meat extract or peptone is added. From this the strain seems to be of Chromogenus type. Judging from several taxonomic characteristics, we have identified it as one strain of Streptomyces aureus (Waksman and Curtius) group. Cultivation of the strain on 6 kinds of media of different compositions showed the glucose bouillon medium, rendered semicolloidal by adding 0. 25 % agar, as most suitable for the production of antibiotics. Optimum pH of the broth for growth as well as for potency is 7. 0, and optimum temperature for growth is 24 ℃, while that for potency is 30 ℃. Broth filtrates inhibit the growth of Staph. aureus in about 20, 000, 000 dilution, E scher. coli in about 200, 000 dilution. Next we tried to extract active substances out of broth by the usual method and have got a white powder with pale yellowish brown tincture. As a solvent for elution of <b>active</b> substances from <b>charcoal,</b> methanol acidified by hydrochloric acid (pH 2) is excellent, and methanol acidified by sulfuric acid (same pH) falls behind. The powder gives brown colored Sakaguchi-reaction, and forms crystalline reineckate as well as helianthate. It is able to inhibit the growth of all the three groups of pathogenic bacteria i. e., Gram positive, Gram negative and acid-fast bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis bovine type). Lytic action upon bacterial bodies is not so conspicuous. Concerning heat stability, it is indifferent to 3 -minute heating at 100 ℃, while the potency decreases considerably by 5 -minute heating at 100 ℃...|$|R
40|$|Charcoal {{plays an}} {{important}} role in boreal soil function and carbon storage, and is present in most boreal forest soils as a result of naturally recurring wildfires. Charcoal management has been proposed as a potentially valuable tool for addressing long term issues of global carbon cycles and sustainability of forest management. However, a proper understanding of boreal charcoal stocks and their effect on boreal soil carbon balance is imperative for successful application. The objectives of this thesis were to 1) review the role of boreal charcoal carbon stocks on boreal soil carbon balance; 2) determine naturally occurring wildfire derived charcoal stocks in North American boreal forests and compare these to laboratory produced charcoal; and 3) determine the risk of charcoal additions priming the decomposition of boreal soil organic matter. A review of the literature of boreal soil charcoal studies found wildfires convert 0. 7 - 2 % of biomass to charcoal, with charcoal in boreal soils accounting for 1 Pg of carbon globally. Charcoal is highly aromatized and represents a form recalcitrant carbon, with half-lives one to two orders of magnitude greater than other soil organic matter, being able to remain onsite for millennia. However, due to a lack of soil mixing processes, charcoal in boreal soils is vulnerable to re-combustion in recurring fires, inhibiting the accumulation of charcoal over time, unlike in other fire prone ecosystems. Boreal charcoal stocks appear to be highly variable, depending on the intensity of fire. Increased fire intensity results in greater charcoal formation. Charcoal stocks in this thesis were 2 - 3 times greater than those reported for other boreal ecosystems where non-stand replacing fires are the predominant disturbance; suggesting global estimates of boreal charcoal carbon stocks may need to be revised upwards to account for greater wildfire intensity in North American boreal forests. Within boreal forests, charcoal is an important driver of soil function, stimulating microbial activity and nitrogen mineralization and decreasing phenolic concentrations. High productivity in post-fire stands has been attributed in part to the presence of <b>active,</b> newly produced <b>charcoal</b> that helps to reverse long term declines in productivity with increasing time since fire. Changes in carbon content and chemical composition, however, occur over time, especially in the first ~ 100 years...|$|R
