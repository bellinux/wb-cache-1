500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{confirmed}} in January 2014, a new court show conceived by Sheindlin titled Hot Bench debuted on September 15, 2014. The courtroom series features {{a panel of}} three judges debating and deciding on cases brought to their TV courtroom. Stated Sheindlin, [...] "When my husband Jerry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds {{to serve as the}} judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench." [...] The panel of judges consist of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango, and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman. As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench is executive-produced by Randy Douthit, and produced by CBS Television Distribution. It {{is important to note that}} Sheindlin originally desired the title of her personal courtroom series to be [...] "Hot Bench" [...] before producers ultimately settled on [...] "Judge Judy." ...|$|E

Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E

2500|$|Byrne joined Claremont {{beginning}} with The X-Men #108 (Dec. 1977). Their work together, along with inker Terry Austin, on such classic story arcs as [...] "Proteus", [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga", and [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] {{would make them}} both fan favorites. Byrne insisted that the title keep its Canadian character, Wolverine, and contributed a series of story elements to justify Wolverine's presence which eventually made the character {{among the most popular}} in Marvel's publishing history. With issue #114, Byrne began co-plotting the series as well as penciling. Claremont recounted that [...] "at that point in time John <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> a very real sense, true collaborators on the book. It was with very few exceptions, difficult, for me, anyway, to tell in the actual gestation of the book where one of us left off and the other began - because it involved one of us coming up with an idea and bouncing it off the other ..." [...] The [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga" [...] in 1980 {{is one of the most}} notable stories in the title's history. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that [...] "'The Dark Phoenix Saga' is to Claremont and Byrne what the 'Galactus Trilogy' is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators' work at the height of their abilities." [...] Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan, and has said that they were [...] "almost constantly at war over who the characters were." [...] Byrne created the characters Alpha Flight, Proteus, and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat during his run on The X-Men. A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] storyline (#141-142, Jan.-Feb. 1981) in which a time-travelling Kitty Pryde tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. Byrne plotted the story wanting to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. Byrne left The X-Men with #143 (March 1981). During his tenure on the series, The X-Men was promoted from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule, with a steady sales incline that continued long after Byrne left.|$|E
