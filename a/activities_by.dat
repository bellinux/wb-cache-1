5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal <b>activities.</b> <b>By</b> the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
5|$|By 1919, the {{influence}} of Chinese Civil War had spread to Sarawak when Kuomintang set up its first branches in Sibu and Kuching. Charles Brooke opposed such political activity by the local Chinese and had expelled several local Kuomintang leaders. However, Charles Vyner Brooke was more receptive of such <b>activities</b> <b>by</b> local Chinese. The local Chinese also participated in a donation drive to aid Kuomintang in its fight against Japanese invasion on China mainland. After World War II ended, local Kuomintang leaders supported the cessation of Sarawak to British as Crown Colony but the local communist leaders were against it. Clashes between the communist and the Kuomintang supporters were common. The Kuomintang branches in Sarawak were finally dissolved in 1949 when the party lost a war on China mainland to the Communist party and retreated to Taiwan. However, clashes between the both sides continued until 1955 when Kuomintang's newspaper was banned by the colonial British government in May 1951; while Communist's newspapar ceased to exist in 1955 due to financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research <b>activities.</b> <b>By</b> this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public <b>activities</b> <b>by</b> initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those in the public arena. Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E

Eventually, the fleet reached Catania in Sicily, from where Belisarius sent Procopius ahead to Syracuse to gather intelligence on the Vandals' <b>activities.</b> <b>By</b> chance, Procopius met a merchant friend of his there, whose servant had just arrived from Carthage. The latter informed Procopius that not only were the Vandals unaware of Belisarius' sailing, but that Gelimer, who had just dispatched Tzazon's expedition to Sardinia, was away from Carthage at the small inland town of Hermione. Procopius quickly informed Belisarius, who immediately ordered the army to re-embark and set sail for the African coast. After sailing by Malta, they reached Cape Caputvada on the eastern shore of modern Tunisia some 162 Roman miles (240km) south from Carthage.|$|E
