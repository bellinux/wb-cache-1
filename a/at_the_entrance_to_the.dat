5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its {{atmosphere}} was inhospitable by the standards of later generations.

Decisions about book selections and the library's program were {{in the hands of an}} all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.|$|E

In 2010, the B.C. Court of Appeal ruled that the city's order to remove the protest structures was unconstitutional, and the structure was restored.|$|E

A number of local Maya men and women had also been hanged but not decapitated, and the attackers had burned the town.|$|E
