40|$|The use of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) {{recommended}} by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has significantly increased during the past years in the design, control and monitoring of pharmaceutical or chemical manufacturing processes. Nowadays, PAT is also commonly used in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). Some PAT techniques employ on-line fiber-optic sensors to acquire non-destructive measurements of physical properties. In this thesis we demonstrated that these methods {{can also be used}} to obtain kinetic information of dissolved and solid fractions of molecular substances in slurries in real time.   The main objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive model for DuPont's sulfonylurea coupling reaction for monitoring purposes (e. g. detect process upsets, detect endpoints, and forecast changes). The comprehensive model will allow us to estimate the kinetics of the reaction, the kinetics of dissolution, and the kinetics of crystallization.   Before such a complex model can be developed, it was necessary to conduct experiments in a simpler system (e. g. salicylic acid in water-ethanol mixtures). These experiments were designed so the process of dissolution and the process of crystallization could be observed independently of one another and independently of chemical reactions. Consequently, we were able to elucidate an appropriate model for each process in our small-scale semi-batch reactor.   For the simpler system, this study used attenuated total reflectance ultra-violet visible (ATR UV-vis) spectroscopy for kinetic modeling of the dissolution and crystallization of salicylic acid in ethanol-water. The dissolution model, which relied on a power-law equation, was obtained by adding aliquots of an ethanol-water mixture into a salicylic <b>acid</b> <b>slurry.</b> Near-infrared (NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to detect and quantify the solid fraction present in a slurry. Using a Partial Least-Squares (PLS) calibration, we were able to verify and validate the kinetic model. A temperature probe was also used to monitor heat changes involved in these experiments.   M.

Processing the leach solution directly to recover metals has the advantage over the conventional metal salt recovery system which usually requires the expensive chemical purification steps to get high added-value chemicals. Metals were recovered from dilute solutions using fluidised bed electrolysis in an easily dissolved form to produce added value-chemicals. A detailed study on the separation of cobalt and nickel from cobalt-nickel cake by oxidative precipitation using Caro's acid as an oxidant is also reported. Following encouraging laboratory studies the process was successfully tested on pilot scale at a copper nickel smelter. The cobalt level was brought down from 8. 6 g/l to 50 ppm with the pH kept above 4. Studies have also been carried out for the recovery of gold along with other metals from computer scrap. Following nitric acid pretreatment the gold was recovered using acidic thiourea leaching method. The manufacture of arsenic acid from arsenic(IH) oxide by nitric acid was also studied. Two reported methods are, (1) standard method (addition of solid arsenic oxide to hot <b>acid)</b> and (2) <b>slurry</b> method (addition of <b>acid</b> to <b>slurried</b> arsenic oxide). The problems associated with the standard method are, (a) Excessive foaming and (b) Evolution of large volume of gases leads to uncontrollable reaction.

The digesters received a daily feedstock of cattle feed and Bermuda grass, with some digesters receiving additional supplements of propionate, butyrate, or nitrate. Microbial biomass, measured as total extractable lipid phosphate, was decreased in slurries from digesters receiving continuous addition of the fermentation intermediates propionate or butyrate as compared with slurries from control digesters receiving the feedstock alone. In slurries from digesters that received continuous addition of nitrate, the microbial biomass was {{higher than in the}} slurries from control digesters.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{distribution}} of lipid fatty acids was studied in marine sediment slurries in which sulphate reduction had been {{stimulated by the}} addition of acetate, propionate, lactate or hydrogen. Acetate was directly oxidized to carbon dioxide at the expense of sulphate, propionate was incompletely oxidized to acetate at the expense of sulphate, and lactate was largely fermented (approximately 75 %) to propionate and acetate, with the propionate subsequently utilized for sulphate reduction. Changes in the lipid fatty <b>acids</b> within these <b>slurries</b> were interpreted by comparison with the lipid fatty acid profiles of pure cultures of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Desulfobacter sp. and Desulfobulbus sp. Desulfobacter sp. seems to be the main acetate-utilizing sulphate-reducing bacterium, as in both the slurry and the original sediment the lipid fatty acids in the C 12 -C 18 range (where bacterial contributions would be expected) were dominated by even chain fatty acids similar to the lipid fatty acid {{distribution of}} Desulfobacter sp. Desulfobulbus sp. appears to be responsible for propionate oxidation and also for hydrogen consumption as its biomarker fatty acid n-C 17 : 1 was increased significantly {{by the addition of}} either propionate or hydrogen. Surprisingly, the biomarker for Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (br-C 17 : 1) was not stimulated in any of the sediment slurries.

One {{step in the process}} of producing ethanol from lignocellulose is enzymatic hydrolysis, which produces fermentable sugars from carbohydrates present in the corn stover in the form of cellulose and hemicellulose. A pretreatment step is crucial to achieve efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to soluble sugars, and later ethanol. This study has investigated steam pretreatment of corn stover, with and without sulphuric acid as catalyst, and examined the effect of residence time (5 – 10 min) and temperature (190 – 210 °C) on glucose and xylose recovery. The pretreatment conditions with and without dilute acid that gave the highest glucose yield were then used in subsequent experiments. Materials pretreated at the optimal conditions were subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) to produce ethanol, and remaining organic compounds were used to produce biogas by anaerobic digestion (AD). Results The highest glucose yield achieved was 86 %, obtained after pretreatment at 210 °C for 10 minutes in the absence of catalyst, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. The highest yield using sulphuric acid, 78 %, was achieved using pretreatment at 200 °C for 10 minutes. These two pretreatment conditions were investigated using two different process configurations. The highest ethanol and methane yields were obtained from the material pretreated in the presence of sulphuric <b>acid.</b> The <b>slurry</b> in this case was split into a solid fraction and a liquid fraction, where the solid fraction was used to produce ethanol and the liquid fraction to produce biogas. The total energy recovery in this case was 86 % of the enthalpy of combustion energy in corn stover. Conclusions The highest yield, comprising ethanol, methane and solids, was achieved using pretreatment in the presence of sulphuric acid followed by a process configuration in which the slurry from the pretreatment was divided into a solid fraction and a liquid fraction. The solid fraction was subjected to SSF, while the liquid fraction, together with the filtered residual from SSF, was used in AD. Using sulphuric acid in AD did not inhibit the reaction, which {{may be due to the}} low concentration of sulphuric acid used. In contrast, a pretreatment step without sulphuric acid resulted not only in higher concentrations of inhibitors, which affected the ethanol yield, but also in lower methane production. </p...|$|R
40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1099 – 1102 Chocolate is {{a complex}} sample with a high content of organic {{compounds}} and its analysis generally involves digestion procedures that might include the risk of losses and/or contamination. The determination of copper in chocolate is important because copper compounds are extensively used as fungicides in the farming of cocoa. In this paper, a slurry-sampling flame atomicabsorption spectrometric method is proposed for determination of copper in powdered chocolate samples. Optimization was carried out using univariate methodology involving the variables nature and concentration of the <b>acid</b> solution for <b>slurry</b> preparation, sonication time, and sample mass. The recommended conditions include a sample mass of 0. 2 g, 2. 0 mol L 1 hydrochloric acid solution, and a sonication time of 15 min. The calibration curve was prepared using aqueous copper standards in 2. 0 mol L 1 hydrochloric acid. This method allowed determination of copper in chocolate with a detection limit of 0. 4 lg g 1 and precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), of 2. 5 % (n= 10) for a copper content of approximately 30 lg g 1, using a chocolate mass of 0. 2 g. The accuracy was confirmed by analyzing the certified reference materials NIST SRM 1568 a rice flour and NIES CRM 10 -b rice flour. The proposed method was used for determination of copper in three powdered chocolate samples, the copper content of which varied between 26. 6 and 31. 5 lg g 1. The results showed no significant differences with those obtained after complete digestion, using a t-test for comparison...|$|R
40|$|RESTRITOThe wheat {{is one of}} the cereals more {{consumed}} in the human food in all worlds. In the form of flour it is used for preparation of breads, cookies, pizzas, cakes, and etc. This way, the knowledge of the mineral content this cereal and its flour is very important. Considering it, methods for determination of metals in these matrices are opportune and several papers have been performed. In this paper, a slurry sampling flame atomic absorption spectrometric method for the determination of manganese in wheat flour is proposed. The optimization step was performed using univariate methodology involving the variables: nature and concentration of the <b>acid</b> solution for <b>slurry</b> preparation, sonication time and sample mass. The established experimental conditions after optimization recommend a sample mass of 0. 5 g, 2. 0 mol L 1 nitric acid solution and a sonication time of 15 min. This method allows the determination of manganese in wheat flour using the standard calibration technique, with a detection limit of 0. 13 lg g 1, and a precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3. 5 % (n = 10) for a manganese content of about 7. 6 lg g 1 and using a wheat flour mass of 0. 5 g. The accuracy was confirmed by analyzing of three certified reference materials of rice flours. The proposed method was applied for the determination of manganese in seven samples of wheat flour acquired in supermarkets from Salvador City, Brazil. In these, the manganese content varied of 5. 2 and 7. 6 lg g 1. The results showed no significant differences with those obtained after complete digestion of these samples and manganese determination also using FAAS...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphism, {{crystal shape}} and {{solubility}} of 1, 4 -dihydroxyanthraquinone (quinizarin) {{have been investigated}} in acetic acid, acetone, acetonitrile, n-butanol and toluene. The solubility of FI and FII from 20 degrees C to 45 degrees C has been determined by a gravimetric method. By slow evaporation, pure FI was obtained from n-butanol and toluene, pure FII was obtained from acetone, while either a mixture of the two forms or pure FI was obtained from acetic <b>acid</b> and acetonitrile. <b>Slurry</b> conversion experiments have established an enantiotropic {{relationship between the two}} polymorphs and that the commercially available FI is actually a metastable polymorph of quinizarin under ambient conditions. However, in the absence of FII, FI is kinetically stable for many days over the temperature range and in the solvents investigated. FI and FII have been characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission and ordinary powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) at different temperatures. The crystal structure of FII has been determined by single-crystal XRD. DSC and high-temperature PXRD have shown that both FI and FII will transform into a not previously reported hightemperature form (FIII) around 185 degrees C before this form melts at 200 - 202 degrees C. By indexing FIII PXRD data, a triclinic P (1) over bar cell was assigned to FIII. The solubility of quinizarin FI and FII in the pure organic solvents used in the present work is below 2. 5 % by weight and decreases in the order: toluene, acetone, acetic acid, acetonitrile and n-butanol. The crystal shapes obtained in different solvents range from thin rods to flat plates or very flat leaves, with no clear principal difference observed between FI and FII. Publishedpeer-reviewe...|$|R

Optimization was carried out using univariate methodology involving the following variables: nature and concentration of the <b>acid</b> solution for <b>slurry</b> preparation, sonication time and sample mass. The optimized conditions were 80 mg of sample ground in a cryogenic mil, dilution using 1. 0 mol L 1 nitric /hydrochloric acid solution, sonication time of 30 min and a slurry volume of 10 mL. The calibration curves had been prepared using standards of copper, manganese and iron also in 1. 0 molL 1 nitric/hydrochloric acid solution. This method allowed the determination of copper, manganese and iron by FAAS, with detection limits of 0. 17, 0. 09 and 0. 46 mg g 1, respectively. The precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), are 3. 0 %, 2. 9 % and 3. 8 % (n ¼ 10), for concentrations of copper, manganese and iron of 17, 22 and 719 mgg 1, respectively. The accuracy of the method was confirmed by analysis of the certified oyster tissue (NIST 1566 b). The proposed method was applied for the determination of copper, manganese and iron in samples of oyster, clams and mussels, collected in Ubatuba and Todos os Santos Bay, Brazil. The obtained concentrations varied between 17. 1 and 143. 9 mg g 1, 17. 9 and 29. 7 mg g 1 and 364 and 1388 mgg 1, respectively, for copper, manganese and iron.
