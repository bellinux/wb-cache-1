40|$|Phase Unwrapping {{is a key}} step in {{deriving}} topographic {{information from}} Interferometric SAR. Several recent methods <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> cost network flow approach. In this paper we develop a new, computationally efficient, "divideand -conquer" strategy for phase unwrapping. INTRODUCTION The well-studied Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) problem for DEM generation involves the derivation of topographic information from radar phase. The topography {{is proportional to the}} full phase, whereas the measured phase is modulo 2, necessitating the process of recovering full phase values via phase unwrapping. In general, the presence of noise, phase discontinuities, and the sheer size of the problem make phase-unwrapping challenging. Our research is motivated by recent work[1, 2] which models the phase unwrapping problem as a discrete optimization problem. We define OE(i; j) and /(i; j) as the unwrapped and wrapped phase functions respectively, where the indices i; j live in [...] ...|$|E
30|$|During {{the last}} 20 years, many speckle filters for SAR images were {{developed}} and documented. Speckle noise {{is a common}} phenomenon in all coherent imaging systems like laser, acoustic, and SAR imagery. The source of this noise is attributed to random interference between the coherent returns issued from the numerous scatterers present on a surface, {{on the scale of}} a wavelength of the incident radar. Speckle noise gives the SAR image a grainy appearance and prevents target recognition and texture analysis efficiently. Obviously, speckle filtering turns out to be an important preprocessing step for some detection or classification optimization. Because speckle noise has the characteristics of a random multiplicative, thus traditional filtering will not remove it easily. In practice, the most widely used filters such as Lee (Enhanced Lee), Kuan and Frost filters <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Minimum</b> Mean Square Error (MMSE) criterion. Thus, in this section, we briefly describe the representative MMSE method, that is, Lee filter and background of level set.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a new recursive {{structural equation model}} where all variables can be written as max-linear function of their parental node variables and independent noise variables. The model is max-linear {{in terms of the}} noise variables, and its causal structure is represented by a directed acyclic graph. We detail the relation between the weights of the recursive structural equation model and the coefficients in its max-linear representation. In particular, we characterize all max-linear models which are generated by a recursive structural equation model, and show that its max-linear coefficient matrix is the solution of a fixed point equation. We also find a unique minimum directed acyclic graph representing the recursive structural equations of the variables. The model structure introduces a natural order between the node variables and the max-linear coefficients. This yields representations of the vector components, which <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> number of node and noise variables. Comment: 29 page...|$|E

While tag clouds effectively {{show the}} relative frequency and thus popularity of tags, {{they fail to}} convey two aspects tothe users: (1) the similarity between tags, and (2) the abstractness of tags. We suggest an alternative to tag clouds known as tag hierarchies. Tag hierarchies <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> evolution-based greedy algorithm for tag hierarchy construction, which iteratively includes optimal tags into the tree that introduce minimum changes to the existing taxonomy. Our algorithm also uses a global tag ranking method to order tags according to their levels of tags will appear at higher levels in the taxonomy. Based on the tag hierarchy, we derive a new tag recommendation algorithm, which is a structure-based approach that does not require heavily trained models and thus is highly efficient. User studies and quantitative analysis suggest that (1) the tag hierarchy can potentially reduce the user’s tagging time in comparison to tag clouds and other tag tree structures, and (2) the tag recommendation algorithm significantly outperforms existing content-based methods in quality...|$|E

40|$|Background: The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) {{disseminates}} {{information on}} {{a broad range of}} health topics through diverse publications. These publications must rely on clear and transparent presentation standards that can be broadly and efficiently applied. Standards are particularly important for large, cross-cutting reports where estimates cannot be individually evaluated and indicators of precision cannot be included alongside the estimates. Objective: This report describes the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions. Results: The multistep NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> denominator sample size and on the absolute and relative widths of a confidence interval calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Proportions (usually multiplied by 100 and expressed as percentages) are the most commonly reported estimates in NCHS reports. Conclusions: The NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions will be applied to all NCHS publications. Using these Standards, some estimates will be identified as unreliable and suppressed and some estimates will be flagged for statistical review. For reports where estimates are evaluated individually, a particular proportion not meeting the NCHS Data Presentation Standards could be identified as unreliable but not be suppressed if it can be interpreted appropriately in the context of subject-specific factors and report objectives.

40|$|Understanding how {{wildlife}} populations {{respond to}} selection pressures imposed by environmental and anthropogenic conditions {{is important in}} wildlife management. Sport harvest, habitat alteration, climate change and population density are all selective pressures that may affect individual fitness, population dynamics and ultimately population viability. Our knowledge of how management practices and the multitude of ecological conditions are affecting the evolution of wildlife populations is extremely limited. I analyzed a 25 -year data set on horn growth and age of bighorn sheep rams in two populations in the southern interior of British Columbia. I examined how harvest regulations, weather, and habitat degradation affected horn length of harvested bighorn rams. I found that age-specific horn growth can predict {{the age at which}} rams are harvested: rams with rapidly growing horns are harvested at younger ages than rams with slow-growing horns. Management regimes that result in an average harvest age much below the reproductive peak of males, <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> horn or antler size and remove mature reproductive males disproportionately to subordinate males are likely to have a selective effect. I found that over 25 years of records, the age-adjusted horn length of bighorn sheep rams in the South Okanagan declined by 10 %. That decline could be attributed to intense selective hunting, as well as severe habitat deterioration that became worse over time. In addition, ram horn growth was slowed in years with hot summer temperatures, suggesting that weather in summer may be important in horn growth. We know little about how wildlife populations are reacting and changing to novel selection pressures, such as introduced species, human-induced habitat and climate change. In general, wildlife management regimes aim to maintain large, healthy populations and attempts to harvest wildlife at a sustainable level. Management actions, however do not necessarily meet the intended goals. Knowledge of biological systems allows us to ask and answer important questions about the directions of adaptations in natural populations. My research examines possible selective pressures on a wildlife population over a short time period, considering management strategies, habitat change and climate and suggests that human actions may have resulted in evolutionary change. While wildlife management has contributed well to population dynamics and habitat relationships, it cannot ignore the possible evolutionary consequences of human behavior and management strategies that can result in rapidly occurring genetic change. In order to develop sustainable harvests, potential evolutionary consequences must be considered...|$|E

40|$|At the Swedish Maritime Administration, Sjöfartsverket, {{work with}} {{updating}} the nationalregulations on {{safety at sea}} and environmental effects has begun. The goal is to update theregulations and present them {{in a similar way}} as the international. The new regulation onfreeboard and stability for ships in national traffic are the first where this new structure is tobe applied. This thesis focus on an analysis of the changes in the regulation on load line and stability andthe effects that this may have on existing ships in some of the sheltered and near coast areas inthe home waters of Sweden. To achieve this, a number of general ship geometries have been designed to correspond to alarge number of existing ships, so that general conclusions from the study can be drawn. The ships that have been investigated are: traditional passenger ships, taxi boats, charterboats and Sea Trucks. The ships in the study have been examined with respect to stability, motions in waves andstability after damages to find out if and how the suggested changes of the regulations willaffect the fleet. But first, which are the major changes? Freeboard: Today the demand on height of hatch comings, air inlets etc are stipulated as aminimum distance above the freeboard. In the new directives the aim is sharper connectionsbetween freeboard and stability. Therefore the new demands <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> heelangel to the openings instead of a fixed distance. The minimum heel angel will be 30 ° ingeneral and 40 ° to engine room for the E and D areas. Stability: The Swedish demand on maximum righting lever arm, GZmax, for at least 30 ° ofheel, and a stability range of at least 60 ° is suggested to be abolished and replaced by weathercriterion with reduced wind pressure in the C and D areas for ships 24 m or longer. Stability after damage: The only difference from the current regulations is that restrictedflotation after damage is initiated also in the E area for new passenger ships. The results from the analysis show on small effects according to stability. On some shipsparticularly air inlets to engine room has to be moved to achieve the demands on freeboard. For ships maintaining service in the D area the ship motion calculation shows that windowsand doors can be exposed to quite large amounts of water for some headings and speeds,which means that windows and doors and there framings need to be of accurate strength. Finally the analysis shows that there is a possibility to fulfil the restricted demands onstability after damage if the bulkheads are made watertight. The traditional passenger shipwill however only survive damages in the fore and aft peaks. Damages elsewhere willeventually result in loss of the ship. NR 2014080...|$|E

It is a distinctive, {{somewhat}} vulnerable, mostly orophilous species. Fresh and dry herbarium material {{was used for}} this study. Herbarium material for anatomical studies comes from CTES, BA, LP, MA, SI and UC (Holmgren et al. 1990). Selected representative specimens are additionally cited after taxonomic treatment of the species. Dry material was restored with aqueous 4 : 1 butil cellosolve. Pinnae were cleared with aqueous 6 % NaOH, then coloured with aqueous 1 % TBO (Gurr 1966). 							Hand made transverse sections of young and adult stipes, and costae were done in fresh and restored herbarium material. Venation and epidermal patterns were analyzed in basal, apical and medium pinnae, but only the latter were illustrated. The size and density of stomata were measured in medium pinnae from all studied samples, values shown are the average of 25 measures per sample; sizes are expressed as minimum, media and maximum length x width, in μm, and density as minimum, media and maximum number of stomata / mm 2. Spores were studied with SEM, mounted on metal stubs with double sided tape, covered with gold under vacuum and photographed with a Jeol /EO JSM 6360 (15 KV) SEM. Spores were also studied with light microscope, mounted in DePeX (DePeX mounting medium, Gurr, BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole BH 15 1 TD, UK) and measured using an ocular micrometer. Measurements <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> sample of 100 spores taken from different specimens. Sizes are expressed as the longest equatorial diameter/ polar diameter, in μm. Gametophytes were studied from material collected in the subtropical forest of Tucumán Province, Argentina. Spore samples for cultures were taken from single sporophytes kept dry at room temperature since the date plants were collected. 							Gametophytes were grown under fluorescent light. Multispore cultures were established on mineral agar. 							Percentage of germination was recorded for {{a random sample of}} 50 spores from each of the two plates, every three days until there was no further increasing. Gametophytes were stained with chloral hydrate acetocarmine. 							The species has large sporophytes, suberect, scaly rhizomes, and dimorphic fronds with short, scaly stipes and lanceolate to elliptic sterile laminae. The rachises can grow indefinitely as radicant axis that vegetatively multiplicate the plants. Pinnae are lanceolate, herbaceous, with crenate and papillose margins, superficially scaly and hairy, peciolulate, with free, visible veins regularly once furcated near the costa, ending in large, active hydathodes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to improve {{flexible}} base course performance within the state of Texas while reducing TxDOT?s testing burden. The focus of this study was to revise the current specification with the intent of providing a ?performance related? specification while optimizing sample sizes and testing frequencies based on material variability. A literature review yielded information on base course variability within and outside the state of Texas, and on what tests other states, and Canada, are currently using to characterize flexible base performance. A sampling and testing program was conducted at Texas A&M University to define current variability information, and to conduct performance related tests including resilient modulus and permanent deformation. In addition to these data being more current, they are more representative of short-term variability than data obtained from the literature. This ?short-term? variability is considered more realistic for what typically occurs during construction operations. A statistical sensitivity analysis (based on the 80 th percentile standard deviation) of these data was conducted to determine minimum sample sizes for contractors to qualify for the proposed quality monitoring program (QMP). The required sample sizes for contractors to qualify for the QMP are 20 for gradation, compressive strength, and moisture-density tests, 15 for Atterberg Limits, and 10 for Web Ball Mill. These sample sizes <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> 25, 000 ton stockpile, or ?lot?. After qualifying for the program, if contractors can prove their variability is better than the 80 th percentile, they can reduce their testing frequencies. The sample size for TxDOT?s verification testing is 5 samples per lot and will remain at that number regardless of reduced variability. Once qualified for the QMP, a contractor may continue to send material to TxDOT projects until a failing sample disqualifies the contractor from the program. TxDOT does not currently require washed gradations for flexible base. Dry and washed sieve analyses were performed during this study to investigate the need for washed gradations. Statistical comparisons of these data yielded strong evidence that TxDOT should always use a washed method. Significant differences between the washed and dry method were determined for the percentage of material passing the No. 40 and No. 200 sieves. Since TxDOT already specifies limits on the fraction of material passing the No. 40 sieve, and since this study yielded evidence of that size fraction having a relationship with resilient modulus (performance), it would be beneficial to use a washed sieve analysis and therefore obtain a more accurate reading for that specification. Furthermore, it is suggested the TxDOT requires contractors to have ?target? test values, and to place 90 percent within limits (90 PWL) bands around those target values to control material variability...|$|E
