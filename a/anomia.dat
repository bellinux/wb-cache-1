25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{of people with}} aphasia can range from occasional trouble finding words to losing the ability to speak, read, or write; intelligence, however, is unaffected. Expressive language and receptive language can both be affected as well. Aphasia also affects visual language such as sign language. In contrast, the use of formulaic expressions in everyday communication is often preserved. One prevalent deficit in the aphasias is <b>anomia,</b> which is a deficit in word finding ability.|$|E

In 2000, Belfagor retired from his musical activities {{to concentrate on}} his occult studies and practices. In 2003, while in prison, Hakola started composing again. In 2004, he was joined by singer Nebiros again, and they recruited drummer Tore [...] "Shiva" [...] Stjerna, who had produced the Mystérion Tés <b>Anomias</b> single. After he served another prison sentence, Hakola got in contact with guitarist Atum, and through him with bassist Tehôm. In December 2004, the band recorded two songs for the Mystérion Tés <b>Anomias</b> re-release through Norma Evangelium Diaboli; on the re-release, Hakola used the new pseudonym [...] "Michayah", and Nebiros called himself Leviathan.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Semantic {{dementia}} {{is characterized}} by fluent, phonologically adequate speech with various <b>anomias</b> and semantic paraphasias. Performance on semantic tasks is well documented in these patients, although little is known regarding performance on more complex language tasks, such as those involving non-literal language (interpretation of metaphors and proverbs and recognition of irony). Objective: To report the investigation of non-literal language in cases of semantic dementia. Methods: Two cases of semantic dementia were investigated {{for the presence of}} deficits in non-literal language abilities using the screening test for Alzheimer's disease with proverbs, metaphor test and irony test. Results: Both patients were found to have low performance on the tests applied, particularly for interpretation of proverbs. Conclusion: This poor performance was attributed largely to the characteristic semantic changes of the disease, but some frontal symptoms inherent to other forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration were also observed which interfered in the testing, such as negativism, reduced attention span, concretism and perseverations...|$|R
25|$|Intensity of {{treatment}} should be individualized {{based on the}} recency of stroke, therapy goals, and other patient-specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation. Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity {{and is able to}} tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke. Some patients cannot tolerate therapy directly after a stroke due to confusion or exhaustion, but may tolerate therapy better later. Intensity {{of treatment}} after a stroke should be dependent on the patient’s motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy. Level of intensity also depends on therapy goals; for certain goals non-intensive therapy is more beneficial. For example, non-intensive therapy {{has been found to be}} more effective than intensive therapy when targeting naming accuracy in patients with <b>anomia.</b> This is because more time in between sessions allows for rehearsal and reinforces long term learning.|$|E
25|$|The term Anomic Aphasia usually {{refers to}} {{patients}} whose only prevalent symptom is impaired word retrieval in speech and writing. Typically, the spontaneous speech {{of a person}} with anomic aphasia is fluent and grammatically correct but contains many word retrieval failures. These failures lead to unusual pauses, talking around the intended word, or substituting a different word for the intended word. Anomic aphasia is the mildest form of aphasia, indicating a likely possibility for better recovery. Patients with Broca’s aphasia may also have difficulty with word retrieval, or <b>anomia.</b> In addition, patients with Broca’s aphasia comprehend spoken and written language better than they can speak or write. These patients self-monitor, are aware of their communicative impairments, and frequently try to repeat or attempt repairs. The preceding factors discussed correlate with a good prognosis for patients with Broca’s aphasia. Many patients with an acute onset of Broca’s aphasia eventually progress to milder forms of aphasia, such as conduction or anomic.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject matter}} {{of this article is}} Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition as it has been exposed in his more recent book, Das Recht der Freiheit. Throughout the paper his {{attempts}} to describe injustices within modern capitalist societies using the notions of pathologies and anomie will be analyzed and criticized, especially from the viewpoint of their inability to deal with processes and contexts of disrecognition (Aberkennung). With help of this category, Honneth’s diagnosis regarding the moral progress in modern societies, as well as his notion of second order disorders, as injustices will be confronted and, hopefully, complemented. Este artigo visa tratar da teoria do reconhecimento de Axel Honneth conforme exposta em seu mais recete livro, Das Recht der Freiheit. Ao longo do texto serão analisadas e criticadas as tentativas deste autor de apreender as desigualdades presentes nas esferas de reconhecimento descritas por ele em sociedades modernas. O principal foco de atenção aqui é a incapacidade dos diagnósticos sobre patologias e <b>anomias</b> em descrever processos e contextos de desreconhecimento (Aberkennung). Através desta ideia, por fim, um complemento ao diagnóstico de Honneth acerca do progresso moral e das “desordens de segunda ordem” como injustiça será confrontado e, espera-se, complementado...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Although {{diffusion}} tensor imaging (DTI) and postmortem dissections {{improved the}} knowledge of white matter (WM) anatomy, functional information is lacking. Our aims are: to provide a subcortical atlas of human brain functions; to elucidate the functional roles of different bundles; to provide a probabilistic resection map of WM. Experimental design: We studied 130 patients who underwent awake surgery for gliomas (82 left; 48 right) with electrostimulation mapping at cortical and subcortical levels. Different aspects of language, sensori-motor, spatial cognition, and visual functions were monitored. 339 regions of interest (ROIs) including the functional response errors collected during stimulation were co-registered in the MNI space, {{as well as the}} resections' areas and residual tumors. Functional response errors and resection areas were matched with DTI and cortical atlases. Subcortical maps for each function and a probability map of resection were computed. Principal observations: The medial part of dorsal stream (arcuate fasciculus) subserves phonological processing; its lateral part [indirect anterior portion of the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF) ] subserves speech planning. The ventral stream subserves language semantics and matches with the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle. Reading deficits match with the inferior longitudinal fascicle. <b>Anomias</b> match with the indirect posterior portion of the SLF. Frontal WM underpins motor planning and execution. Right parietal WM subserves spatial cognition. Sensori-motor and visual fibers were the most preserved bundles. Conclusions: We report the first anatomo-functional atlas of WM connectivity in humans by correlating cognitive data, electrostimulation, and DTI. We provide a valuable tool for cognitive neurosciences and clinical applications...|$|R

5000|$|Semantic <b>anomia</b> is a {{disorder}} {{in which the}} meaning of words becomes lost. In patients with semantic <b>anomia,</b> a naming deficit {{is accompanied by a}} recognition deficit. Thus, unlike patients with word selection <b>anomia,</b> patients with semantic <b>anomia</b> are unable to select the correct object from a group of objects, even when provided with the name of the target object.|$|E
50|$|Disconnection <b>anomia</b> {{results from}} the {{severing}} of connections between sensory and language cortices. Patients with disconnection <b>anomia</b> may exhibit modality-specific <b>anomia,</b> where the <b>anomia</b> {{is limited to a}} specific sensory modality, such as hearing. For example, a patient who is perfectly capable of naming a target object when it is presented via certain sensory modalities like audition or touch, may be unable to name the same object when the object is presented visually. Thus, in such a case, the patient's <b>anomia</b> arises as a consequence of a disconnect between his/her visual cortex and language cortices.|$|E
5000|$|Anomic aphasia, aphasia (expressive + {{receptive}} aphasia) and Alzheimer's {{disease can}} all affect recalling or retrieving words. <b>Anomia</b> renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people, a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of <b>anomia</b> have difficulties recalling words. <b>Anomia</b> is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe {{form of the}} [...] "tip-of-the-tongue" [...] phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word. Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause <b>anomia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This genus first {{appeared}} in the Permian period of China, Italy, and Pakistan. <b>Anomia</b> species are common in both tropical and temperate oceans and live primarily attached to rock or other shells via a calcified byssus that extends through the lower valve. <b>Anomia</b> shells tend to take on the surface shape of what they are attached to; thus if an <b>Anomia</b> is attached to a scallop shell, the shell of the <b>Anomia</b> will also show ribbing. [...] The species A. colombiana has been found in the La Frontera Formation of Boyacá, Cundinamarca and Huila of Colombia.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} populations {{can and do}} {{suffer from}} <b>anomia.</b> For instance, deaf patients who have suffered a stroke can demonstrate semantic and phonological errors, much like hearing anomic patients. Researchers have called this subtype sign <b>anomia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Word {{selection}} <b>anomia</b> {{occurs when}} the patient knows how to use an object and can correctly select the target object {{from a group of}} objects, and yet cannot name the object. Some patients with word selection <b>anomia</b> may exhibit selective impairment in naming particular types of objects, such as animals or colors. [...] In the subtype known as color <b>anomia,</b> the patient can distinguish between colors but cannot identify them by name or name the color of an object. The patients can separate colors into categories, but they cannot name them.|$|E
50|$|Patients with {{disconnection}} <b>anomia</b> {{may also}} exhibit callosal <b>anomia,</b> in which {{damage to the}} corpus callosum prevents sensory information from being transmitted between the two hemispheres of the brain. Therefore, when sensory information is unable to reach the hemisphere that is language-dominant (typically the left hemisphere in most individuals), the result is <b>anomia.</b> For instance, if a patient {{with this type of}} disconnection <b>anomia</b> holds an object in their left hand, this somatosensory information about the object would be sent to the right hemisphere of the brain, but then would be unable to reach the left hemisphere due to callosal damage. Thus, this somatosensory information would fail to be transmitted to language areas in the left hemisphere, in turn resulting in the inability to name the object in the left hand. In this example, the patient would have no problem with naming, if the test object were to be held in the right hand. This type of <b>anomia</b> may also arise as a consequence of a disconnect between sensory and language cortices.|$|E

50|$|Although {{many experts}} have {{believed}} that damage to Broca's area or Wernicke's area are the main causes of <b>anomia,</b> current {{studies have shown that}} damage in the left parietal lobe is the epicenter of anomic aphasia. One study was conducted using a word repetition test as well as fMRI in order to see the highest level of activity as well as where the lesions are in the brain tissue. Fridrikkson, et al. saw that damage to neither Broca's area nor Wernicke's area were the sole sources of <b>anomia</b> in the subjects. Therefore, the original <b>anomia</b> model, which theorized that damage occurred {{on the surface of the}} brain in the grey matter was debunked, and it was found that the damage was in the white matter deeper in the brain, on the left hemisphere. More specifically, the damage was in a part of the nerve tract called the arcuate fasciculus, for which the mechanism of action is unknown, though it is known to connect the posterior (back) of the brain to the anterior (front) and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to dysphasia, <b>anomia</b> and auditory processing disorder can impede {{the quality of}} auditory perception, and therefore, expression. Those who are Hard of Hearing or deaf may be considered to fall into this category.|$|E
