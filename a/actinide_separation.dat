40|$|Recycling of {{actinides}} {{by their}} separation from spent nuclear fuel, followed by transmutation in fast neutron reactors of Generation IV, {{is considered the}} most promising strategy for nuclear waste management. Closing the fuel cycle and burning long-lived actinides allows optimizing the use {{of natural resources and}} minimizing the long-term hazard of high-level nuclear waste. Moreover, improving the safety and sustainability of nuclear power worldwide. This paper presents the activities striving to meet these challenges, carried out under the Euratom FP 7 collaborative project SACSESS (Safety of <b>Actinide</b> <b>Separation</b> Processes). Emphasis is put on the safety issues of fuel reprocessing and waste storage. Two types of <b>actinide</b> <b>separation</b> processes, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical, are considered, as well as related aspects of material studies, process modeling and the radiolytic stability of solvent extraction systems.

40|$|With {{the end of}} {{the cold}} war, the {{principal}} mission in <b>actinide</b> <b>separations</b> has changed from production of plutonium to cleanup of the immense volume of moderately radioactive mixed wastes which resulted from fifty years of processing activities. In order to approach the cleanup task from a proper perspective, it is necessary to understand the nature of the problem and how the wastes were generated. In this report, the history of <b>actinide</b> <b>separations,</b> both the basic science and production aspects, is examined. Many of the separations techniques in use today were developed in the 40 `s and 50 `s for the identification and production of actinide elements. To respond to the modern world of <b>actinide</b> <b>separations</b> new techniques are being developed for separations ranging from analytical methods to detect ultra-trace concentrations (for bioassay and environmental monitoring) to large scale waste treatment procedures. Some of these new methods are ``improvements`` or adaptations of the historical techniques. Total <b>actinide</b> recovery, lanthanide/actinide <b>separations,</b> and selective partitioning of actinides from inert constituents are of primary concern.

40|$|Using {{high-temperature}} high-speed liquid centrifuges for lanthanides and <b>actinides</b> <b>separation</b> {{was originally}} proposed {{as a physical}} separation method in the Los Alamos ADTT/ATW concept [C. Bowman, LA-UR- 92 - 1065 (1992) ]. The authors investigated centrifugal separation in a concerted effort of experiments, theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. They discovered that owing to the ionic-composition-dependence of the sedimentation coefficients for the fission products and <b>actinides,</b> <b>separation</b> by grouping of molecular densities would not work in general in the molten salt environment. Alternatively the lanthanides and actinides could be transferred to a liquid metal carrier (e. g. bismuth) via reductive extraction and then separated by liquid centrifuges, but the material and technical challenges are severe. Meanwhile the authors have established that the reductive extraction procedure itself {{can be used for}} desired separations. Unlike conventional aqueous-based reprocessing technologies, reductive extraction separation uses only reagent (Li) that reconstitutes carrier salts (LiF-BeF{sub 2 }) and a processing medium (Bi) that can be continuously recycled and reused, with a nearly-pure fission products waste stream. The processing units are compact and reliable, and can be built at relatively low cost while maintaining high throughput. Therefore the research effort on developing liquid centrifuges for separations in ADTT/ATW was terminated in late 1995. This paper will discuss the various aspects involved in reaching this decision...|$|R

Thus C 5 -BTPhen showed significantly higher solubility in octanol than C 1 -BTPhen. The high solubility of C 5 -BTPhen and its complexes was exploited to facilitate the NMR titration experiments. These experiments shown that the dominant species in solution were the 1 : 2 complexes [Ln(III) (BTPhen) 2], even at high Ln concentrations, and that the relative stability of the 2 : 1 to 1 : 1 BTPhen-Ln complexes varied with different lanthanides.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} {{in the development of}} future generations of nuclear reprocessing procedures is the separation of the minor actinides from the chemically similar trivalent lanthanide ions. In this thesis, the potential of two purely N-donor ligands for minor <b>actinide</b> <b>separations</b> is evaluated and behaviour in aqueous and extraction conditions investigated. Of two chosen ligands, 12 N 4 Py 4 and 9 N 3 Py 3, only the larger 12 N 4 Py 4 was found to be able to complex lanthanide ions; however, both bind readily to divalent calcium ions. In comparison to earlier published properties of Ln(III) - 12 N 4 Py 4 complexes, the cerium complex was found to show differences based on greater d-orbital mixing. Conjugated acid dissociation constants and metal binding constants were determined using newly developed fitting functions in several conditions and found to be comparable to those of other extractants. As the investigation was performed in aqueous conditions, side reactions such as hydroxide formation and precipitation had to be considered and included into fitting procedures. Studies on U(IV) and Am(III) were conducted, but due to unfavourable conditions complexation by 12 N 4 Py 4 could not be verified beyond reasonable doubt. Extraction of ligand species and metal complexes was studied in various conditions and in the presence of various anions. Beside the main target cations, Ln(III) and An(III), 12 N 4 Py 4 is also capable of complexing and extracting protonated ligand species and Na+ with considerably higher partition coefficients than those observed for species with higher charge. Low solubilities of potassium, sodium and protonated species involving 12 N 4 Py 4 in presence of lipophilic anions such as pertechnetate, perrhenate and triiodide lead to precipitation. Formation of solids is of considerable concern in minor <b>actinide</b> <b>separations,</b> but could also offer novel pathways for iodine trapping. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{selective}} extraction {{of the minor}} actinides (Am(III) and Cm(III)) from the lanthanides {{is an important part}} of advanced reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. This separation would allow the Am/Cm to be fabricated into targets and recycled to a reactor and the lanthanides to be dispositioned. This separation is difficult to accomplish due to the similarities in the chemical properties of the trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Research efforts at the Idaho National Laboratory have identified an innovative synthetic pathway yielding new regiospecific dithiophosphinic acid (DPAH) extractants. The synthesis provides DPAH derivatives that can address the issues concerning minor <b>actinide</b> <b>separation</b> and extractant stability.

40|$|AbstractTo {{comply with}} the {{sustainability}} goals defined for innovative reactor systems mainly the waste minimization through recycling of all actinides, the corresponding fuel cycles will {{play a central role}} in trying to achieve these goals. The new concept of a grouped <b>actinide</b> <b>separation</b> can be derived from aqueous or pyro-chemical partitioning processes of minor actinides. The present paper describes the progress made in developing this type of process for both routes. A major focus will be on the very challenging separation of lanthanides from the trivalent actinides. The process developments, especially for pyro-metallurgy, require a good basic understanding on the extraction mechanisms. Pyro-reprocessing, where all actinides are recycled, is based on metallic materials. However, the fuels even those of new generation reactors will, at least in the beginning, most likely be oxides. Therefore, a head-end reduction step for oxide fuels is needed to convert oxides into metals.

40|$|Organic resins have {{previously}} shown good results with application to <b>actinide</b> <b>separations.</b> Large portions of recent research have been {{dedicated to the}} synthesis and evaluation of resins with phenolic-type functional groups. Other recent chemical research with lighter metals has developed a technique known as ion imprinting which can provide greater selectivity for the target metal ion. Initial work with ion imprinting and phenolic-type resins has shown these two areas to be largely incompatible. Identifying the ion imprinting technique as potentially the more valuable of the two, further work was undertaken with resins that incorporate a carboxylic acid-type functionality. These new resins are synthesized via a radical polymerization method, which proved to be very compatible with both actinides and the ion imprinting procedure. Polymer-based resins were synthesized without a metal template as well as ion imprinted, or templated, with U(VI), Th(IV), Np(V), and a resin for use with Am(III). Each of these resins were individually characterized and evaluated for use with their respective target metals. Characterization provides a means of comparing theoretical binding capacities of various resins, which the evaluations define the binding characteristics of interest (capacity, selectivity, kinetics, etc.). Based on the initial results for the selectivity of the U(VI) and Th(IV) ions, {{a new type of}} resin was developed in an effort to further increase the selectivity of the resin for the target metal ion. This new resin, known as a "capped" resin, seeks to remove the binding capability of any potential binding sites not involved in the ion imprinting process. (cont.) Results show that the ion imprinting technique can be successfully applied in the synthesis of resins for <b>actinide</b> <b>separations</b> with good success. The resins created through this process also show an affinity for their target metals over both competing ions as well as ions of similar ionic charge and radii. The removal of so-called random binding sites is also possible, {{with the addition of a}} few synthetic steps. by Karen Lynn Noyes. Thesis (Sc. D.)

Two general configurations of B&B reactors are considered: a "minimum-burnup" version in which fuel elements can be shuffled in three dimensions, and a "linear-assembly" version composed of conventional linear assemblies that are shuffled radially. Based on studies of different core compositions, the best options for minimizing fuel burnup and material DPA are metal fuel (with a strong dependence on alloy content), the type of steel that allows the lowest structure volume fraction, and helium coolant.

As regards to management of high level liquid wastes mainly arising from the reprocessing stream, two vitrification plants are currently operational whereas third one in under commissioning. One pre-disposal storage facility for vitrified high level waste products is operational at Tarapur while another new storage facility is under construction at Kapakkam. Research and development activities in the field of permanent geological disposal of such vitrified high level waste are in progress. These activities in the back end have been amply supported by development of large technological innovations and design of remote handling systems, robotics, radiation shielding etc. Development of advanced matrices, innovations in processes related to <b>actinide</b> <b>separations</b> and partitioning, recovery of other valuable isotopes are among the areas of future research and developments in fuel cycle of thermal reactors in India...|$|R

In this <b>separation</b> process the <b>actinides</b> should be extracted {{as a group}} from the lanthanides and the fission and corrosion/activation products. This {{can be achieved by}} combining BTBP (bis-triazine-bipyridine) with TBP (tri-butyl phosphate) in cyclohexanone. From 4 M nitric acid this organic system extracts the actinides (log(DAm) = 2. 19, log(DPu) = 2. 31, log(DU) = 1. 03, log(DNp) = 0. 53) and also separates them from the lanthanides (log(DLa) = - 2. 0, log(DCe) = - 1. 72, log(DNd) = - 1. 05, log(DSm) = - 0. 18, log(DEu) = - 0. 02). One problem encountered {{is that some of the}} fission and corrosion products are also extracted. The new system however still looks feasible...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the radiolytic {{degradation}} {{behavior of}} organic molecules involved in new or existing schemes for the recycle of used nuclear fuels is of significant interest for sustaining a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Here {{we have conducted}} several lines of investigation to begin understanding the effects of radiolysis on the aqueous phase of the TALSPEAK process for {{the separation of the}} trivalent lanthanides from the trivalent actinides. Using the 60 -Co irradiator at the INL, we have begun to quantify the effects of radiation on the aqueous phase complexants used in this separation technique, and how this will affect the <b>actinide</b> lanthanide <b>separation</b> factor. In addition we have started to develop methodologies for stable product identification, a key element in determining the degradation pathways. We have also introduced a methodology to investigate the effects of alpha radiolysis that has previously received limited attention...|$|R
