5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly {{at the intersection of}} the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were put}} in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba, where significant precipitation ranging up to 20inches (500mm) across the mountainous south was expected <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba. Cuban officials evacuated 300,000people and brought its fishing fleet into harbors. The Cuban state television broadcast extensive warnings about the storm, urging precautions. Cattle were moved to higher ground, tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma, and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day. The threat of the storm caused domestic flights to be canceled.|$|E
5|$|Lima flourished {{during the}} 17th century <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> an {{extensive}} trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty of Peru with the Americas, Europe and the Far East. Its merchants channeled Peruvian silver through the nearby port of Callao and exchanged it for imported goods at the trade fair of Portobelo in modern-day Panama. This practice was sanctioned by law as all trade from the Viceroyalty {{was required to}} go through Callao {{on its way to}} and from overseas markets. The resulting economic prosperity of the city was reflected in its rapid growth, population expanded from about 25,000 in 1619 to an estimated 80,000 in 1687.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Lima, {{the capital of}} Peru, began with its {{foundation}} by Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535. The city was established on {{the valley of the}} Rímac River in an area populated by the Ichma polity. It became the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. In the 17th century, the city prospered <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> an extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates. However, prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to an economic downturn and the Bourbon Reforms.|$|E
5|$|The section {{addressing}} God as Father and Son {{is again}} a duet, {{this time of}} soprano I and tenor. The voices are often in canon and in parallel, as in the Christe. The movement is likely another parody, possibly from the 1729 cantata Ihr Häuser des Himmels, BWV 193a. As the Christe, it is a love-duet addressing Jesus. Both duets appear <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the symmetry within the respective part, Kyrie and Gloria. Here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with the orchestra and introduces material that the voices pick up.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E

5|$|By August18, the NHC {{noted that}} the {{hurricane}} was asymmetrical, having uneven distribution of the wind radii. Later that day, deep convection continued to form and an eye later appeared on satellite imagery. Early the next day, the eye became increasingly defined <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Bob passed roughly 35mi (55km) from the North Carolina coastline. By 0600UTC, Hurricane Hunters recorded flight level winds of 140mph (225km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 115mph (185km/h). At this time, the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), the lowest pressure recorded during the storm. After attaining this intensity, the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at 25mph (35km/h), steered by the trough over the southeast United States, an upper-level cutoff low over the Great Lakes Region and the subtropical ridge over the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|By September1, {{the storm}} began to consolidate, with {{reconnaissance}} flights finding an elongated center and surface winds of 60mph (95km/h). Moderate wind shear inhibited convective {{development in the}} western portion; however, outflow {{in other areas of}} the storm improved, leading to further development. A northwest track, fully identified by this time as a mid-tropospheric ridge located over Florida, strengthened. Remaining disorganized, Earl continued to intensify <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> circulation was located close to deep convection. The NHC stated in their fifth advisory on the storm that Earl did not appear to be fully tropical due to the lack of organization. Around 1200UTC on September2, Earl intensified into a hurricane despite having an atypical structure; the wind field of the storm was asymmetric and the strongest winds were located well to the southeast of the center.|$|E
5|$|Colross, (also {{historically}} {{known as}} Belle Air and Grasshopper Hall), is a Georgian mansion in Princeton, New Jersey; {{it was built}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> an estate in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia. Colross is currently the administration building of Princeton Day School. The Colross property originally occupied the entire 1100 block of Oronoco Street; Alexandria merchant John Potts developed it as a plantation and began building the mansion in 17991800. In 1803, Jonathan Swift—also an Alexandria merchant and a city councilman—purchased the property and during his ownership continued constructing the mansion. After Swift's death in 1824, Colross was purcheased by Thomson Francis Mason (1785–1838), son of Thomson Mason (1759–1820) and grandson of Founding Father George Mason (1725–1792) of Gunston Hall. Mason served as a judge of the Criminal Court of the District of Columbia and as mayor of Alexandria. During his ownership, Mason made Colross his chief homestead; he substantially modified and added to the mansion. After successive ownerships, the area around Colross became heavily industrialized. The mansion was bought by John Munn in 1929; between that year and 1932 it was transported brick-by-brick to Princeton, where in 1958 it was sold to Princeton Day School, which uses it as a school administration building housing its admission and advancement offices.|$|E

The türbe of Haji Bektash Veli {{is located}} in the {{original}} Bektashi tekke (now a museum) in the town that now bears his name and remains a site for Alevi pilgrims from throughout Turkey.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, Cooper {{has served}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> attractions for Delta County. The city became host to several small schools and churches. In 1955, the {{construction}} of Cooper Lake was authorized. In 1986, major work on the lake began, and the lake was finished in 1991. The lake is now the most popular tourist attraction in the area. Boating, swimming, and fishing are available at Cooper Lake. The main fish stocked in the lake are catfish, largemouth bass, and crappie. Along {{the north shore of}} the lake is the Doctor's Creek Unit of Cooper Lake State Park. The park contains several picnic areas, campgrounds and a large swimming area on Cooper Lake. The park also contains several hiking and equestrian trails. On {{the eastern edge of the}} lake near the Cooper Lake Dam is the Wildlife Observation Deck, a large birdwatching platform. Along the west and northwest shores of the lake is the Cooper Wildlife Management Area. The park was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and protects four unique habitat types. These are wetland, Blackland Prairie, Upland Post Oak, and Bottomland Hardwood. The park contains several hiking trails, as well as birdwatching stations and wildlife viewing areas. The park allows fishing and hunting to visitors if they have a proper license.|$|E
5|$|The first {{refining}} {{operations at}} Corsicana were built by Joseph S. Cullinan, a former manager for Standard Oil in Pennsylvania. His company, which was later absorbed by Magnolia Petroleum Company and then acquired by Standard Oil of New York, {{built the first}} modern refinery west of the Mississippi River. Following the strike at Spindletop, Cullinan partnered with Arnold Schlaet to form the Texas Fuel Company in Beaumont with funding from an investment group run by former Texas governor James S. Hogg and other investors. In 1905, as the new company rapidly expanded its operations, it moved its corporate headquarters to Houston. The company's strength {{in the oil industry}} established Houston <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the industry in Texas.
