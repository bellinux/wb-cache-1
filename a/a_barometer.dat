5|$|It is {{estimated}} that at 18:00 UTC on 8 September, the tropical storm attained hurricane intensity. Intensification remained gradual until the hurricane moved into the Gulf of Honduras by 10 September, when the hurricane began to rapidly intensify. At 00:00 UTC on 10 September, the cyclone intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The storm strengthened further before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) at 1800 UTC. The strong hurricane made landfall on Belize City at the same intensity two hours later. <b>A</b> <b>barometer</b> in the city recorded a minimum pressure of 952 mbar (hPa; 28.12 mbar); this was the lowest barometric pressure measured {{in association with the}} storm. The hurricane substantially weakened over the Yucatán Peninsula, and had weakened to tropical storm strength by the time it had entered the Bay of Campeche. Despite moving back over water, the tropical cyclone continued to weaken in the bay, and made its final landfall roughly 60–70 mi (95–110 km) north of Tampico, Mexico, with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) at around 00:00 UTC on 13 September. Over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, the storm quickly weakened, and dissipated later on 13 September.|$|E
25|$|Barometers and {{pressure}} altimeters (the most basic and {{common type of}} altimeter) are essentially the same instrument, but used for different purposes.

25|$|Clermont-Ferrand was {{the home}} of {{mathematician}} and philosopher Blaise Pascal who tested Evangelista Torricelli's hypothesis concerning the influence of gas pressure on liquid equilibrium.

25|$|After {{leaving the}} Lake District, Dalton {{returned}} annually {{to spend his}} holidays studying meteorology, something which involved a lot of hill-walking.

The altitude achieved was estimated using <b>a</b> <b>barometer.</b> Until the Ordnance Survey published maps for the Lake District in the 1860s, Dalton was one of the few sources of such information. Dalton was often accompanied by Jonathan Otley, who was one of the few other authorities on the heights of the Lake District mountains. Otley became both an assistant and a friend.|$|E
25|$|As the air {{pressure}} decreases at altitudes {{above sea level}} (and increases below sea level) the uncorrected reading of the barometer will depend on its location. The reading is then adjusted to an equivalent sea-level pressure for purposes of reporting. For example, if <b>a</b> <b>barometer</b> located at sea level and under fair weather conditions is moved to an altitude of 1,000 feet (305m), about 1 inch of mercury (~35 hPa) must be added on to the reading. The barometer readings at the two locations {{should be the same}} if there are negligible changes in time, horizontal distance, and temperature. If this were not done, there would be a false indication of an approaching storm at the higher elevation.|$|E
25|$|However, Pascal went {{even further}} {{to test the}} {{mechanical}} theory. If, as suspected by mechanical philosophers like Torricelli and Pascal, air had lateral weight, {{the weight of the}} air would be less at higher altitudes. Therefore, Pascal wrote to his brother-in-law, Florin Perier, who lived near a mountain called the Puy de Dome, asking him to perform a crucial experiment. Perier was to take <b>a</b> <b>barometer</b> up the Puy de Dome and make measurements along the way of the height of the column of mercury. He was then to compare it to measurements taken {{at the foot of the}} mountain to see if those measurements taken higher up were in fact smaller. In September 1648, Perier carefully and meticulously carried out the experiment, and found that Pascal's predictions had been correct. The mercury barometer stood lower the higher one went.|$|E
