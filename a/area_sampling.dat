The results on who wins are decided by 10 randomly selected passerby who are asked to taste both dishes and vote on who's dish they like better by choosing Yuen's or Lee's cartoon panel board.

40|$|Summary: The {{properties}} of a variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> technique, {{by which the}} observer varies the searchradius to obtain approximately a prescribed number of woody plants in each tier measured, were determined by (i) comparison of fixed area and variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> of a computer-mapped shrub population; (ii) comparison of results from fixed area and variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> of woody plants exceeding about 2 m height in a rata-kamahi forest; (iii) two variable area surveys of woody plants exceeding 30 cm height in a beech forest. Variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> gave unbiased estimates of crown area and plant density in the computer-mapped population. These were as precise as estimates obtained by fixed <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> when sampling intensities were equal. For {{the same number of}} plots, 20 m x 20 m fixed <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> of density and basal area in rata-kamahi forest was more precise than variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> in plots containing 30 stems per plot, but in terms of sampling intensity and time, variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> was more efficient. Both sampling methods gave similar stem diameter frequency patterns. Two surveys of beech forest, conducted 11 years apart, showed that with about 70 - 80 single-tier plots, differences in basal area of about 15 % can be detected using the variable area plot method. Variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> is robust and suitable for ecological surveys of New Zealand's indigenous forests...|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} {{utilizing}} digital earth resource observation satellite data since {{the launch of}} the first Landsat in 1972. There are three major applications in the U.

In addition, we are {{in the early stages of}} research on using remote sensing in yield models. The <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> frame construction process is the largest operational application. <b>Area</b> <b>sampling</b> frames remain as the statistical foundation of many U.

NASS has been utilizing area frame sampling since 1954 and nationwide since 1965. The land area of the country (state by state in the U. S.) is divided into broad land use or land cover strata. From 1954 to 1978 aerial photography was the primary source of information for this stratification. From 1978 to the present, Landsat image products have been the main source of stratification information. In 1988, NASS started a joint research effort with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to convert the stratification process from a basically manual image interpretation proces...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Occupational noise {{exposure}} can be monitored directly by personal sampling or indirectly, by <b>area</b> <b>sampling.</b> Personal sampling {{is performed using}} an integrating sound level meter, worn by the worker while performing his/her job. When <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> is used, measurements {{need to be made}} in all locations where a typical worker stays while performing his/her tasks; the respective partial lengths of exposure need to be accurately monitored, and the time-weighted average sound level of the measured noise levels must be calculated. OBJECTIVES: Current regulations identify three different thresholds, corresponding to different types of action, but they do not propose any standard criteria to decide whether a threshold has been exceeded. Defining standard procedures to assess occupational {{noise exposure}} and identifying such thresholds is crucial. METHODS: Using empirical data collected in the field, the effects are illustrated of the number of sampling locations and of the partial lengths of exposure on <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> measurements, and the effects of duration of noise exposure on both area and personal samplings. RESULTS: When dealing with area samplings, an accurate definition of both sampling locations and partial lengths of exposure is crucial. When arbitrary decisions are taken in selecting sampling locations and/or establishing partial lengths of exposure, spatial changes in noise level and operator' displacements while performing his/her tasks may affect results. Sampling for less than the duration of noise exposure is the major contributor to measurement error, particularly under conditions of unpredictable variation in noise level. In fact, as noise level in the non-monitored time fraction is unknown, measurement error cannot be determined. We estimate that, even under the most favorable circumstances, sampling should last not less than 40...|$|E
