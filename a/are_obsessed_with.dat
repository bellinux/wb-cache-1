5|$|In StarCraft, the Zerg <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> {{the pursuit}} of genetic purity, and {{are the focus of}} the game's second episode. With the Xel'Nagaempowered Protoss {{targeted}} as the ultimate lifeform, the Zerg invade the Terran colonies in the Koprulu Sector to assimilate the Terrans' psionic potential and give the Zerg an edge over the Protoss. Through the actions of the Sons of Korhal, the Zerg are lured to the Confederate capital Tarsonis, where they capture the psionic ghost agent Sarah Kerrigan and infest her. Returning to the Zerg base of operations on Char, the Zerg are attacked by the dark templar Zeratul, who accidentally gives the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur to the Zerg Overmind. With victory in sight, the Overmind launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet. However, {{at the end of the}} game, the Protoss high templar Tassadar sacrifices himself to destroy the Overmind, leaving the Zerg to run rampant and leaderless across the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with.</b> In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{is similar to}} atrophic rhinitis, namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or oil-based lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding menthol to lubricants may be helpful in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifer at home. For people with anxiety, depression, or who <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> {{the feeling that they}} can't breathe, psychiatric or psychological care may be helpful.|$|E
25|$|It was {{believed}} that, if one {{was confronted with}} a kappa, {{there were a few}} means of escape. Kappa <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> politeness, so if a person makes a deep bow, it will return the gesture, the water in the plate on its head spills out and it is rendered unable to leave the bowing position until the plate is refilled with water from the river in which it lives. If a person refills it, the kappa will serve that person for all eternity. A similar weakness of the kappa involves its arms, which can easily be pulled from its body. If an arm is detached, the kappa will perform favors or share knowledge in exchange for its return. Another method of defeat involves shogi or sumo wrestling: a kappa sometimes challenges a human being to wrestle or engage in other tests of skill. This tendency is easily used to encourage the kappa to spill the water from its sara. Kappa also accept challenges put to them, as in the tale of the farmer's daughter who was promised to a kappa in marriage by her father in return for the creature irrigating his land. She challenged it to submerge several gourds in water and, when it failed in its task, it retreated and she was saved from the promised marriage. Kappa have also been driven away using their aversion to variously, iron, sesame, or ginger.|$|E
500|$|Another {{focus of}} the show is the Cutie Mark Crusaders, a trio of much younger mares {{consisting}} of Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo, who <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> finding their [...] "cutie marks", an iconic symbol that magically appear on a pony's flank once they have discovered their special talent in life. The show regularly features episodes centered on the Crusaders, who have yet to receive their cutie marks and are teased by other young ponies as [...] "blank flanks". In response, they desperately hurry to try to discover their talents and receive their own cutie marks, often doing so in comical fashions.|$|E
50|$|The {{conflict}} between Mu'tazilis and Ash'aris concerning this point {{was a matter}} of the focus of obsession. Mu'tazilis <b>were</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> Divine justice, whereas the Ash'aris <b>were</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> Divine omnipotence. Nevertheless, Divine self-restraint in Mu'tazili discourse is because of, not a negation of, Divine omnipotence.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{books by}} middle-age writers depict their {{perceptions}} of old people. One writer notices the change in his parents: they move slowly, they have lost strength, they repeat stories, their minds wander, and they fret. Another writer sees her aged parents and is bewildered: they refuse to follow her advice, they <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> the past, they avoid risk, they live at a [...] "glacial pace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Commoners {{and rural}} villagers, {{who made up}} over 90% of the population, very rarely left the villages or {{farmsteads}} where they were born. Common forms of employment differed by region, though farming was almost universally common. Professions were hereditary; a father's employment was passed to his eldest son after he died. The Lüshi Chunqiu gave examples of how, when commoners <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> material wealth, instead of the idealism {{of a man who}} [...] "makes things serve him", they were [...] "reduced to the service of things".|$|E
2500|$|Blair {{accepted}} the titular {{role on the}} NBC sitcom Kath & Kim, opposite Molly Shannon.

Blair had to gain weight and use hair extensions to play her role as Kim, a self-absorbed suburban young princess who is forced to reassess her relationship with her mother. The series was canceled after one season. Blair also appeared with Rainn Wilson singing [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] for the 2008 Gap winter ad campaign, and was included in Glamour's list of the 50 Most Glamorous Women of 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 {{speech at}} Harvard, Minow {{said that he}} could never have {{anticipated}} the impact of television.

[...] "Too much deals with covering controversy, crimes, fires, and not enough with the country’s great issues" [...] he said. He also said that presidential campaigns <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> the trivial. The speech came 50 years after he referred to television as a [...] "vast wasteland" [...] on May 9, 1961.

Although the film speaks superbly to the speed bumps all pro wrestlers navigate, I’m happy to report most of us don’t swerve off the road quite so severely." [...] WWE play-by-play commentator Jim Ross called it a [...] "really strong, dramatic film that depicts how people who <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> {{their own lives and}} their careers can self-destruct".|$|E
2500|$|Dirty Little Rabbits' musical {{style is}} {{considerably}} different from Crahan's most notable band, Slipknot. Crahan explained {{in an interview}} in 2008 that he is an [...] "alternative person in art and music" [...] and that he didn't grow up obsessed with metal. He went on to explain that other members of Slipknot <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> metal and that he [...] "went with it" [...] because it was different for him and he could introduce them to something different. He describes Dirty Little Rabbits as the band he's been waiting his whole life for. He made a particular point {{about the fact that they}} have a female singer and that he's always wanted to be in a band with a female singer because he wants to [...] "represent the whole world, male and female." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1727 Jonathan Swift {{published}} Gulliver's Travels. The tale {{included a}} people who <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> mathematics and more advanced than Europeans scientifically. [...] They populate a floating island fortress called Laputa, 4½ miles in diameter, which uses its shadow to prevent sun and rain from reaching earthly nations over which it travels, ensuring they will {{pay tribute to the}} Laputians. Voltaire's Micromégas (1752) includes two beings from Saturn and Sirius who, though human in appearance, are of immense size and visit the Earth out of curiosity. At first they think the planet is uninhabited, due to the difference in scale between them and the peoples of Earth. When they discover the haughty Earth-centric views of Earth philosophers, they are greatly amused by how important Earth beings think they are compared to greater beings in the universe such as themselves.|$|E

60|$|Ben {{will agree}} that I have quoted him fairly. And so, the thought comes to me, that {{to all these}} slaves of the Elsinore the Real is real because they fictionally escape it. One and all they <b>are</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> the belief that they are free agents. To me the Real is unreal, because I have torn aside the veils of fiction and myth. My {{pristine}} fictional escape from the Real, making me a philosopher, has bound me absolutely to {{the wheel of the}} Real. I, the super-realist, am the only unrealist on board the Elsinore. Therefore I, who penetrate it deepest, in the whole phenomena of living on the Elsinore see it only as phantasmagoria.|$|E
