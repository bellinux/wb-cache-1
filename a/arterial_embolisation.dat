40|$|A 28 -year old man {{presented}} with a symptomatic giant haemangioma. On June 26, 1983, at laparotomy, no resection was attempted because the lesion involved the right lobe of the liver {{and a part of}} segments II and III. The patient underwent a right hepatic <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation</b> with gelatine sponge particles. During follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic. Five-year review by CT-scan showed a diminution {{of the size of the}} haemangioma and hypertrophy of the left lobe. On October 21, 1988, the patient was reoperated on for liver abscess and complete necrosis of the haemangioma. A right hepatectomy was performed. In conclusion, the long-term effect of hepatic <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation,</b> as demonstrated in our case by regular CT-scans, is useful in cases of diffuse haemangioma as an alternative to hazardous major liver resection.

40|$|BackgroundBehçet disease (BD) is a {{multisystemic}} inflammatory disorder classified {{among the}} vasculitides which can affect all types and sizes of blood vessels. ObjectiveOur {{aim is to}} study the characteristics of cardio vascular involvement in BD. Methods medical records of 180 patients diagnosed BD according to the International Study Group of Behcet Disease, in the Internal Medicine Department of F. Bourguiba hospital in Monastir, were retrospectively analyzed. The diagnosis of vascular involvement was made by Doppler ultrasonography and/ or computed tomography. Results there were 65 % males and 35 % females. The mean age at diagnosis was 30 years. Familiar history of BD was found in 22. 5 % of cases. Vascular involvement was found in 32 % of patients revealing the diagnosis in 3 % of cases. Superficial venous thrombosis was found in 25 % of cases. Deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed in 62. 5 % of patients as following: upper limb in 3. 1 %, lower limb in 34. 4 %, bilateral lower limb in 6. 3 % and inferior vena cava in 18. 7 %. Arterial manifestations were found in 21. 9 % of cases with pulmonary embolism in 12. 5 % of patients and pulmonary arterial aneurysm in 9. 4 %. Cardiac involvement was as following: myocardial infarction and coronary aneurysm in 1. 6 % and intracardiac thrombosis in 1. 6 %. The medical treatment was based on anticoagulants and colchicine in all cases; corticosteroids in 45. 2 % of cases with immunosuppressive drugs in 15. 6 %. <b>Arterial</b> pulmonary <b>embolisation</b> was performed in two cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—A {{retrospective}} study {{was carried out}} on 13 patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) who presented with isolated or associated signs of intracranial hypertension.  METHODS—Nine patients presented with symptoms of intracranial hypertension {{at the time of}} diagnosis. Ocular fundoscopy available in 12 patients showed bilateral papilloedema in eight and optic disk atrophy in four. Clinical evolution was particularly noticeable in five patients because of chronic (two patients) or acute (after lumbar shunting or puncture: three patients, one death) tonsillar herniation.  RESULTS—Two patients had a type I fistula (drainage into a sinus, with a normal antegrade flow direction). The remaining 11 had type II fistulas (drainage into a sinus, with abnormal retrograde venous drainage into sinuses or cortical veins). Stenosis or thrombosis of the sinus(es) distal to the fistula was present in five patients. The cerebral venous drainage was abnormal in all patients.  CONCLUSION—Type II (and some type I) DAVFs may present as isolated intracranial hypertension mimicking benign intracranial hypertension. Normal cerebral angiography should be added as a fifth criterion of benign intracranial hypertension. The cerebral venous drainage pattern must be carefully studied by contralateral carotid and vertebral artery injections to correctly evaluate the impairment of the cerebral venous outflow. Lumbar CSF diversion (puncture or shunting) may induce acute tonsillar herniation and should be avoided absolutely. DAVF may induce intracranial hypertension, which has a poor long term prognosis and may lead to an important loss of visual acuity and chronic tonsillar herniation. Consequently, patients with intracranial hypertension must be treated, even agressively, to obliterate the fistula or at least to reduce the arterial flow and to restore a normal cerebral venous drainage. The endovascular treatment may associate <b>arterial</b> or transvenous <b>embolisation</b> and /or surgery. Patients in whom the fistula is not obliterated after an endovascular therapeutic procedure, need continous clinical and angiographical follow up. ...|$|R

40|$|Background—Arteriovenous malformations of {{the liver}} in Osler's disease may present as high output cardiac failure. A few case reports {{suggested}} that treatment with <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation</b> may have beneficial effects in such patients.  Aims—To investigate the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality in a prospective pilot study.  Patients and methods—Four women and one man (aged 39 - 59 years) with the dominant hepatic manifestation of Osler's disease presented with symptoms of cardiac failure and elevated cardiac output. Arteriovenous malformations were treated in three to five sessions with <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation</b> using coils. The outcome was analysed by measurement of cardiac output and scoring of clinical symptoms.  Results—Embolisation was technically feasible in all patients and adequate occlusion of vascular malformations was achieved in four patients. After completion of therapy symptoms improved in four patients, while one patient suffered from abdominal pain due to cholangitis. One patient died seven months after the embolisation treatment from variceal bleeding. Mean cardiac output significantly decreased from 14. 2 (range 12 - 17. 3) l/min to 8 (range 5. 9 - 10. 6) l/min (p= 0. 043). After a median follow up of 23 months (range 7 - 50 months), three of five patients had a long lasting improvement of clinical symptoms and cardiac function.  Conclusions—This first treatment series of patients with dominant hepatic involvement in Osler's disease indicates that <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation</b> may prevent cardiac failure by significantly lowering cardiac output. ...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} management, and short- and longer-term outcome of patients presenting with an acute blue finger. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-note review and prospective follow-up by telephone and general practitioner enquiry. All patients who presented with sudden onset blue discolouration of a finger within the previous 72 h, with normal radial and ulnar pulses, were included. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2006, 22 patients, 15 female, 7 male, were reviewed. Median age was 56 years (range, 19 - 88 years). Median time from onset of blue finger was 6 days (range 1 day to 3 months). In most cases (17), no underlying cause was identified. Five patients had an underlying cause; two had symptoms compatible with Raynaud's phenomenon, one patient had signs (later confirmed on MRA) of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome and two had polycythaemia (haemoglobin > 17 g/dl). Otherwise, all laboratory investigations were normal. Upper limb duplex, echocardiogram and 24 -h cardiac tapes were normal in all cases. Median follow-up was 19 months. Three patients had recurrent symptoms in the finger. No patient suffered tissue loss or loss of digit(s), and none had stroke or <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The acute blue finger is a benign condition not suggestive of <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation.</b> Tissue or digit loss is not a threat and, in the longer term, there is no threat of embolisation to other vascular sites...|$|E
30|$|Artero-venous fistula (not {{included}} in the AAST classification). Artero-venous fistulae (Fig.  8 d–e) usually have the same CT appearance as arterial pseudoaneurysms. An important finding that enables the differential diagnosis between the two lesions is the identification of a dilated renal vein that enhances early during the arterial phase of the study; anyway, a true arterial phase should be acquired in order to appreciate this finding that might be obscured by the physiological venous return during the corticomedullary phase.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the short- and medium-term results of prostatic <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation</b> (PAE) for {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH). METHODS: This was a prospective non-randomised study including 255 patients diagnosed with BPH and moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms after failure of medical treatment for at least 6 months. The patients underwent PAE between March 2009 and April 2012. Technical success is when selective prostatic <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation</b> is completed {{in at least one}} pelvic side. Clinical success was defined as improving symptoms and quality of life. Evaluation was performed before PAE and at 1, 3, 6 and every 6 months thereafter with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), uroflowmetry, prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and volume. Non-spherical polyvinyl alcohol particles were used. RESULTS: PAE was technically successful in 250 patients (97. 9 %). Mean follow-up, in 238 patients, was 10 months (range 1 - 36). Cumulative rates of clinical success were 81. 9 %, 80. 7 %, 77. 9 %, 75. 2 %, 72. 0 %, 72. 0 %, 72. 0 % and 72. 0 % at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months, respectively. There was one major complication. CONCLUSIONS: PAE is a procedure with good results for BPH patients with moderate to severe LUTS after failure of medical therapy. KEY POINTS: • Prostatic artery embolisation offers minimally invasive therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia. • Prostatic artery embolisation is a challenging procedure because of vascular anatomical variations. • PAE is a promising new technique that has shown good results...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} endovascular treatment for controlling haemorrhage in haemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic bone fractures and to relate clinical efficacy to pre-procedural variables. Materials and Methods: From March 2009 through April 2013, 168 patients with major pelvic trauma associated with high-flow haemorrhage were referred to our emergency department and were retrospectively reviewed. Pelvic arteries involved were one or more per patient. Embolisation was performed using various materials (micro-coils, Spongostan, plug, glue, covered stent), and technical success, complications, treatment success, clinical efficacy, rebleeding, and mortality rates were assessed. Factors influencing clinical efficacy were also evaluated. Results: The technical success rate was 100 %; no complications occurred during the procedures. Treatment was successful in 94. 6 % cases, and clinical efficacy was 85. 7 %. Three patients had to undergo a second arteriography due to recurrent haemorrhage. Fifteen patients died. Pre-embolisation transfusion demand {{was significantly associated with}} clinical efficacy. Conclusions: Percutaneous embolisation of pelvic bleeding may be considered a safe, effective, and minimally invasive therapeutic option. As haemodynamic stability is the first objective with traumatic haemorrhagic patient, <b>arterial</b> <b>embolisation</b> can assume a primary role. On the basis of our results, pre-procedural transfusion status may be considered a prognostic factor. Key Points: • The series presented {{is one of the largest}} in a single centre. • <b>Arterial</b> <b>embolisation</b> is a life-saving procedure in patients with pelvic haemorrhage. • In pelvic traumas associated with haemorrhage, prognosis is dependent upon prompt treatment. • Transfusion status is significantly related to clinical efficacy...|$|E
