Soleus and gastrocnemius biopsies were obtained from eight subjects before ULLS, immediately after 12 days of ULLS (post- 0 h), and after 6 h of reambulation (post- 6 h).

40|$|Objectives To assess {{physical}} fitness in pregnancy and to evaluate {{its effect on}} perceived health, back pain, blood pressure and duration of gestation. Also, to evaluate the effect of serum relaxin levels on blood pressure and duration of gestation. Material and methods A prospective cohort of 520 pregnant women were examined in early pregnancy and five months postpartum with regard to socio-demographic characteristics and estimated peak oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 peak, est.). Serum concentrations of relaxin were carried out in early pregnancy. Physical exercise, possible back pain and blood pressure were measured repeatedly throughout pregnancy. Results <b>Absolute</b> V̇O 2 <b>peak,</b> est.  in early pregnancy was positively correlated to perceived health, which was lower during than after pregnancy. The average <b>absolute</b> V̇O 2 <b>peak,</b> est.  in early pregnancy of 2. 4 l/minute was 0. 02 l/minute less than the V̇O 2 peak, est.  postpartum, while regular physical exercise decreased throughout pregnancy. <b>Absolute</b> V̇O 2 <b>peak,</b> est.  in early pregnancy was not associated to the incidence of any low back pain location in pregnancy or postpartum, but inversely to intensity of back pain and diastolic blood pressure and positively with duration of gestation. Elevated serum relaxin levels were associated with decreased diastolic blood pressure and higher duration of gestation among women with miscarriage. Conclusions Perceived health, diastolic blood pressure and duration of gestation were positively affected by {{physical fitness}} while no effect was shown on the incidence of back pain.

40|$|Objectives: To explore {{relationships}} between aspects of vastus lateralis (VL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle structure (muscle thickness, fascicle length and pennation angle) and isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) peak force capacity. Design and Methods: Fifteen male collegiate athletes (height 1. 79 ± 0. 05 m; body mass 82. 8 ± 8. 1 kg, age 23. 2 ± 3. 4 years), {{from a wide}} range of field-based sports, had sonographic images of their VL and MG musculature (for the dominant leg) recorded at rest before participating in a standardized maximal IMTP protocol. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients (≥ 0. 91, P < 0. 001) and coefficient of variation percentages (≤ 2. 5 %) showed excellent reliability of the muscle structure and IMTP peak force measurements. A large positive relationship was found between VL muscle thickness and <b>absolute</b> IMTP <b>peak</b> force (r = 0. 62, P < 0. 01, power = 0. 89). Moderate, but non-significant, relationships were observed between VL pennation and both absolute (r = 0. 41, P = 0. 06, power = 0. 60) and relative (r = 0. 39, P = 0. 08, power = 0. 46) IMTP peak force. A small non-significant correlation was noted between VL muscle thickness and relative IMTP peak force (r = 0. 26, P = 0. 19). No aspect of MG muscle structure was significantly correlated with IMTP peak force. Conclusion: The VL muscle thickness of male collegiate athletes’ dominant leg is largely correlated to their bilateral <b>absolute</b> IMTP <b>peak</b> force capacity (demonstrating 38 % shared variance). Practitioners should, therefore, develop hypertrophy of male collegiate athletes’ VL musculature through appropriately designed strength training programs...|$|R

40|$|Because of flux conservation, flux-averaging {{justifies the}} use of the distanceredshift {{relation}} for a smooth universe in the analysis of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) data. We have combined the SN Ia data from the High-z SN Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project, and binned the combined data by flux-averaging in redshift intervals of ∆z = 0. 05 and ∆z = 0. 1. We find that the unbinned data yield a Hubble constant of H 0 = 65 ± 1 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 (statistical error only), a matter density fraction of Ωm = 0. 7 ± 0. 4, and a vacuum energy density fraction of ΩΛ = 1. 2 ± 0. 5. The binned data for ∆z = 0. 1 yield H 0 = 65 ± 1 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 (statistical error only), Ωm = 0. 3 ± 0. 6, and ΩΛ = 0. 7 ± 0. 7. Our results are not sensitive to the redshift bin size. Flux-averaging leads to less biased estimates of the cosmological parameters by reducing the bias due to systematic effects such as weak lensing. Comparison of the data of 18 SNe Ia published by both groups yields a mean SN Ia <b>peak</b> <b>absolute</b> magnitude of MB = − 19. 33 ± 0. 25. The internal dispersion of each data set is about 0. 20 magnitude in the calibrated SN Ia <b>peak</b> <b>absolute</b> magnitudes. The difference in analysis techniques introduces an additional uncertainty of about 0. 15 magnitude. If the SNe Ia <b>peak</b> <b>absolute</b> luminosity changes with redshift due to evolution, our ability to measure the cosmological parameters from SN Ia data will be significantly diminished. Assuming power-law evolution in the <b>peak</b> <b>absolute</b> luminosity, (1 + z) β, we find a strong degeneracy between the evolution power-law index β and the matter density fraction Ωm. For Ωm = 0. 3, we find that the unbinned data yields H 0 = 65 ± 1 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 (statistical error only), ΩΛ = 1. 4 ± 1. 1, and β = 0. 5 ± 1. 6, and the binned data (with ∆z = 0. 1) yields H 0 = 65 ± 1 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 (statistical error only), ΩΛ = 0. 6 ± 1. 4, and β = 0. 0 ± 1. 0...|$|R
