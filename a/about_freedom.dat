25|$|During the Estado Novo authoritarian regime, {{music was}} widely {{used by the}} left-wing {{resistance}} {{as a way to}} say what could not be said, singing <b>about</b> <b>freedom,</b> equality and democracy, mainly through metaphors and symbols. Many composers and singers became famous and persecuted by the political police, some of them being arrested or exiled, such as Zeca Afonso, Paulo de Carvalho, José Mário Branco, Sérgio Godinho, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Manuel Freire, Fausto, Vitorino, Júlio Pereira and some others.

25|$|The {{official}} {{stance of}} both the South and North Korean governments has been against the continuing balloon drops.

25|$|The {{success of}} The Ostrobothnians {{was due to}} a {{confluence}} of factors: {{the appeal of the}} music, tonal but darkly colored; the use of folk melodies (blended with Madetoja's own idiom) familiar to the audience; a libretto (also by Madetoja) based upon a well-known and beloved play; a story <b>about</b> <b>freedom</b> from oppression and self-determination, the allegorical qualities of which were particularly salient in a country that had recently emerged from a war for independence; and, the skillful combination of comedic and tragic elements. The introduction to Act I (No. 2: Prisoner's Song in the suite), for example, is based upon a famous Ostrobothnian folk song, Tuuli se taivutti koivun larvan (The Wind Bent the Birch), {{which was one of the}} 262 folk songs Kuula had collected during his travels and which made its way into Madetoja's nationalistic opera, becoming its signature leitmotif.|$|E
