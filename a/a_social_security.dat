40|$|Several {{authors have}} argued that <b>a</b> {{mandatory}} <b>social</b> <b>security</b> program undertaken by Social Planner can have positive effects on welfare when individuals possess hidden information about their longevity. Davies and Kuhn (1992) have considered the related problem {{of the effects of}} <b>a</b> mandatory <b>social</b> <b>security</b> program undertaken by Social Planner when individuals can take hidden actions to affect their longevity and they have shown that <b>social</b> <b>security</b> never raises welfare in a pure moral hazard economy. Anderberg (1999) has considered voting over <b>a</b> mandatory <b>social</b> <b>security</b> program when there is an annuity market characterized by adverse selection and he has shown that a majority voting can be either the median type's ideal policy or an ends-against-the-middle equilibrium. In this work I will consider the case in which the annuity market is characterized by both adverse selection and moral hazard and I will analyse the effect of <b>a</b> mandatory <b>social</b> <b>security</b> program undertaken by Social Planner and by individuals through a Majority Rule: <b>a</b> mandatory <b>social</b> <b>security</b> program can have positive effects on welfare...|$|R

25|$|With few exceptions, {{all legal}} {{residents}} {{working in the}} United States now have an individual Social Security number.

25|$|The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) (codified in the Internal Revenue Code) imposes <b>a</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> {{withholding}} tax equal to 6.20% {{of the gross}} wage amount, up to but not exceeding the Social Security Wage Base ($97,500 for 2007; $102,000 for 2008; and $106,800 for 2009, 2010, and 2011). The same 6.20% tax is imposed on employers. For 2011 and 2012, the employee's contribution was reduced to 4.2%, while the employer's portion remained at 6.2%. In 2012, the wage base increased to $110,100. In 2013, the wage base increased to $113,700. For each calendar year for which the worker is assessed the FICA contribution, the SSA credits those wages as that year's covered wages. The income cutoff is adjusted yearly for inflation and other factors.|$|E

Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.|$|E

Senator Hinch stated that he did not believe that this constituted entitlement to a right or privilege of citizenship, which could breach s 44(i), but would consult with the Solicitor-General on whether he should refer himself to the High Court. On 2 September 2017, Hinch stated that he would not seek a reference, since the Attorney-General had advised him that he was not in breach.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, France was invaded and {{occupied}} by Nazi Germany. Metropolitan France {{was divided into}} a German occupation zone {{in the north and}} Vichy France, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, in the south, while Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London. From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews, were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany {{and occupied}} Poland. On 6 June 1944 the Allies invaded Normandy and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious over the Axis powers and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (suffrage extended to women, creation of <b>a</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> system).|$|E
40|$|In a {{quantitative}} model of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> with endogenous health, I argue that <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> increases the aggregate health spending {{of the economy}} because it redistributes resources to the elderly whose marginal propensity to spend on health is high.

In addition, <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> has <b>a</b> spill-over effect on Medicare. <b>As</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> increases health spending, it also increases the payments from Medicare, thus raising its financial burden...|$|R

25|$|The {{completion}} of the Nordland Line to Bodø in 1962 concluded {{the construction of new}} railway routes, while {{the first part of the}} Oslo Metro opened in 1966. <b>A</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> net was gradually introduced after the war: child allowance was introduced in 1946 and the Social Care Act was introduced in 1964. The 1960s saw good times for the heavy industry and Norway became Europe's largest exporter of aluminum and the world's largest exporter of ferroalloys. The University of Trondheim and the University of Tromsø both opened in 1968, one year before a network of regional colleges started being opened. Influenced by American culture and similar actions abroad, youth and students started an uproar against cultural norms. The 1960s saw an increased focus on environmentalism, especially through activism, based on ever-more conversion of waterfalls to hydro stations, pollution and the dilapidation of herring stocks. Rondane National Park was created as the country's first in 1962 and the Ministry of the Environment was the first in the world when it was established in 1972. A network of regional airports were built in Western and Northern Norway in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Membership in the European Economic Community was rejected in a 1972 referendum.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining <b>a</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> {{number for}} a child is voluntary. Further, there is no general legal {{requirement}} that individuals join the Social Security program unless they want or have to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About {{the only way to}} avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes are to join a religion that does not believe in insurance, such as the Amish, Christian Science or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517 and 4361). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans. Now only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the Social Security Administration estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in public employee pensions and not subject to Social Security taxes due to historical exemptions.|$|E
