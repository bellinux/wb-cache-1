40|$|Transfer of Pb <b>and</b> <b>As</b> into {{vegetables}} {{grown on}} orchard soils historically contaminated by Pb arsenate pesticides {{was measured in}} the greenhouse. Lettuce, carrots, green beans, and tomatoes were grown on soils containing a range of total Pb (16. 5 – 915 [*]mg/kg) <b>and</b> <b>As</b> (6. 9 – 211 [*]mg/kg) concentrations. The vegetables were acid-digested and analyzed for total Pb <b>and</b> <b>As</b> using ICP-mass spectrometry. Vegetable contamination was dependent on soil total Pb <b>and</b> <b>As</b> concentrations, pH, <b>and</b> vegetable species. Arsenic concentrations were the highest in lettuce and green beans, lower in carrots, and much lower in tomato fruit. Transfer of Pb into lettuce and beans was generally {{lower than that of}} <b>As,</b> <b>and</b> Pb <b>and</b> <b>As</b> were strongly excluded from tomato fruit.
