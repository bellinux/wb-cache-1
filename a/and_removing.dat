5|$|About 120 SS {{personnel}} {{were assigned to}} the gas chambers and lived on site at the crematoria. Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each gas chamber, while the bulk of the work was done by the mostly Jewish prisoners known as Sonderkommandos (special squads). Sonderkommando responsibilities included guiding victims to the gas chambers <b>and</b> <b>removing,</b> looting, and cremating the corpses.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, it was {{released}} on VHS in North America {{for the first time}} and on UK VHS in 1988 for the first time.

5|$|In 1995, {{the first}} report on {{attempted}} isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent actinides, the group 5 elements, and polonium.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} logic with the dynamic modal {{operators}} copy <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b> The copy operator replicates a given model, <b>and</b> the <b>remove</b> operator removes paths {{in a given}} model. We show that the product update by an action model (with Boolean pre-conditions) in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations. We also show that copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operators (of path of length 1) can be expressed by action models. We investigate {{the complexity of the}} satisfiability problem of syntactic fragments of the logic with copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations...|$|R
25|$|This {{behavior}} can be axiomatized in various ways. For example, a common VDM (Vienna Development Method) description of a stack defines top (peek) <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> as atomic, where top returns the top value (without modifying the stack), <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> modifies the stack (without returning a value). In this case pop is {{defined in terms of}} top <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} logic with the dynamic modal {{operators}} copy <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b> The copy operator replicates a given model, <b>and</b> the <b>remove</b> operator removes paths {{in a given}} model. We show that the product update by an action model in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations, when we consider action models with Boolean pre-conditions and no post-condition. We also show that copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operators with paths of length 1 can be ex-pressed by action models with post-conditions. We investigate the expressive power of the logic with copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations, together with the complex-ity of the satisfiability problem {{of some of its}} syntactic fragments...|$|R

5|$|Later work, {{during the}} 1750s and 1760s, was {{undertaken}} by the landscape gardener Capability Brown. This included extending the gardens to the north <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> the central cascade making the combe into a single sweep. The garden, as it was originally laid out, influenced other designers and contributed to defining the style of garden {{thought of as the}} English garden in continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, 2011, Lovato {{posted a}} message on Twitter criticizing her former network for airing episodes of Shake It Up and So Random! in which {{characters}} joked about eating disorders.

5|$|Soon after Urban VI {{had been}} elected pope in 1378, Robert of Geneva was elected as a rival pope, taking the name Pope Clement VII <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> himself to Avignon. The {{so-called}} Western Schism subsequently caused a great crisis in the Church and created rivalry and conflict throughout Christian Europe. It was eventually resolved {{as a result of}} the Council of Constance (1414–1418).|$|E
5|$|The game {{also offers}} {{objectives}} {{to be accomplished}} over multiple sessions, like making a six-letter word, or clearing three or more rows at once. This unlocks power-ups that occasionally provide opportunities such as halting the rate of new tetromino drops, <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> blocks from the screen. Up to three power-ups can be selected {{to be used in}} each game.|$|E
5|$|The present borders {{were drawn}} in 2006 {{with the aim}} of decentralising power <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> {{associations}} with the old system and the genocide. The previous structure of twelve provinces associated with the largest cities was replaced with five provinces based primarily on geography. These are Northern Province, Southern Province, Eastern Province, Western Province, and the Municipality of Kigali in the centre.|$|E

25|$|Slag {{may also}} form during smithing and refining. The {{product of the}} bloomer process is {{heterogeneous}} blooms of entrapped slag. Smithing is necessary to cut up <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> the trapped slag by reheating, softening the slag and then squeezing it out. On the other hand, refining is needed for the cast iron produced in the blast furnace. By re-melting the cast iron in an open hearth, the carbon is oxidized <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> from the iron. Liquid slag is formed <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> in this process.|$|R
5|$|The £500million {{restoration}} plan announced by Network Rail in 2005 {{was approved by}} Camden London Borough Council in 2007.

5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} who held the keys to power, installing new governors <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> them from office. By 1534, the Spanish colony in Honduras was close to collapse. Trujillo had a population of less than two hundred; {{it was the}} only Spanish settlement in Honduras, and very little territory beyond the town itself had been conquered. The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population had collapsed as a result of disease, mistreatment, and the export of large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, however, {{a second}} attempt to {{resupply}} B Company {{resulted in an}} Australian Iroquois helicopter being shot down by heavy ground fire, and exploding on impact. Two crew members were killed and another two injured, while another soldier was injured on the ground. With ammunition exploding among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, scrambling through the debris <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety. Subsequently, another winch point was established {{to the rear of}} the Australian positions for casualty evacuation and resupply.|$|E
50|$|After the {{structure}} {{was no longer}} used as a hospital extension it became the Alumni and Athletic Office in 1953 for the University. It was destroyed in 1969 <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> to get the land to construct other new buildings for University facilities in the 1970s. In 1975 the next Plankinton mansion to be destroyed <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> for the land was the John Plankinton house which was next door to William's. Thereafter the Elizabeth Plankinton House was destroyed in 1980 <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> under much protest.|$|R

5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on CD-ROM and floppy disk. A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> files such as the audio dialog to fit the game onto six diskettes.|$|E
5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the Ca2+ ion, high {{coordination}} numbers are common, up to 24 in some intermetallic compounds such as CaZn13. Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as EDTA and polyphosphates, which are useful in analytic chemistry <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> calcium ions from hard water. In the absence of steric hindrance, smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} for people with focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{pitching}} on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey {{injured his}} right hip. Over {{the next several}} seasons, he had multiple surgeries on his hip, including repairing a torn labrum <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8–5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. His eight wins tied for the most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians would attempt to shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time {{on the disabled list}}, Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the disabled list in 2001 with a strained elbow ligament.|$|E
5|$|Local {{churches were}} further {{organized}} into geographically defined presbyteries. A presbytery was {{a convention of}} all ministers within its jurisdiction and one ruling elder chosen by each session. Collegiate churches were entitled to be represented by two or more ruling elders {{in proportion to the}} number of its pastors. Presbyteries were responsible for examining, licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> ministers. They were also responsible for resolving doctrinal or disciplinary questions and also functioned as courts of appeal from sessions. An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E
