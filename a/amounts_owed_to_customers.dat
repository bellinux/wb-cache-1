50|$|In 1982 the {{net capital}} {{required}} under the Alternative Method was reduced <b>to</b> 2% of <b>customer</b> indebtedness. This meant customer receivables could not exceed 50 times the broker-dealers net capital. Neither at 2% nor at 4% required net capital did the resulting implicit 25 to 1 or 50 to 1 leverage limit on assets {{apply to a}} broker-dealer's overall assets. The 2% or 4% capital requirement was solely for customer assets (i.e., <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> by <b>customers</b> <b>to</b> the broker-dealer).|$|R
5000|$|The SEC {{has stated}} the net capital rule is {{intended}} to require [...] "every broker-dealer to maintain at all times specified minimum levels of liquid assets, or net capital, sufficient to enable a firm that falls below its minimum requirement to liquidate in an orderly fashion." [...] The Basic Method tries to reach this goal by measuring such [...] "liquid assets" [...] of the broker-dealer against most of its unsecured indebtedness. The [...] "liquid assets" [...] serve as the [...] "cushion" [...] to cover full repayment of that unsecured debt. The Alternative Method instead measures the [...] "liquid assets" [...] against obligations <b>owed</b> by <b>customers</b> <b>to</b> the broker-dealer. The [...] "liquid assets" [...] serve as the [...] "cushion" [...] for the broker-dealer's recovery of the full <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> it by <b>customers.</b>|$|R
