5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium {{from the end of the}} press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could <b>add</b> <b>all</b> 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.|$|E

VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. The microprocessor is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic.

During the 2004-2005 baby switch storyline, when Bianca's {{daughter}} is kidnapped and switched with the son of Babe Carey Chandler (Alexa Havins), Riegel also portrayed Bianca on fellow ABC soap opera One Life to Live.

2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1850s, there was {{discussion}} of closing the cemetery or abandoning {{it because of}} health concerns. In fall 1858, Dr. John H. Rauch MD suggested that the burial grounds were a health risk, which [...] "might serve extremely well for plantations of grove and forest trees" [...] that would be [...] "useful and ornamental to the city." [...] The idea was dropped during the Civil War, but revived by Dr. Rauch after the war ended. By 1864, the city council had decided to <b>add</b> <b>all</b> the [...] cemetery lands north of North Avenue to the park by relocating the graves. [...] The cemetery sections south of North Avenue were also relocated but this land was left for residential development. To this day, the Couch mausoleum can still {{be seen as the}} most visible reminder of the history as a cemetery, standing amidst trees, behind the Chicago History Museum. [...] Ira Couch, who is interred in the tomb, was one of Chicago's earliest innkeepers, opening the Tremont House in 1835. Couch is believed to not be the only person interred in the old burial ground in Lincoln Park. A plaque placed nearby states that [...] "the remains of six Couch family members and one family friend are in the tomb." [...] Partially due to the destruction of the Chicago Fire of burial markers, it was difficult to remove many of the remains.
