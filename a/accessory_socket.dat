40|$|ABSTRACT: Since {{the late}} 1990 s, GPS {{has begun to}} be used as a method for {{measuring}} personal travel. Early devices were for in-vehicle use only and derived their power from the <b>accessory</b> <b>socket</b> of the car. In the early 2000 s, the first wearable devices appeared, using battery power from rechargeable batteries. The early wearable devices were heavy and ungainly, and success in having people use the devices was limited. In 2005, ITLS and NeveITS pioneered the use of a much smaller device with its own internal battery, similar in weight and dimensions to a mobile telephone. Subsequent to the initial deployment of this device, there have been further advances in the sensitivity of the antenna/receiver and we have developed with NeveITS a number of improvements to software. This paper describes some of the tests conducted on these GPS devices and demonstrates the capability of these devices to provide detailed and accurate data on travel movements. The latest technologies for GPS devices indicate its potential to replace many conventional methods of data collection that are flawed because of known errors and inaccuracies...|$|E
50|$|The {{regulation}} requires all {{socket outlet}} units {{to comply with}} the requirements of BS 1363-2 Specification for 13A switched and unswitched socket-outlets and with the requirements of BS 5733 Specification for General requirements for electrical <b>accessories.</b> <b>Sockets</b> and socket outlets do not require independent approval under the regulations. Any plug fitted to the socket outlet unit must comply with the requirements of BS 1363-1 Specification for rewirable and non-rewirable 13A fused plugs. Plugs must also be independently approved and marked in accordance with the requirements of the regulation.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of non-permanently {{connected}} domestic equipment, a BS 1363-2 socket rated at 13 A {{is attached to the}} ring circuit, into which a fused plug may be inserted. (Note, it is not intended that the fuse should protect the appliance itself, for which it is still necessary for the appliance designer to take the necessary precautions.) Multiple <b>socket</b> <b>accessories</b> may be protected with a fuse within the socket assembly.|$|R
50|$|VIKO is {{providing}} product {{solutions for the}} handling of low voltage electricity current at different stages in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The company’s product portfolio includes wiring devices (switches & <b>sockets),</b> multi <b>sockets,</b> <b>accessories,</b> miniature circuit breaker boxes, smart meters & automatic meter reading solutions, low voltage switchgears and building automation systems.

40|$|Research Projects Agency task {{targeted}} at developing a neurally controlled upper-extremity prosthetic limb for the wounded warrior population that would incorporate and emulate, from the shoulder joint through the fingertips, the full 22 {{degrees of freedom}} possessed by the biologic arm. This review will give a brief background of upper-limb prosthetics and the impact currently insufficient technology has on both the military and civilian sectors. It then highlights the most novel socket concepts, prototypes, and <b>socket</b> <b>accessory</b> tool designs developed to support the Revo-lutionizing Prosthetics 2009 Modular Prosthetic Limb and meet the body interface chal-lenge unique to the Modular Prosthetic Limb. All of the technology developed also has potential to define directions of future prosthetic attachment and overall body interface standards in prosthetics as well as man–machine interface technology...|$|R
50|$|Sockets and {{extensions}} for impact wrenches {{are made}} of high tensile metal, as any spring effect will greatly reduce the torque available at the fastener. Even so, {{the use of multiple}} extensions, universal joints, and so forth will weaken the impacts, and the operator needs to minimize their use. Using non-impact <b>sockets</b> or <b>accessories</b> with an impact wrench will often result in bending, fracturing, or otherwise damaging the accessory, as most are not capable of withstanding the sudden high torque of an impact tool, and can result in stripping the head on the fastener. Non-impact <b>sockets</b> and <b>accessories</b> {{are made of}} a harder more brittle metal. Safety glasses should always be worn when working with impact tools, as the strong impacts can generate high-speed shrapnel if a <b>socket,</b> <b>accessory,</b> or fastener fails.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs the {{complexity}} of semiconductors grows rapidly, the volume of test data for them also increases enormously. Multi-Valued Logic(MVL) is one of solutions to meet test economics. MVL-based ATE can transmit several test data bits concurrently in a line, because MVL can have more than two values. Thus, even if the test clock speed {{is the same as}} DUT's, the test data can be expanded in proportional to the MVL bit steps. Moreover, the test <b>accessories</b> like a <b>socket</b> is easy to make due to lower test clock than binary TAM's one and the power consumption will be smaller too. However, MVL interface is vulnerable to noise for the small noise margin and needs decoders to convert MVL to binary data. In this paper, we simulate previous quaternary decoders if they are suitable for MVL decoder. After the simulation, an efficient decoder structure for MVL interface is proposed to improve the performance as well as the size...|$|R
