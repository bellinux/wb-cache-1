5|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{insignificant}} {{during the first half}} of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America. This impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by the export of <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
5|$|Merchants and peasant farmers paid {{property}} and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with {{a portion of}} their crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> and homemade wares at urban markets. The Han government may have found collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods.</b> However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E

5|$|Many {{insects are}} {{considered}} pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include {{those that are}} parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), or destroy <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce insecticides, but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control, or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered {{a key element of}} integrated pest management.|$|E
5|$|Settlement in {{the region}} of Gaza dates back to 3300–3000 BCE at Tell as-Sakan, a site located south of the present-day city, which began as an Ancient Egyptian {{fortress}} built in Canaanite territory. Tell as-Sakan prospered as Canaanite cities began to trade <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> with the Egyptians. However, when Egypt's economic interests shifted to the cedar trade with Lebanon, Gaza's role was reduced to that of a port for ships carrying goods and it declined economically. The site was virtually abandoned and remained so throughout the Early Bronze Age II.|$|E
5|$|The first {{industrial}} canal in Wales {{was built}} in 1768 to convey coal from the Gwendraeth Valley to the coast, and the following year, the earliest tramroad bridge was on the tramroad built alongside the canal. During the Napoleonic Wars (1799–1815) there was increased demand for coal, iron and <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods,</b> and the county prospered. The landscape changed as much woodland was cleared {{to make way for}} more food production, and mills, power stations, mines and factories sprang up between Llanelli and Pembrey. Carmarthenshire was at the centre of the Rebecca Riots around 1840, when local farmers and agricultural workers dressed as women and rebelled against higher taxes and tolls.|$|E

5|$|Despite this decision, Bird {{returned}} to government on 15 May 1996 as Minister of Science, Technology and Communications, with a {{transfer to the}} Ministry of Trade, Industry and Business Development following the 1999 general election. In 2000, he became Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; in this role, he negotiated {{an end to the}} Antiguan boycott of <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> from Trinidad and Tobago. The ALP lost the 2004 general election and were replaced by a United Progressive Party government under Baldwin Spencer. Bird remained involved in politics, and along with six other senior ALP members was arrested in 2009 after an unauthorised May Day rally. The seven politicians were found guilty of public order offences, although the trial was delayed following a seizure suffered by Bird. He suffered two more seizures in 2010, after the completion of the trial, and died on 31 March 2013 of heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Member states remain optimistic of {{the union}} and key {{partners}} in the region, namely China, Iran, Turkey remain interested in it. A common belief is that the Eurasian Economic Union has significant potential {{over the next two}} decades, with experts predicting a 25 percent growth in the member states' GDP by 2030, which equates to over US$600 billion. The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation. These collaborative policies are particularly interesting for countries in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} SR 266 {{from the western}} {{terminus}} to the junction with SR 168 is designated by the California State Legislature as eligible by law for the State Scenic Highway System; {{but it is not}} officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The entire route, consisting of two lanes for two-way traffic, traverses on the flat land in the Fish Lake Valley east of the White Mountains, and it can serve as transportation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> between California and Nevada via the route's only junction State Route 168. In the event that SR 168 is closed, SR 266 connects to Nevada State Route 264, which intersects with U.S. Route 6 in order to provide an alternate access to California.|$|E

5|$|When Harding {{took office}} on March 4, 1921, {{the nation was}} in the midst of a postwar {{economic}} decline. At the suggestion of its leaders, Harding called a special session of Congress to convene on April 11. When Harding addressed the joint session the following day, he urged the reduction of income taxes (raised during the war), an increase in tariffs on <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> to protect the American farmer, as well as more wide-ranging reforms, such as support for highways, aviation, and radio. But it was not until May 27 that Congress passed an emergency tariff increase on agricultural products. An act authorizing a Bureau of the Budget followed on June 10; Harding appointed Charles Dawes as bureau director with a mandate to cut expenditures.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E
5|$|The Uruguay Round of GATT {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.|$|E
30|$|Grain tariff {{changes are}} {{expected}} to have little effect on private food consumption levels. Overall, a grain tariff reduction is expected to increase food consumption levels for the majority of <b>agricultural</b> <b>good</b> only slightly, while a higher grain tariff is predicted to decrease food consumption levels.|$|R
30|$|In {{the short}} run, an {{increase}} in the international price of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>good</b> (i.e., an improvement in the terms of trade) raises the real remuneration received by landowners, capitalists in the primary sector and service workers. However, it reduces the real remuneration of workers and capitalists in the manufacturing sector.|$|R
30|$|Notice {{that the}} real effects of an {{increase}} in the international price of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>good</b> are identical to those of a decrease in the international price of the manufactured good.

25|$|Distribution of {{food and}} other <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> to urban consumers, {{industry}} and rural areas deficient in food was carried out primarily {{by the state and}} secondarily by producers or cooperatives. The state procured <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> by means of taxes in kind and by purchases by state commercial departments (state trading companies) under the Ministry of Commerce. The agricultural tax was not large, falling from 12 percent of the total value of agricultural output in 1952 to 5 percent in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to find gold and silver failed, the Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> that were to be exported to Europe. Tobacco and cotton and some other <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> were produced, but sugar became {{by far the most}} important Brazilian colonial product until the early 18th century. The first sugarcane farms were established in the mid-16th century and were the key for the success of the captaincies of São Vicente and Pernambuco, leading sugarcane plantations to quickly spread to other coastal areas in colonial Brazil. Initially, the Portuguese attempted to utilize Indian slaves for sugar cultivation, but shifted to the use of black African slave labor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{carefully}} analyzes {{a passage}} of Ricardo’s Essay on Prof-its ([1815] 1923), {{which suggests that}} he clearly understood the effects of both interindustry as well as intraindustry trade. In {{the context of the}} Essay model, Ricardo argues that free interindustry trade involv-ing an exchange of manufactures for <b>agricultural</b> <b>good</b> (from England’s point of view) raises the rate of profit through lowering the relative price of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>good.</b> On the other hand, where trade in-volves simply an exchange of manufactures for manufactures, these being produced under conditions of economies of scale (“division of labour in manufactures ” (pg. 25 of Essay)), the rate of profit is unaf-fected although that exchange of goods does raise welfare by augment-ing the variety of commodities made available through intraindustry trade. His Essay, therefore, is a precursor of the new trade theory. JEL classification: B 12, B 3...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that consumers tend to be patriotic in their choices of food. This paper theoretically examines the consequences of such patriotic behavior for agricultural policy, assuming that the policy is decided by the median voter. The analysis is conducted {{in the framework of}} a small open economy, with a ricardian production structure. Consumers differ with respect to how much extra they are prepared to pay for a domestically produced <b>agricultural</b> <b>good.</b> The indirect utility functions are used to find the specific values of tariffs and agricultural subsidies that the various households prefer. For the tariff we find that only the group that buys the domestically produced <b>agricultural</b> <b>good</b> will favor a strictly positive tariff. This tariff is higher the more disadvantage the country has in agricultural production. It is more likely that this group is a majority of the population if this country has a high productivity in the agricultural sector and if the patriotic parameter is large. agriculture, trade, policy, European perspective, International Relations/Trade, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|R
