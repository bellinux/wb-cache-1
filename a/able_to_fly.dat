5|$|Auks are seabirds {{which are}} superficially similar to {{penguins}} with their black-and-white colours, their upright posture {{and some of}} their habits, but the living species are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly.</b> There are about 23 species worldwide, four of which are rare vagrants in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest {{they would be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E

50|$|Prof. Ninomiya's designs also included, for {{the first}} time in any paper model, working {{propellers}} driven by airflow, in particular for his profile scale models of the Cessna Skymaster and Piaggio P.136 of 1967. Noteworthy as well was the careful design of gliders so that they could fly without ballast - his F-4 Phantom II model is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>flown</b> immediately without recourse to paperclips etc.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Kim and Fred Spratt of Jackson, New Jersey, took a babymoon {{vacation}} to Portugal {{with the full}} medical clearance of their physician. Tragedy struck when Kim pre-maturely gave birth to twins, Hudson and Hayden Spratt. Only one twin survived, and Kim and Fred were stranded in Portugal until Hayden Spratt, the surviving twin, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>flown</b> back <b>to</b> the United States on a medical flight.|$|R
5|$|The AW101 is {{typically}} {{operated by a}} crew of three: a pilot, an observer, and a crewman/operator. The pilot is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> {{for the majority of}} a mission in a hands-off mode, enabled by the sophisticated autopilot. All crew members have individual access to management computers and tactical information.|$|E

5|$|Among the anecdotes of {{navigation}} by bioluminescence, the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot {{he had found}} {{his way back to}} his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed. Turning off his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake of the ship, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to it and land safely.|$|E
50|$|Outfielders must cover large distances, so speed, {{instincts}} and quickness {{to react to}} the ball are key. They must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> catch <b>fly</b> balls above their heads and on the run. They must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> throw the ball accurately over a long distance to be effective. Novice players may find it difficult to concentrate on the game, since they are so far from the action. Emphasizing the correct position will give outfield players something to concentrate on at each pitch.|$|R
50|$|Rawlins {{joined the}} Oxford University Air Squadron while {{studying}} at the University of Oxford. This meant his was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> and train {{as an officer}} cadet of the Royal Air Force {{at the same time}} as studying for his degree. He was commissioned in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) on 1 November 1938 as a pilot officer.|$|R
50|$|The player {{begins with}} five lives (three on the PlayStation version). If a player dies, {{they return to}} the {{starting}} point of the level. Frogger's new abilities include being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> eat <b>flies</b> of various types, croak, and jump upwards onto ledges {{to take advantage of the}} 3D perspective. Flies and croaking tend to add to the player's score, though select insects allow Frogger to speed up, lengthen his tongue, or earn an extra life.|$|R
5|$|Pines of Rome by Ottorino Respighi. A {{family of}} {{humpback}} whales are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly.</b> The calf {{is separated from}} his parents and he becomes trapped in an iceberg. Eventually he finds his way out with his mother's help. The family join a larger pod of whales who fly and frolic through the clouds to emerge into outer space. Introduced by Steve Martin and Itzhak Perlman.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft {{would be needed to}} service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
5|$|The airline, in {{addition}} to the DouglasDC-3, DouglasDC-6B and Martin2-0-2s, operated Douglas DC-4 and Douglas DC-7C during the 1950s. JAL flew to Hong Kong via Okinawa by 1955, having pared down its domestic network to Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka and Sapporo. By 1958 the Hong Kong route had been extended to Bangkok and Singapore. With DC-7Cs JAL was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> nonstop between Seattle and Tokyo in 1959.|$|E
50|$|Outfielders must cover large distances, so speed, {{instincts}} and quickness {{to react to}} the ball are key. They must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> catch <b>fly</b> balls above their head and on the run, as well as prevent balls hit down the right field foul line from getting past them. Being situated 250-300 feet from home plate, they must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> throw the ball accurately over a long distance to be effective. Of all outfield positions, the right fielder often has the strongest arm, because they are the farthest from third base.|$|R
2500|$|The line is {{featured}} in Microsoft Train Simulator, which depicts the line {{as it was}} in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, depicting all of the stations on the line, with the player <b>able</b> <b>to</b> drive the <b>Flying</b> Scotsman or British Rail Class 50 Valiant along the [...] line.|$|R
25|$|In {{breeding}} experiments, Michael R. Rose selected {{fruit flies}} for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected {{that this would}} surely reduce their fertility. His team found that they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> breed <b>flies</b> that lived {{more than twice as}} long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artefact.|$|R
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they had not been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1942, a small {{detachment}} of an American fighter control squadron had been stationed on Goodenough Island to provide advance {{warning to the}} Australian fighters based at Milne Bay. On 7 August, five Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-40 Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron made forced landings on the grassy plains. One crashed on landing {{and had to be}} written off, but after makeshift airstrips were cut through the grass, the remaining four were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> out again.|$|E
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when they died. Their wings and shoulders are especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree of embryonic ossification in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus hatchlings, like megapodes and little terns, would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> very soon after hatching.|$|E
25|$|All {{navigational aid}} systems at LAX were {{controlled}} {{and found to}} be working {{at the time of}} the accident. The flight recorder was recovered using a remotely operated underwater vehicle and found to be intact. Flights and simulator tests were carried out by SAS, confirming that the recorded data could be simulated in an appropriate manner on schedule. As the aircraft was found airworthy and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>flown,</b> the bulk of the work of the investigation commission focused on operational procedures.|$|R

2500|$|At dawn on 31 March 1942, a dozen Japanese bombers {{launched}} the attack, destroying the radio station. The mutineers signalled {{their intention to}} surrender, raising a white flag before the 850-man landing force had come ashore. The Japanese expeditionary corps was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> disembark at <b>Flying</b> Fish Cove without opposition.|$|R
5|$|Properly {{equipped}} {{aircraft are}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> through snowstorms under Instrument Flight Rules. Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing {{of snow and}} other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise {{the safety of the}} aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing pneumatic boots, electro-thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} and female both are active in {{protecting}} and feeding the fledged chicks until they learn to forage on their own. The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a threatening manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it only takes {{a couple of weeks}} for them to become proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.|$|E
5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, {{at an age}} of about eight days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young in the nest leave it {{during the same period}} of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly.</b> They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.|$|E
3000|$|The GCS {{approach}} was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> track all <b>flies</b> in all experiments: only 49 of 50 flies were detected. On the other hand, the trajectories of the detected flies were less fragmented (compare to Section 4.2). In addition, the GCS was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> solve collisions and occlusions more frequently {{because of the}} global search space. This leads to the higher tracking accuracy illustrated in Figure [...]...|$|R
25|$|With {{pitch control}} {{provided}} by all four elevons, roll by the split ailerons (operating together), speed / approach control by split ailerons / airbrakes and yaw {{controlled by the}} rudder. In this configuration the aircraft proved to be stable in pitch, being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>flown</b> hands-off during aero-tow, and pitch could be controlled simply by the pilot leaning forwards or backwards to adjust the centre of gravity. Lateral stability was noted to be poor to fair but acceptable and the aircraft was safe and capable of flying simple aerobatics.|$|R
500|$|Ruf is {{a strong}} power hitter who, {{according}} to one talent evaluator quoted in Lindy's Sports 2014 baseball preview magazine, possesses [...] "raw country strength" [...] at the plate. He has an uppercut swing, and struggles to hit outside pitches because of poor balance at the plate, but consequently, is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hit <b>fly</b> balls and drive mistake pitches out of the park. He is a patient hitter, but {{is the opposite of}} many hitters, in that as a right-handed hitter, he hits left-handed pitchers better than right-handed pitchers.|$|R
