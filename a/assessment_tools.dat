40|$|The Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> is a 7 -item {{instrument}} that discriminates spasticity, dystonia, and rigidity on 3 levels: item scores, subtype, and hypertonia diagnosis for each extremity. We quantified the inter- and intrarater reliability using Kappa statistics, Gwet's first-order agreement coefficient (both with 95 % confidence interval), and percentage agreement for all levels. For validity, {{we compared the}} Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> subtype with the clinical diagnosis provided by the physicians. Two physiotherapists tested 45 children with neuromotor disorders. The interrater reliability (n = 45) of the Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> subtype was moderate to substantial whereas the intrarater reliability (n = 42) was almost perfect. The Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> showed good agreement in detecting spasticity. On the contrary, there was a higher presence of dystonia of 24 % to 25 % tested with the Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> compared to the clinical diagnosis. Even some individual items showed lower agreement between raters; the Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> subtypes and diagnosis were reliable. Validity of the Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> to test spasticity is confirmed, whereas, for dystonia and rigidity, further studies are needed...|$|R

By using life cycle <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His main findings showed that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Background: Self {{and peer}} {{evaluation}} using an objective <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> {{may be an}} effective way to evaluate procedural competency without requiring one-on-one expert attention in a simulation environment. Materials and Methods: An <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> was created as a checklist of critical steps involved in performing a thoracostomy. The checklist was verified by three expert physicians. Sixteen inexperienced medical students were recruited in pairs to perform one thoracostomy on a synthetic chest tube model in a simulated environment. After completing the procedure, the students used the <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> alongside a video recording of their procedure to conduct a self and peer evaluation. An expert physician conducted an independent evaluation of each student using the same <b>assessment</b> <b>tool.</b> The variations between the self, peer, and expert evaluations were compared to test the <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> for objectivity. Results: There was significant variation between self and expert evaluations (p = < 0. 00001) and between peer and expert responses (p = < 0. 00001). The significant variation occurred in 19 of the critical tasks. Conclusion: The <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> is not objective across the evaluators. Self and peer evaluation is an ineffective approach for assessing procedural competency, until variation is reduced among the 19 critical tasks...|$|R

2500|$|Diagnosis of ataxic {{cerebral}} palsy {{is based on}} clinical assessment using standardized <b>assessment</b> <b>tools.</b> Diagnosis begins with the observation of slow motor development, abnormal muscle tone, and unusual posture in children that fail to reach developmental milestones. [...] Diagnosis differs in adults and children because a child’s brain is still developing and acquiring new motor, linguistic, adaptive, and social skills.

2500|$|Once formed, first {{impressions}} {{tend to be}} stable. A {{review of the literature}} on the accuracy and impact of {{first impressions}} on rater-based assessments found that raters' first impressions are highly correlated with later scores, but it is unclear exactly why. One study tested stability by asking participants to form impressions people based purely on photographs. Participants' opinions of the people in photographs did not significantly differ after interacting with that person a month later. One potential reason for this stability is that one's first impressions could serve as a guide for his/her next steps, such as what questions are asked and how raters go about scoring. More research needs to be done on the stability of first impressions to fully understand how first impressions guide subsequent treatment, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the halo effect. <b>Assessment</b> <b>tools</b> can influence impressions too, for example if a question provides only a dichotomous [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] response or if a rater uses a scale (ratio). Although this study was conducted with the intention of improving rating methods in medical education, the literature review was sufficiently broad enough to generalize.|$|E
