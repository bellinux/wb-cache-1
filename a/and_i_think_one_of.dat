40|$|Development of {{national}} {{food and nutrition}} plans Suggested introduction: Poor nutrition can take many forms. It is a shocking truth that {{in some parts of}} the world, over-consumption of sweet and fatty foods is having a huge impact on health and fitness, while in others, people are weak and prone to disease because they do not have enough to eat, or lack sufficient protein, vitamins and minerals in their diet. Whilst the island states of the Caribbean region is perhaps unusual in having both these problems existing side by side - obesity and under-nutrition are, in some places, almost neighbours. As a way of addressing these problems, many Caribbean governments are now developing national food and nutrition security plans. This is a complex process, since food and nutrition involve many different areas of expertise, and require joint action by more than one ministry. At a recent conference on food and nutrition held in Belize, Susanna Thorp spoke to two people who have been heavily involved in the development of such plans. She spoke first to Lorraine Thompson, who works as country co-ordinator in Belize for the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and Panama (INCAP), and began by asking about Belize?s progress in implementing its national food and nutrition plan. IN:		?In Belize we are working on developing? OUT:		? financially as well as otherwise. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 28 ? Back announcement: Christine Bocage from the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute in Trinidad and Tobago emphasising the importance of good nutrition in supporting economic development. Transcript Thompson	In Belize we are working on developing a food and nutrition security plan. Our policy was adopted by government in 2001 and right after that a commission was named which is the body that would try to co-ordinate activities and try to make the plan operational. We have had some difficulties in trying to develop the plan and to implement it. One of them for instance has to do with co-ordination of activities. There are several different sectors that are working on nutrition in the country and I am sure this is what happens elsewhere. You have Ministry of Health has its programme, you have Ministry of Agriculture has its programmes related to food and nutrition security. You have the Ministry for Education for instance that has school feeding programmes. And what happens at the moment is that each of these bodies are carrying out their projects discreetly and what we need to do is to have some sort of co-ordinated approach to ensure that activities are co-ordinated and we are all working towards the same goal, that is improving food and nutrition security in the country. Thorp		So you would like to see better integration between the sectors? Thompson	Right <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the ways we are trying to approach it from is to have a co-ordinator, somebody who would work with the different entities that are involved in food and nutrition security that would bring us together. We put all our activities into one plan and hopefully there can be a more co-ordinated approach and certainly less duplication of efforts and better utilisation of the resources that we have. Thorp	And how is the plan seen within the country policy as a whole, is it given the priority that you would like it to be given? Thompson	I think for the most part our problem in the area of food and nutrition has been the fact that nutrition was never seen to be a problem. Now we understand better the concepts of food and nutrition security and we recognise that in fact the problems in relation to nutrition in this country are big. We are having a lot of chronic non-communicable diseases and we still have pockets of under-nutrition and so our problems are in fact bigger than we thought. We do have a big problem and we do need to generate more support - financial, technical and other resources - to support the implementation of these plans. Thorp	So although you are struggling with a number of different issues, actually in Belize your food and nutrition commission is further along perhaps in being set up and implementing its plan than some of the other countries in the region? Thompson	Right. There is a lot of political will and that is what has helped us along. Our government has seen, and I think they recognise, that food and nutrition security can be a tool to development and I think it recognises that food and nutrition security can be a tool that would help to alleviate poverty. The bottom line is that we have the political commitment which has helped us to come this far. NARR	Christine Bocage is a nutritionist at the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute, and she is responsible for assisting countries to develop and implement their national plans. I put it to her that one of the main challenges Caribbean nations face is the low number of people who are trained in both agriculture and nutrition. Bocage	With respect to agricultural, the human resource in agriculture I think it is much better, 100 % better than with respect to nutrition personnel in the region. We do have countries with no nutrition experts at all and they rely very heavily on the services of the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute. And with respect to agriculture even countries that are importing 99 % of their foods that they utilise and consume in country, they do have a greater capacity in agriculture than they do have in nutrition. So it is something that we really do need to take a long look at and to try to convince policymakers that there is a need for nutrition experts if we want to improve food and nutrition security at a national level as well as at a household level. And it is at the household level that we have the nutrition experts; particularly important because then they can give them knowledge and skills so that they can make the right choices and they can lead healthy lifestyles so that we can have a healthier population. Thorp	Because if nutrition can be seen in the right way governments would actually be saving themselves money? Bocage	Yes, I do think we have seen that in the past and again this will have to do with a lot of sensitisation. But you know politicians like to look at dollars and cents. How would improving nutritional status affect productivity or the economics of the country and so on. So we really need to, as nutrition professionals, agriculturists, persons in trade and planning, try to collect data, analyse the data, have sufficient information, as advocacy tools to convince the policymakers that if we do have a more productive society we can improve our situation financially as well as otherwise. End of track. Attempts in Belize to have a co-ordinated approach to food and nutrition planning, and the wider need for expertise and attention on nutrition...|$|E

40|$|Trading {{standards}} for export Cue: The global market for medicinal plants is huge, amounting {{to millions of}} dollars each year. It is also a growing market, with increasing numbers of people, particularly in Europe and the United States, using herbal medicines not only as treatment for illnesses, but as {{a regular part of}} their diet. For anyone using or selling a herbal medicine, having precise knowledge about the medicine is obviously important. In particular, they need to know what the plant is used for, how effective it is, and how safe it is. Those wanting to sell medicinal plants to markets in Europe or America must be able to answer these questions. For African medicinal plants, however, this creates a problem, as many plants are not fully documented. Currently, an organisation called the Association for African Medicinal Plants Standards, or AAMPS, is trying to address the issue. With advice from experts from across Africa, the association is writing herbal profiles, detailed descriptions of the 50 most important African medicinal plants, in the hope that this will support the marketing of these plants. Kobus Eloff, {{one of the founders of}} the association, explained more to Lucas Moloi. IN:		?We have got more plants species ? OUT:		? Africa of the whole world. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 13 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Kobus Eloff of the Association for African Medicinal Plants Standards. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Eloff	We have got more plants species in Africa than there are in China and in India but if you look at herbal medicines that are used in Europe you find that a very very few African herbal medicines are used and many many herbal medicines from India and many many especially from China as well. Moloi	So why do so many people in Europe prefer Indian and Chinese plant medicine compared to African? Eloff	In India and China information has been written down over a very long time now and all this information is available in a written form and people can read that and evaluate it. Whereas in Africa most of the information has been orally brought over from one generation to the next generation. So the difficulty in Africa is that people wanting to import plant material from Africa, they cannot really evaluate the quality and the value of that plant material. Moloi	AAMPS has been writing herbal profiles for African medicinal plants. What is a herbal profile? Eloff	What the herbal profile does, we also call it a trading standard, it tells a person that would want to import this exactly what this plant has been used for, every bit of information that we can collect is in there, and then also what the safety of that plant is. Moloi		How will these herbal profiles be useful to those growing medicinal plants? Eloff 	What we hope is that it will create a market. If let?s say there is a certain plant species that is grown in Tanzania, for example, and it is also valuable and if people have written these profiles they can see that this is an important plant and it addresses a need in Europe, then it will create a market. So the challenge is really to establish a market and then also to provide plant material of high enough quality. Quality is very important because if the quality is not good enough people will not import it and if the quality is poor then the name of that plant species will go down. Moloi		What will be key factors in achieving consistent quality? Eloff 	I think for consistent quality there are a number of factors. The first is that you must have the right plant material, because you must remember in the end if you use a herbal plant for a medicine, it is actually not the plant that we need, it?s the chemical compound that is inside the plant. So if you can find a certain plant from a certain area that has got very high concentration of this active compound it will be very valuable to grow that plant. And then the next thing is also, after you have grown the plant material and let?s say you need the leaves or you need the bark then what do you do with that. It must be dried under good conditions, there must be no fungus growing on it. So not only during the growing but also after you have harvested it is very important that it should be treated in a very good way. Moloi	Should small-scale farmers expect to work independently or as out growers or members of a group or cooperative? Eloff	I think the way that it would probably work out, a small-scale farmer will not be the person exporting it to someone else, because a person exporting the plant material will probably be contacted by someone from Europe or America. They said, ok they need so many tons of this and this plant, and then he will go to different areas, small communities and ask them whether they are able to grow the plant material. This is going to need something that is very well organised and well integrated and will probably grow through big exporters. I think they will be the people that do most of the work because they will also have the contact with the people in Europe that will have the demand for the plant material. Moloi	So what can African countries do to increase and expand their medicinal plant market in the future? Eloff	We are forming a very important link between Africa and Europe. If we have these written profiles now they will have to be big developments and that is where big enterprises or business companies will have to come in. If we have African businesses that start working in this area where they have good contacts with people in Germany or in France or in Europe or everywhere else where they need the different plant materials, they will then start identifying. This is already happening in some cases where you have got big companies in East, West or southern Africa and they already appoint people to grow these plant materials. But what has happened frequently, they grow Chinese plant materials or Indian plant materials in South Africa and then they export this because there is a market. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most important things of these profiles that we are writing is that we identify where there are gaps in literature. Let?s say that you have got a wonderful plant that helps for inflammation of whatever area and people have been using it a long time but we are not sure how safe that plant is. So in such a case there will have to be experiments done to determine the safety and then a scientist could then go to a funding organisation and say, ?This is one of the 50 most important African medicinal plants but we do not know what the safety is. We want to do safety experiments. ? And then there is a good chance that he could get funding. Moloi	Now Mr Kobus Eloff, I thank you very much and I appreciate your time you have shared with us. Eloff	I am very glad to have the opportunity because I think it is a wonderful opportunity. We have got such wonderful plants that we have in Africa and we must share it with the rest of the world and remember Africa will also benefit because now we know that the plants that they grow in Senegal for example, when we have all the information available, then these plants growing in Senegal or in Cameroon or Nigeria or wherever, or in Namibia, they can be used for all the people of Africa. Not only of Africa of the whole world. End of track. Producing detailed documentation on 50 important African medicinal plants, to aid international marketing of these species...|$|E
