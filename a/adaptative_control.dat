40|$|This {{paper is}} part of larger scope project in which the scientificity of the Gaia theory is analysed, {{intending}} to contribute towards a critical appraisal or the role that such a theory might have in biology teaching and in approaching the "environment" transversal theme. The Gaia theory proposes that the biosphere acts as na <b>adaptative</b> <b>control</b> system, keeping the earth in homeostasis. Some authors have proposed that this theory should be incorporated in the school curriculum. In Brazil, it already appears in some biology textbooks. The scientificity of this theory is questioned in this paper, given that its didactical transposition should be suported by a previous demonstration of its scientific nature...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{real-time}} {{identification of the}} rotor parameters of the induction motor drive. The model reference <b>adaptative</b> <b>control</b> technique {{has been used for}} synthesising two identifiers. An appropriate choice of the reference model allows a Lyapunov function to be built by means of which the updating law of the rotor time constant can be found. A higher order identifier is also synthesised using the hyperstability approach which allows real-time updating of two rotor parameters. The persistent exciting property of the input vector assures the parameters convergence. Using a DSP-based system (TMS 320 C 30), having 30 MHz clock frequency, a few experiments are conducted for testing the proposed identifiers performance {{in the case of a}} CRPWM inverter supplied driv...|$|E

40|$|International audienceResearch in <b>adaptative</b> cruise <b>control</b> (ACC) is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most important topics in the field of intelligent transportation systems. The main challenge is to perceive the environment, especialy at low speed. In this paper, we present a novel approach to track the 3 -D trajectory and speed of the obstacles and the surrounding vehicles through a stereo-vision system. This tracking method extends the classical patch-based Lucas-Kanade algorithm [9], [1] by integrating the geometric constraints of the stereo system into the motion model: the epipolar constraint, which enforces the tracked patches to remain on the epipolar lines, and the magnification constraint, which links the disparity of the tracked patches to the apparent size of these patches. We report experimental results on simulated and real data showing the improvement in accuracy and robustness of our algorithm compared to the classical Lucas-Kanade tracker...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an <b>adaptative</b> <b>control</b> algorithm, {{which is}} {{designed}} by adding a parametric identification method to a non-linear controller. The identification module is built upon the Hopfield neural network, resulting in an unconventional network with time-varying weights and biases. The convergence of the estimations of the parameters of a dynamical system was proved in previous work, {{as long as the}} system inputs can be freely manipulated to provide persistent excitation. Henceforth the behaviour of the closed-loop system, when the inputs result from the controller equations, is here analyzed in order to assess both the tracking performance of the full adaptive controller and the identification ability of the neural estimator. The algorithm is applied to an idealized robotic system with two joints, whose positions and velocities are required to follow, as closely as possible, a prescribed reference trajectory. The simulation results show a satisfactory control performance, since the demanded trajectory is almost accurately followed. The estimated values also converge to the correct parameters, as long as the controller provides sufficiently rich signals to the system. The results are similar to a conventional least-squares adaptive controller, with a much lower computational cost. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech...|$|E
40|$|In the MPC literature, {{stability}} is usually assured {{under the assumption}} that the state is measured. Since the closed-loop system may be nonlinear because of the constraints, {{it is not possible to}} apply the separation principle to prove global stability for the Output feedback case. It is well known that, a nonlinear closed-loop system with the state estimated via an exponentially converging observer combined with a state feedback controller can be unstable even when the controller is stable. One alternative to overcome the state estimation problem is to adopt a non-minimal state space model, in which the states are represented by measured past inputs and outputs [P. C. Young, M. A. Behzadi, C. L. Wang, A. Chotai, Direct digital and <b>adaptative</b> <b>control</b> by input-output, state variable feedback pole assignment, International journal of Control 46 (1987) 1867 - 1881; C. Wang, P. C. Young, Direct digital control by input-output, state variable feedback: theoretical background, International journal of Control 47 (1988) 97 - 109]. In this case, no observer is needed since the state variables can be directly measured. However, an important disadvantage of this approach is that the realigned model is not of minimal order, which makes the infinite horizon approach to obtain nominal stability difficult to apply. Here, we propose a method to properly formulate an infinite horizon MPC based on the output-realigned model, which avoids the use of an observer and guarantees the closed loop stability. The simulation results show that, besides providing closed-loop stability for systems with integrating and stable modes, the proposed controller may have a better performance than those MPC controllers that make use of an observer to estimate the current states.

40|$|The green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) {{was used}} as a model protein to study the recombinant protein production by the strain Methylobacterium extorquens ATCC 55366. Scale-up from shake flasks to 20 l fed-batch fermentation was achieved using methanol as a sole carbon and energy source and a completely minimal culture medium. Two different expression vectors were used to express GFP. Clone PCM-GFP containing the vector pCM 110 with native promoter of the methanol dehydrogenase PmxaF produced approximately 100 -fold more GFP than the clone PRK-GFP containing the vector pRK 310 with the heterogeneous promoter Plac. Several fed-batch fermentations with and without selective pressure (tetracycline) were run in a 20 l stirred tank fermenter using the two different clones of M. extorquens. The methanol concentration was monitored with an on-line semiconductor gas sensor in the culture broth. It was maintained at a non-toxic level of 1. 4 g l(- 1) with an <b>adaptative</b> <b>control</b> which regulates the methanol feed rate. The same growth profile was achieved in all fermentations. The maximum growth rate (micro(max)) was 0. 18 h(- 1) with an overall yield (Y(X/S)) of 0. 3 g g(- 1) methanol. With this high cell density fermentation process, we obtained high levels (up to 4 g l(- 1)) of GFP with the clone PCM-GFP. The maximum specific GFP production (Y(GFP/X)) with this clone was 80 mg g(- 1) representing approximately 16 % of the total cell protein. Additional feeding of pure oxygen to the fermenter permitted a longer phase of exponential growth but had no effect on the total yields of biomass and GFP. The specific GFP production of clone PCM-GFP remained unaffected in {{the presence or absence of}} selective pressure (tetracycline), within the initial 50 h of the fermentation culture.

40|$|Abstract: Type 1 {{blood glucose}} {{regulation}} remains a complex problem to simulate. Different blood glucose control schemes for insulin-dependent diabetes therapies and {{systems have been}} proposed in the literature. This arti-cle presents an <b>adaptative</b> predictive <b>control</b> system for glycaemia regulation based on feedforward Artificial Neural Networks trained with the resilient propagation (RPROP) method. Experiments performed on a math-ematical (theoretical) compensation model and our system aim to objectively compare the behaviour of each approach when both exact and perturbated data are presented. These experiments, which make use of a virtual patient, not only cover the ANN’s best configuration and training parameters on exact training information, they also demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} neural approach when up to 20 % perturbated data are supplied. As a result of the experiments on perturbated data, the neural approach gives slightly better evaluations than the theoretical model. This demonstrates the neural system’s ability to adapt to perturbated environments. ...|$|R
40|$|Synaptic {{transmission}} of the light response from photoreceptors to second-order cells of the retina was studied with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) retinal slices. Synaptic strength is modulated by extracellular pH in a striking manner: Light-sensitive postsynaptic currents in horizontal and bipolar cells {{were found to be}} exponential functions of pH, exhibiting an e-fold increase per 0. 23 pH unit over the pH range from 7 to 8. Calcium channel currents in isolated photoreceptors were measured and also exhibited proton sensitivity. External alkalinization from pH 7 to 8 shifted the voltage dependence of channel activation negative by 12 mV. A model of the synaptic transfer function suggested that presynaptic Ca channels could be the primary sites of proton action. Increased Ca influx and transmitter release brought about by alkalinization give rise to larger postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that activity-dependent interstitial pH changes known to occur in the retina, while not alleviating signal clipping at this synapse, may provide an <b>adaptative</b> mechanism <b>controlling</b> gain at the photoreceptor output synapse...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that high performance speed control {{can be obtained}} by using an <b>adaptative</b> sliding mode <b>control</b> method for a direct vector controlled Squirrel Cage Induction Motor (SCIM). In this study a new method of designing a simple and effective adaptative sliding mode rotational speed control law is developed. The design includes an accurate sliding mode flux observation from the measured stator terminals and rotor speed. The performance of the Direct Field-Orientation Control (DFOC) is ensured by online tuning based on a Model Reference Adaptative System (MRAS) rotor time constant estimator. The control strategy is derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory so that the stable tracking performance can be guaranteed under the occurrence of system uncertainties and external disturbances. The proposed scheme is a solution for a robust and high performance induction motor servo drives.

Following scopolamine treatment muscarinic receptor density in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum of young rats increased by 34, 57 and 27 %, respectively; in brains of aged rats the increase was 41 % in cerebral cortex, 43 % in hippocampus and nil in striatum.

40|$|International audienceLaboratory {{experiments}} on simulated faults in rocks clearly show the temperature dependence of rock friction. Since rocks surrounding faults are permeable, {{we have developed}} a numerical method to describe the thermo-mechanical evolution of the pre-seismic sliding phase which takes into account both the rate-, state- and temperature-dependent friction law and the heat advection term in the energy equation. We consider a laminar fluid motion perpendicular to fault plane and assume that fluids {{move away from the}} fault plane. A semi-analytical temperature solution which accounts for the variability of slip velocity and stress on the fault has been found. This solution has been generalized to the case of a time varying fluid velocity and then was used to include the thermal pressurization effect. After discretizing the temperature solution, the evolution of the system is obtained by the solution of a system of first order differential equations which allows us to determine the evolution of slip, slip rate, friction coefficient, effective normal stress, temperature and fluid velocity. The numerical solutions are found using a Runge-Kutta method with an <b>adaptative</b> stepsize <b>control</b> in time. When the thermal pressurization effects can be neglected, the heat advection effect gives rise to a delay, with respect to the purely conductive case, of the earthquake occurrence time. This delay increases with increasing permeability of the system. When the thermal pressurization effects are taken into account the situation is opposite, i. e. the onset of instability tends to precede that of the purely conductive case. The advance in the time of occurrence of instability increases with increasing coefficient of thermal pressurization. In the small permeability range (H≤ 10 m), the seismic moment and nucleation length of the pre-seismic phase are significantly smaller than those predicted by the purely conductive model...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy (LVH) {{may be an}} adaptative remodelling process {{induced by}} physical training, or result from pathological stimuli. We hypothesized that different LVH aetiology could lead to dissimilar spatial distribution left ventricular (LV) contraction, and compared different components of LV contraction using 2 -dimensional (2 -D) speckle tracking derived strain in subjects with adaptative hypertrophy (endurance athletes), maladaptative hypertrophy (hypertensive patients) and healthy controls. METHOD: We enrolled 22 patients with essential hypertension, 50 endurance athletes and 24 healthy controls. All subjects underwent traditional echocardiography and 2 -D strain evaluation of LV longitudinal, circumferential and radial function. LV basal and apical rotation and their net difference, defined as LV torsion, were evaluated. RESULTS: LV wall thicknesses, LV mass and left atrium diameter were comparable between hypertensive group and athletes. LV longitudinal strain was reduced only in hypertensive patients (P < 0. 05). LV apex circumferential strain was higher in hypertensive patients than in other groups (P < 0. 001), LV basal circumferential strain, although slightly increased, did not reach significant difference. Hypertensive patients showed significantly increased rotation and torsion (P < 0. 001), while no differences were observed between athletes and control. CONCLUSION: In patients with pathological LVH, LV longitudinal strain was reduced, while circumferential deformation and torsion were increased. No differences were observed in LV contractile function between subjects with <b>adaptative</b> LVH and <b>controls.</b> In pathological LVH, increasing torsion {{could be considered a}} compensatory mechanism to counterbalance contraction and relaxation abnormalities to maintain a normal LV output...|$|R
