5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E

5|$|C# is more type safe than C++. The only {{implicit}} conversions {{by default}} <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during JIT, and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, {{which can be}} implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ copy constructors and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, Christmas {{number one}} albums <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{at the top}} of the UK Albums Chart on Christmas Day. Typically, this will refer to the album that was {{announced}} as number one on the Sunday before 25 December—when Christmas Day falls on a Sunday itself, the official number one is considered by the OCC to be the one announced on that day's chart. During the 1990s, the following albums were Christmas number ones.|$|E
5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a hierarchy of being, and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E

5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{present in}} high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent {{and the higher}} these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> long acting {{and do not}} require ongoing health care visits. Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. With typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high, at 9%, due to incorrect usage. Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young people.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, {{he has to go}} where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
