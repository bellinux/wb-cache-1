5000|$|Korn and {{the boys}} go {{investigate}} the [...] "Mystery of the Pirate Ghosts and the missing body." [...] After a few mishaps typical of Scooby-Doo episodes, it is revealed that Priest Maxi was behind the Pirate Ghosts, which he simply conjured up with rather impossible light tricks and sounds (the explanation {{to some of the}} citizen's deaths earlier caused by the Pirate Ghosts is left unsolved and unknown). The mystery of Cleo Broflovski's missing corpse is solved when the dog regurgitates the body. The Halloween Haunt goes as planned, with Korn playing [...] "Falling Away from Me" [...] which shocks the crowd, as their cheery personality in the episode is a strong contrast to the song. The boys get their revenge against the 5th graders while Korn is playing, scaring them with the corpse and Cartman's Antonio Banderas doll gets popped by Nibblet. Kenny's spectacular ED-209 costume does not win him first prize, which goes instead to Wendy Testaburger wearing the same Chewbacca costume as in the previous Season 1 Halloween Special [...] "Pinkeye". During the closing credits, he ends up getting killed by miniature Snowspeeders as in The Empire Strikes Back while inside his costume and rats <b>arrive</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> his body.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{the town}} of Ocotepec, north of Cuernavaca in the State of Morelos, opens its doors to {{visitors}} in exchange for veladoras (small wax candles) to show respect for the recently deceased. In return the visitors receive tamales and atole. This is done only by {{the owners of the}} house where someone in the household has died in the previous year.

5000|$|After the two {{figure out}} that the {{experimental}} carpet in the room swapped them while Dipper conducted static electricity, they also realize that they can sabotage their uncle's view of each other while in each other's bodies. Mabel (Dipper) makes Stan a sandwich made out of rocks while Dipper (Mabel) sings [...] "Breaking stuff is so much fun, I am Dipper and I stink," [...] while Stan, not knowing what happened, is confused. Waddles rolls around on the electron carpet while Soos cleans and comes to pet him, thereby swapping them, fulfilling Soos' wish of {{wanting to be a}} pig. Meanwhile, Candy and Grenda <b>arrive</b> <b>to</b> have yet another sleepover with whom they think is Mabel (actually Dipper), and reject Dipper (Mabel)'s request to talk to her (him). Mabel (Dipper) tries to get away, but Grenda suggests that they should read a romance novel about a werewolf. Dipper (Mabel) spies on them through the keyhole, trying to listen to the book reading, when Stan discovers her and, thinking Dipper is spying on the girls, decides that they need to have a talk about the birds and the bees. Downtown, Soos enjoys being Waddles, and is rolling in mud until Old Man McGucket <b>arrives</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> him, while Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland read their horoscopes from their car.|$|R

50|$|While they awaited in {{a private}} area for La Mare and his {{associates}} <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> they began <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> lunch. Without comment two gunmen leaped out from a back room and unleashed a barrage of shotgun blasts at both men. Milazzo {{was hit in the}} head and died instantly, while Parrino was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm and soon died. Milazzo was 43 years of age and his murder would start a new round of killings within the Detroit Mafia, but this next round of killings would finally allow the alignment of the Detroit Mafia under a new regime and a national criminal organization under the leadership of The Commission.|$|R
5000|$|Bradford {{commissioned}} {{a group of}} armed men (Bradford says 14) under Captain Standish {{on a mission to}} raid Nemasket at night to round up Corbitant and any accomplices. The men set out on August 14, and Hobomok agreed to show them the route. The day proved very wet, but they marched within two or three miles of Nemasket and hoped to rest before their midnight attack. Hobomok, however, lost his way in the night, which, together with the rain and fatigue, greatly discouraged the men. Fortunately, Winslow and Stephen Hopkins had been to Nemasket recently on their way to an embassy to Massasoit in Pokanoket. Though discouraged and wet, they <b>arrived</b> in time <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> what they brought, then fell on the town around midnight.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the women}} of Armagh prison had been {{operating}} under a [...] "no work" [...] protest {{for quite a while}} to no avail, the events of 7 February 1980 served as a catalyst which would escalate their protest into a [...] "dirty" [...] one, mirroring the actions of their male counterparts in Long Kesh. After weeks of being served poor food, the women were told that their lunch on this afternoon would be chicken and apple pie. As they <b>arrived</b> <b>to</b> being <b>eating,</b> the warden informed them that their cells were to be searched during their meal; this warning which was generally ignored due to the astonishingly good food they were being served, and the searches went on unimpeded. During the meal, however, an increased number of guards, some rumoured to have been brought over from Long Kesh for extra reinforcement, entered the room, causing panic and an uprising among the women. This panic led to a prisoners' rebellion, during which the women were locked into two mass cells as their own cells were torn apart looking for clothing which could be identified as military-like uniforms. After the search was completed, the women were returned to their cells but were also informed that they were to be [...] "Adjudicated" [...] for their roles in the riot; they were subsequently beaten by guards in riot gear and confined to their cells for 24 hours, during which time they were denied access to the bathroom and given little food <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Over the course of their confinement, their chamber pots began to fill, forcing the women to dump the urine out of spy holes in their doors (these were subsequently nailed shut) and to throw the excrement out their windows (which were then boarded up). By 12 February 1980, it was official: Armagh Dirty Protest had begun.|$|R

Later that night, Justine discovers a strong, itchy rash all over her body. She goes to the doctor the next day, who diagnoses her with food poisoning and gives her a cream for the rash.|$|R

5000|$|When the Planet Express crew {{lands on}} a planet in search for a fast food restaurant, they find that it abounds in a delicious edible life-form, which they call [...] "Popplers". The highly {{addictive}} [...] "Popplers" [...] soon inspire a new business venture for the crew. Unfortunately, after Popplers become an incredibly popular food item and the organization MEAT (Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment) begins to protest against them, it is learned {{that they are the}} larval stage of the Omicronian race, and that the planet from where they came from is one of the nursery planets of the Omicronians. Leela, the first to discover this when a Poppler awakens in her hands, leads the charge <b>to</b> stop the <b>eating</b> of Popplers. This mostly fails, partly due to Bender's subversive actions. The warlike natives of Omicron Persei 8, led by Lrrr, <b>arrive</b> <b>to</b> seek justice for humans devouring billions of their young. The Omicronians demand that they be allowed <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the same number of Earthlings as [...] "Popplers" [...] which were eaten. Since there are fewer humans on Earth than the number of Popplers that were eaten, and since Lrrr filled up on nuts during the negotiations, the Omicronians choose instead <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the first Earthling <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> their young: Leela.|$|R
50|$|The show skips to prehistoric Utah {{during the}} Late Jurassic period. The region has been engulfed by a severe drought as the {{seasonal}} rain has failed <b>to</b> <b>arrive.</b> A predatory Ceratosaurus stalks {{a family of}} Dryosaurus, including a mother and two youngsters. The predator eventually breaks its cover and charges after the small dinosaurs as they scatter. The Dryosaurus can only flee but the Ceratosaurus is quicker than they are and catches up, grabbing and killing one of the juveniles. The Ceratosaurus feasts while the others escape into a grove of pine trees and run into a herd of sauropods called Camarasaurus. They will be safe around the gentle giants. A male Stegosaurus fights off the attacking Ceratosaurus, the same individual from the earlier sequence, later on using its spiked tail and follows a female Stegosaurus constantly displaying its plates. Eventually, the female decides {{that he is a}} healthy individual and the two mate. With the onset of the rainy season, a herd of Apatosaurus arrive, followed by a Allosaurus who launches an assault against the herd while the sauropods graze but is unsuccessful due to their size and strength. The Allosaurus subsequently kills the Ceratosaurus that attacked the Dryosaurus and finally is able to feed. Later whilst following its herdmates, one Apatosaurus stumbles over a fallen tree and tumbles off of a 20 foot high cliff and cripples itself. The sauropod is mortally wounded, and its agonized bellowing is picked up by the hungry Allosaurus. When the Allosaurus <b>arrive,</b> they begin <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the sauropod alive.|$|R
50|$|As Heart {{is unable}} <b>to</b> live by <b>eating</b> plants and can't sustain himself of berries, he travels {{outside the forest}} and into the plains to look for food; {{unfortunately}} he watches a Triceratops fighting a pack of Tyrannosaurus, {{one of which is}} impaled by one of its horns and killed. Suddenly from the mist enters Baku, a particularly large Tyrannosaurus with a scar over his right eye, who slams the Triceratops to the ground, killing it. After watching the pack eat the corpse, Heart tries to retreat quietly <b>to</b> avoid being <b>eaten</b> as well, not knowing he was one of them. However Baku notices him and ask him about his family. Heart fearfully answered that he had a brother and a mother, not telling that they are Maiasaura. Then Baku explains the lifestyle of a predator, which makes Heart flee in panic, without noticing that Gonza, one of the Tyrannosaurus, was following him. After rejoining with Light, Heart tells in disdain his experience with the Tyrannosaurus, but Gonza <b>arrives</b> and threatens <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> Light. In panic Light yells to Heart to save himself, causing Gonza to wonder why a Maiasaura would take care of a Tyrannosaurus. Light explains that Heart is his brother, but then Gonza reveals Heart's real species, which Heart denies and attacks Gonza. He bites and rips off his tail, leaving Gonza to flee in pain, feeling betrayed. Unfortunately, upon eating the tail, Heart realizes that Gonza was telling the truth, and, upon tackling Light, that he couldn't control his predatory instincts, so he decides to run away to avoid killing and eating his family.|$|R
