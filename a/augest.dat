40|$|We {{report on}} {{theoretical}} <b>Auger</b> electron {{kinetic energy distribution}} originated from sequential two-step <b>Auger</b> decays of molecular double core-hole (DCH) state, using CH 4, NH 3 and H 2 CO molecules as representative examples. For CH 4 and NH 3 molecules, the DCH state has an empty 1 s inner-shell orbital and its <b>Auger</b> spectrum has two well separated components. One is originated from the 1 st <b>Auger</b> transition from the DCH state to the triply ionized states with one core hole and two valence holes (CVV states) {{and the other is}} originated from the 2 nd <b>Auger</b> transition from the CVV states to quadruply valence ionized (VVVV) states. Our result on the NH 3 <b>Auger</b> spectrum is consistent with the experimental spectrum of the DCH <b>Auger</b> decay observed recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 213005 (2010) ]. In contrast to CH 4 and NH 3 molecules, H 2 CO has four different DCH states with C 1 s^{- 2 }, O 1 s^{- 2 } and C 1 s^{- 1 }O 1 s^{- 1 } (singlet and triplet) configurations, and its <b>Auger</b> spectrum has more complicated structure compared to the <b>Auger</b> spectra of CH 4 and NH 3 molecules. In the H 2 CO <b>Auger</b> spectra, the C 1 s^{- 1 }O 1 s^{- 1 } DCH -> CVV <b>Auger</b> spectrum and the CVV -> VVVV <b>Auger</b> spectrum overlap each other, which suggests that isolation of these <b>Auger</b> components may be difficult in experiment. The C 1 s^{- 2 } and O 1 s^{- 2 } DCH -> CVV <b>Auger</b> components are separated from the other components in the H 2 CO <b>Auger</b> spectra, and can be observed in experiment. Two-dimensional <b>Auger</b> spectrum, representing a probability of finding two <b>Auger</b> electrons at specific pair of energies, may be obtained by four-electron coincidence detection technique in experiment. Our calculation shows that this two-dimensional spectrum is useful in understanding contributions of CVV and VVVV states to the <b>Auger</b> decay of molecular DCH states.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanisms of}} <b>Auger</b> recombination of nonequilibrium carriers in semiconductor heterostructures with quantum wells are investigated. It is shown {{for the first}} time that there exist three fundamentally different <b>Auger</b> recombination mechanisms of (i) thresholdless, (ii) quasi-threshold, and (iii) threshold types. The rate of the thresholdless <b>Auger</b> process depends on temperature only slightly. The rate of the quasi-threshold <b>Auger</b> process depends on temperature exponentially. However, its threshold energy essentially varies with quantum well width and is close to zero for narrow quantum wells. It is shown that the thresholdless and the quasi-threshold <b>Auger</b> processes dominate in narrow quantum wells, while the threshold and the quasi-threshold processes prevail in wide quantum wells. The limiting case of a three-dimensional (3 D) <b>Auger</b> process is reached for infinitely wide quantum wells. The critical quantum well width is found at which the quasi-threshold and threshold <b>Auger</b> processes merge into a single 3 D <b>Auger</b> process. Also studied is phonon-assisted <b>Auger</b> recombination in quantum wells. It is shown that for narrow quantum wells the act of phonon emission becomes resonant, which in turn increases substantially the coefficient of phonon-assisted <b>Auger</b> recombination. Conditions are found under which the direct <b>Auger</b> process dominates over the phonon-assisted <b>Auger</b> recombination at various temperatures and quantum well widths.

The {{absolute}} <b>Auger</b> rates, relative intensities and {{the angular}} anisotropy coefficients of <b>Auger</b> electrons have been {{calculated for the}} KLL <b>Auger</b> spectra of laser-excited sodium atoms.

To study the KLL <b>Auger</b> spectra of 3 s! 3 p excited sodium atoms we calculated the <b>Auger</b> matrix elements within the multiconfigu-rational Dirac–Fock model using the intermediate coupling scheme for representing the atomic states. The intensities and angular distribution parameters are discussed together with theoretical predictions in the LS coupling and compared to results obtained for the sodium ground-state KLL <b>Auger</b> transitions. We also discuss the influence of overlapping initial fine-structure states on the <b>Auger</b> dynamics. Large anisotropy coefficients are predicted, even for the case of a non-resolved initial- and final-state fine structure. 1...|$|R

In order to quantify the effectiveness of proper irrigation and nitrogen management on tea, the response of tea to various levels of irrigation and nitrogen applications was studied in Fouman suburb of Guilan province. Tea crop production function and its crop coefficient (KC) were determined. A line source sprinkler irrigation was used for creatiating a variable irrigation application and a split-split-plot statistical design was used. Irrigation treatments consisted of full irrigation (I 4), deficit irrigation (I 3, I 2 and I 1) and no irrigation(I 0). Nitrogen application treatments were N 1, N 2 and N 3 (100, 180 and 360 kg/ha) in three replications randomly arranged as main plots, while irrigation treatments as sub plots were not randomized. During the growing period, soil moisture up to the depth of 90 cm was determined gravimetrically and actual crop water use was calculated from mass balance equation weekly. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was estimated by Penman-Montieth equation and was used to estimate tea crop coefficient. During growing period, the actual tea water use of I 4 and I 0 were computed to be 457 and 256 mm. Tea crop coefficient during dry period (June, July and <b>Augest)</b> ranged from 0. 8 to 0. 9. Crop resistance factor (Ky) for tea was found to be 1. 37.

These are distributed according to localities. The target samples were distributed in Omdurman, Karrari and Ombada localties, and were collected from Boreholes, Storage facilities, houses and Vendors, which are feeding the houses not connected to the network, samples were taken for laboratory analysis, which included chemical, physical and bacteriological examinations. The results of the study showed that, the majority of boreholes in study area were safe regarding chemical quality aspects. This included (F- NO 2 - NO 3 - CL – pH - TDS);the concentration of these parameters were within the allowable limits set by (WHO) and (SSMO). The samples taken from Elshab factory boreholes recorded high level of chlorides 7250 mg/l, exceeding the maximum permissible level of 250 mg/l, and TDS values, equaling 1023 mg/l, were also more than the maximum permissible level of 1000 mg/l in drinking water. Assessment of Groundwater Quality in Omdurman City 12 The results of physical quality of water samples, taken from the study area, were acceptable. The bacteriological analysis of the water samples taken from the boreholes in the study area recorded higher level of thermotolerant and Ecoli, (46 %) were more than the permissible levels set by (WHO) and (SSMO) standards. The results of samples taken from the Storage facilities showed that (66. 7 %) of these facilities were safe (not polluted). As for the Bacteriological quality of water samples taken from Houses, samples were found to be polluted by Ecoli and thermotolerant coliforms. It was observed that the contamination rate of water in houses which are not connected to the net work was (62. 3 %) higher in comparison with those directly connected to the net work. This demonstrates the importance of distribution system in alimentally the contamination rate. This study comes out with many suggested recommendations, the important of which are that the pollution sources should be sited away from boreholes, Septic tank and latrines should be of proper designs to eliminate infiltration to boreholes through soil layers. Also disinfection of wells is important. On the other hand legislative acts and regulation for well drilling and proper disposal of effluent is of high importance.
