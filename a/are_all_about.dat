Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the same size.|$|E

25|$|A {{frequent}} {{criticism of}} Resnais's films among English-language commentators {{has been that}} they are emotionally cold; that they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> technique without grasp of character or subject, that his understanding of beauty is compromised {{by a lack of}} sensuousness, and that his seriousness of intent fails to communicate itself to audiences. Elsewhere however it is suggested that such views are partly based on a misreading of the films, especially his earlier ones, which has impeded an appreciation of the humour and irony which pervade his work; and other viewers have been able to make the connection between the film's form and its human dimension.|$|E

Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child.

The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state."

500|$|Some {{suggest that}} Meyer is likely a Republican, while others feel {{she is a}} Democrat. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer's party {{affiliation}} is unknown because the show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology. James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows: Veep is [...] "almost all politics and almost no political issues". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations, or even political ideology in a similar manner, saying that Veep is [...] "less a show about politics than about politicking." [...] In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus suggested that Meyer's associated political party is intentionally left unknown to the audience. Louis-Dreyfus later elaborated: [...] " [...] politics <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> her and staying alive ... she will hold any position if it keeps her in office."

Another 9 of the cathedrals, Norwich, Peterborough, Salisbury, Worcester, Gloucester, Wells, Exeter, Chichester and Lichfield, are between 120–150 metres long (being between 397–481 feet, 121-146.5 metres).

500|$|Bumgarner pitched for the Augusta Greenjackets, the Giants' Low-A South Atlantic League affiliate, in 2008. The Giants {{sought for}} him to alter the angle of his head during his delivery, but after Bumgarner {{struggled}} over his first three starts in Augusta, he reverted {{to the way he}} had thrown in high school. With Augusta, he worked on the changeup, the slider, and [...] "the ability to pitch inside." [...] When asked if it was tough to work on off-speed pitches in a league in which most of the hitters can be fooled with the fastball, Bumgarner replied, [...] "The minors <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> player development. I needed to work on other pitches and have the confidence to throw them." [...] He won the South Atlantic League pitchers' Triple Crown, tying for the league lead in wins (15, tied with Levi Maxwell), leading the league in earned run average (1.46), and leading the league in strikeouts (164). He began the 2009 season with the Giants' High-A affiliate, the San Jose Giants of the California League. After five starts, in which he went 3–1 with a 1.48 ERA and 23 strikeouts, he was called up to the Giants AA affiliate, the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League. On July 22, he hit a grand slam against Eric Niesen and picked up the victory in a 9–3 triumph over the Binghamton Mets.

[...] Cox added that [...] "there is absolutely {{an attempt to}} make sure every punch or kick that is thrown is like a line of dialogue; there is motive behind it, there is reason behind it, it means something." [...] Cox's stunt double, Chris Brewster, explained how the series' fight choreography has evolved, with the first season having shown Murdock just starting out as a vigilante—"he fought with all heart and soul, but wasn't a polished fighter....he was more raw and gritty"—while the second season sees the character having learned from previous mistakes—"his style is more defined and thought out now, but he will always fight with the Daredevil flair". As for the fighting styles of Punisher and Elektra, Brewster said that because of the Punisher's military background he uses a lot of weapons, and his [...] "hand to hand style is more of a close quarter combat nature", while Elektra was trained by Stick and the Hand, so she has similar movement to Daredevil who was also trained by Stick. [...] "However," [...] Brewster continued, [...] "The Hand are trained assassins who <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> stealth takeouts and quick kills. Her style shows elements of" [...] that as well. The season uses multiple different martial art styles, including kali, Chinese kung fu, wing chun, kenjutsu, and boxing.|$|E
500|$|Several {{prominent}} scientists {{working in}} the field of neuroscience supported Carr's argument as scientifically plausible. James Olds, a professor of computational neuroscience, who directs the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study at George Mason University, was quoted in Carr's essay for his expertise, and upon the essay's publication Olds {{wrote a letter to the}} editor of The Atlantic in which he reiterated that the brain was [...] "very plastic" [...] — referring to the changes that occur in the organization of the brain as a result of experience. It was Olds' opinion that given the brain's plasticity it was [...] "not such a long stretch to Carr's meme". One of the pioneers in neuroplasticity research, Michael Merzenich, later added his own comment to the discussion, stating that he had given a talk at Google in 2008 in which he had asked the audience the same question that Carr asked in his essay. Merzenich believed that there was [...] "absolutely no question that our brains are engaged less directly and more shallowly in the synthesis of information, when we use research strategies that <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> 'efficiency', 'secondary (and out-of-context) referencing', and 'once over, lightly'". Another neuroscientist, Gary Small, director of UCLA's Memory & Aging Research Center, wrote a letter to the editor of The Atlantic in which he stated that he believed that [...] "brains are developing circuitry for online social networking and are adapting to a new multitasking technology culture".|$|E

We went through some ups and downs this season, but the playoffs <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> showing heart and playing together." [...] Of Nowitzki's performance, ESPN columnist Bill Simmons wrote, [...] "Dirk is playing at a higher level than any forward since [...] Bird."

Nowitzki only made 20 of his last 55 shots in the final three games as the Mavericks lost the Finals series, 4–2, to the Heat. The German was criticized by ESPN as [...] "clearly ... not as his best this series" [...] and remarked: [...] "That was a tough loss (in Game 3) and that really changed the whole momentum of the series. ...

500|$|Freedom Ring was a {{character}} depicted as gay from his debut by his creator Robert Kirkman. Joe Quesada touted him as Marvel Comics' leading gay hero, with stories dedicated to his adventures in Marvel Team-Up. Despite this, the character was killed one month later. His death and general treatment {{was met with}} some negative reactions, including accusations of homophobia, {{particularly with respect to}} the phallic imagery of the death, with the character being killed by being impaled with spikes. Kirkman commented on the controversy, stating [...] "Freedom Ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. So I wanted to do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. Then I decided to combine the two ideas. In hindsight, yeah, killing a gay character is no good when there are so few of them... but I really had only the best of intentions in mind." [...] Kirkman later stated, [...] "Frankly, with the SMALL amount of gay characters in comics in general, and how unfortunate the portrayals have been thus far, whether intentional or not—I completely understand the backlash on the death of Freedom Ring, regardless of my intentions. If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character. I just never took that stuff into consideration while I was writing." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{initially}} invited Feldmann to hear its demos, and {{he suggested}} that the band regroup at his studio {{the next day to}} make a fresh start. The next day, the group wrote three songs, including the lead single [...] "Bored to Death". As the band continued to write and record, the trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3–4 weeks. Half of these songs were chosen to be put on the finalized album, in addition to two joke songs. Barker fought for all 28 songs to be on the album, as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music. The trio, as well as Feldmann, regularly stayed in the studio for up to 18 hours a day. The band members would arrive at the studio with no plan for what to work on for the day. They would then write several songs in only a few hours, aiming to complete them {{by the end of the}} night. Feldmann asked the members to consider what Blink-182, as a group, <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about,</b> to inspire the songwriting. He would encourage the musicians to write with speed, which Hoppus admitted could be frustrating. [...] "John was like, 'Okay: We've got the song structure. Write lyrics. Go in there and sing it. Go in there and sing it.' Sometimes, I was like, 'I'm not ready to sing!' (and Feldmann would reply) 'No. Go write something great right now!'" [...] Barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with the Transplants, which had a similar speedy approach. [...] "I always feel like your first instinct is your best," [...] Barker remarked.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Cyrus {{became the}} subject of {{widespread}} media attention and public scrutiny following a controversial performance and duet with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards at Barclays Center in New York City. The performance began with Cyrus performing [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] in bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage and Cyrus stripped down to a skin-colored two-piece outfit. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch. An article published in The Hollywood Reporter described the performance as [...] "crass" [...] and [...] "reminiscent of a bad acid trip". The performance was described by XXL critic B. J. Steiner as a [...] "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment", while the BBC said Cyrus stole the show with a [...] "raunchy performance". The performance generated 306,100 tweets per minute on Twitter, breaking the record for the most tweeted-about event {{in the history of the}} social network; the previous record, held by the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show featuring Beyoncé, generated 268,000 tweets per minute. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone magazine recognized published a criticism of the presentation of Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards 2013, “It's Miley, Bitch: The Tongue That Licked the World”. The article praises the performance of the singer said: [...] " [...] Miley was the one star in the room who truly understood what the MTV Video Music Awards <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> — waggling your tongue, grabbing your crotch, rocking a foam finger, going to third with the Care Bears, twerking and shrieking and acting out America's goriest pop-psycho nightmares. She showed up Robin Thicke as one uptight douche, though he helped by dressing as the world's edgiest Foot Locker manager. Miley stole the night, which is why the nation is still in recovery today. Thanks, Miley."
