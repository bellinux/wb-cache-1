5|$|Isaac Newton {{described}} comets as compact <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> solid bodies {{moving in}} oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, ignited or heated by the Sun. Newton suspected that comets were {{the origin of}} the life-supporting component of air.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth <b>and</b> <b>durable.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> elytra {{that have}} been used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus's {{success in}} high school led to a {{scholarship}} to the University of Notre Dame, where he played from 1940 to 1942. He was known in college as a tough <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> tackle. In a 1941 game against Georgia Tech, Rymkus was elbowed in his upper lip. He left the game to get 14 stitches and returned {{to play in the}} 20–0 Notre Dame victory. Notre Dame went undefeated that season, coach Frank Leahy's first year at the school. During his junior year in 1942, Rymkus earned All-America honors, and in his final season at Notre Dame he was named the team's Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible <b>and</b> <b>durable,</b> yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E

5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them {{to the site of the}} monument to be erected.|$|E
5|$|Using {{actinides}} {{in nuclear}} fuel, sealed radioactive sources or advanced {{materials such as}} self-glowing crystals has many potential benefits. However, a serious concern is the extremely high radiotoxicity of actinides and their migration in the environment. Use of chemically unstable forms of actinides in MOX and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards. There {{is a challenge to}} develop stable <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> actinide-bearing materials, which provide safe storage, use and final disposal. A key need is application of actinide solid solutions in durable crystalline host phases.|$|E
5|$|Wills held no {{positions}} of power at the South Melbourne Cricket Club and only occasionally appeared in local team lists. He nonetheless convinced the club to open its ground to football in winter by arguing {{that it would make}} the turf firm <b>and</b> <b>durable.</b> Other clubs soon followed South Melbourne's example and football adapted to an oval-shaped field. By now, the sport had spread throughout Australasia with Melbourne matches attracting the world's largest football crowds yet seen.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the {{porcupine}} ray consists {{mainly of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes, which it digs {{up from the}} sea floor. It is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The porcupine ray has long been valued for its rough <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> skin, which {{was made into a}} shagreen leather once used for various utilitarian and ornamental purposes, such as to cover sword hilts and shields. It is caught incidentally by coastal fisheries. Because it must be handled carefully due to its thorns, its commercial significance is limited. Unregulated fishing has led to this species declining in many parts of its range, and thus has been listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|Race {{director}} Torriani {{was happy}} with the success the 1985 Giro d'Italia had when passing through the Aosta Valley and chose to include this mountainous region, which lies adjacent to the Rhône-Alpes, in the 1987 route. With the Giro's return to the valley, La Stampa and the regional cycling federation director, Maggiorino Ferrero, speculated that the stages taking place in this region would be critical in deciding the general classification. Carlo Champvillair, a climbing champion of Aosta Valley, believed {{it to be a}} well-constructed, technical race route. The time trial in San Marino, the sixth stage with the finish atop Monte Terminillo, and the stages including the Dolomites were seen by L'Unità writer Gino Sala as stages that would heavily influence the general classification. In addition, he said that the route was suited to well-rounded, strong, <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> riders. The prologue contained a descent of the Poggio, a mountain used frequently in the Milan–San Remo, and was considered dangerous by some critics. However, Torriani decided to include the descent.|$|E
