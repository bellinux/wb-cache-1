5|$|Through the {{development}} of Pentangle, Jansch played a number of instruments: banjo, Appalachian dulcimer, recorder and concertina—on rare occasions he has even been known to play electric guitar. However, it is his <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar</b> playing that was most notable.|$|E
5|$|Harrison overdubbed call-and-response guitar riffs by Alvin Lee and Ron Wood {{onto the}} 1973 rhythm track, {{as well as}} his own slide guitars. Further overdubs {{included}} baritone and tenor saxophone parts by Tom Scott, and a second <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar,</b> played by Mick Jones.

5|$|Nelson {{featured}} {{arrangements of}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar,</b> accompanied by piano, played by his sister, Bobbie, as well complementary arrangements of drums, harmonica and mandolin. The sparsely instrumented acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors {{to doubt the}} wisdom of releasing the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced {{and no more than}} a demo. However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications.|$|E
5|$|The Paperboys were {{originally}} formed in 1991 by bassist Christopher Jonat and Tom Landa on <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar</b> and vocals, with Jeremy Hughes on accordion and vocals, Kevin Ball on fiddle, and Dave Plenkovich on drums. This {{early version of}} the band was very popular with the Vancouver college crowds, but after creative discrepancies Landa kept the Paperboys name {{and all the other}} remaining bandmembers reformed as The Clumsy Lovers.|$|E
5|$|The album embraces {{a form of}} {{symbolism}} {{that would}} eventually become a staple of Morrison's songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or as close as a living being can approach it. Morrison and Davis's upright bass {{can be interpreted as}} the earth opposing Kay's percussion and the string arrangement representing heaven and with Berliner's lead <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar</b> residing on a plane in between.|$|E

5|$|The {{songs on}} Obscured by Clouds are all short and economical, in {{contrast}} to the lengthy instrumentals found on other Floyd albums. A strong country music influence was present on several tracks, with prominent use of <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar.</b> The album also featured the VCS 3 synthesizer, which Wright had purchased from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.|$|E
5|$|While Smith {{tends to}} write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a {{collaborative}} effort. The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar</b> where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'. Smith {{has said that he}} purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so people can draw their own conclusions.|$|E
5|$|A demo of the song, only {{featuring}} the vocals and an <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar,</b> was exclusively released as bonus track on the Target {{edition of the}} album, on December 11, 2012. Almost a year later, on November 5, 2013, the demo of the song was also included on the deluxe edition of the album, released worldwide. The song was re-registered in ASCAP with new writing credits, which included Mac Davis. Davis won a BMI Pop Award in 2015 due to his writing credits on this song.|$|E

5|$|According to Gočeva, {{the album}} {{features}} elements of ethno jazz {{in addition to}} the prominent elements of Macedonian folklore music. Critics also noted elements of pop and jazz in the songs and added that they represent an internationalization of the sound of traditional Macedonian music. The lyrics cover various topics which express states of happiness, sadness, love and longing of a mellow female protagonist. Instrumentally, the songs on Makedonsko Devojče 2 contain the following instruments: clarinet, bass guitar, horn, <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar,</b> violin, qanun, saxophone and percussion.|$|E
5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar</b> parts to Harrison alone, Spizer {{suggests}} that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé {{credited}} {{both her}} husband, rapper Jay-Z, and jazz singer Etta James for inspiring her {{to push the}} limits of her songwriting and artistry. Musically, I Am... drew inspiration from folk and alternative rock, while blending <b>acoustic</b> <b>guitar</b> elements into contemporary ballads. The tracks on the first disc were written and produced by Beyoncé, during collaborative efforts with Babyface, Tricky Stewart, The-Dream and Ryan Tedder. Sasha Fierce boasted production from Darkchild and Sean Garrett.|$|E
