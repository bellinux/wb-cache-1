25|$|The photo-isomerization of {{azobenzene}} {{is extremely}} rapid, occurring on picosecond timescales. The {{rate of the}} thermal back-relaxation varies greatly depending on the compound: usually hours for azobenzene-type molecules, minutes for <b>aminoazobenzenes,</b> and seconds for the pseudo-stilbenes.|$|R
25|$|The {{wavelengths}} {{at which}} azobenzene isomerization occurs {{depends on the}} particular structure of each azo molecule, but they are typically grouped into three classes: the azobenzene-type molecules, the <b>aminoazobenzenes,</b> and the pseudo-stilbenes. These azos are yellow, orange, and red, respectively, owing to the subtle differences in their electronic absorption spectra. The compounds similar to the unsubstituted azobenzene exhibit a low-intensity n-π* absorption in the visible region, and a much higher intensity π-π* absorption in the ultraviolet. Azos that are ortho- or para-substituted with electron-donating groups (such as aminos), are classified as <b>aminoazobenzenes,</b> and tend to closely spaced n-π* and π-π* bands in the visible. The pseudo-stilbene class is characterized by substituting the 4 and 4' positions of the two azo rings with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (that is, the two {{opposite ends of the}} aromatic system are functionalized). The addition of this push-pull configuration results in a strongly asymmetric electron distribution, which modifies a host of optical properties. In particular, it shifts the absorption spectra of the trans and the cis isomers, so that they effectively overlap. Thus, for these compounds a single wavelength of light in the visible region will induce both the forward and reverse isomerization. Under illumination, these molecules cycle between the two isomeric states.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the one- and two-photon {{absorption}} spectra of seven azoaromatic compounds (five pseudostilbenes-type and two <b>aminoazobenzenes)</b> were theoretically investigated using the density functional theory {{combined with the}} response functions formalism. The equilibrium molecular structure of each compound was obtained at three different levels of theory: Hartree-Fock, density functional theory (DFT), and Moller-Plesset 2. The effect of solvent on the equilibrium structure and the electronic transitions of the compounds were investigated using the polarizable continuum model. For the one-photon absorption, the allowed pi ->pi(*) transition energy showed {{to be dependent on}} the molecular structures and the effect of solvent, while the n ->pi(*) and pi ->pi(*) (n) transition energies exhibited only a slight dependence. An inversion between the bands corresponding to the pi ->pi(*) and n ->pi(*) states due to the effect of solvent was observed for the pseudostilbene-type compounds. To characterize the allowed two-photon absorption transitions for azoaromatic compounds, the response functions formalism combined with DFT using the hybrid B 3 LYP and PBE 0 functionals and the long-range corrected CAM-B 3 LYP functional was employed. The theoretical results support the previous findings based on the three-state model. The model takes into account the ground and two electronic excited states and has already been used to describe and interpret the two-photon absorption spectrum of azoaromatic compounds. The highest energy two-photon allowed transition for the pseudostilbene-type compounds shows to be more effectively affected (similar to 20 %) by the torsion of the molecular structure than the lowest allowed transition (similar to 10 %). In order to elucidate the effect of the solvent on the two-photon {{absorption spectra}}, the lowest allowed two-photon transition (dipolar transition) for each compound was analyzed using a two-state approximation and the polarizable continuum model. The results obtained reveal that the effect of solvent increases drastically the two-photon cross-section of the dipolar transition of the pseudostilbene-type compounds. In general, the features of both one- and two-photon absorption spectra of the azoaromatic compounds are well reproduced by the theoretical calculations.

40|$|<b>Aminoazobenzene</b> photoreorientation is {{investigated}} in systems in which hydrophobically substituted chromophores are organized in molecular (Langmuir-Blodgett) films on glass substrates. Whereas the cis absorption of the chromophores in CHCl 3 after irradiation into their pifpi * absorption band is easily measured, {{we were not}} able to detect spectral changes characteristic of isomerization in the solid films during irradiation. The quantum efficiency for transfcis isomerization in LB films is reduced at least by a factor of ∼ 10 - 4 from that in organic solvent. We conclude that aggregation of the chromophores in LB films limits conformational changes after photoexcitation, in distinction from the situation when <b>aminoazobenzene</b> derivatives are embedded in thin polymer or liquid-crystal films. Hence, the subsequent reorientation is probably driven by a mechanism that does not encompass the cis isomer. The temperature dependence of the reorientation indicates thermal activation with an activation energy ∆E) 0. 24 eV. The irradiation intensity dependence shows that the reorientation is a collective process. It is distinctly different from what would be expected if photoexcitation resulted in reorientation of individual dye molecules and is simulated in a simple model from which the intensity threshold, Ith) 0. 95 (0. 2 mW/cm 2, is retrieved. From the experimental observations we postulate that the vibronic coupling of excited states may open a radiationless deactivation channel in which the electronic excitation energy is thermalized and distributed across neighboring molecules of the excited chromophore. The excited chromophore may hence rotate by an infinitesimal amount within the steric potential of its neighbors. This process ceases only when the chromophores are rotated to an orientation in which they are no longer excited by the irradiating light beam...|$|E

In view of the practical difficulties in-volved in experimentation on human anemic individuals, especially when large amounts of blood are required, it appears desirable to have, for purposes of experimentation, as great a variety of anemic conditions as possible.

40|$|This acid is a {{component}} of Fast Yellow G and, {{because it is not}} solid, is not used generally as dyestuff. But it is important as an infermediate product of fast disazodyes, such as Crocein Scarlet etc. Finding it necessary to obtain a pure p-aminoazobenzensulphonic acid as component of the Chlorantine Fast Dyes (Red 5 BL, 7 BL and Bordeux BLL,), the auther made the following study on the preparation of the acid. The preparation of this pure acid with a good yield offers some difucuties. By sulphonating <b>aminoazobenzene</b> a product may be obtained, which consists mostly of the same monosulphoryic acid, but contains also some of disulphonic acid and possibly isomeric monosulphoryic acid. This product does not give the resired shade and properties, which are obtainable by pure p-sulbphonic acid. The method of coupling diazotised sulphanilic acid with aniline gives a poor yield. If, however, some easily hydrolysed derivatives of aniline, such as acylaniline, methylaniline-w-sulphonic acid etc., are used, coupling may be successful in certain cases. In the present work, according to the method used in G. P. 217935, aniline is acylated with p-toluenesul-phochloride. The preparation then proceeds as fallows, 93 parts of aniline are suspended in 1100 parts of water and 45 parts of caustic soda, acylated with 190 parts of p-toluenesulphochloride under rapid stirring. p-Toluenesulphochloride thus obtained is then dissolved in 1800 parts of water and 180 parts of caustic soda solution (40 %). 210 parts of sulphanilic acid are diazotized as usual and added to the above cooled solution of p-toluenesulphochloride. p-Toluenesulphoaminoazobenzenesulphonic acid is separated, and when coupling is finished, it is acidfied, filtered off and washed.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} for the metabolic activatiou of N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene is unknown. Although cytochrome P- 450 dependent mixed function oxygenases are important in the activation of arylamines, there are target tissues for arylamines which do not contain these oxygenases. These tissues do contain peroxidases. Therefore a one electron oxidation mechanism was investigated by studying a Horseradish Peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide catalyzed metabolism of aminoazobenzenes [i. e; N-methyl- 4 -aminoazobenzene (MAB), N,N-dimethyl- 4 -aminoazobenzene (DAB), <b>aminoazobenzene</b> (AB) ], and by following the binding of the activated products to exogenous DNA. In order to further explore the mechanism, the effect of biological and phenolic antioxidants on metabolism and binding of the activated products of [¹⁴C] MAB was studied. The oxidation products were analyzed by spectrophotometry, high pressure liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography. The major product obtained from both MAB and DAB at pH 7. 4 was a dimer of MAB, i. e; N-methyl,N(MAB) - 4 -aminoazobenzene. The product obtained at pH 5. 0 was 4 '-(MAB) -N-methyl- 4 -aminoazobenzene. It is suggested that DAB is first N-demethylaced, and then follows the same metabolic pathway as does MAB. Evidence suggests that AB is also oxidized to a dimer with N-N linkage at pH 7. 4 and C-N linkage at pH 5. 0. [...] The binding of the activated products to calf thymus DNA was observed spectrophotometrically. [¹⁴C] MAB {{was used to determine}} the quantitative binding by liquid scintillation counting.

The maximum binding of [¹⁴C] MAB to homo polyriboguanylic acid among the four homo polyribonucleotides suggests the preferential binding of the activated products occurs at the guanine residues in DNA.
