5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E

5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E

5|$|Ramayana narrates: Tara {{says that}} Sugriva is mindful that through Rama, Sugriva has gained the kingship, Ruma and herself. She defends Sugriva saying that even great sage Vishwamitra was tempted by pleasure, Sugriva—a mere forest {{dwelling}} monkey—is fatigued by his past hardships and is relaxing, but not partaking in carnal pleasures. Tara informs Sugriva that Vali {{told her that}} Ravana is a mighty king with several rakshasas in his service. She reminds Lakshmana that without an ally like Sugriva, Rama cannot defeat such a powerful foe. Tara informs him that Sugriva has summoned all monkey commanders and troops to the capital. Adhyatma Ramayana also presents a similar description, where Tara, Angada and Hanuman are sent by Sugriva to calm Lakshmana. In a condensed one-verse description, Ramacharitamanasa says that Tara and Hanuman were dispatched by Sugriva and were successful in appeasing Lakshmana by singing Rama's praises. In Ramavataram, though not Sugriva's consort, Tara pacifies Lakshamana. The usual epithet of Tara, lustrous <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon,</b> in Ramavataram signifies her white clothes, {{the sign of a}} widow. Lakshmana is reminded of his own widowed mother seeing Tara.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E
5|$|While on {{the trail}} of the vampire known <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Moon,</b> they then run into trouble when the shape-shifting vampire Hierophant tracks them and finds them. The group {{attempts}} to fight him, but he proves to be too powerful. When notified by Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) that the Hierophant cannot enter houses without permission, Jake shapeshifts into a house and the group takes shelter inside. The Hierophant then tells Marceline that he didn't come to fight, but to propose an alliance to take down the Vampire King together. Marceline agrees only on the condition that the Hierophant no longer drinks blood, but he attacks her instead. During the struggle, he is accidentally knocked into Jake and dies due to entering a house uninvited. Marceline reabsorbs his shapeshifting powers but then falls ill, having been stung and poisoned by the Hierophant's stinger. Princess Bubblegum takes Marceline to the Candy Kingdom {{to try to find a}} cure for the Hierophant's poison. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake track down the Moon in hopes of using her healing power to heal Marceline. Upon finding the Moon, they find that due to her healing powers, they can't kill her with their stakes. When the sun sets, the Moon wakes up and Finn and Jake flee, luring the Moon to the Candy Kingdom. However, when they try to fight back, the Moon uses her powers to incapacitate Finn and Jake as she attempts to kill Marceline. Fortunately, Peppermint Butler stabs the Moon in the back, her only weak spot. Marceline reabsorbs the Moon's healing power and fully recovers from the poison.|$|E

25|$|An {{anomalistic month}} {{is longer than}} a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same {{direction}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in nine years.
