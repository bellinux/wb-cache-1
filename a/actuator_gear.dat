40|$|In {{aerospace}} positioning <b>actuators,</b> <b>gear</b> efficiencies of 85 % {{as well as}} breakout {{forces as}} high as 50 % of the stall load of the actuator are observed at very low temperature conditions. Due to the low efficiency and high loading, stiction in these actuators is common {{which can lead to}} limit cycles or problems with controlling the actuators. To be able to correctly predict and assess these effects using simulations, a complete actuator, including motor, inverter, load and controller is needed. This article presents an object based, numerically efficient gear contact in a planar environment with user-defined friction- and stiffness laws. The emphasis of the modeling is not a fully detailed contact model, but the description of a gear contact model which can be used for system simulations like complete aircraft electro-mechanical actuators including control surfaces. The presented model is suitable for complex gearing configurations (e. g. compound planetary gears). This is enabled by breaking down the transmission into the basic gear contacts. By adding masses and constraints from an existing component library, a complete transmission can be modeled. The generated model can be used for standalone simulations or can be used in multi-domain simulations like actuator modeling, in order to analyze the complete actuator model including parts such as drives, controllers and mechanical systems. The presented models have been validated using a gear test rig for a single stage spur gear...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Space Shuttle fleet was {{originally}} intended {{to have a life}} of 100 flights for each vehicle, lasting over a 10 -year period, with minimal scheduled maintenance or inspection. The first space shuttle flight was that of the Space Shuttle Columbia (OV- 102), launched April 12, 1981. The disaster that destroyed Columbia occurred on its 28 th flight, February 1, 2003, nearly 22 years after its first launch. In order to minimize risk of losing another Space Shuttle, a probabilistic life and reliability analysis was conducted for the Space Shuttle rudder/speed brake actuators to determine the number of flights the actuators could sustain. A life and reliability assessment of the <b>actuator</b> <b>gears</b> was performed in two stages: a contact stress fatigue model and a gear tooth bending fatigue model. For the contact stress analysis, the Lundberg-Palmgren bearing life theory was expanded to include gear-surface pitting for the actuator as a system. The mission spectrum of the Space Shuttle rudder/speed brake actuator was combined into equivalent effective hinge moment loads including an actuator input preload for the contact stress fatigue and tooth bending fatigue models. Gear system reliabilities are reported for both models and their combination. Reliability of the actuator bearings was analyzed separately, based on data provided by the actuator manufacturer. As a result of the analysis, the reliability of one half of a single actuator was calculated to be 98. 6 percent for 12 flights. Accordingly, each actuator was subsequently limited to 12 flights before removal from service in the Space Shuttle...|$|R
