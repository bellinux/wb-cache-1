5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Within the uterus the embryos lie lengthwise with their heads pointing {{the same direction as}} their mother. Most information known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> shark's life history comes from the subpopulation off northeastern Brazil, and may not hold true {{in other parts of the}} species range. Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer, with the males biting at the female's body and fins as a prelude to copulation.|$|E

The review also found that [...] "there's no denying that his harsh communiqués crackle with a mean-streets vitality as fascinating as his confrontational world view is disturbing." [...] Robert Christgau gave the Jive reissue of the album a B, stating [...] "What other rapper would write a rhyme <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> his mother pulled a gun on him—or make it so clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove." [...] Spin stated that it [...] "can't sustain an album with just reverb and a cowbell. Even if it is killer reverb and a way funky cowbell."

500|$|Rumours <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> of the Long Knives rapidly spread. Although many Germans {{approached}} the official {{news of the}} events as described by Joseph Goebbels {{with a great deal}} of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos. Luise Solmitz, a Hamburg schoolteacher, echoed the sentiments of many Germans when she cited Hitler's [...] "personal courage, decisiveness and effectiveness" [...] in her private diary. She even compared him to Frederick the Great, the 18th-century King of Prussia. Others were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow Germans. [...] "A very calm and easy going mailman," [...] the diarist Victor Klemperer wrote, [...] "who is not at all National Socialist, said, 'Well, he simply sentenced them.'" [...] It did not escape Klemperer's notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power. [...] "A chancellor", he wrote, [...] "sentences and shoots members of his own private army!" [...] The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo, however, meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it. Among the few exceptions were General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord and Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler. Hammerstein, who was a close friend of Schleicher, had been much offended at Schleicher's funeral when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated the wreaths that the mourners had brought. Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow, Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on July 18 setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped. The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible, and criticised Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow. Finally, Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganise the government by firing Baron Konstantin von Neurath, Robert Ley, Hermann Göring, Werner von Blomberg, Joseph Goebbels and Richard Walther Darré from the Cabinet. Instead, the memo asked that Hindenburg create a directorate to rule Germany comprising the Chancellor (who was not named), General Werner von Fritsch as Vice-Chancellor, Hammerstein as Minister of Defense, the Minister for National Economy (also unnamed) and Rudolf Nadolny as Foreign Minister. The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny, the former Ambassador to Moscow who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler's anti-Soviet foreign policy, indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the [...] "distant friendliness" [...] towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933.

2500|$|The {{early modern}} period also saw fear of Satanists reach its [...] "historical apogee" [...] {{in the form}} of the witch trials of the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries. This came about as the accusations which had been {{levelled}} at medieval heretics, among them that of devil-worship, were applied to the pre-existing idea of the witch, or practitioner of malevolent magic. The idea of a conspiracy of Satanic witches was developed by educated elites, although the concept of malevolent witchcraft was a widespread part of popular belief and folkloric ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> witch, the wild hunt, and the dance of the fairies were incorporated into it. The earliest trials took place in Northern Italy and France, before spreading it out to other areas of Europe and to Britain's North American colonies, being carried out by the legal authorities in both Catholic and Protestant regions.|$|E
2500|$|Farrands {{expanded}} the [...] "Curse of Thorn" [...] plot line, in which Jamie Lloyd is kidnapped by a covert cult who has cursed Michael Myers via the Runic symbol of Thorn, which compels him {{to kill and}} also affords him immortality. Farrands had in part based the idea on dialogue present in Halloween II (1981) <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of Samhain, during which the [...] "veil between {{the living and the}} dead is thinnest," [...] the one time of the year during which Myers became [...] "active, and seeks out his bloodline." [...] References to Druidism as well as Myers's grandfather [...] "hearing voices" [...] had also appeared in the 1978 novelization of Halloween by Curtis Richards. While the character of Jamie Lloyd dies early in the film, the initial versions of Farrands' script had her character surviving until the final act, at which point she was ultimately killed by Michael. Other elements of Farrands' working script that ultimately had to be trimmed down included an extension of the Curse of Thorn subplot, which had the entire town of Haddonfield in collusion with the cult, an idea Akkad wanted to use for the series' seventh installment.
