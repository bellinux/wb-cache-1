5|$|Parties in {{opposition}} to Alcalá-Zamora's government gained {{the support of the}} church and the military. The head of the church in Spain, Cardinal Pedro Segura, was particularly vocal in his disapproval. Until the 20th century, the Catholic Church had proved an essential part of Spain's character, although it had internal problems. Segura was expelled from Spain in June 1931. This prompted an outcry from the Catholic right, who cited oppression. A series of church-burning incidents occurred in major Spanish cities throughout May 1931. When the government refused to call out the Guardia Civil, Minister for War Manuel Azaña came under heavy criticism from the rightist press. The military were opposed to reorganisation, including an increase in regional autonomy granted by the central government, and reforms to improve efficiency were seen as a direct attack. Officers were retired <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> had their promotions reviewed, including Francisco Franco, who served as director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza, which was closed by Manuel Azaña.|$|E

25|$|Overall command {{for defense}} of the District was given to Major General Christopher C. Augur as {{commander}} of the XXII Corps. Major Generals Quincy Gillmore and Alexander McCook commanded the Northeast sector and the reserve post at Blagden farm, respectively.

With promised reinforcements from Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, Russell would have more than 8,600 men, including a cavalry force of 850 men, all of them well armed and well trained. Russell had estimated the combined rebel forces from Cornwall and Devon at only 7,000 men. On 28 July Arundell decided to block their approach to Exeter at Fenny Bridges.

25|$|Psychological {{dependency}} {{is addressed}} in many drug rehabilitation programs {{by attempting to}} teach the patient new methods of interacting in a drug-free environment. In particular, patients are generally encouraged, or possibly even required, to not associate with friends who still use the addictive substance. Twelve-step programs encourage addicts not only to stop using alcohol or other drugs, but to examine and change habits related to their addictions. Many programs emphasize that recovery is a permanent process without culmination. For legal drugs such as alcohol, complete abstention—rather than attempts at moderation, which may lead to relapse—is also emphasized ("One is too many, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> is never enough.") Whether moderation is achievable by those {{with a history of}} abuse remains a controversial point, but is generally considered unsustainable.|$|E

The men of the Count of Lous counterattacked. They did not wait for the other Christians, and the Count and his men died under a cloud of arrows when they came too close to the wall. After the king had seen the damage that could be done, {{in the next few days}} he had a trench dug around the Villa Vieja from the Río de la Miel to the sea to prevent attacks {{from the city}}. Shelters were built next to the trenches and soldiers were posted at regular intervals to stand guard at night. The king moved his headquarters closer to the city and sent several of his men conquer the Cartagena Tower in the city of Carteia, from where they could observe the movements of the Merinids of Gibraltar.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} common themes in The Kite Runner <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>Thousand</b> Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini replied:"Both novels are multigenerational, {{and so the}} {{relationship}} between parent and child, {{with all of its}} manifest complexities and contradictions, is a prominent theme. I did not intend this, but I am keenly interested, it appears, in the way parents and children love, disappoint, and in the end honor each other.
