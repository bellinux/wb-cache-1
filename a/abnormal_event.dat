TS also detects, and corrects for, overflows {{in such a}} way as to propagate a carry for multi-precision add/subtract. If the result has no overflow (leftmost 2 bits of A the same), nothing special happens; if there is overflow (those 2 bits differ), the leftmost one goes the memory as the sign bit, register A is changed to +1 or −1 accordingly, and control skips to the second instruction following the TS. Whenever overflow is a possible but <b>abnormal</b> <b>event,</b> the TS was followed by a TC to the no-overflow logic; when it is a normal possibility (as in multi-precision add/subtract), the TS is followed by CAF ZERO (CAF = XCH to fixed memory) to complete the formation of the carry (+1, 0, or −1) into the next higher-precision word.

These consequences have inspired the development of techniques in this thesis to improve the inherent safety and perform dynamic risk assessment, as vital ingredients in the planning, design, and operation of chemical plants. ^ Initially, multi-objective process designs using Game theory are developed to increase their inherent safety, thereby resulting in lower frequencies of <b>abnormal</b> <b>events.</b> Extended bifurcation diagrams are introduced to provide an improved understanding of processes having instability and non-minimum-phaseness. Applications of the proposed method to an isothermal, continuous, stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), an exothermic CSTR, and an anaerobic fermentor, are presented. ^ In spite of inherently safer designs, the occurrence of <b>abnormal</b> <b>events</b> is inevitable {{in chemical}} operations. Consequently, methods are developed for plant-specific, dynamic, risk assessment using Bayesian analysis with copulas that analyze <b>abnormal</b> <b>events.</b> More specifically, three analyzers are developed: (i) a forecasting analyzer that predicts the frequencies of occurrence of <b>abnormal</b> <b>events,</b> (ii) a reliability analyzer that predicts the failure probabilities of safety systems involving equipments and human actions, and (iii) an accident closeness analyzer that predicts the proximity of a current plant state to a failure or disaster, {{through the use of}} accident precursor data. In addition, the propagations of <b>abnormal</b> <b>events</b> through the safety systems are modeled in real-time for a continuous ethyl-benzene process. ^ Furthermore, the role of consequences, with their frequencies, in risk estimation {{led to the development of}} a fast-Fourier transform-based method to estimate the capital-at-risk within an industry utilizing frequency and loss-severity distributions. The model has been tested using data in the National Response Center database for companies in Harris County, Texas. ^ Finally, the importance of human behavior on plant safety is examined. A framework to estimate the impacts of management and engineering decisions, operator performance, and equipment operations, on the failure state is introduced. Also, a game-theoretic model is developed to balance the advantages and disadvantages of having a Near-miss Management System with different sophistication levels. ...|$|R

However, the faults of nodes and the poor deployment environment have brought great challenges to <b>abnormal</b> <b>event</b> detection. In a typical event detection technique, spatiotemporal correlations are collected to detect an event, which is susceptible to noises and errors. To improve the quality of detection results, we propose a novel approach for <b>abnormal</b> <b>event</b> detection in wireless sensor networks. This approach considers not only spatiotemporal correlations but also the correlations among observed attributes. A dependency model of observed attributes is constructed based on Bayesian network. In this model, the dependency structure of observed attributes is obtained by structure learning, and the conditional probability table of each node is calculated by parameter learning. We propose a new concept named attribute correlation confidence to evaluate the fitting degree between the sensor reading and the <b>abnormal</b> <b>event</b> pattern. On the basis of time correlation detection and space correlation detection, the abnormal events are identified. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the impact of interference factors and the rate of the false alarm effectively; it can also improve the accuracy of event detection...|$|E
