25|$|In {{the event}} of an {{appearance}} of sudden flashes of light or floaters, <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>doctor</b> needs to be consulted immediately. A shower of floaters or any loss of vision, too, is a medical emergency.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses are {{prescribed}} by ophthalmologists, optometrists, or specially licensed opticians {{under the supervision}} of <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>doctor.</b> Contact lenses can typically be ordered at the office that conducts the eye exam and fitting. The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act gives consumers the right to obtain a copy of their contact lens prescription, allowing them to fill it at the lens provider of their choice.|$|E
25|$|When {{the lens}} first {{contacts}} the eye, {{it should be}} comfortable. A brief period of irritation may occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear. This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, {{taking a break from}} lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>doctor</b> to rule out potentially serious complications.|$|E

50|$|In {{all cases}} of {{congenital}} fourth nerve palsy, {{it is important}} to see an experienced strabismologist about management/treatment options. A strabismologist is <b>an</b> ophthalmologist (<b>eye</b> <b>doctor)</b> specialising in <b>eye</b> movement disorders.|$|R

25|$|One {{treatment}} {{strategy is}} light therapy (phototherapy), {{with either a}} full-spectrum lamp providing 10,000 lux at a specified distance from the eyes or a wearable LED device providing 350–550 lux at a shorter distance. Sunlight can also be used. The light is typically timed for 30–90 minutes at the patient's usual time of spontaneous awakening, or shortly before (but not long before), which is {{in accordance with the}} phase response curve (PRC) for light. Only experimentation, preferably with specialist help, will show how great an advance is possible and comfortable. For maintenance, some patients must continue the treatment indefinitely; some may reduce the daily treatment to 15 minutes; others may use the lamp, for example, just a few days a week or just every third week. Whether the treatment is successful is highly individual. Light therapy generally requires adding some extra time to the patient's morning routine. Patients with a family history of macular degeneration are advised to consult with <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>doctor.</b> The use of exogenous melatonin administration (see below) in conjunction with light therapy is common.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, corneal transplants (also {{known as}} corneal grafts) for {{keratoconus}} are usually performed under sedation as outpatient surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, {{the operation is}} commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>doctor</b> (ophthalmologist or optometrist) {{for a number of}} years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and rejection of the donor cornea. Vision loss is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful. Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue. The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.|$|E

5000|$|With {{individuals}} {{who are unable to}} read letters for various reasons, including being too young to know the alphabet or having <b>a</b> handicap, <b>eye</b> <b>doctors</b> may use what is called the tumbling E chart.

The scale of the tumbling E chart is the same as with the standard Snellen chart.

Whenever acuity must be assessed carefully (as in <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>doctor's</b> examination), or where {{there is a possibility that}} the examinee might attempt to deceive the examiner (as in a motor vehicle license office), equipment is used that can present the letters in a variety of randomized patterns.BS 4274-1:1968(British Standards Institution) [...] "Specification for test charts for determining distance visual acuity" [...] was replaced by BS 4274-1:2003 [...] "Test charts for clinical determination of distance visual acuity — Specification".

A self-administered structured questionnaire was used to examine their knowledge of visual sensations and their associated anxiety/fear experienced by patients during cataract surgery. Simple frequencies and proportions were calculated to describe the data. Results A total of 150 ophthalmologists, residents and medical officers were invited to participate in the study. Of these, 68 (45. 3 %) responded. The mean age (±SD) of the participants was 42. 9 (13. 2) years. The proportion of participants who thought that patients could experience visual sensations during cataract surgery under regional anaesthesia was 89. 7 % and that under topical anaesthesia was 73. 5 %. The most frequently cited sensations included: light perception, changes in light brightness, movements, instruments and surgeon’s hands or fingers. The <b>eye</b> <b>doctors</b> estimated that 38. 9 % and 64. 3 % patients would see at least something during cataract surgery under regional anaesthesia and topical anaesthesia, respectively. They also believed that 24. 2 %- 36. 9 % of patients may experience anxiety/fear as a result of visual sensations during such surgery. Approximately half of the <b>eye</b> <b>doctors</b> did not think that retained vision was a source of fear or anxiety for the patients. While most of them acknowledged the importance of preoperative counselling in helping to alleviate such fear/anxiety, the majority of them did not regularly counsel their patients on what to expect during the surgery. Conclusion Our study reveals that a significant proportion of <b>eye</b> <b>doctors</b> do not have adequate knowledge of the visual phenomenon and their associated anxiety or fear, that patients can experience during cataract surgery. Targeted educational interventions are needed to increase awareness of this phenomenon among eye care professionals. </p...|$|R
