25|$|Prior to 1969, Australia did {{not have}} a {{national}} number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services possessed many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the Postmaster General (PMG) introduced the Triple Zero (000) number in major population centres and {{near the end of the}} 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number Triple Zero (000) was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones, so it was easy to dial in darkness.|$|E

5000|$|On the <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> button, the [...] "off" [...] {{signal was}} {{changed from the}} Number [...] "0" [...] (Zero) to the word [...] "off".|$|E
5000|$|For the 2001 US {{model year}} (2000 {{calendar}} year), the VE was eliminated and the S model was introduced. The CE became the new base model offered in 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic transmission and the sporty S replaced the Touring Package. The 2001 model year {{also got a}} slight refresh with the new front headlights, redesigned front bumper, auxiliary DC power port with a higher armrest (LE 4 speed <b>automatic</b> models), inside <b>trunk</b> release for accidental lockouts in the trunk, new controls for the air conditioner that had the rear glass defrost button relocated with a button for the recirculation of air, and round reverse lights. The 'sportiness' of the S model built upon the CE models with a gauge cluster with tachometer in a red/black theme with an outside temperature gauge, a charcoal gray and black interior, standard front fog lamps, color matched side skirts, color matched rear mudflaps, a color matched front grill, a trunk release lever next to the gasoline cap door lever (but not on the remote fob), power mirrors, a trunk light, 14" [...] 'S' model wheel covers, and lighted map lights on the rear view mirror. The S model lacked the 60/40 folding rear seat, or tilt steering of the LE model. The 'S' model had no performance advantage over the other models: it was purely an appearance package. The 2002 model year was short and was only produced {{until the end of}} 2001 {{to make way for the}} redesigned model which launched in early 2002 for the 2003 model year.|$|R
50|$|Other test {{equipment}} includes a line insulation tester and an <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> tester, for items whose numerosity and simplicity lent themselves to automatic testing. An automated AMA translator tester checked for miswiring that could bill one line to another. A nonautomated outgoing trunk test panel allows voltmeter checks on trunks to distant offices, freeing the MTF from this tedious job. Each outgoing trunk {{is represented by}} two jacks: one for test access for the voltmeter {{and one for the}} make-busy operation. MTF was able to override Make Busy when necessary.|$|E
50|$|The Ranger's base trim {{appointments}} included arm rests, {{a cigarette}} lighter, rear-view mirror, two coat hangers and black rubber floor mats. On the exterior, Rangers received chrome around the {{rear quarter panel}} cove molding. Two-tone paint was also optional. The main visual cue {{that makes it possible}} {{to tell the difference between}} most Rangers and the upmarket Pacer was the lack of stainless trim on the front doors and fenders. A very rare, optional, Ranger-only door trim was available from dealers early in the model year to be used together with the Pacer fender trim. A basic heater (as a US$92 option) and radio (at US$95) were available, and air conditioning was optional as well (at $417), along with seat belts, warning lights, <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> opener, and rear door child safety lock covers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971, a new {{telephone}} exchange and trunk line building was erected {{to take place}} of the existing manual exchange and provide <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> line switching facilities to surrounding district exchanges. A building to house this was building erected on site adjoining the Post Office with access from Crescent Street and there are easements between the two sites. In 1994 the building was sold into private ownership and now operates as the Childers Heritage Shop although some post office services are also continued. In 1999 alterations were carried out to allow the operation of a coffee shop in a former bedroom by opening the verandah on the residence and creating a roof deck section between the verandah and eastern porch of the post office. Paving and landscaping were also carried out to a forecourt area.|$|E

50|$|The Super {{used the}} new General Motors C-body for 1957. Larger than the Series 40 Special and Series 60 Century B-body, the Riviera body styles had {{different}} roof treatments as well. Supers had {{a group of}} three Chevrons on each rear quarter or door for series identification, in addition to the normal wording within the grille and deck emblems. Four VentiPorts were used on each front fender. Closed models were upholstered in Nylon/Cordaveen combinations while the convertible had an all-Cordaveen interior and featured power windows and seat controls as part of its equipment. Standard Super equipment included foam rubber seat cushions, <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> lamp, Red Liner speedometer, glovebox lamp, dual horns, trip mileage indicator, directional signals, dual sunshades, color coordinated dash panel, and on the convertible, outside left-hand rearview mirror. The 4-door pillared sedan body style was gone. Engine displacement was increased to 364 cuin L on the Nailhead V8. Nevertheless, sales fell to 70,250, the lowest level {{with the exception of the}} abbreviated 1942 model year.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Citation, the Corsair was {{powered by}} the [...] 410 cuin L MEL V8 (with four-barrel {four choke} carburetor), and came {{equipped}} with Edsel’s Teletouch automatic as standard. (This was a US$231 option on Ranger and Pacer models.) Unlike other Ford models that used a column-mounted gear selector, Teletouch placed its drive-selection buttons in the steering wheel hub where drivers were accustomed to finding the horn button. In emergency situations, damage to the transmission that might occur if the driver hit the Teletouch unit instead of the steering wheel's horn ring was prevented by an electro-hydraulic switch activated by internal transmission fluid pressure. A basic heater (as a US$92 option) and radio (at US$95) were available, and air conditioning was optional as well (at US$460). Also optional was an <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> release, a tachometer, an automatic lube system, seat belts, a padded dash board, warning lights for low oil level and parking brake on, plus rear door safety locks to prevent young kids from opening them while the car is moving.|$|E
50|$|From {{the middle}} of the 1984 model year and {{throughout}} the 1985 model year, Ford had a performance version of the LTD called the LTD LX. It came standard with the high output 5.0L CFI V8 engine, four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, 600 lb-in front and 270 lb-in rear coil springs, front and rear sway bars, 10 inch front disc and 10 inch rear drum brakes, and a 3.27:1 rear gear ratio with a Traction-Lok differential. The LX model was the only LTD to have a tachometer in the instrument cluster. The center console and floor-mounted shifter re-appeared, having last been available in the full-size 1972 model year. Police Package editions were also produced along side the LX. Notable for its bigger sway bars and brakes, it also included bench seats with an <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> opener located underneath the steering wheel. They were a factory option and most were equipped with light bars and police accessories, although some came without. Mercury's sister car to the LX, the Marquis LTS, was available only in Canada and only in the 1985 model year, with only 134 produced that year.|$|E
5000|$|... 1957 was chiefly {{notable for}} the {{introduction}} of one of GM's most memorable designs, the Series 70 Eldorado Brougham. Announced in December 1956 and released around March 1957, the Eldorado Brougham was a hand-built, limited car derived from the Park Avenue and Orleans show cars of 1953-54. Designed by Ed Glowacke, it featured the first appearance of quad headlights and totally unique trim. The exterior ornamentation included wide, ribbed lower rear quarter beauty panels extending along the rocker sills and rectangularly sculptured side body [...] "cove" [...] highlighted with five horizontal windsplits on the rear doors. Tail styling treatments followed the Eldorado pattern. This four-door hardtop with rear-hinged rear doors was an ultra-luxury car that cost an astonishing $13,074—twice the price of any other 1957 Eldorado and more than the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud of the same year. It featured a stainless steel roof, self leveling air suspension, the first automatic two-position [...] "memory" [...] power seats, a dual four-barrel V-8, low-profile tires with thin white-walls, <b>automatic</b> <b>trunk</b> opener, cruise control, high-pressure cooling system, polarized sun visors, electric antenna, automatic-release parking brake, electric door locks, dual heating system, silver magnetized glovebox, drink tumblers, cigarette and tissue dispensers, lipstick and cologne, ladies' compact with powder puff, mirror and matching leather notebook, comb and mirror, Arpège atomizer with Lanvin perfume, automatic starter with restart function, Autronic Eye, drum-type electric clock, power windows, forged aluminum wheels and air conditioning. Buyers of Broughams had a choice of 44 full-leather interior and trim combinations and could select such items as Mouton, Karakul or lambskin carpeting.|$|E
5000|$|The highly {{expensive}} and exclusive 4-door Cadillac Eldorado Brougham hardtop marked {{the return of}} the Series 70, but for only two years, as from 1959-60 the Eldorado Brougham was denoted a Series 6900, and it was discontinued thereafter. Announced in December 1956 and released around March 1957, the Series 70 Eldorado Brougham was a hand built, limited car derived from the Park Avenue and Orleans show cars of 1953-54.

Buyers of Broughams had a choice of 44 full leather interior and trim combinations and could select such items as Mouton, Karakul or lambskin carpeting. The 1957 Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car, and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name. There were serious difficulties with the air suspension. Some owners found it cheaper to have the system removed and replaced with conventional coil springs. Only 400 Series 70 Eldorado Broughams were sold in 1957.|$|E
