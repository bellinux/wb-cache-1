40|$|Systems {{and methods}} for electrodepositing a nickel-cobalt alloy using a {{rotating}} cylinder electrode assembly with <b>a</b> <b>plating</b> surface and <b>an</b> electrical contact. The assembly is placed within <b>a</b> <b>plating</b> bath and rotated while running <b>a</b> <b>plating</b> cycle. Nickel-cobalt alloy deposition is selectively controlled by controlling current density distribution and/or cobalt {{content in the}} plating bath while running the plating cycle to deposit an alloy of a desired yield strength onto the <b>plating</b> surface in <b>a</b> single <b>plating</b> cycle. In various embodiments, the rotating cylinder {{may be used as}} an insitu monitoring method to assist in obtaining the properties desired...|$|R

The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding.

5|$|By 1500, the Arikara (or Ree) {{had settled}} {{in much of the}} Missouri River valley. European contact with the area began in 1743, when the LaVérendrye {{brothers}} explored the region. The LaVérendrye group buried <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> near the site of modern-day Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of greater Louisiana. in 1762 the entire region became part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802. By the early 19th century, the Sioux had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area.|$|E
5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is described {{to survive on}} the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad and <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of khichdi that is offered to the goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of}} the temple.|$|E

5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto <b>a</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jibneh Arabieh or jibneh baida is a {{white table}} cheese served {{with any of the}} above dishes. Ackawi cheese is a common {{variation}} of jibneh baida. Ackawi cheese has a smoother texture and a mild salty taste. Labaneh is a pasty yogurt-like cream cheese either served on <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> with olive oil and za'atar—which is generally called labaneh wa za'atar—or in a khubz sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E

5|$|The Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland (illustration) is {{an example}} of Palladian {{architecture}} in the United States. It is the only existing work of colonial academic architecture that was principally designed from <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> in Andrea Palladio’s Quattro Libri. The house was designed by the architect William Buckland in 1773–74 for wealthy farmer Matthias Hammond of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It was modeled on the design of the Villa Pisani in Montagnana, Italy in Book II, Chapter XIV of I Quattro Libri dell’Achitettura.|$|E

If <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears {{at the top of}} the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground.|$|E

5|$|When {{the grade}} of Knight Commander was {{established}} in 1815 the regulations specified that they too should have a banner and stall plate affixed in the chapel. This was never implemented (despite some of the KCBs paying the appropriate fees) primarily {{due to lack of}} space, although the 1847 statutes allow all three classes to request the erection of <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> in the chapel bearing the member's name, date of nomination, and (for the two higher classes) optionally the coat of arms.|$|E

Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>plate</b> of hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all {{birds in}} the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton {{noted that it}} confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
