5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit, showing that {{a man and a woman}} had travelled together, almost up to the pit, and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to many of those who gathered around the pit, as was the fact that she had gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at once. When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{my paper}} (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A 64 (1956), 223 – 238), I gave a general {{transfer}} principle in {{the geometry of}} numbers which consisted of inequalities linking the successive minima of <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> <b>in</b> n dimensions with those of <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> <b>in</b> N dimensions where in general N is greater than n. This result contained in particular my earlier theorem on compound convex bodies (Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 5 (1955), 358 – 379). In the present paper I apply essentially the same method to prove a new transfer principle which connects the successive minima of <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> <b>in</b> m dimensions and those of <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> <b>in</b> n dimensions with the successive minima of <b>a</b> convex <b>body</b> <b>in</b> mn dimensions...|$|R

5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E

Siti Bida Undara, at first upset at the thought of sharing her husband, soon becomes close friends with Siti Akbari. Shortly thereafter Bahar Oedin takes his revenge, capturing Abdul Moelan and Siti Bida Undara. When the sultan tries to capture Siti Akbari, he discovers <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> her room and believes it to be hers. He takes his captives back to Hindustan and imprisons them.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana, {{known in}} Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Rise of Mana, is a Japanese action {{role-playing}} video game developed by Square Enix and Goshow for iOS, Android and PlayStation Vita. It {{was published by}} Square Enix in 2014 for mobile devices and 2015 for the Vita. It is the eleventh game in the Mana series, featuring a new narrative unconnected to other games in the series. The gameplay uses a similar action-based battle system to earlier Mana titles while using a free-to-play model in common with mobile titles. The story focuses on two characters, an angel and a demon, who are cast down to the mortal world {{in the midst of}} a battle and are forced to share <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> order to survive.|$|E

5|$|Within {{months a}} call {{was made for}} an {{international}} women's conference {{to be held in}} The Hague. Coordinated by Mia Boissevain, Aletta Jacobs and Rosa Manus, the Congress, which opened on April 28, 1915 was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and belligerent nations, and resulted in the establishment of an organization which would become the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). At the close of the conference, two delegations of women were dispatched to meet with European heads of state over the next several months. They secured agreement from reluctant Foreign Ministers, who overall felt that such a body would be ineffective, but agreed to participate or not impede creation of a neutral mediating body, if other nations agreed and if President Woodrow Wilson would initiate <b>a</b> <b>body.</b> <b>In</b> the midst of the War, Wilson refused.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Wombosi {{continues}} to obsess over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, planted <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> the Paris morgue {{to appear as}} the assailant, but Wombosi is not fooled and threatens to report this and other CIA secrets to the media. The Professor assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about Wombosi's yacht, and that the assailant had been shot twice in the back during the escape; he realizes {{that he was the}} assailant. He and Marie take refuge at the French countryside home of her old friend Eamon (Tim Dutton) and his children. Under pressure from Abbott to tie off the Wombosi matter entirely, Conklin tracks Bourne's location and sends the Professor there, but Bourne shoots him twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him. The Professor reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie, Eamon, and Eamon's children away for their protection, and then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone to arrange a meeting. From a rooftop near the arranged location in Paris, Bourne sees Conklin has brought backup, so he abandons the meeting, but uses the opportunity to place a tracking device on Conklin's car, leading Bourne to Treadstone's safe house.|$|E

25|$|The seasons are {{quadrants}} of the Earth's orbit, {{marked by}} the two solstices and the two equinoxes. Kepler's second law states that <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> orbit traces equal areas over equal times; its orbital velocity is highest around perihelion and lowest around aphelion. The Earth spends less time near perihelion and more time near aphelion. This means that the lengths of the seasons vary.|$|E
25|$|Hence, {{with respect}} to an {{inertial}} frame, an object or body accelerates only when a physical force is applied, and (following Newton's first law of motion), {{in the absence of}} a net force, a body at rest will remain at rest and <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> motion will continue to move uniformlythat is, in a straight line and at constant speed. Newtonian inertial frames transform among each other according to the Galilean group of symmetries.|$|E
