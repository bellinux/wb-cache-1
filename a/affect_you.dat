I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that <b>affect</b> <b>you.</b> It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{spoke with}} Larry King on CNN, {{supporting}} the It Gets Better Project and The Trevor Project, {{a non-profit organization}} providing crisis and suicide prevention for LGBT youth, {{in light of the}} high profile suicides committed in Fall, 2010. She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding everything inside... internalizing everything. And that really can <b>affect</b> <b>you,</b> and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you." [...] She made an official It Gets Better video which was released on December 1, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Critics say {{the absurdity}} of Plan 9 from Outer Space {{is found in the}} {{dialogue}} rather than on-screen action. Criswell's opening narration redundantly informs the viewer that [...] "future events such as these will <b>affect</b> <b>you</b> in the future", while referring to viewers as [...] "my friends" [...] four times in the same minute. Criswell also begins the narration by referring to future events, only to later describe them in the past tense ("...the full story of what happened on that fateful day"), and inexplicably calling for [...] "the guilty" [...] to be punished.|$|E

2500|$|Lennon {{refused to}} be filmed in therapy by Arthur Janov, saying, [...] "Who are you kidding Mr. Janov?" [...] Lennon commented after therapy, [...] "I still think that Janov's therapy is great, you know, but I {{do not want to}} make it a big Maharishi thing" [...] and [...] "I just know myself better, that's all. I can handle myself better. That Janov thing, the primal scream and so on, it does <b>affect</b> <b>you,</b> because you {{recognize}} yourself in there...It was very good for me. I am still 'primal' and it still works." [...] and [...] "I no longer have any need for drugs, the Maharishi or the Beatles. I am myself and I know why." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} by Wood's friend, psychic Criswell: [...] "Greetings my friends! We are all {{interested in the}} future, For that is where you and I are {{going to spend the}} rest of our lives! ...". (This line appears in the narration for the General Motors' [...] "Futurama" [...] ride and its accompanying film, To New Horizons, that were part of the 1939 New York World's Fair—years before Criswell's own television program.) At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP-13) television series, Criswell Predicts. The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show, but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early televangelists. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as [...] "my friends", as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line is likely to derive from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction, [...] "Future events such as these will <b>affect</b> <b>you</b> in the future", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.|$|E
