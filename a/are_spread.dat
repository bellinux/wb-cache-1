5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> by blood-sucking insects.|$|E
5|$|Felt over {{an area of}} , the {{earthquake}} followed the Midcontinent seismic trend: unlike earthquakes on the Western Coast of the US, events in the central and east-central sectors of the country <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> out over extensive areas; for example, the 1968 Illinois earthquake also followed this trend.|$|E

5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} imagery, the {{asteroid}} belt is mostly empty. The asteroids <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> over such a large volume {{that it would be}} improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that {{the asteroid belt}} has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
30|$|Both Buddhism and Catholicism <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> {{into many}} {{countries}} {{all over the}} world. Buddhism <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> {{to a number of}} Asian countries such as China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Tibet, Mongolia, and Bhutan to the north, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia to the south. 8 By the nineteenth century, Buddhism was introduced into Europe, Australia, America and then Africa by Western scholars and immigrants. 9 Like Buddhism, Catholicism <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the Roman Empire and to north Europe through the fourth and fifth centuries. 10 By the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> to America, Asia and Africa.|$|R

5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay transmission system, the cross-rope suspension tower was invented. This type of tower features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed tower, but the two legs don't converge at the tower base. In the case of the cross-rope suspension tower, the tower legs <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> apart on two different foundations. In addition, the crossbar is replaced by a series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. The design is also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|E
5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, and prairie dogs. The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted well to the area after being {{introduced}} from China. Growing populations of bald eagles <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River. Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, bass, and other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish.|$|E
50|$|Veneration of Benedict <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{throughout}} Latin America, from Mexico through Argentina. In Venezuela, particularly, {{his devotion}} <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> through the country's various states, {{and he is}} celebrated on many different dates, according to the local traditions.|$|R
5|$|Strep throat <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> by {{respiratory}} droplets from {{an infected}} person. It may <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|R
25|$|HIV/AIDS {{education}} is somewhat limited in Gaborone. 14.5% of Gaborone residents between 10–64 who {{have heard of}} HIV/AIDS believe that HIV can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through witchcraft, and 31.3% of the residents believe HIV can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through mosquito bites.|$|R
5|$|Marasmius sasicola is {{a species}} of Marasmiaceae fungus known from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. First {{collected}} in 2000, it was described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with white caps and very short, very thin black stems. Unlike in other, similar species, the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> out around the cap, {{and all of them}} reach the stem. The flesh has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead Sasa leaves, from which it takes its specific epithet.|$|E
5|$|Memorials {{to those}} who died <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> widely around the UK, {{and some of the}} crew are commemorated in {{different}} locations. One casualty, George David Spinner, is remembered on the Portsmouth Naval memorial, the Hood Chapel at the Church of St John the Baptist, in Boldre, Hampshire, and also on the gravestone of his brother, who died while serving in the Royal Air Force in 1942, in the Hamilton Road Cemetery, Deal, Kent.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
50|$|Diphtheria is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheria It <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing, it can also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through skin lesions on the infected person and through contact with contaminated clothes and objects.|$|R

50|$|Hepatitis E <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{primarily}} through the oral-fecal route {{but may also}} <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> by blood and from mother to fetus. The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention {{is similar to that}} for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices).|$|R
5|$|On {{occasion}} a Ruisdael changes hands. In 2014, Dunes by the Sea was auctioned at Christie's in New York, and realised a {{price of}} $1,805,000. Of his surviving drawings, 140 in total, the Rijksmuseum, the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Dresden's Kupferstich-Kabinett, and the Hermitage each hold significant collections. Ruisdael's rare etchings <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> across institutions. No collection holds a print {{of each of the}} thirteen etchings. Of the five unique prints, the British Museum holds two, two are in the Albertina in Vienna, and one is in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Other {{families}} claiming {{descent from}} his nephews <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> through Stara Raška and Šumadija in Serbia. There was a tale that Pivljanin put a curse {{on his family}} after seven of his brothers and cousins declined {{to join him in}} the hajduks. The Markovići brotherhood in Ljuljaci, Serbia, with the slava of St. John, settled {{in the first half of}} the 18th century, descending from one of Pivljanin's children. The Bajić brotherhood in Takovo, with the slava of St. George, numbering 30 households in 1960, also claim descent from him.|$|E
5|$|Sati– A Meluhan princess, {{she is the}} {{daughter}} of King Daksha. Shiva falls in love with her and marries her. Sati is a skilled swords-woman and is very brave since childhood. She assists Shiva on his journey to destroy Evil, but dies a valiant death while saving her people from a group of assassins. Her death becomes a trigger for the wars to cease. She is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti).|$|E

5|$|The Catlins—and {{especially}} its {{central and southern}} areas—experiences considerably higher precipitation {{than most of the}} South Island's east coast; heavy rain occurs infrequently, but drizzle is common and the region averages around 150days of rain per year. Rain days <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> fairly evenly throughout the year; there is no particularly rainy season in the northern Catlins, and only a slight tendency towards more autumn rain in the southwest. The average annual rainfall recorded at the Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre is about , with little variation from year to year.|$|E
5|$|The film begins {{three years}} after the onset of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> across the galaxy, leading a massive war against the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to {{eliminate}} the notorious General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army. Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker grows close to Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, unknown to the public, a Sith Lord. Their deepening friendship threatens the Jedi Order, the Republic, and Anakin himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can {{regenerate}} through a ground-stored seed bank. Seedlings mostly germinate {{within two years}} of fires. Several species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus pollinate the flowers. Swamp wallabies are a main consumer of its fruit, and the seeds <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> in wallaby faeces. Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.|$|E
