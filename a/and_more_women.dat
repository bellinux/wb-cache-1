5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 October, a young woman struck a marching drum {{at the edge of}} a group of market-women who were infuriated by the chronic {{shortage}} and high price of bread. From their starting point in the markets of the eastern section of Paris then known as the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the angry women forced a nearby church to toll its bells. Their numbers continued to grow and with restless energy the group began to march. More women from other nearby marketplaces joined in, many bearing kitchen blades and other makeshift weapons, as the tocsins rang from church towers throughout several districts. Driven by a variety of agitators, the mob converged on the Hôtel de Ville where they demanded not only bread, but arms. As more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> – and men – arrived, the crowd outside the city hall reached between six and seven thousand, and perhaps as many as ten thousand.|$|E
25|$|Once {{women were}} allowed in Antarctica, {{they still had}} to fight against sexism and sexual harassment. However, a tipping point was reached in the mid 1990s when it became the new normal that women were part of Antarctic life. Women began to see a change as more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> began working and researching in Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|By 1978 nearly 40% {{of girls}} 6 and above were literate; over 12,000 {{literacy}} corps women were teaching in villages; 33% of university students were women, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> than men took the entrance exam {{for the school}} of medicine. 333 women were elected to local councils, 22 women were elected to parliament, and 2 served in the Senate. There were one cabinet minister (for women’s affairs), 3 sub-cabinet under-secretaries, one governor, an ambassador, and five women mayors.|$|E

25|$|Most {{social roles}} are not gender-restricted by law, {{though there are}} still {{cultural}} inhibitions surrounding certain roles. More <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> have entered the workplace, and in the year 2000, made up 46.6% of the labor force; up from 18.3% in 1900. Most men, however, have not taken up the traditional full-time homemaker role; likewise, few men have taken traditionally feminine jobs such as receptionist or nurse (although nursing was traditionally a male role prior to the American Civil War).|$|E
25|$|This patriarchal {{backlash}} {{may indeed}} {{be the result of}} lack of employment opportunities for men <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> entering the workforce which has altered traditional gender dynamics and created a situation of conflict between the sexes. Other researchers attribute the murders to Mexico's structural crisis including increasing poverty, unemployment, the disintegration of the peasant economy, migration, and a dysfunctional justice system. Overall, in considering the potential motives for gendered violence against women, academic Mercedes Olivera has argued that femicide is a mechanism of domination, control, oppression, and power over women.|$|E
25|$|Labour unions {{were not}} allowed and a minimum wage policy was not enforced. However, {{in a context of}} an {{expanding}} economy, bringing better living conditions for the Portuguese population in the 1960s, the outbreak of the colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security.|$|E

25|$|In 1917, with America {{taking part}} in World War I, more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> began to work the various stalls and shops in the Market as their husbands went to war. By the time the war was underway, the Western Avenue {{commission}} houses that had {{led to the creation}} of the Pike Place Market were in decline, being unable to compete directly with the farmers. The net effect was a near complete stop by the time of World War I of the food price profiteering that had been rampant previously. Washington State government took an interest later in insuring that such things would be prevented during the war for the benefit of its citizens. The Fisheries Commission turned over to the Seattle city government dead hatchery salmon that were killed for eggs and sperm to combat rising fish prices. The city created the municipal-owned City Fish Market at Pike Place Market, cutting the cost of salmon by a third. The city-owned fish vendor business would only last until the end of World War I, when it was stopped. In 1918, wanting to spend more time on his other business ventures, Frank sold his stake in the Pike Place Market to his brother Arthur, who took control of most of the business.|$|E
2500|$|These poets drew {{inspiration}} from the troubadour poetry of Occitania written in langue d'oc, which applied the feudal code of honor to the relation between a man (acting as the vassal) and a woman (acting as king or superior). This is {{a reversal of the}} traditional role of women, traditionally dependent on men, and marks a new awareness in medieval society: the decadence of feudalism with the increasing power of the middle class, causes a shift in the reading public, the epic (traditionally devoted to great military pursuits) gradually giving way to the lyric (generally focused on love). In the lower Middle Ages more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> were reading books than ever before and poetry tried to adapt to their point of view and their newly acquired role in society.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on {{the area}} within South Africa, {{the manner in which}} honor is {{expressed}} varies. For example, traditionally in rural areas, women handled all agricultural jobs (except for herding and plowing). They also took care of the home and the children. Men were involved in various aspects of life including politics, all jobs that required heavy lifting and moving and took care of their animals. [...] Many men become what is called a labor migrant and send their earnings back to their families and in some families women are labor migrants instead of men. Because of high rates of unemployment, more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> have taken on this role. For those families who live in the city, both men and women go to work, but women are still responsible for taking care of the home (both mothers and the oldest daughter in the home).|$|E

2500|$|An {{economic}} crisis {{which began in}} 1976, bound women across class lines for the first time. Social issues gave women a new political voice as they demanded solutions to address problems created by the rural to urban migration which was taking place. Women formed neighborhood coalitions to deal with lack of housing, sanitation, transportation, utilities and water. As more people moved into cities to find work, lack of investment in those areas, as well as education and health facilities, became challenges that united women's efforts. Though these colonias populares (neighborhood movements) were making [...] "demands for genuine representation and state accountability {{as well as social}} citizenship rights" [...] they did not ask for systemic changes to improve women's societal positions. As the debt crisis intensified and Mexico devalued its currency to gain international loans, wages decreased while the cost of living escalated, causing more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> to enter the workforce. Companies began hiring women because they could pay them lower wages, male unemployment soared, and feminist activity came to a standstill.|$|E
2500|$|For one {{comparison}} {{note that}} in 1989 Mikhail Gorbachev abandoned the quota for female representation in the Supreme Soviet {{and the proportion of}} women immediately fell from 1/3 to 15 percent. [...] <b>And</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> than ever before were elected in US Congress in 2009 - 74 women out of 435 (17%) in the House and 17 out of 100 in the Senate. The US Senate reached 19 women in the election of 2012. In Canada women in parliament in 2004 were 24.7% of the members. By 2006 60% of nations had reached only 10% female representation in government while 10% of the countries had reached 30% female representation and use of quotas is common. In 2010 the world average for members of parliaments was 19% though regional averages varied from 23% to 9%. Meanwhile, the world average of women serving on national assemblies had reached rates of 31% as early as 1953, been above 31% continuously since 1996, and reached 39% in 2007, (the last date for which data is currently available) and this inclusive of a period [...] "growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hair styling in African-American {{culture is}} greatly varied. African-American hair is {{typically}} composed of coiled curls, {{which range from}} tight to wavy. Many women choose to wear their hair in its natural state. [...] Natural hair can be styled {{in a variety of}} ways, including the afro, twist outs, braid outs, and wash and go styles. [...] It is a myth that natural hair presents styling problems or is hard to manage; this myth seems prevalent because mainstream culture has, for decades, attempted to get African American women to conform to its standard of beauty (i.e., straight hair). [...] To that end, some women prefer straightening of the hair through the application of heat or chemical processes. [...] Although this can be a matter of personal preference, the choice is often affected by straight hair being a beauty standard in the West and the fact that hair type can affect employment. However, more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> are wearing their hair in its natural state and receiving positive feedback. Alternatively, the predominant and most socially acceptable practice for men is to leave one's hair natural.|$|E

2500|$|The wave metaphor {{has been}} {{described}} as misleading and even dangerous because it not only renders the periods of time in-between waves as silent and irrelevant, but it also contributes to the faulty conceptualization of a particular brand hegemonic feminism as the ultimate understanding of what feminism is. [...] These critiques advocate for the recognition of periods of mass social organizing rather than ‘waves’. [...] It is argued that the wave metaphor weakens the strength and relevance of feminist arguments, since waves necessarily must peak and then retreat, which is not an accurate picture of feminist progress in the United States or elsewhere. [...] Feminism does not retreat or disappear in-between ‘waves'. [...] For example, after the explosion of mass social organizing in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, feminism was being worked into our institutions – a much less glamorous but just as important job that did not require such large-scale attention. [...] As a result, we have seen more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> in more areas of the job force, higher education, and the installation and success of Women’s and Gender Studies programs across the United States, {{to name just a few}} examples of feminism’s continuous and very relevant presence in this time between the ‘waves’.|$|E
2500|$|Marriage is very {{important}} {{to the members of the}} Parsi community, believing that, in order to continue the expansion of God’s kingdom, they must procreate. Up until the mid-19th century child marriages were common even though the idea of child marriage was not part of the religious doctrine. Consequently, when social reform started happening in India, the Parsi community discontinued the practice. There are, however, rising problems over the availability of brides. More <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> in the Parsi community are becoming well educated and are therefore either delaying marriage or not partaking at all. Women within the Parsi community in India are ninety-seven percent literate; forty-two percent have completed high school or college and twenty-nine percent have an occupation in which they earn a substantial amount of money. The wedding ceremony begins much like the initiation with a cleansing bath. The bride and groom then travel to the wedding in florally decorated cars. The priests from both families facilitate the wedding. The couple begins by facing one another with a sheet to block their view of one another. [...] Wool is passed over the two seven times to bind them together. The two are then supposed to throw rice to their partner symbolizing dominance. The religious element comes in next when the two sit side by side to face the priest.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} twentieth century to present day, more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> are {{becoming}} involved in science. [...] However, women often find themselves at odds with expectations held towards them in relation to their scientific studies. [...] For example, in 1968 James Watson questioned scientist Rosalind Franklin's place in the industry. [...] He claimed that [...] "the best place for a feminist was in another person's lab", most often a male's research lab. [...] Women were and still are often critiqued of their overall presentation. [...] In Franklin's situation, she was seen as lacking femininity for she failed to wear lipstick or revealing clothing. [...] Women believed that in order to gain recognition, they needed to hide their feminine qualities, to thus appear more masculine. [...] Women in the sixties were often forced to wear men's clothing, which often did not fit for they were too large or too short within the crotch area. [...] Since most of their colleagues in science are men, women also find themselves left out of opportunities to discuss possible research opportunities. [...] In Londa Scheibinger's book, Has Feminism Changed Science?, she explains how men discuss research outside of the lab, but this conversation is preceded by talk of sports and the like, thus excluding women. [...] This causes women to seek other women in science to converse with, which in turn causes their final work to be looked down upon, for a male scientist was not involved.|$|E
50|$|Another {{factor that}} {{may have contributed to}} the trend was The Equal Pay Act of 1963, which aimed at abolishing wage {{disparity}} based on sex.

60|$|And now, {{known as}} the King of the Klondike, {{carrying}} several other royal titles, such as Eldorado King, Bonanza King, the Lumber Baron, and the Prince of the Stampeders, not to omit the proudest appellation of all, namely, the Father of the Sourdoughs, he was more afraid of women than ever. As never before they held out their arms to him, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>women</b> were flocking into the country day by day.

Think of that! all those multitudes of men fighting, fighting, killing, killing! The four rivers running with blood! The shouts of triumph! the howls of rage! the curses of despair! the shrieks of torment! That will be life indeed: life lived to the very marrow: burning, overwhelming life.
