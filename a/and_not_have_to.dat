5|$|The {{decision}} to use English-speaking actors was made early. Since the film would be very visual, the director wanted audiences {{to be able to}} focus on the images, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rely on subtitles. He later expressed his approval of the use of dubbed voice tracks in non-English speaking countries.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> share it with his brothers.|$|E

25|$|On 11 January 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that Christopher Lee would reprise {{his role as}} Saruman the White. Lee had originally said {{he would have liked to}} have shown how Saruman is first corrupted by Sauron, but would not be comfortable flying to New Zealand at his age. Lee went on to say that if a film were made, he would love to voice Smaug, as it would mean he could record his part in England <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel. On 10 January 2011, it was reported that Lee had entered into negotiations to reprise the role of Saruman.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{a pitcher}} could {{intentionally}} walk a batter by simply announcing his intent {{to do so}} <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> actually throw any pitches. Beginning in 2008, the pitcher had to actually pitch the required four balls (which were counted against the pitch count). In 2017, the Major and Minor levels of Little League Baseball aligned with a new rule of Major League Baseball and allowed the batter to intentionally walk a batter simply by declaration. The intentional walk adds 4 to the pitcher's pitch count. This change rescinded a former rule in which the team at bat could decline the award of first base and force the pitcher to pitch, such as to further inflate the pitch count to force {{the removal of the}} pitcher.|$|E

He again reluctantly accepting, believing he would be defeated <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> serve in the office. He was overwhelmingly defeated in the election, finished out his two remaining years as a state senator, {{and returned to his}} farm in 1892. The following year the nation was adversely affected by the Panic of 1893, leading to a collapse of farm and produce value. Across the state, farmers began to lose their land to their lenders. The following year in the 1894 mid-term elections the Republicans swept to power in the statehouse, and took control of the Indiana General Assembly. As a farmer, Mount was also affected by the economic downturn and decided a return to politics was the best way he could help the situation.|$|E
25|$|Network {{services}} include offerings such as file sharing, print services, email, web sites, {{and file}} transfer protocols (FTP), {{most of which}} can have compromised security. At {{the front line of}} security are hardware devices known as firewalls or intrusion detection/prevention systems. At the operating system level, {{there are a number of}} software firewalls available, as well as intrusion detection/prevention systems. Most modern operating systems include a software firewall, which is enabled by default. A software firewall can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the operating system. Therefore, one can install and be running an insecure service, such as Telnet or FTP, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be threatened by a security breach because the firewall would deny all traffic trying to connect to the service on that port.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because reactive power does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E

Bianchi, Felisatti and cinematographer Franco Delli Colli would collaborate again the following year in La moglie di mio padre. Nude per l'assassino score was written by Berto Pisano, who would also go on to write the score for Bianchi's 1979 film Malabimba. Bianchi would later cast Femi Benussi, who portrayed one of the slain models, in two other films—La moglie di mio padre and Cara dolce niopte.|$|E

It was not until a year later in June 2012 that the voice work contracts were signed for the pair, and it was also announced that the likeness rights and voice acting {{of the rest of the}} main cast from the film had been secured. Some cast members such as Pegg improvised parts of their performances. Quinto praised the positive experience in the recording studio, and said that [...] "it was nice to be able to play the character <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do all this physical stuff".|$|E

500|$|PHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and {{the fact}} that the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various {{products}} have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an opcode cache, which works by caching the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in shared memory to avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling the code every time the script runs. [...] An opcode cache, Zend Opcache, is built into PHP since version 5.5. [...] Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the Alternative PHP Cache (APC), which is available as a PECL extension.|$|E

The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else".

500|$|For instance, while {{traveling}} in a moving vehicle at a [...] velocity, {{the laws of}} physics do not change {{as a result of its}} motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> apply a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by, would observe the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Ruth Lambert held {{a series}} of casting auditions for the film in New York, Los Angeles, and London, but the crew already had some actors in mind for two of the major characters. The character of Dr. Doppler was written with David Hyde Pierce in mind, and Pierce was given a copy of the Treasure Planet script along with preliminary sketches of the character and the film's scenic elements while he was working on Pixar's A Bug's Life (1998). He stated that [...] "the script was fantastic, the look was so compelling" [...] that he accepted the role. Likewise, the character of Captain Amelia was developed with the idea that Emma Thompson would be providing her voice. [...] "We offered it to her and she was really excited," [...] Clements said. Musker said, [...] "This is the first action adventure character that Emma has ever played and she was pregnant during several of the sessions. She was happy that she could do all this action <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> train for the part" [...] There were no actors initially in mind for the characters of John Silver and Jim Hawkins; Brian Murray (John Silver) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Jim Hawkins) were signed after months of auditions. Gordon-Levitt stated that he was attracted to the role because [...] "it's a Disney animated movie and Disney animated movies are in a class by themselves," [...] and that [...] "to be part of that tradition is unbelievable to me". Musker mentioned that Gordon-Levitt [...] "combined enough vulnerability and intelligence and a combination of youthfulness but incompleteness" [...] and that they liked his approach.|$|E
