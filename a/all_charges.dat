40|$|The {{preliminary}} NA 49 {{results on}} the energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations over the whole SPS energy range exhibit an unexpected effect. The Φ_p_T fluctuation measure - used by the NA 49 experiment - manifests a different behavior for different charge combinations. Whereas the Φ_p_T is consistent with zero and independent of energy for negatively charged particles, it significantly increases for both <b>all</b> <b>charged</b> and positively charged particles at lower SPS energies. The string-hadronic model UrQMD is applied here to explain this effect. The UrQMD simulations show {{that the number of}} protons is strongly correlated with impact parameter and that the event-by-event impact parameter fluctuations are responsible for the event-by-event transverse momentum fluctuations of positively <b>charged</b> and <b>all</b> <b>charged</b> particles where protons are included. The observations presented in this article are important for all experiments measuring event-by-event fluctuations, especially for those using <b>all</b> <b>charged</b> particles in the analysis. The results can be also crucial for detectors with acceptances extending to the beam/target spectator domains.
