Both leaders participated in the NATO Summit in Strasbourg-Kehl, where Spain committed an additional 450 troops to its previous military contingent of 778 in Afghanistan. Commentators said the decision may have been partially motivated by the Zapatero government's desire to curry favor with the new administration in Washington. Days later at the EU-U.S. Summit in Prague the two held a 45-minute meeting, and afterwards shared a photo-op for the press, where Obama called Zapatero a friend, and said he thinks that the two nations would establish an even stronger relationship in the years to come. This was the first formal meeting between heads of government of Spain and the United States since 2004.|$|E

However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged. Even so, Heath was privately outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.|$|R

Though Cao Cao criticised his lack of {{academic}} learning, Cao Zhang had always aspired to pursue a career in the military. Once, his father sent him to the imperial University to study, but Cao Zhang lamented to his <b>aides,</b> <b>saying</b> a real man should command the army {{to make a name for}} himself instead of being a Doctor (a Doctor was both an academic degree and a formal court title for many Chinese dynasties).|$|R

One affected resident told the Ottawa Citizen, [...] "The principle is really bothering me: that my information has been gathered without my knowledge. I don't know how it's going to be used." [...] Two families who received cards have sent letters to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, asking confirmation the MP won't use the collected personal information. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has no jurisdiction in investigating such matters. Gallant's <b>aide</b> <b>says</b> the Member receives many requests for birthday and anniversary cards, and the office is unsure how the information {{was put on the}} list, since Gallant receives thousands of requests for salutations and the birth date could have been on one of the request forms returned by a constituent.|$|R

Despite the opposition, a harbour and railway connection were built in 1872–73. Several domestic and foreign shipping companies attempted year-round traffic with varying commercial success, but the port of Hanko remained closed for several months nearly every year.|$|R

Aside from security risks, the report stated that [...] "she did not comply with the Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act." [...] Each of these findings contradicted what Clinton and her <b>aides</b> had been <b>saying</b> up to that point. The report also stated that Clinton and her senior aides declined to speak with the investigators, while the previous four Secretaries of State did so.|$|R
50|$|Surprise is long in port at Kutali being windbound. The Dryad and the gun-laden {{transports}} she fetched seem long in coming. Graham {{engages in}} a harsh argument with Aubrey. Rumor spreads that Ismail has permission {{to take charge}} of Kutali, causing the locals to beg Aubrey to protect them. Graham travels by land to Ali Pasha of Ioannina learning that Mustapha lured Dryad and the transports into his port, and is sailing on his ship Torgud to take Kutali. The rumor was started by Ali Pasha in his own double dealing, to fire up Mustapha against his enemy Ismail; in the end, Ali Pasha wants rid of Mustapha. Mustapha is on his own, with no approval from the Sultan of Turkey. Surprise is ready to sail on the instant, especially as the winds have changed. Aubrey will attack both ships, Kitabi sailing with Torgud. They meet at sea, with Surprise firing broadsides instantly and repeatedly. Torgud is cruelly damaged, with many dead. Young Williamson loses half his arm. Kitabi goes between Surprise and Torgud, crashing into Torgud’s side. Aubrey boards Kitabi, and takes her. Boarding crew proceeds to Torgud, jumping across like Nelson. Pullings falls, so Aubrey stands above him then fights fiercely in the close hand-to-hand combat. Aubrey reaches Mustapha, early wounded and sitting. His <b>aide</b> Ulusan <b>says,</b> we surrender. Bonden carries the swords and ensigns. Aubrey asks Mowett what happened to Pullings, to learn he survives. They return to the Surprise before the Torgud can sink.|$|R

When Lameda hung up, he told Hernandez that the call [...] "was from an officer who was present when an order was issued to send the military intelligence police after him." [...] Lameda assumed the police were coming [...] "to prevent him from appearing on television later in the day, when he planned to appeal to the military to choose sides in the growing tensions between Chávez's supporters and his opponents." [...] Lameda was not calling for a coup, he said, although he and other opponents of Chávez hoped that anti-Chávez demonstrations would grow so large that Chávez would have to crack down, whereupon the military would be faced with the decision of whether to enforce his orders or not.|$|R
5000|$|During her presidential campaign, Clinton {{had made}} several {{references}} to her March 1996 trip to visit U.S. troops enforcing the Dayton Agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, detailing a harrowing experience. At a February 29, 2008, event in Waco, Texas, with retired Gen. Wesley Clark and remarks at a December 29, 2007, event in Dubuque, Iowa, Clinton detailed {{how she had}} to make a run for it on the tarmac at Tuzla Air Base to avoid sniper fire. On March 17, 2008, during her Saint Patrick's Day speech at The George Washington University, Clinton described her trip to Bosnia:The Associated Press could find no evidence that Clinton had been under extraordinary risk during her landing at Tuzla Air Base. A video of her arrival, released by CBS News, shows Clinton and her daughter Chelsea smiling and waving as they walked at a leisurely pace across the tarmac from a cargo plane, stopping to shake hands with Bosnia's acting president and listen while an 8-year-old girl read a poem. Clinton shook hands with American troops and posed for pictures with a group of 7th graders who were also on the tarmac. Comedian Sinbad, who accompanied Clinton on the trip, said, [...] "I never felt that I was in a dangerous position. I never felt being in a sense of peril, or 'Oh, God, I hope I'm going to be OK when I get out of this helicopter or when I get out of his tank.'" [...] When spokesman Howard Wolfson was asked about her remarks, he said that she [...] "misspoke". CBS News reported that hundreds of thousands of viewers had by then seen video of the 1996 event that offers evidence of Clinton's exaggeration, with Clinton <b>aide</b> Lissa Muscatine <b>saying</b> the event [...] "was not quite as dramatic as Clinton put it." [...] Clinton acknowledged her mistake, saying [...] "I made a mistake. That happens. It proves I'm human, which you know, for some people, is a revelation." [...] The Obama campaign responded by releasing documentation of three other instances in the past in which Clinton had repeated the same sniper fire claim.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1919, {{when the}} Allies {{submitted}} the Treaty of Versailles for the Reichstag to ratify, the President Friedrich Ebert {{was in favor}} of rejecting the treaty and resuming the war. As such, Ebert asked the military what were the possibilities of the Reich winning if the war resumed in June 1919. Groener advised acceptance of the treaty under the grounds that Allies would win the war if it resumed and that the terms of Versailles treaty left the Reich intact and allowed for the possibility of Germany regaining great power status one day, observing the treaty did not destroy the basis of German power. Hindenburg felt the same way, but argued at a meeting with Ebert and Groener that: [...] "Should we not appeal to the Corps of Officers and demand from a minority of the people a gesture of sacrifice in defence of our national honor?". Groener replied: [...] "The significance of such a gesture would escape the German people. There would be a general outcry against counter-revolution and militarism. The result would be the downfall of the Reich. The Allies, baulked of their hopes of peace, would show themselves pitiless. The Officer Corps would be destroyed and the name of Germany would disappear from the map". Hindenburg could not rebut Groener's argument, but still offered only half-hearted support, writing to Ebert on 17 June 1919: [...] "In the event of a resumption of hostilities, we can reconquer the province of Posen and defend our frontiers in the East. In the West, however we can scarcely count upon being able to withstand a serious offensive {{on the part of the}} enemy in view of the numerical superiority of the Entente and their ability to outflank us on both wings. The success of the operation as a whole is therefore very doubtful, but as a soldier I cannot help feeling it were better to perish honourably than accept a disgraceful peace". The Allies submitted an ultimatum saying that Germany had 72 hours to sign the Treaty of Versailles before the war resumed. On 23 June 1919 with only 7 hours left before the ultimatum expired, Ebert contacted Groener and Hindenburg to ask for their advice as professional military men about what he should do. Hindenburg refused to speak, and let Groener do all the talking as Groener advised acceptance. After hearing Groener's advice, with just 19 minutes to go, Ebert sent a message to the French Premier Georegs Clemenceau saying Germany would ratify the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on 28 June 1919. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett wrote that Hindenburg's behavior in June 1919 closely resembled his actions in November 1918 where Groener had to pressure Wilhelm II to abdicate while he remained silent. Wheeler-Bennett further charged that in June 1919, the real Hindenburg revealed himself; not the titanic, larger-than-life figure beloved by the German people, the [...] "rock" [...] upon which the Reich rested, but rather [...] "a poor thing, a thing of plaster and of papier mâché." [...] Wheeler-Bennett wrote Hindenburg knew the truth, but chose to do the easy thing by having his faithful <b>aide</b> Groener <b>say</b> all the things that he knew to be true while maintaining the pretense that he had been opposed to accepting Versailles, a sign of both Hindenburg's deeply dishonest nature and his tendency to evade responsibility whenever responsibility became difficult.|$|R
