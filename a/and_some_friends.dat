5|$|In September 1960 Bukovsky entered Moscow University {{to study}} biology. There he <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>friends</b> decided {{to revive the}} {{informal}} Mayakovsky Square poetry readings which began after a statue to the poet was unveiled in central Moscow in 1958. They made contact with earlier participants of the readings such as Vladimir Osipov, the editor of Boomerang (1960), and Yuri Galanskov who issued the Phoenix (1961), two examples of literary samizdat.|$|E
5|$|In January 1748, Adams <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>friends</b> were {{inflamed}} by British impressment {{and launched}} The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized {{many of the}} themes that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.|$|E

Beyoncé enters the club with a different outfit and hairstyle <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>friends.</b> Male patrons seated at the tables look on. She and Usher notice each other. They meet {{on the dance floor}} and dance intimately. Beyoncé performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a champagne glass filled with bubbles. In the final scene, Beyoncé sits atop a piano and after being lifted down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the Catalogue. She caught Zeus's eye while she <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>friends</b> were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E

5|$|William Abb Cannon {{was born}} in Neshoba County, Mississippi to Harvey and Virgie Cannon. The family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father worked during World War II. While {{attending}} Istrouma High School in Baton Rouge, Cannon drew attention for his speed, strength and size; he exceled in football, basketball, and track. In football in 1955, his senior year, Cannon scored 39 touchdowns, was included in All-State and All-America teams, and led the Istrouma Indians to a state championship. Although generally appearing in just {{the first half of}} games, he scored 229 points that season, a state record at the time. In track and field, he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds and threw the shot-put over 56 feet, setting what were state records at the time for both events. In the summer of 1955, Cannon received a 90-day suspended sentence for theft; he <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>friends</b> were caught extorting money from men whom they had seen with prostitutes. This was {{the first in a series}} of legal troubles in Cannon's life.|$|E

25|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Beethoven would not recover, his friends gathered to help and to pay their final respects. Beethoven's doctors conducted four minor operations to relieve ascites (abdominal swelling), of which the first resulted in infection, the others not. On 24 March he was given his last rites, and on 26 March he slipped into unconsciousness and died. While others, including Beethoven's brother <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>friends,</b> were probably in the house, Hüttenbrenner reports in his 1860 account that only he and Beethoven's sister-in-law were present in the room at the time of death.|$|E
25|$|On early Sunday, March 11, 2012, {{two days}} before his trade to the Bears, Marshall was accused of hitting {{a woman in the}} face at a New York club and being {{involved}} in a melee.

The investigation later ended after a lack of evidence of Marshall's role in the incident.|$|E
25|$|In December 1930, Paramount offered Dane & Arthur a twenty-three-week Publix Theatre {{vaudeville}} tour. The pair {{had made}} a few shorts for Paramount and RKO as well.

The venture failed. By February 1932, Dane had returned to vaudeville, this time as a solo comedic act. His act was panned by critics and apparently short-lived.

Both decided to leave the band, and began to pursue a career together, marking the beginning of Savage Garden.|$|E
