500|$|A {{few weeks}} after Ulam reached Los Alamos in February 1944, the project {{experienced}} a crisis. [...] In April, Emilio Segrè discovered that plutonium made in reactors would not work in a gun-type plutonium weapon like the [...] "Thin Man", which was being developed in parallel with a uranium weapon, the [...] "Little Boy" [...] that was dropped on Hiroshima. [...] This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the Hanford site and to make slow separation of uranium isotopes {{the only way to}} prepare fissile material suitable for use in bombs. [...] To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an implosion-type weapon and appointed George Kistiakowsky head of the implosion department.

500|$|Judgements {{were mixed}} on Yardley's {{performance}} as Yorkshire's captain. His record {{would have been}} considered good at any other county, but not by the standards set by previous Yorkshire sides. Critics felt that Yorkshire should have won the Championship with the players available. Contemporaries believed him to be the best captain in the country tactically, taking reasonable chances without too many risks and judging players strengths and weakness. Trevor Bailey, who played against him for Essex and under him for England, wrote that he thought him [...] "an outstanding tactician <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> wicket behaviour. He was unquestionably one of the best captains I have ever played with or against. It has been said that he was too nice to lead Yorkshire, but I cannot think of anybody I have preferred playing under." [...] Alan Gibson believed that unlike some county captains, Yardley was worth his place in the side on cricketing ability. However, he seemed unable to extract the best from his players. Jim Kilburn noted that he used orthodox tactics, even when a different approach was called for, while other critics believed that he was shocked by the attitude of some difficult players in the side. Neither Yardley nor Hutton, his senior professional, were disciplinarians in the dressing room and kept apart from others. Both were frequently absent, playing in representative matches. This may have inflamed the situation, leading to accusations that some players were out of control. Yardley disliked confrontation, and Ray Illingworth, who played under him, described him as too nice to stand up to his players. But Bob Appleyard, another of his former players, gives Yardley credit for recognising his potential and encouraging him to become a spinner, and believes that he and Hutton made a formidable pair of tacticians. Generally, he was popular with his players.|$|E
