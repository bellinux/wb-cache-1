5|$|Amelia and Kanyenke next {{fight the}} Circle at their last stronghold in Cuba, and, after allying with the Spanish colony of Havana and {{awaiting}} {{the arrival of}} the U.S. Navy, they destroy the Ossuary and the fixed guns guarding it. As the battle is ending, Amelia and Kanyenke pass under an archway in which Beaumont is concealed. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia but Kanyenke pushes her out of the way. All three tumble to the ground. Beaumont charges at Amelia, about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, Amelia kicks him and pushes him backwards. He quickly charges <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> but she grabs her shotgun and shoots him. Amelia later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast.|$|E
2500|$|Once Io {{was given}} to Hera, she tied her to a tree and sent her servant Argus to keep Io {{separated}} from Zeus. [...] Argus was a loyal servant to Hera and he has immense strength and one hundred eyes all over his body. It {{was not possible to}} go past Argus since he never closed more than half his eyes at any time. Zeus was afraid of Hera's wrath could not personally intervene, so to save Io, he commanded Hermes to kill Argus, which he does by lulling all one hundred eyes into eternal sleep. In Ovid's interpolation, when Hera learned of Argus' death, she took his eyes and placed them in the plumage of the peacock, her favorite animal, accounting for the eye pattern in its tail and making it the vainest of all animals. Hera, furious about Io being free and the death of Argus, sent a gadfly (Greek oistros, compare oestrus) to sting Io as she wandered the earth. [...] Eventually Io made it to Egypt, the Egyptians worshiped the snow-white heifer and named her the Egyptian goddess Isis. [...] Hera permitted Zeus to change Io back into her human form, under the condition that he never look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b> [...] Io, the goddess-queen of Egypt, then bore Zeus' son as the next King.|$|E

60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> father <b>again,</b> but no tear {{fell down}} her cheek.|$|R
6000|$|Here Miss Squeers looked {{sideways}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> father <b>again,</b> {{who looked}} sideways <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{as much as}} to say, 'There you had him.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{entered the}} house and was <b>at</b> <b>her</b> side <b>again</b> within {{the time he had}} named. 'This is it,' he said pleasantly.|$|R
60|$|Tom looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> and recollected; {{and then}} looked away, and forgot in an instant.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked to}} the door, waited a moment before I opened it, and turned round to look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fan glanced timidly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> {{her eyes}} brightening, a red colour {{flushing}} her pale cheeks, {{and her lips}} quivering.|$|E
6000|$|Isabel gazed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> cousin <b>again.</b> [...] "I don't {{know what}} you mean. You mean something--that you don't mean. What was Monsieur Merle?" ...|$|R
60|$|His {{evening is}} a flame of wine Among the eager, cordial men. And she with her women hot and hard Moves <b>at</b> <b>her</b> ease <b>again.</b>|$|R
50|$|Marie-France wisens up and folds her Dance Academy. Although happy {{pulling the}} strings <b>at</b> <b>her</b> model-agency <b>again</b> she'll never admit that she's drawn the {{shortest}} straw.|$|R
60|$|He tapped lightly {{upon the}} {{tablecloth}} {{for a minute}} with the fingers of one hand. Then he looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{gathered}} his cream while she stood silently by, {{and when he}} looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> she was in deep thought.|$|E
60|$|That answer smote him {{instantly}} still. Under {{the shock}} of it he just stood and stared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> his jaw fallen.|$|E
60|$|Miss Churton looked inquiringly <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{then turned}} <b>again</b> to Fan.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned his}} eyes aside, and looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hands as she washed the forks. They trembled slightly. Then {{he looked back}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> eyes <b>again,</b> that were {{watching}} him large and wistful and a little accusing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. She goes on pegging {{away at the}} hospital; she's a brick." [...] But he did {{not look}} <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>again</b> there was silence, till he stopped by Lord's Cricket-ground.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{her tone}} puzzled him. He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> long and fixedly. Her eyes met his, they {{answered}} his unspoken question.|$|E
60|$|Kate looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> {{but less}} {{steadily}} than before; and resting her elbow on the table, covered {{her eyes with}} her hand.|$|E

60|$|Ruggedo blinked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and sighed}} <b>again,</b> {{and then tried}} very hard to think.|$|R
60|$|Unable to {{determine}} whether she was serious or jesting, and conscious only of his delight <b>at</b> seeing <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> he advanced impulsively. But her expression instantly changed: she became at once stiff and school-girlishly formal, and stepped back towards the door.|$|R
60|$|As Charley was <b>at</b> <b>her</b> writing <b>again</b> {{in my room}} in the evening, and as I sat {{opposite}} to <b>her</b> <b>at</b> work, I felt the table tremble. Looking up, I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot.|$|R

60|$|The miner looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> in fear, {{and went}} obediently {{out of the}} room. Paul saw the tape of his garters {{swinging}} against his legs.|$|E

60|$|He {{went into}} her boudoir, a remote and very cushiony place. She was sitting <b>at</b> <b>her</b> table writing letters. She lifted her face abstractedly when he entered, watched him go to the sofa, and sit down. Then she looked down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> paper <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{woman behind}} the hedge, who had still {{continued}} to dog their footsteps, made an impatient movement at this change in their conversation, and looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> watch <b>again.</b> Yet she seemed reluctant to give over listening to them.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>again</b> his eye {{wandered over}} the room. He {{saw a little}} {{coloured}} portrait {{of a child with}} a fleece of brownish-gold hair and surprised eyes, in a pale-blue stiff frock with a broad dark-blue sash.|$|R
60|$|Again I looked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>again</b> I {{listened to}} her after she was silent, and again his image, though it was still fixed in my heart, darkened.|$|E
60|$|He did not answer, {{but looked}} <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Again</b> {{his heart was}} crushed in a hot grip. He wanted to cry, he wanted to smash things in fury.|$|E
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> {{with that}} intent, longing worship in his eyes, and answered, [...] "I accept {{the chance for}} the sake of one more hour with you." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked down}} <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>again</b> {{she had an}} uncomfortable sense that {{notwithstanding}} his rude clothes and country dialect, this man was no ordinary villager.

60|$|The {{girl looked}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> father <b>again,</b> {{but he turned}} his head away and tapped on the floor with his foot. Then in perplexity, akin to tears, she walked from the room, {{carefully}} drawing her dress aside as Gunn held the door for her.|$|R
