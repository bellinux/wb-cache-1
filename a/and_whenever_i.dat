500|$|Yankovic {{was dismayed}} by the album's lackluster reception. He noted that he [...] "thought {{it was the end}} of [...] career". Yankovic {{explained}} that [...] "I figured I'd peaked with 'Eat It' and 'Like a Surgeon' and now people were slowly forgetting about me and I was well on my way to obscurity." [...] However, Yankovic's next album, Even Worse, would resurrect his career and become his best-selling album at the time; the experience led Yankovic to realize that [...] "careers have peaks and valleys, <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> go through the rough times, another peak might be right around the corner." ...|$|E
2500|$|The diaries {{have become}} famous {{mostly because of}} the {{frequent}} remarks on and criticisms of Churchill. Although the diaries contain passages expressing admiration of Churchill, they {{also served as a}} vent for Brooke's frustration with working with the Prime Minister. The diaries also give sharp opinions on several of the top Allied leaders. The American generals Eisenhower and Marshall, for example, are described as poor strategists and Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander as unintelligent. Among the few individuals of whom Brooke seems to have kept consistently positive opinions, from a military standpoint, were General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir John Dill, and Joseph Stalin. Brooke admired Stalin for his quick brain and grasp of military strategy. Otherwise he had no illusions about the man, describing Stalin thus: [...] "He has got an unpleasantly cold, crafty, dead face, <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> look at him I can imagine his sending off people to their doom without ever turning a hair." ...|$|E

5000|$|Paying {{tribute to}} his sister, Muhammad Ali Jinnah once said, [...] "My sister was like a bright ray of light <b>and</b> hope <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> came back home and met her.

6000|$|... "Now, my own, own love," [...] she whispered, [...] "you are mine, and on'y mine; for she has forgot 'ee at last, {{although}} for her you died. But I--whenever I get up I'll think of 'ee, <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> lie down I'll think of 'ee. Whenever I plant the young larches I'll think that none can plant as you planted; <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> split a gad, <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> turn the cider-wring, I'll say none {{could do it}} like you. If ever I forget your name, let me forget home and Heaven!--But no, no, my love, I never can forget 'ee; for you was a GOOD man, and did good things!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> {{sit at the}} banquet, [...] Where {{the feast}} and song are high, Amid the mirth and music [...] I can hear that fearful cry.|$|E

60|$|The more I {{thought about}} this the lovelier it seemed. The hills, the farmhouses, the roads, the meadows all had {{delightful}} associations in my mind, as I knew they must have in my mother's mind {{and the idea of}} a regained homestead in the place of my birth began to engage my thought <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> had leisure to ponder my problem <b>and</b> especially <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> received a letter from my mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{take off}} my hat, <b>and</b> salute them, <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> pass the gate," [...] cried the young man, [...] "if the king and the whole court are {{standing}} by!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must be made}} to remember. You {{are aware}} that I have a little box full of spade-guineas, which your uncle put into my hands to divide between {{yourself}} <b>and</b> Clym <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> chose. Perhaps the time has come when it should be done. They can be turned into sovereigns at any moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{was always}} repeating them, because {{for a good}} many years this court stood for me as my only image of a convent, <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> read of monks and monasteries, this was my scenery for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] {{returned}} Queen Cor. [...] "You are {{as fat as}} a pincushion, as {{you must}} yourself admit, <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> needed a pin I could call you to me."

6000|$|... 'I shall state {{my opinion}} {{respecting}} your father, madam, {{with the most}} perfect unreserve, wherever <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> choose; quite convinced that, however you esteem that opinion, {{it will not be}} widely different from the real sentiments of the only parent whom you ought to respect, and whom you are bound to obey.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is {{the wife}} of the farmer who shares the house,' she said. 'She is {{accustomed}} to come out <b>and</b> meet me <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> walk far <b>and</b> am benighted. I am obliged to walk everywhere now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you feel}} that she wouldn't, or couldn't? No doubt she wouldn't have made the same point of it--for more than one reason. Poor Guy hasn't pretensions--has nothing but his youth and his beauty. But that's {{precisely}} why I'm sorry for him <b>and</b> try <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> can {{to give him a}} lift. Lady John's company is, you see, a lift." ...|$|R
60|$|But over <b>and</b> above this, <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> {{have come}} in contact with this clerk and shopman class, they have {{impressed}} me with considerable respect, not merely as to what they may be hereafter, but what they are now.|$|R

60|$|Near this {{dwelling}} of mine, but {{a little}} farther within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season: <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> had occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.|$|E

6000|$|The {{rest of the}} day I {{spent with}} Kory-Kory and Fayaway, {{wandering}} about a part of the valley situated in an opposite direction from the Ti, <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> so much as looked towards that building, although it was hidden from view by intervening trees, and at the distance of more than a mile, my attendant would exclaim, “Taboo, taboo!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And sent {{an angel}} {{to save me}} {{in the shape of}} a little maid," [...] he answered; adding, [...] "Don't blush so red, dear, for it is true that ever since that day, {{whenever}} I think of angels, I think of you; <b>and</b> <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> think of you I think of angels, which shows that you and the angels must be close together." ...|$|E

60|$|The Academy is {{too large}} <b>and</b> too vulgar. <b>Whenever</b> <b>I</b> have gone there, there have been either {{so many people that}} I {{have not been able to}} see the {{pictures}}--which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people--which was worse.|$|R
60|$|You solemnly {{promised to}} come <b>and</b> see me <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> should send for you. Can you call {{for five minutes}} as soon as possible, and {{disperse}} those plaguy glooms from which I am so unfortunate as to suffer? If you refuse I will not answer for the consequences.|$|R
25|$|Men are {{not always}} {{themselves}} and put on their behaviour with their clothes, but if you live with a man on board ship for years, if you are continually {{with him in his}} cabin, your mind will soon find out how to appreciate him.

I have not shed a tear before the 21st October, <b>and</b> since <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> am alone, I am quite like a child.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{stood there}} talking for over 'arf-an-hour arter I 'ad let'im in.

6000|$|... "No, I know a {{good deal}} more than I knew then, Chavigny.

60|$|The gardener's wife (charged with {{looking after}} the {{accommodation}} of the ladies) met {{me in the}} first-floor corridor. This excellent woman treats me with an excessive civility which is plainly the offspring of down-right terror. She stares, trembles, <b>and</b> curtseys, <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> speak to her. On my asking for Miss Verinder, she stared, trembled, and would no doubt have curtseyed next, if Miss Verinder herself had not cut that ceremony short, by suddenly opening her sitting-room door.|$|R
60|$|Flo. There's {{the more}} hope he may love me among the rest: Hang it, I would not marry {{one of these}} solemn fops; they are good for nothing, but to make cuckolds.

60|$|We are all {{at peace}} and happy now, but {{whenever}} my thoughts {{fly back to}} that morning, whenever the ears of memory recall those hideous yells of fury and of hate, coupled with the equally horrible cries for pity, which pierced through the walls behind which the six of us were crouching, trembling, <b>and</b> praying, <b>whenever</b> <b>I</b> think of it all my heart still beats violently with that same nameless dread which held it in its deathly grip then.|$|R
