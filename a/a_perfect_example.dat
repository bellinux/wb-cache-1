Jerry Falwell was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

Temple of Goddess Stambeswari at Asurgarh, built during 500 AD, is <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> where the first brick Temple in Eastern India was built. Sanskritization in Odisha was first started from Kalahandi, Koraput region, ancient Mahakantara region. Earliest flat-roofed stone temple of Odisha was built at Mohangiri in Kalahandi during 600 AD. Temple architecture achieved perfection at Belkhandi in Kalahandi and then traversed to Ekamra, present Bhubaneswar, along with the political expansion of the Somavamsis during the 1000–1100 AD.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting the seam is {{not as easy as}} it sounds. The seam has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger {{at the time of the}} delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smith is also {{responsible}} {{for the majority of}} the band's lyrics, which are written in a cryptic fractured form of English alternately hailed as poetic or nonsensical. He has generally refused to discuss their content, preferring to keep the words and their inspirations shrouded in mystique and allowing for fan interpretations. Smith has also sometimes employed a cut-up lyrical approach drawing on the works of (among others), William Blake, Charles Kingsley, William Shakespeare and T.S. Eliot. Two favourite cut-and-paste sources are Pedro Carolino’s English As She Is Spoke (a failed Victorian English-Portuguese phrasebook once hailed by Mark Twain as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> of absurdity) and the nineteenth-century Irish poet George Darley. Fans have also spotted references to the films The Night of the Hunter and Eraserhead in Smith's words and music videos.|$|E

25|$|As {{one of the}} World's {{great powers}} {{together}} with Great Britain, France did not only exercise its influence by conquest {{but also by the}} prestige of its military. At the height of European colonial expansion in the 19th century, France's army and Britain's navy were each regarded as the most powerful forces ever on land and at sea. This lead many a military to copy both powers' military and naval cultures. As most navies in the World adopted the British naval looks (double-breasted navy blue jacket and peaked cap for officer, blue jean collar for ratings, etc.), numerous land armies adopted French-inspired uniforms during the 1860s and 1870s (both Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War, the Chilean Army of the War of the Pacific, the Russian Imperial Army, etc.) and even sometimes imported types of French units (e.g. Zouave regiments). France's influence on military fashion dimmed for the time being after the most unexpected French defeat ending the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 and many armies then changed to adopt Prussian military style (as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> of this trend, Chilean soldiers traded their kepis for pickelhauben).|$|E
25|$|Now the {{unexpected}} number one {{contender for the}} heavyweight crown held by Jim Braddock, Schmeling looked forward to his chance to regain the title as first Heavyweight ever, scheduled for that September. The fight was postponed, however, when Braddock injured his hand in training. Rumors existed that the fight's organizers were stalling, afraid of the negative publicity that would be generated over a perceived Nazi getting {{a shot at the}} world's title. When it was confirmed that Braddock's managers were in talks with the Louis camp, the New York Commission officially released an order for Braddock to fight Schmeling for the title. Any other fight, with Louis or otherwise, would not be recognized by New York as being for the championship. The Madison Square Garden Corporation, the largest promotional company in the sport at the time, even attempted to get a legal injunction against a Braddock-Louis fight (Louis was not on their roster). Nonetheless, in February 1937, Schmeling received the news that the champion had indeed signed to defend his championship against Louis. A furious Schmeling protested, but to no avail, and he was forced to watch from ringside as Louis knocked Braddock out and gained the championship. Sorely disappointed and convinced that he would never receive his chance at redemption, Schmeling fought just once more in America, an eighth-round knockout of future contender Harry Thomas, before returning to Germany. In his native land, Schmeling was regarded as a hero and promoted by the Nazi propaganda machine as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> of German supremacy over {{the rest of the world}} by virtue of his defeat of the current champion, Louis. The government ordered parades and rallies in his honor. He became a friend to Hitler and other powerful figures in the government and also a popular subject of newspaper articles and films. He continued to press for a chance at a rematch with Louis and in the meantime padded his record against overmatched fighters Ben Foord and Steve Dudas.|$|E
500|$|More favorably, Aaron Sagers of the {{newspaper}} The Morning Call saw Gravemind as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> of a trend in pop culture called a [...] "frenemy". A frenemy, according to Sagers, is a friend or rival [...] "with whom [...] feuds; an individual who reinvigorates the sense of self-worth and drives up one's visibility in the public's eye." [...] Gravemind, operating as a frenemy, served to personify the Master Chief's otherwise nebulous fight against the Flood. Will Prusik of PlanetXbox360 listed the Flood {{as one of the}} great video game aliens, and that the revelation of a central Flood intelligence was a good idea despite the Gravemind's resemblance to Audrey II.|$|E

The Michigan Daily Eric Chiu said [...] "Hosts Blumenfeld and Seidell {{do what they can}} with their material, but their banter and commentary is mostly forgettable", and [...] "the Prank War series on CollegeHumor.com is <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> of discomforting gags done right...It's a shame that Pranked can't muster up anything near the same level of ingenuity." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly reviewers Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and graded {{it with a}} C, stating [...] "Although neat for its {{parallel}} plotting and George's hilariously clueless career chats with Jerry, 'The Revenge' is not so sweet". IGN critic Andy Patrizio considered [...] "The Revenge" [...] one of his personal favorites of season two. The scene in which Kramer struggles to put cement {{in one of the}} washing machines has gained positive responses from critics. Margery Eagan of The Boston Globe cited the scene as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> of Kramer's personality. Neal Justin of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune also considers the scene {{to be one of the}} show's [...] "classic moments". Daily News of Los Angeles critic Jody Leader also praised Seinfeld for how he distracted Vic in the scene.|$|E

[...] Additionally, the Byrds gave William Bell's Stax hit, [...] "You Don't Miss Your Water", a country flavored make-over, highlighted by the band's trademark crystal clear harmonies and contributions from JayDee Maness and Earl P. Ball, on pedal steel guitar and honky-tonk piano respectively.

500|$|According to Rayfield, [...] "'The Student' is <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> in {{miniature}} of Chekhov's art, and it bridges {{the gap between}} the ecstatic mood of the [...] and steppe stories of 1886–7 and the lyricism of the prose of the 1900s." [...] "'The Student' is only a few pages long, but it is a story of extraordinary economy, beauty, and power", wrote James N. Loehlin. He continued that the story [...] "not only describes the power of narrative to evoke spiritual truth, it embodies it". Kerry McSweeney wrote that Ivan's revelation at the story's end may also provide a similar feeling of epiphany to the reader, writing that [...] "What is central is the continuing power of Chekhov's artwork to establish connections–to forge new links in a living chain that is not vertical, timeless, and sacred but horizontal, temporal and secular." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hell Is Other Robots" [...] lampoons drug {{addiction}} and religious conversion. In the DVD commentary for the episode, David X.

Cohen noted that Bender's addiction is <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> of something they could do with a robot character which they could not get away with had it been a human character. One person at the studio refused to work on this episode because they did not agree with the portrayal of some of the religious content. Cohen also noted that the writing team had begun to loosen up during this episode, which gave it a feel similar to the series' later episodes. Kaplan claimed that before editing, there was enough material to make a three-part episode.|$|E
