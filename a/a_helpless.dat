5|$|Some {{studies of}} older {{children}} have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behavior in infancy can {{develop into a}} child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organized, but the behaviour is treated by researchers {{as a form of}} 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organized according to parenting authority.|$|E
5|$|When Venkatapathy asks Ramana {{to marry}} Chitti, he refuses and foregoes the wealth he is {{entitled}} to inherit in exchange for Ammadu and their newborn son. Govindayya asks Venkatapathy to marry Chitti and Chukkalamma protests, reuniting Chitti and Bheemudu. <b>A</b> <b>helpless</b> Govindayya is confronted by Viyyanna, who threatens to use his influence as {{a president of the}} panchayat to have him arrested if he does not reform himself. Govindayya begs pardon and flees with his family. The film ends with everyone present in Ramana's house, laughing maniacally.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E

5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, and again the Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2004, Trisha {{played the}} role of <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> girl a kabaddi player tries to save from a corrupt {{politician}} who wants to marry her in Ghilli. It was a major commercial success. She appeared in Mani Ratnam's political drama Aaytha Ezhuthu (2004), starring as part of an ensemble cast that included Siddharth, R. Madhavan and Suriya. The Telugu romantic comedy Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana (2005) featured Trisha as a village girl and was a commercial success. It earned her another Filmfare Award and her first Nandi Award for Best Actress. She reprised the role in the Tamil remake Unakkum Enakkum (2006) which was also successful. Selvaraghavan's Telugu film Aadavari Matalaku Arthale Verule (2007) won Trisha her third Filmfare Award. The same year she featured opposite Ajith Kumar in A. L. Vijay's Kireedam, a box office success. In 2008, her releases Bheemaa and Kuruvi both failed commercially, while Abhiyum Naanum and Krishna earned her Filmfare nominations for Best Actress in the Tamil and Telugu categories respectively.|$|E

25|$|According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, Eos consorted {{with the}} war god Ares and was thereupon cursed with unsatisfiable sexual desire by the jealous Aphrodite. This caused her to abduct a number of {{handsome}} young men, most notably Cephalus, Tithonus, Orion, and Cleitus. The good-looking Cleitus was made immortal by her. She also asked for Tithonus to be made immortal, but forgot to ask for eternal youth, which resulted in him living forever as <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> old man.|$|E

25|$|Valenzuela works. Dr. Pío Valenzuela was {{a medical}} doctor by profession. In 1896, during the first {{publication}} of Kalayaan, Valenzuela assisted Bonifacio and Jacinto in editing the newspaper. He also wrote Catuiran? (Is it Fair?), which described the cruelties of the Spanish priest and civil guards of San Francisco del Monte (now in Quezon City) on <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> village lieutenant. He also collaborated with Bonifacio in writing the article Sa Mga Kababayan (To my Countrymen), an essay addresses to the motherland. His nom-de-plume was Madlang-Away.|$|E

25|$|Scipione {{followed}} his father shortly afterwards and the eldest sibling Marcantonio then took over power in Favale. Isabella {{grew up in}} a hostile family environment, with <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> mother and brothers who were uncouth, unruly and brutish. She was deeply affected by the sudden departure of her father, which tormented her {{for the rest of her}} life. She was given a tutor who guided her in the study of Petrarch and Latin poets, and was probably the only person with whom she could talk about literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{countess of}} Bedford wrote “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” in {{response}} to Donne’s first elegy that characterized Death as a gluttonous monster. In the poem, she refers to Donne’s Holy Sonnet 10, which starts with the famous line, “Death be not proud.” Russell argues that Donne’s interpretation of Death was more accurate in this Holy Sonnet instead of in his elegy. She says that Death is something {{that should not be}} proud, and that Donne’s elegy gave Death too much credit. As a Christian, Boulstred went to Heaven when she died, and Donne did not give Boulstred enough credit when he characterized her as <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> victim of Death in his elegy. After this criticism, Donne wrote his second elegy for Boulstred, focusing on Boulstred’s virtues instead of on Death.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{authorities}} believed {{until the}} last minute that the worst could be avoided, and as such urged the populace to stay home with buckets of water, so as to be prepared to extinguish any fire and prevent its spread. So feeble a means of stopping the fire quickly proved useless, and the panicked residents tried to save their most precious belongings and fled to the heights of the city, east of the Senne valley. <b>A</b> <b>helpless</b> crowd watched the fire from the park at the ducal palace. By the middle of the night, the entire heart of the city was aflame, including the stone buildings of the Grand Place and its surroundings, the Town Hall, abandoned by the authorities and whose spire was being used as a target by the French artillery, the Breadhouse, the Récollet convent and the Church of Saint Nicholas, whose bell fell on and crushed the neighbouring houses. Max Emmanuel, who had hastily returned from Namur with several troops, tried in vain to organize an effective resistance against the inferno and to maintain order.|$|E

25|$|When they arrive, Yzma {{is already}} there. Pacha has his family delay Yzma, giving he and Kuzco {{a head start}} back to the capital. They find Yzma's secret lab and {{numerous}} transformation potions including one to return one to human, but Yzma and Kronk arrive shortly thereafter. Yzma orders Kronk to kill the pair, but he refuses to, and she drops him through a trap door and orders her guards to capture them. Pacha grabs a handful of vials and he and Kuzco flee, trying the various vials during their flight to find the one. As they are cornered on the ledges of a giant wall structure, they find they are down to two vials. Yzma chases them, knocking away the vials. She grabs one and drinks it, planning on becoming a large creature to kill them, but instead transforms into <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> kitten. Pacha and Kuzcu use teamwork to reach the other vial before Yzma, and though she grabs it first, she is knocked off the wall by a wall panel suddenly opened by Kronk, who found {{his way out of}} the trap door. Kuzco recovers the vial and drinks it.|$|E
25|$|In 454 Aetius was {{personally}} {{stabbed to death}} by Valentinian, who was himself murdered by the dead general's supporters a year later. (Valentinian) thought he had slain his master; he found that he had slain his protector: and he fell <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> victim to the first conspiracy which was hatched against his throne. A rich senatorial aristocrat, Petronius Maximus, who had encouraged both murders, then seized the throne. He broke the engagement between Huneric, prince of the Vandals, and Princess Eudocia, and had time to send Avitus {{to ask for the}} help of the Visigoths in Gaul before the Vandals sailed to Italy. Petronius was unable to muster any effective response and was killed by a mob as he tried to flee the city. The Vandals entered Rome, and plundered it for two weeks. Despite the shortage of money for the defence of the state, considerable private wealth had accumulated since the previous sack in 410. The Vandals sailed away with large amounts of treasure and also with the Princess Eudocia, who became the wife of one Vandal king and the mother of another.|$|E

500|$|He {{was interviewed}} by Det Sgt van Thal and Det Insp John Kennedy on ten {{occasions}} {{over a period of}} four days. He made several incriminating statements during the interviews, at first admitting he had thrown stones, then during the second interview saying he had seen the attack on Blakelock. During the third, he said he had spoken to Silcott about the murder, and that Silcott owned a hammer with a hook on one side. After the fifth interview he was charged with affray, and during the sixth he described the attack on Blakelock: [...] "It was like you see in a film, <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> man with dogs on him. It was just like that, it was really quick." [...] He did not sign this interview, Rose writes, and after it he vomited.|$|E
500|$|Marseille's {{impact on}} Allied fighter pilots and their morale is unclear. Andrew Thomas quoted Pilot Officer Bert Houle of No. 213 Squadron RAF; [...] "He was an {{extremely}} skilled pilot and a deadly shot. It was <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> feeling to be continually bounced, {{and to do so}} little about it." [...] Robert Tate, on the other hand, is skeptical Allied pilots would have been familiar, asking, [...] "How well was Marseille known to DAF personnel in the Desert? Apparently not so well. Although there is little indication that some Allied pilots may have heard of Marseille, this information did not readily make its way down to Allied Squadrons. Fanciful stories abound of how pilots knew of one another and hoped to duel with each other in the skies. This was more than likely not the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Night (1960) {{is a work}} by Elie Wiesel {{about his}} {{experience}} with his father in the Nazi German concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald in 1944–1945, {{at the height of}} the Holocaust toward the end of the Second World War. In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about the death of God and his own increasing disgust with humanity, reflected in the inversion of the parent–child relationship, as his father declines to <b>a</b> <b>helpless</b> state and Wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver. [...] "If only I could get rid of this dead weight...Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever." [...] In Night everything is inverted, every value destroyed.
