50|$|Because {{of their}} shorter life cycle, cotton thistle plants can be {{effectively}} treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments {{should be applied}} at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very effective on seedlings and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. Onopordum spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and reinfestation is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. Picloram, dicamba, 2,4-D, dicamba + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling Cotton Thistle. Clopyralid is more selective for controlling plants in the Asteraceae family, but will also injure or kill legumes.|$|E

50|$|This plant {{produces}} a usually erect stem with several curving branches {{up to about}} 25 centimeters (10 in) tall. It has a taproot reaching up to half a meter deep in the soil and many lateral roots. The branches are lined with narrow, fleshy, blue-green leaves each up to about 2 centimeters long tipped with stiff bristles. The inflorescences are located all along the stem branches next to the leaves. Each inflorescence is a small cluster of tiny bisexual and female-only flowers accompanied by waxy bracts. The winged, membranous flowers surround the developing fruit, which is all that remains on the plant when it is ripe, the leaves and flower parts having fallen away. The fruit is a pale cylindrical utricle. The plant produces large amounts of seeds, which are dispersed by many vehicles, including human activity, animals (including ants), water flow, wind, and by being carried on the dry plant when it breaks off at ground level and rolls away as a tumbleweed. The seeds have the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> within one hour after being exposed to water.|$|E
50|$|Beatrix Potter was {{interested}} in every branch of natural science save astronomy. Botany was a passion for most Victorians and nature study was a popular enthusiasm. Potter was eclectic in her tastes: collecting fossils, studying archeological artefacts from London excavations, and interested in entomology. In all these areas she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s her scientific interests centred on mycology. First drawn to fungi because of their colours and evanescence in nature and her delight in painting them, her interest deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in Perthshire in 1892. He helped improve the accuracy of her illustrations, taught her taxonomy, and supplied her with live specimens to paint during the winter. Curious as to how fungi reproduced, Potter began microscopic drawings of fungus spores (the agarics) and in 1895 developed a theory of their germination. Through the connections of her uncle Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe, a chemist and vice-chancellor of the University of London, she consulted with botanists at Kew Gardens, convincing George Massee of her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> spores and her theory of hybridisation. She {{did not believe in}} the theory of symbiosis proposed by Simon Schwendener, the German mycologist, as previously thought; rather she proposed a more independent process of reproduction.|$|E
40|$|The onset and {{development}} of both the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> and to tolerate rapid enforced desiccation were investigated during the development and maturation of seeds of bean {Phaseolus vulgaris L.) at different temperatures and also after different slow-drying treatments. The onset of germinability occurred when seeds were less than half-filled {{in the absence of}} both a post-ovule abscission programme and water loss from the seeds. Maximum <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> normally and maximum tolerance to rapid enforced desiccation to 14 - 16 % moisture content did not occur until 2 - 23 d and 6 - 23 d after mass maturity (end of the seedfilling period), respectively. The slow-drying of immature seeds for 7 d ex planta before rapid enforced desiccation increased the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> and stimulated the onset of desication tolerance. Holding seeds moist for 7 d (during which time moisture content declined by < 5 %) had similar effects, but seed germination after rapid enforced desiccation was consistently greater in seeds first dried slowly than held moist. Comparisons between seeds less than halffilled dried slowly ex planta and full seeds undergoing maturation drying in planta showed that a similar (slow) rate of water loss over a 7 d period had a similar effect on the subsequent ability of seeds to tolerate rapid enforced desiccation. Thus, neither a post-ovule abscission programme nor loss of water were required for the onset of the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> in developing bean seeds, but both were required {{for the development of the}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> and resistance to solute leakage, when rehydrated, after rapid enforced desiccation.

The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> withstand salt as an established plant may require different mechanisms and plant traits than those needed <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> in salty soils. Seeds establishing themselves in high salt content may respond differently depending on the light conditions and seed germinability at the time of salty water imbibition.

The objectives of this paper are to determine the effect of salt (NaCl) in water imbibed by S. faberi seed during after-ripening and germination, as well temperature and light. Observations made also provide insights on the possible relationship between salt and drought tolerance. Seed germination of all phenotypes inhibited by two percent or more of NaCl. The effects of lesser amounts of NaCl on each of the three phenotypes was highly dependent on the specific temperature and light conditions.

Sucrose decreased greatly at 30 °C and increased again at 40 °C. Raffinose and stachyose contents were higher in ungerminated seed. In germinated seed, raffinose and stachyose contents were found only in cotyledon tissues at 10 °C. Peroxidase activities was affected by cultivars, type of tissue and temperature.

40|$|Background and Aims Short {{periods of}} extreme {{temperature}} may affect wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seed weight, but also quality. Temporal sensitivity to extreme temperature during seed development and maturation was investigated. Methods Plants of cv.

Seed samples were harvested serially and moisture content, weight, <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate,</b> subsequent longevity in air-dry storage, and bread-making quality determined. Key Results High temperature (34 / 20 °C) reduced final seed weight, with greatest temporal sensitivity at 7 - 14 or 14 - 21 DAA. Several aspects of bread-making quality were also most sensitive to high temperature then, but whereas protein quality decreased protein and sulphur concentrations improved. Early exposure to high temperature provided earlier development of <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> and tolerate desiccation, but {{had little effect on}} maximum germination capacity. All treatments at 15 / 10 °C resulted in <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> declining between 58 and 65 DAA. Early exposure to high temperature hastened improvement in seed storage longevity, but the subsequent decline in late maturation preceded that in the control. Long (7 - 65 DAA) exposure to 15 / 10 °C disrupted the development of seed longevity, with no improvement after seed filling ended. Longevity improved during maturation drying in other treatments. Early (7 - 14 DAA) exposure to high reduced and low temperature increased subsequent longevity at harvest maturity, whereas late (35 - or 42 - 49 DAA) exposure to high increased and low temperature reduced it. Conclusions Temporal sensitivity to extreme temperature was detected. It varied considerably amongst the contrasting seed variables investigated. Subsequent seed longevity at harvest maturity responded negatively to temperature early in development, but positively later in development and throughout maturation...|$|E

40|$|Pulmonary {{exposure}} to Aspergillus fumigatus {{has been associated}} with morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. A. fumigatus conidia produce 2 -glucan, proteases, and other immunostimulatory factors upon germination. Murine models have shown that the ability of A. fumigatus <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> at physiological temperature may be an important factor that facilitates invasive disease. We observed a significant increase in IFN- 3 -producing CD 8 (+) T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of immunocompetent mice that repeatedly aspirated A. fumigatus conidia in contrast to mice challenged with A. versicolor, a species that is not typically associated with invasive, disseminated disease. Analysis of tissue sections indicated the presence of germinating spores in the lungs of mice challenged with A. fumigatus, but not A. versicolor. Airway IFN- 3 (+) CD 8 (+) T-cells were decreased and lung germination was eliminated in mice that aspirated A. fumigatus conidia that were formaldehyde-fixed or heat-inactivated. Furthermore, A. fumigatus particles exhibited greater persistence in the lungs of recipient mice when compared to non-viable A. fumigatus or A. versicolor, and this correlated with increased maintenance of airway memory-phenotype CD 8 (+) T cells. Therefore, murine airway CD 8 (+) T cell-responses to aspiration of Aspergillus conidia may be mediated in part by the <b>ability</b> of conidia <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> in the host lung tissue.

40|$|Acquisition of {{desiccation}} {{tolerance and}} the related changes at the cellular level in wheat (Triticum aestivum cv.

During normal development, the <b>ability</b> of embryos <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> after rapid drying and rehydration was acquired after completion of morphological development, which is {{a few days before}} mass maturity. The acquisition of desiccation tolerance, as assessed by germination, was associated with an upsurge in cytoplasmic viscosity, the onset of accumulation of protein and oil bodies, and the retention of membrane integrity upon dehydration/rehydration. These features were also used to assess cellular desiccation tolerance in the cases when germination could not occur. Slow premature drying was used to decouple the acquisition of cellular desiccation tolerance from morphogenesis. Upon premature drying of kernels on the ears of plants cut at 5 d after anthesis, desiccation-tolerant dwarf embryos were formed that were able <b>to</b> <b>germinate.</b> When plants were cut at earlier stages poorly developed embryos were formed that were unable <b>to</b> <b>germinate,</b> but cellular desiccation tolerance was nevertheless acquired. In such prematurely dried kernels, peripheral meristematic endosperm cells had already passed through similar physiological and ultrastructural changes associated with the acquisition of cellular desiccation tolerance.

The rate and extent of germination for both kinds of spores was proportional to the intrasporal manganese concentration.

We found three species that were promoted by smoke water: Coreopsis tinctoria, Salvia azurea, and Gutierrezia sarothrae. In this study, these species experienced either increased emergence (Gutierrezia sarothrae) or decreased germination time (Coreopsis tinctoria, Salvia azurea) when exposed to some (but not all) concentrations of smoke water.

In the case of Gutierezia sarothrae, a species that is native but often considered undesirable over much of the western US (Ralphs and McDaniel 2011), smoke treatments could stimulate mass germination, thereby depleting the seedbank of seeds of this plant (Adkins and Peters 2001). Emergent plants could then be treated mechanically or chemically to remove them from the landscape before they produce further seeds. Alternatively, smoke treatment could also be used to treat seeds of desirable species before sowing, perhaps increasing their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>germinate</b> when sowed under favorable conditions (Baxter and van Staden 1994).|$|R

Merr. cv Williams), pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Alaska), and corn (Zea mays L. cv Merit) axes. The loss of desiccation tolerance during imbibition was monitored by following the <b>ability</b> of seeds <b>to</b> <b>germinate</b> after desiccation following various periods of preimbibition and by following the rates of electrolyte leakage from dried, then rehydrated axes. Finally, we analyzed the soluble sugar contents of the axes throughout the transition from desiccation tolerance to intolerance. These analyses show that sucrose and larger oligosaccharides were consistently present during the tolerant stage, and that desiccation tolerance disappeared as the oligosaccharides were lost. The results support the idea that sucrose may serve as the principal agent of desiccation tolerance in these seeds, with the larger oligosaccharides serving to keep the sucrose from crystallizing...|$|R
