In 1905 a general <b>alphabetical</b> <b>classification</b> {{was introduced to}} the NSW Government Tramways.|$|E
50|$|Since 1950, the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>classification</b> of the Soviet league {{hierarchy}} has resumed. In 1960 through 1962 {{the league}} {{consisted of two}} groups with the better clubs qualified for the championship pool and less fortunate - the relegation pool.|$|E
5000|$|Its name {{derives from}} Old English , meaning [...] "wealth", [...] "money", and [...] "coin", {{which has been}} applied to these coins since the 17th century based on interpretations of the legal codes of Mercia and of Kent under its king Æthelberht. It is likely, however, that the coins were more often known to contemporaries as [...] "pennies" [...] (peningas), much like their {{successor}} silver coins. They are very diverse, organized into over a hundred numbered types derived from the British Museum Catalogue of the 1890s and by broader <b>alphabetical</b> <b>classifications</b> laid out by British numismatist Stuart Rigold in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|The NER Class A (LNER Class F8) was a {{class of}} 2-4-2 tank {{locomotives}} designed by Thomas William Worsdell and built at Gateshead works for the North Eastern Railway (NER). Sixty locomotives were built between 1886 and 1892. At this time the class was designated class A by the NER {{and was the first}} class in the company to be given an <b>alphabetical</b> letter <b>classification.</b>|$|R
50|$|The externat {{generally}} {{consists of}} four training courses per annum, three months each one in services of specialities, chosen by grids {{at the beginning of}} each year or quarter, either by classification with the merit, or by <b>alphabetical</b> <b>classification.</b> The training courses consist of five mornings per weeks in the services. Certain training courses are obligatory from the statutory texts (pediatrics, obstetric gynaecology surgery, internal medicine and emergency medicine.), and can then integrate theoretical teaching (the external one is then present at the hospital all the day). Conversely, certain services do not have the external ones, that depends on the agreements made with the university.|$|E
50|$|He {{is famous}} for his book Kitab Al-Ma'a (The Book of Water), which is a medical encyclopedia. that lists the names of diseases, its {{medicine}} and a physiological process or a treatment. It is the first known <b>alphabetical</b> <b>classification</b> of medical terms. In this encyclopedia, Ibn Al-Thahabi not only lists the names but adds numerous original ideas about {{the function of the}} human organs. Indeed, he explains an original idea of how the vision takes place. It also contains a course for the treatment psychological symptoms. The main thesis of his medication is that cure must start from controlled food and exercise and if it persists then use specific individual medicines if it still persists then use medical compounds. If the disease continued, surgery was performed.|$|E
40|$|Few {{conditions}} demonstrate theadvances in neonatal surgery {{more clearly}} than the management of oesophageal atresia (OA). Although this condition was first described in the literature in 16701, {{it was not until}} 1941 that the first successful primary repair was achieved 2. By the 1960 s survival figures of 60 - 70 % were reported, and currently survival rates of> 90 % are routine. However, the treatment of OA still poses some challenges. This article outlines the anatomy, aetiology, diagnosis and clinical presentation, investigation, initial management, surgical treatment, complications and finally outcome and prognosis of this condition. Anatomy and classification An atresia is defined as ‘a congenital absence of a body opening or body passage’ 3. OA occurs in between 1 in 3500 and 1 in 4500 live births in the UK 4 and has a slight male predominance 5. It can occur in isolation, but is more commonly associated with an abnormal connection between the oesophagus and trachea, a tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF). Different anatomical configurations of OA and TOF arise and numerous different numerical and <b>alphabetical</b> <b>classification</b> systems have been described 6 - 8. However, the most helpful classification in practice is a purely descriptive one consisting of 5 main sub-types (see FIGURE 1) : OA with distal TOF OA with proximal fistula OA with both proximal and distal TOF Isolated OA Isolated TOF – also termed the ‘H-type fistula ’ due to the anatomical shape of this configuration. Associated abnormalities As with many neonatal surgical conditions, Oesophageal atresia Oesophageal atresia (OA) occurs in about 1 in 4500 live births in the UK. Over 50 % of infants with this condition will also have other congenital abnormalities. The management of this condition has advanced considerably over the past 30 years, resulting in good outcomes in many of these patients. However, the treatment of OA still presents challenges. This article reviews different aspects of this condition...|$|E
