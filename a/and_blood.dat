5|$|In {{the ninth}} century, Hrabanus Maurus and Ratramnus also defended Augustine's view of non{{metabolic}} real presence.

The doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in the high Middle Ages to explain the change of the elements into Christ's body <b>and</b> <b>blood.</b> Transubstantiation is the belief that the Eucharistic elements are transformed into Christ's body <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> in a way only perceivable by the intellect, not by the senses.|$|E

5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> pressure.|$|E
5|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1524, Bucer {{concentrated}} on the main issue dividing leading reformers, the eucharist. In this dispute, he attempted to mediate between Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. The two theologians disagreed on whether the body <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> of Christ were physically present within the elements of bread and wine during {{the celebration of the}} Lord's Supper. Luther believed in a corporeal or physical real presence of Christ; and Zwingli believed Christ's body <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> where made present by the Holy Spirit. By late 1524, Bucer had abandoned the idea of corporeal real presence and, after some exegetical studies, accepted Zwingli's interpretation. However, he did not believe the Reformation depended on either position but on faith in Christ, other matters being secondary. In this respect he differed from Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity.

5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection.

In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the reproducibility and relationship with left ventricular mass index of home {{blood pressure in}} comparison with ambulatory <b>and</b> office <b>blood</b> pressures.

40|$|Blood is a {{significant}} evidence associated with forensic investigation as bloodstain pattern analysis helps establish specific events associated with crimes. The study involved the comparison of bloodstain patterns of real <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> synthetic <b>blood</b> on various solid matrices. Bloodstain appearance and dimensions were studied in terms of release height, directionality, angle of impact and area of impact. Results showed that shapes <b>and</b> sizes of <b>blood</b> drops differ as the heights of release, angles impact and surface matrices were changed, but there were only minor differences between real <b>and</b> synthetic <b>blood.</b> Sizes of blood drops increased with release height, but the increase was more pronounced for synthetic blood. The multiple impact sites, origin and point of divergence study on droplets of real <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> synthetic <b>blood</b> as determined using mathematical methods showed that for medium velocity droplets, synthetic blood gave higher angles. However, at high velocity, the angles were almost equal for both real <b>and</b> synthetic <b>blood.</b> For both real <b>and</b> synthetic <b>blood,</b> the angles were approximately 17 o- 43 o for all sides, except for {{the center of the}} high velocity droplets which were 90 o...|$|R
