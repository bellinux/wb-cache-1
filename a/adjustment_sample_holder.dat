40|$|The <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> for the MSL- 1 {{mission of}} TEMPUS were developed, {{manufactured}} and {{tested in the}} framework of this Experiment Support Project. Three <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> types for the different experiment classed were developed: <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> with a horizontal slit for the radial observation of strongly evaporating <b>samples,</b> <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> with crossed slits for the observation of the nucleation front motion and cage <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> for weakly evaporating samples for which a good radial observation was of special importance. In a prototype test program <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> were build from different materials. Tests were performed with these prototypes, e. g. thermal shock tests with liquid sample materials at temperatures of up to 2000 C, vibration tests and tests of the coupling of the <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> to the RF fields of the leviation coils. As a result, silicon nitride was selected as the material for the flight <b>sample</b> <b>holders.</b> After the Design Review <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> were custom made for each of the flight experiments. In addition, a Ti-sample was integrated into a <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> which was used as a sublimation pump during the mission. The <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> were cleaned and shipped for sample integration to the Kennedy Space Center in special transport containers in an ultrapure noble gas atmosphere. In addition, parameter sets were developed for the new subsystems Residual Gas Analyzer and Active Sample Oscillation Damping. The parameter set development at DLR as well as the operation of the TEMPUS Development Model at DLR was supported by Dornier. (orig.)

40|$|The {{promise of}} a vast source of energy to power the world and protect our planet using fusion {{technology}} has been the driving force for scientists and engineers around the globe for more than sixty years. Although the materialization of this ideal still in the distance, multiple scientific and technological advances have been accomplished, which have brought commercial fusion power closer to a reality {{than it has ever}} been. As part of the collaborative effort in the pursuit of realizable fusion energy, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is being developed by a coalition of nations of which the United States is a part of. One critical technological challenge for ITER is the development of adequate plasma facing materials (PFMs) that can withstand the strenuous conditions of operation. To date, high heat flux (HHF) testing has been conducted mainly on non-irradiated specimens due to the difficulty of working with radioactive specimens, such as instrument contamination. In this thesis, the new Irradiated Material Target Station (IMTS) facility for fusion materials at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), in which the HHFs are provided by water-wall plasma-arc lamps (PALs), is considered for neutron-irradiated specimens, especially tungsten. The facility is being used to test irradiated plasma-facing components materials for magnetic fusion reactors as part of the US-Japan plasma facing components evaluation by tritium plasma, heat and neutron irradiation experiments (PHENIX). In order to conduct HHF testing on the PFMs various <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> designs were developed to accommodate radioactive specimens during HHF testing. As part of the effort to design <b>sample</b> <b>holders</b> that are compatible with the IMTS facility, numerical simulations were performed for different water-cooled <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> designs with the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package, ANSYS™ FLUENT®. The numerical models are validated against experimental temperature measurements obtained from the IMTS facility. These experimentally validated numerical models are used to assess the thermal performance of two <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> designs and establish safe limits for HHF testing under various operating conditions. The limiting parameter for the current configuration was determined for each <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> design. For the Gen 1 <b>sample</b> <b>holder,</b> the maximum temperature reached within the Copper rod limits the allowable incident heat flux to about 6 MW/m². In the case of the Gen 2 <b>sample</b> <b>holder,</b> the maximum temperature reached within the Molybdenum clamping disk limits the allowable incident heat flux to about 5 MW/m². In addition, the numerical model are used to parametrically investigate the effect of the operating pressure, mass flow rate, and incident heat flux on the local heat flux distributions and peak surface temperatures. Finally, a comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages associated with the main design modifications between the two <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> models as to evaluate their impact in the overall thermal performance of each <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> in order to provide conclusive recommendations for future <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> designs.

To create more reliable measurements with higher precision a new <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> has been constructed. To make the efficiency measurement possible a so called solar simulator is used. The solar simulator illuminates the solar cell and this measurement requires that the temperature of the solar cell is constant.

40|$|The {{nuclear testing}} {{facilities}} {{all around the}} world which perform irradiation experiment sometime use sodium inside the experiment itself to enhance thermal heat transfer. Nowadays, the development of sodium technologies for the Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR) requires new easiest methodologies to be able to characterise all aspects related to the use of Sodium. Usually, the level of Sodium inside a sealed metallic <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> is checked with X-ray but sometime, especially if the sodium to detect is not so much, there could be some troubles finding its exact level. The problems, checking the level of the sodium with X-ray, are {{due to the fact that}} the opacity of thin layer of Sodium can be not easily recognised. Moreover, a check on the volume of sodium inserted can not always be sufficient to establish the exact level of the sodium inserted due to the geometrical complexity of the devices contained in the metallic <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> and generally it is used as double check when the exact level of the sodium is recognised with the use of X-ray. The needed to establish the exact level of sodium inserted in a metallic <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> came from an experiment which has been recently performed at the High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten. The name of the experiment was HELIOS and it was dealing with the irradiation of U-free fuels containing americium. The X-ray performed on the <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> containing HELIOS shows immediately the difficulty to see, among the other things contained in the <b>sample</b> <b>holder,</b> the exact level of the sodium inserted. Hence, it started an investigation to find out other easy and cheap methods that, together with X-Ray, can help the detection of the level of sodium. In fact the availability of other easy and cheap methods based on different physical phenomena, although can be affected by the same problems encountered with the X-Ray, can be useful to confirm the exact level of the sodium inside a metallic <b>sample</b> <b>holder.</b> A round robin test has been prepared with a dummy metallic <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> filled with an unknown amount of Sodium. The paper will contains the background of the methodology that could be employed as well as the description of the experiments performed in order to establish the level of the sodium inside a dummy sealed stainless steel <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> filled with an unknown amount of Sodium. An original, easy and cheap methodology will be described. It should be mentioned that a deep investigation using ultrasonic device has not been performed because considered obviously useful and the natural alternative to the X-Ray methods. Other methodologies have been investigated because considered much easier and less expensive. JRC. DDG. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R

Experiments that focused on several controllable lapping parameters were performed to determine to what extent they affected the process. It was determined that the MRR can be modeled with the Preston equation under certain ranges of pressure and speed. It was also found that using a hard and rigid <b>sample</b> <b>holder</b> produces higher MRRs than soft and flexible <b>sample</b> <b>holders.</b> The results have also shown that MRRs in excess of 300 micrometers per hour can be achieved while using 10 grams of diamond abrasive per PDC per hour of lapping.
