"In my last lecture I {{endeavored}} {{to present the}} destructive side of present social theories as little as possible; to dwell more on the keen desire of the modern thinkers for constructive imagination. But I judge that I was regarded as too destructive, which amuses me, and to which I shall apply the antidote of showing how destructive modern thought is and must be--whether running with sootily smoking torch of individuality in Bakunin, or hissing in Nietzsche, or laughing at Olympus in Bernard Shaw. My 'radicalism' has been spoken of. Radical! Do you realize that I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> that there might possibly some day be a revolution in America, but rather that now I am stating that there is, this minute, and for some years has been, an actual state of warfare between capital and labor? Do you know that daily more people are saying openly and violently that we starve our poor, we stuff our own children with useless bookishness, and work the children of others in mills and let them sell papers {{on the streets in}} red-light districts at night, and thereby prove our state nothing short of insane? If you tell me that there is no revolution because there are no barricades, I point to actual battles at Homestead, Pullman, and the rest. If you say that there has been no declaration of war, open war, I shall read you editorials from The Appeal to Reason.|$|E

5000|$|I am not sure, however, if {{everyone}} noticed the distinction I drew between Santiniketan {{as an art}} movement and Santiniketan as a school very clearly. There was both a Santiketan movement and a Santiniketan school, but these are two different things. The movement was shaped by the practices of the masters, chiefly Nandalal, Benodebehari, Ramkinkar and Rabindranath. Their art practices were interrelated but did not stylistically converge. They were linked more by concerns and as participants in a discourse to which each contributed in a different manner. They themselves saw this very clearly but many who wrote about them did not. They either plumped for Nandalal and Benodebehari, or for Ramkinkar and Rabindranath; one pair representing a traditionalist position {{and the other a}} modernist position. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> that there are no differences between them but that they saw themselves as co-authors of an art scene being essayed around shared issues, complementing each other and expanding their concerns and reach rather than at war with each other.

5000|$|... "The first {{question}} is this: does liberation theology invite me {{to engage in a}} war, and indeed, in a class war, the ugliest kind of strife known, where humanity most quickly and surely becomes inhuman? Perhaps that is not the meaning of the invitation; but unless I am totally bereft of my wits, my mail and certain publications contain invitations to watch over the garments of those who throw stones, to put it mildly. These are invitations to support political activities with purposes which cannot be realistically achieved without violence, and a violence which will be carried on without quarter until the extermination of the enemies. Possibly I ask no more than a moderation of rhetoric. Revolutions have always fed upon inflated rhetoric. If one reads the rhetoric of the rebellious colonies of North America in 1776, one would never suspect that the rebellion was a coalition of oligarchs, the slave traders and the rumrunners of Boston and the slave-owning planters of Virginia. These wealthy middle-class gentlemen were hardly those who claims were being forged on the plains of Boston. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> an analogy, merely pointing out that one learns to be skeptical about revolutionary rhetoric. It all sounds very much alike; and if it can make George Washington and John Adams victims of an oppressive tyrant, it could sell refrigerators to Eskimos." [...] Source, page 109 ...|$|E

5000|$|Among the most-commonly cited of Pinter's {{comments}} {{on his own}} work are his remarks about two kinds of silence ("two silences"), including his objections to [...] "that tired, grimy phrase 'failure of communication'," [...] as defined in his speech to the National Student Drama Festival in Bristol in 1962, incorporated in his published version of the speech entitled [...] "Writing for the Theatre": There are two silences. One when no word is spoken. The other when perhaps a torrent of language is being employed. This speech is speaking of a language locked beneath it. That is its continual reference. The speech we hear {{is an indication of}} that which we don't hear. It is a necessary avoidance, a violent, sly, anguished or mocking smoke screen which keeps the other in its place. When true silence falls we are still left with echo but are nearer nakedness. One way of looking at speech is {{to say that it is}} a constant stratagem to cover nakedness.We have heard many times that tired, grimy phrase: 'failure of communication' &hellip; and this phrase has been fixed to my work quite consistently. I believe the contrary. I think that we communicate only too well, in our silence, in what is unsaid, and that what takes place is a continual evasion, desperate rearguard attempts to keep ourselves to ourselves. Communication is too alarming. To enter into someone else's life is too frightening. To disclose to others the poverty within us is too fearsome a possibility.I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> that no character in a play can never say what he in fact means. Not at all. I have found that there invariably does come a moment when this happens, when he says something, perhaps, which he has never said before.
