5|$|Phase II: As {{the extent}} of the territories falling under Roman control {{expanded}} {{and the size of the}} forces increased, the soldiery gradually became salaried professionals. As a consequence, military service <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> (non-salaried) levels became progressively longer-term. Roman military units of the period were largely homogeneous and highly regulated. The army consisted of units of citizen infantry known as legions (Latin: legiones) as well as non-legionary allied troops known as auxilia. The latter were most commonly called upon to provide light infantry, logistical, or cavalry support.|$|E

The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.|$|E

5|$|The present civil {{services}} of India is mainly {{based on the}} pattern of the former Indian Civil Service of British India. The civil services were divided into two categories - covenanted and uncovenanted.
