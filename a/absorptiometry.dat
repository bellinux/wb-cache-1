25|$|A {{new type}} of {{assessment}} centre opened in 2014 to collect imaging data. The visits extended the initial dataset to include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brain and chest regions, whole body dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> (DXA) scan of bones and joints, ultrasound measurements of the carotid arteries and resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Initial data on 4,000 participants was released {{at the end of}} 2015 and it was planned to scan 100,000 participants between 2015 and 2020 or later.|$|E
25|$|Osteoporosis {{may be due}} {{to lower}} than normal bone mass and greater than normal bone loss. Bone loss {{increases}} after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. Not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> at the hip.|$|E
2500|$|Dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> (DEXA scan) is {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is {{less than or equal to}} 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30–40-year-old:58), healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a T-score. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age.:58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines: ...|$|E
2500|$|Osteoporosis is {{a disease}} of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density, {{increasing}} the likelihood of fractures. [...] Osteoporosis is defined in women by the World Health Organization as a bone mineral density of 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass, relative to the age and sex-matched average. This density is measured using dual energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> (DEXA), with the term [...] "established osteoporosis" [...] including {{the presence of a}} fragility fracture. Osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause, when it is called [...] "postmenopausal osteoporosis", but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications, specifically glucocorticoids. Osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs. For this reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture.|$|E

50|$|Dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> (DXA, {{previously}} DEXA) is a {{means of}} measuring bone mineral density (BMD). Two X-ray beams, with different energy levels, are aimed at the patient's bones. When soft tissue absorption is subtracted out, the BMD can be determined from the absorption of each beam by bone. Dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> is the most widely used and most thoroughly studied bone density measurement technology.|$|E

50|$|Since {{density is}} usually {{measured}} by the decrease {{in the amount of}} light which shines through a transparent film, it is also called <b>absorptiometry,</b> the measure of light absorption through the medium. The corresponding measuring device is called a densitometer (absorptiometer). The decadic (base-10) logarithm of the reciprocal of the transmittance is called the absorbance or density.|$|E

50|$|Dual X-ray <b>Absorptiometry</b> and Laser {{technique}} (DXL) in {{the area}} of bone density studies for osteoporosis assessment is an improvement to the DXA Technique, adding an exact laser measurement of the thickness of the region scanned.

50|$|The {{bone density}} scan {{is known as}} a dual energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> scan (DEXA or DXA scan). It is a very simple {{straightforward}} test, taking less than 15 minutes to perform.

50|$|CT is {{also used}} in {{osteoporosis}} studies and research alongside dual energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> (DXA). Both CT and DXA {{can be used to}} assess bone mineral density (BMD), which is used to indicate bone strength, however CT results do not correlate exactly with DXA (the gold standard of BMD measurement). CT is far more expensive, and subjects patients to much higher levels of ionizing radiation, so it is used infrequently.|$|E

A DEXA scan requires medical supervision by a radiologist and some consider it to be the new [...] "Gold Standard" [...] in body composition testing.

50|$|The outcome {{measure of}} obesity is usually either the gain {{of body weight}} or body fat. The body weight gain is {{quantified}} using {{the difference in the}} raw mass of the animal or in the Lee index (an index similar to the BMI in humans). The body fat gain is quantified either indirectly through the weight gain, or directly using dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry.</b> When studying effects of obesity on diabetes, a fasting blood sugar test is also done before and after the diet.|$|E
50|$|Consumer grade {{devices for}} {{measuring}} BIA {{have not been}} found to be sufficiently accurate for single measurement use, and are better suited for use to measure changes in body composition over time for individuals. Two-electrode foot-to-foot measurement is less accurate than 4-electrode (feet, hands) and eight-electrode measurement. Results for some four- and eight-electrode instruments tested found poor limits of agreement and in some cases systematic bias in estimation of visceral fat percentage, but good accuracy in the prediction of resting energy expenditure (REE) when compared with more accurate whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometry</b> (DXA).|$|E
50|$|The body {{consists}} of three main components: bone mineral, lean soft tissue (skin, blood, water and skeletal muscle) and adipose tissue (fat and yellow bone marrow). These different components have different x-ray attenuating properties.The standard in bone mineral density scanning developed in the 1980’s is called Dual X-ray <b>Absorptiometry,</b> known as DXA. The DXA technique uses two different x-ray energy levels to estimate bone density. DXA scans assume a constant relationship between the amounts of lean soft tissue and adipose tissue. This assumption leads to measurement errors, with an impact on accuracy as well as precision.|$|E
