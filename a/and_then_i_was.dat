A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here?

I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tired of playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around.

500|$|Valene's storyline in {{her first}} two episodes on Dallas focuses on the {{rebuilding}} of her relationship with estranged ex-husband Gary Ewing. When Valene arrives in Texas to find her daughter, Lucy Ewing, she is brought back into {{the drama of the}} Ewing family. Upon arrival, she is reunited with Gary with whom she slowly falls back in love. Once Dallas became a hit, series creator David Jacobs proceeded to launch a spin-off series titled Knots Landing, which would feature Valene and Gary prominently. The actress had strong input on how they would create her character outline. She recalled, [...] "I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E
500|$|Crane and Kauffman {{strongly}} envisioned Friends as {{an ensemble}} comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed {{the show as}} such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms {{at the time to}} be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are [...] "of equal importance." [...] As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because [...] "utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines." [...] Kauffman echoed [...] "that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage." [...] The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten– approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the [...] "Rachel" [...] and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, [...] "I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel do I have in me?’” However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.|$|E

[...] Fairy tales were also an inspiration: the bluesy [...] "Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum" [...] is titled after the trademark exclamation of the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk.|$|E

One of Mignogna's career goals was [...] "to record at all of the major places where dubbing is done." [...] He said he was [...] "the first ADV voice actor to record at Funimation in Dallas <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the first to go to New York". [...] He has also recorded in Los Angeles; he tried out for Bleach and received the part of Ikkaku Madarame. In non-anime productions, he voiced Qrow Branwen in the American web series RWBY.|$|E

Time passes, and Susie sees that her family is healing, which Susie refers to as [...] "the lovely bones" [...] that grew around her absence. As the film concludes, Susie finally enters Heaven, telling the audience: [...] "My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.

I was telling my Mom about it later, and I said I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like, [...] "Gotta go. Bye!"

2500|$|In October 1965, {{prior to}} the expiry of her option, Fox {{assigned}} Harrison as the date of studio attorney Harry E. Sokolov for the premiere of The Agony and the Ecstasy. She was selected as Sokolov's date because [...] "Harry was from Baltimore." [...] Sokolov was also chief executive assistant to Fox's Vice President in Charge of Production, Richard D. Zanuck. Harrison was excited, because it was her first premiere, and because the film co-starred Charlton Heston, who had been her idol since she had seen Ben-Hur. At the post-premiere party, which she attended with her studio-assigned date, Harrison was thrilled to meet her longtime idol, Heston, with whom she would soon co-star in Planet of the Apes. At the premiere, Harrison met Zanuck, who was Sokolov's boss. Zanuck, Harrison said later, was immediately [...] "smitten" [...] and fell [...] "madly in love" [...] with her, and she with him. [...] "That was during the 60-day period that I started dating Richard, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> signed to a seven-year contract." [...] Harrison's acting career, {{as well as her}} life, became inextricably intertwined with their subsequent relationship.|$|E
2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, {{he told me he had}} a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> back in time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm going to blow everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E
