50|$|Fuchsia tissue {{becomes so}} {{distorted}} {{as a result}} of gall mite infestation that affected plants fail to produce normal growth and flowers, which seriously impacts their horticultural amenity value. The mites are resistant to chemical treatments, because once symptoms are visible, the mites have already entered leaf and flower buds, which afford them protection. Products that contain abamectin or spirodiclofen provide some control, though repeated applications at four-day intervals may be necessary to break the mite life cycle. Insecticidal soap and horticultural oils can also be used, and <b>acephate</b> may provide control on susceptible Fuchsia cultivars. Some mites can be removed from plants by cutting off distorted tissue, though regrowth is likely to be recolonised. Trials in California showed that the best control was achieved by combining the removal of tissue with pesticide application. The options for biological control are also limited, though the predatory mite Amblyseius californicus might depress fuchsia gall mite populations.|$|E

Group C 1 was administered distilled water and served as pesticide vehicle control. Group T 1 (low dose) rats received 1 / 40 th ofLD 50, group T 2 (mid dose) received 1 / 20 th of LD 50 and group T 3 (high dose) received 1 / 10 th of LD 50 of <b>Acephate</b> suspended in distilled water for 28 days. The clinical symptoms were observed in high dose group i. e. T 3. The most common signs were sudden onset of depression, reduced feed intake, dullness, salivation and tremor (infew rats). While in mid dose <b>Acephate</b> treated group T 2, rats were dull and depressed. In low dose <b>Acephate</b> treated group T 1, no visible clinical signs of toxicity were observed. There was no statistically significant effect on body weight up to 3 rd week of experiment in <b>Acephate</b> treated groups. There was significant (p≤ 0. 05) decrease in mean live body weight in male and female rats treated with high dose of <b>Acephate</b> during the 4 th week of exposure as compared to control group.

For the four OPs, the EC 50 s were 7. 03 pM, 3. 17 pM, 10. 56 pM, and 309. 82 microM, respectively. The EC 50 for propoxur was 449. 90 pM. Reduction in AChE {{activity was}} directly related to an increase in immobility in all chemicals tested. However, the ratio between the EC 50 and the AChE median inhibiting concentration ranged from 0. 31 to 0. 90. A 50 % reduction in AChE activity generally was associated with detrimental effects on mobility. However, for <b>acephate,</b> high levels of AChE inhibition (70 %) were observed in very low concentrations and were not associated with immobility. In addition, increasing the concentration of <b>acephate</b> further had a slight negative effect on AChE activity but a strong detrimental effect on mobility. Binding sites other than AChE possibly are involved in <b>acephate</b> toxicity to D. magna. Our findings demonstrate different associations between AChE inhibition and toxicity when different chemicals are compared. Therefore, the value of using AChE activity as a biomarker in D. magna will be dependent on the chemical tested...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do presente trabalho foi estudar a toxicidade de abamectin, <b>acephate,</b> azoxystrobin, benomyl, chlorfenapyr, imibenconazole, iprodion, {{metalaxyl}} + mancozeb e triforine para adultos de Orius insidiosus (Say). Os produtos foram utilizados nas concentrações indicadas pelos fabricantes e/ou que estão em fase de pesquisa para o controle de pragas e doenças na cultura do crisântemo, sendo aplicados em adultos por meio de torre de Potter. Os bioensaios foram realizados em laboratório, sob temperatura de 25 ± 2 ºC, umidade relativa de 70 ± 10 % e fotofase de 12 horas. A toxicidade dos produtos para adultos foi determinada pela porcentagem do efeito total (E%), levando-se em consideração a taxa de mortalidade e redução de oviposição, sendo, ainda, classificados segundo escala proposta por membros da IOBC. Abamectin, <b>acephate</b> e chlorfenapyr são tóxicos a adultos de O. insidiosus, provocando redução na sua sobrevivência. Fêmeas adultas de O. insidiosus tratadas com abamectin e <b>acephate</b> têm a viabilidade de seus ovos reduzida, enquanto a aplicação de abamectin e chlorfenapyr prolongam seu período de oviposição. Os fungicidas azoxystrobin, benomyl, imibenconazole, iprodione, metalaxyl + mancozeb e triforine têmbaixa toxicidade ao O. insidiosus. The aim of {{this work}} wasevaluate the toxicity of abamectin, <b>acephate,</b> azoxystrobin, benomyl, chlorfenapyr, imibenconazole, iprodione, metalaxyl + mancozeb and triforine on adults of Orius insidiosus (Say). These pesticides were used at the concentrations indicated by the manufacturers. All {{of them are in}} testing process for pest and diseases control on chrysanthemums crop, and were spraying on adults using a Potter's tower. The bioassays were carried out in laboratory, under controlled conditions at 25 ± 2 ºC, RH of 70 ± 10 % and 12 -h photophase. The toxicity of the pesticides to adults was determined by the total effect (E), considering the mortality rate and oviposition reduction. Toxicity effect was classified according to scale proposed by IOBC. Abamectin, <b>acephate</b> and chlorfenapyr were toxic to adults de O. insidiosus, and caused reduction in their survival. Females of O. insidiosus treated with abamectin and <b>acephate</b> caused reduction on eggs viability, whereas the application of abamectin and chlorfenapyr cause encrease on pre-oviposition period. The fungicides azoxystrobin, benomyl, imibenconazole, iprodione, metalaxyl + mancozeb and triforine presented low toxicity to O. insidiosus...|$|E
40|$|Slow release {{formulations}} of <b>acephate</b> and carbofuran encapsulated in pearl corn­ starch or corn flour granules {{were applied to}} the soil at seeding time of potted 2 ̆ 7 Caldwell 2 ̆ 7 wheat in the laboratory. Dosages of these insecticides were adjusted to a standard of IO kg/ha of a 102 ̆ 210 granular formulation of carbofuran. The residual action of these insecticide treatments against Rhopalosiphum padi were compared with those obtained with that of carbofuran 150 at corresponding dosages and foliar sprays of solutions of <b>acephate</b> (252 ̆ 210 EC) at 0. 22 ̆ 210 and carbofuran (4 F) at 1. 252 ̆ 210, applied 12 d after seedling emergence. The residual action of carbofuran 150, which controlled R. padi since seedling emergence, lasted 28. 5 d. The slow release granular {{formulations of}} carbofuran began to provide control (3 ̆e 502 ̆ 210 aphid mortality) on days 13. 3 and 17. 9 after seeding. They controlled the insect until days 31. 6 and 35. 5 after seeding. The two corresponding granular formulations of <b>acephate</b> began to provide control on days 15. 0 and 17. 0 after seeding and con­ trolled the aphids until days 31. 5 and 32. 8 after seeding. The foliar sprays of <b>acephate</b> and carbofuran provided control for 18. 3 and 36. 2 d from application, respectively. The slow release granular formulations provided control of R. padi, an important vector of barley yellow dwarf virus, during early. stages of wheat development...|$|E
