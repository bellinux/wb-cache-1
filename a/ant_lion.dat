40|$|Ant lions are insect larvae {{that feed}} on the {{liquefied}} internal components of insect prey. Prey capture is assisted by the injection of toxins that are reportedly derived from both the insect and bacterial symbionts. These larvae display interesting gut physiology where the midgut is not connected to the hindgut, preventing elimination of solid waste until adulthood. The presence of a discontinuous gut and the potential involvement of bacteria in prey paralyzation suggest an interesting microbial role in <b>ant</b> <b>lion</b> biology; however, the <b>ant</b> <b>lion</b> microbiota has not been described in detail. We therefore performed culture-independent 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the bacteria associated with tissues of an <b>ant</b> <b>lion,</b> Myrmeleon mobilis. All 222 sequences were identified as Proteobacteria and could be subdivided into two main groups, the �-Proteobacteria with similarity to Wolbachia spp. (75 clones) and the �-Proteobacteria with similarity to the family Enterobacteriaceae (144 clones). The Enterobacteriaceae-like 16 S rRNA gene sequences were most commonly isolated from gut tissue, and Wolbachia-like sequences were predominant {{in the head and}} body tissue. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses supported the localization of enterics to gut tissue and Wolbachia to nongut tissue. The diversity of sequences isolated from freshly caught, laboratory-fed, and laboratory-starved ant lions were qualitatively similar, although the libraries from each treatment were significantly different (P � 0. 05).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>Ant</b> <b>lion</b> optimization (ALO) {{technique to}} solve optimal load dispatch problem. <b>Ant</b> <b>lion</b> optimization (ALO) {{is a novel}} nature inspired algorithm. The ALO algorithm mimics the hunting mechanism of ant lions in nature. Five main steps of hunting prey such as the random walk of ants, building traps, entrapment of ants in traps, catching preys, and re-building traps are implemented. Optimal load dispatch (OLD) is a method of determining the most efficient, low-cost and reliable operation of a power system by dispatching available electricity generation resources to supply load on the system. The primary objective of OLD is to minimize total cost of generation while honoring operational constraints of available generation resources. The proposed technique is implemented on 3, 6 & 20 unit test system for solving the OLD. Numerical results shows that the proposed method has good convergence property and better in quality of solution than other algorithms reported in recent literature...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} known and {{accepted}} among evolutionary biologists that the selective pressures upon the immature stages of an organism {{may be very}} different from those upon the adult form. This principle is especially true of the endopterygote (holometabolous) insects: in these, there can be seen a nearly complete dissociation of the larva from the adult, manifested both biologically and morpho-logically. Thus it often happens that phylogenies based upon fea-tures of the immature endopterygote insect differ sharply from those constructed from the adult; ideally, both kinds of information should be available to and utilized by the taxonomist. The Neuroptera* * is thought to be the most generalized and primitive endopterygote order, and as such is considered to include forms that are closest to the common ancestor of all Endopterygota. Such families as Sialidae, Corydalidae and Raphidiidae express their primitive phylogenic positions by the relatively small degree of biological and morphological divergence exhibited between larva and adult. Other families and complexes of families within the Neuroptera, notably the superfamily Myrmeleontoidea (<b>ant</b> <b>lions</b> and their relatives), are highly specialized, possessing larval forms that in no way resemble the adults.

Insect larvae, pupae and mole crickets are detected by the bill and either extracted or dug out with the strong feet.

Common diet items include crickets, locusts, beetles, earwigs, cicadas, <b>ant</b> <b>lions,</b> bugs and <b>ants.</b> These can range from 10 to 150 mm in length, with a preferred prey size of around 20-30 mm.

Reference [16] proposes a hybrid model combining dynamic and fuzzy time series approaches to forecast the power consumption in household, commerce and industry respectively.

Reference [18] constructs a semi-parametric model to investigate the uncertainties in mid-to-long-term forecasting and estimate the probability distribution of the future load, while a novel Kullback-Liebler divergence-based similarity measure strategy is combined to identify the significant impact factors. A Grey model optimized by the <b>Ant</b> <b>Lion</b> Optimizer and a regression model optimized by Improved Particle Swarm Optimization are proposed in [19, 20], respectively.
