In 2005, Passy donated the vehicle (which had become symbolic of Bulgaria's NATO accession) to the National Historical Museum of Bulgaria. In 1997 the Trabant was celebrated for passing the moose test without rolling over, as the Mercedes-Benz W168 had; a Thuringian newspaper's headline read, [...] "Come <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>us,</b> moose!

And now this pestilent woodward will be always finding fault--killing the fowls and ducks, and seizing the swine and sheep, and very like {{slaughtering}} the dogs <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> turned out of house and home; for now you have offended the squire, he will believe anything against us." ...|$|R

5000|$|The film {{opened to}} mixed reviews with a critic noting [...] "the movie surprises {{us with a}} nice turn of events. It {{definitely}} energizes the movie <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> interested again. Looking back on the first half after this, we realize that the movie has actually been quite clever in setting up stock characters but {{in a slightly different}} way that makes the twist surprising." [...] Another reviewer noted [...] "To sum up 'Success' is not the right film for Jr Ganesan to be successful." ...|$|R
