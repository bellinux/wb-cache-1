5|$|Drawn and Quarterly {{has become}} known as a house for art comics, {{translations}} of non-English works, like Montrealer Michel Rabagliati's Paul series, and archive editions of classic comics, such as Wright's Little Nipper. The publisher has earned a reputation for the special <b>attention</b> <b>they</b> put into book design, and has played a pivotal rôle in shaping comics' rise in artistic prominence, and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US. D publisher Chris Oliveros, along with Art Spiegelman, lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels, which would be subdivided by subject.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{scientific}} investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially huge profits to be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from the coal under common lands in the region that Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the investment costs and <b>attention</b> <b>they</b> took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 {{in the second half of}} 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.|$|E

5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, {{and they would}} be given a great deal of extra <b>attention.</b> <b>They</b> would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's <b>attention,</b> <b>they</b> trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E

25|$|After the pilgrimage, Sarada Devi {{lived alone}} in Kamarpukur, the village where Ramakrishna was born. There, she endured poverty, verging on {{starvation}} for a year. In 1888, {{when the news}} reached the lay and monastic disciples of Ramakrishna that she needed their care and <b>attention,</b> <b>they</b> invited her to Calcutta and arranged for her stay. Swami Saradananda built a permanent house for Sarada Devi in Calcutta. The house was named the Udbodhan House, after the Bengali monthly magazine published by the Ramakrishna Math. The house, also known as Mayerbati ("Holy Mother's House"), is where she spent the longest period of her life outside Jayrambati.|$|E
25|$|Philosophical atheist thought {{began to}} appear in Europe and Asia in the sixth or fifth century BCE. Will Durant, in his The Story of Civilization, {{explained}} that certain pygmy tribes found in Africa were observed to have no identifiable cults or rites. There were no totems, no deities, and no spirits. Their dead were buried without special ceremonies or accompanying items and received no further <b>attention.</b> <b>They</b> even appeared to lack simple superstitions, according to travelers' reports. The Vedas of Ceylon admitted only the possibility that deities might exist but went no further. Neither prayers nor sacrifices were suggested in any way by the tribes.|$|E
25|$|When {{people choose}} to do things about which they are {{ambivalent}} and which they would have difficulty justifying, they experience a state of cognitive dissonance, {{which can lead to}} rationalization, denial, or even self-deception. For example, a 2011 experiment found that, when the harm that their meat-eating causes animals is explicitly brought to people's <b>attention,</b> <b>they</b> tend to rate those animals as possessing fewer mental capacities compared to when the harm is not brought to their attention. This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future. Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals. The data suggest that people who consume meat {{go to great lengths to}} try to resolve these moral inconsistencies between their beliefs and behaviour by adjusting their beliefs about what animals are capable of feeling. Ethical vegetarians argue that it is behaviour rather than supporting beliefs that should be adjusted.|$|E

25|$|Applications such as Instagram {{have become}} a “body-image battleground”, while the “selfie” is now the {{universal}} lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others. Facebook and Snapchat also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the highpoints of their lives, a survey by Common Sense reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or {{if it did not}} receive the amount of <b>attention</b> <b>they</b> hoped for. Hence, this could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos {{in order to meet the}} media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the Renfrew Center Foundation, 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35 year old women edited their images before uploading. Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online. Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.|$|E

It also established a speed limit of [...] for motorized vehicles {{and set up a}} regime for mine inspection. Perhaps most significantly, it set up a court system, with Arthur Lewis Sifton as the province's first Chief Justice.|$|E

During an interview on Israeli TV in 1971, Rabbi Goren claimed the two agreed to meet again when the time of peace comes.|$|E
500|$|By October, Deep Purple {{set off to}} the States {{to start}} their US tour. The success of [...] "Hush" [...] was a giant boost in America and from their first gigs they {{received}} all the <b>attention</b> <b>they</b> had not been given in England. The first dates were at The Inglewood Forum on 18 and 19 October 1968, supporting Cream in their farewell tour. A recording of those live performances was released in 2002 with the title Inglewood – Live in California. The band played at many different locations, including festivals, bars and even at the Playboy After Dark TV show, alongside Hugh Hefner {{and a bunch of}} dancing women.|$|E
500|$|The group drew {{inspiration}} from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as [...] "like all punk bands... very fast and furious." [...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where to get people's <b>attention</b> <b>they</b> resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk {{into the street and}} stop traffic to get noticed. [...] "Sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things to get people's attention, and we're not afraid to do that. We'll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going," [...] said McDermott.|$|E

500|$|The march {{commenced}} on 13 April 1930, {{coinciding with}} the Puthandu (Tamil New Year), from Rajan's house in Trichinopoly Cantonment. As soon as the marchers reached Tanjore, Rajaji avoided the usual route to Vedaranyam, and instead chose a [...] "circuitous" [...] route via Kumbakonam, Valangaiman, Semmangudi, Needamangalam and Thiruthuraipoondi as he hoped that the marchers would receive hospitality in these places. He had organised fifteen sub committees to ensure a smooth functioning of the march. The idea was to gather enough support among the people by drawing their <b>attention.</b> <b>They</b> planned to cover a stretch of 10 miles each day {{for a period of}} about 15 days, thus reaching the destination before the stipulated time.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Quadrophenia was positive. Melody Makers Chris Welch wrote [...] "rarely {{have a group}} succeeded in distilling their essence and embracing a motif as convincingly", while Charles Shaar Murray described the album in New Musical Express as the [...] "most rewarding musical experience of the year". Reaction in the US was generally positive, though Dave Marsh, writing in Creem gave a more critical response. Lenny Kaye, writing in Rolling Stone wrote [...] "the Who as a whole have never sounded better" [...] but added [...] "on its own terms, Quadrophenia falls short of the mark". In a year-end top albums list for Newsday, Robert Christgau ranked it seventh and found it exemplary of how 1973's best records [...] "fail to reward casual <b>attention.</b> <b>They</b> demand concentration, just like museum and textbook art." ...|$|E
