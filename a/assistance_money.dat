30|$|This {{previous}} {{analysis has}} been very abstract. To be more concrete, let me say the following: There is a vast literature {{about the relationship between}} culture, entrepreneurship and economic growth (Doepke and Zilibotti 2014). According to this literature, all countries or regions have entrepreneurs (some countries more than others, in accordance with their culture). In some way, the Cultural Factor that is analyzed in this paper leads to the absence of entrepreneurship. Thus, assistance programs could, as a part of their strategies, promote partnership between entrepreneurs and communities; entrepreneurs could develop new technology (e.g., small-scale production technology, marketing technology, new types of hierarchies, etc.) and indigenous communities could produce the items, with their craft abilities. The entrepreneurs might be in universities and the indigenous communities in rural areas, but the adventure of working together can produce true wonders (if also useless things). The key is that the entrepreneurs would be aware of the Cultural Factor, and they could use their intellect and their imagination to increase efficiency. The government would then need to provide <b>assistance,</b> <b>money</b> and financing to reduce the risk to indigenous communities.|$|E
40|$|After {{a decade}} of reform {{contrasts}} between regions in Russia in per resident regional gross product and per resident real income have increased essentially. The challenge to smooth these inequalities {{is one of the}} high priorities for the contemporary Russian federal regional policy. For this purpose in the year 2001 federal program of diminishing interregional disparities was elaborated. In 2002 forty regions will receive federal assistance in this Program. Institutional factors on the regional level are critical to make this assistance more efficient. To understand this influence special research of the link between the structure of the regional authorities and the regional economic growth has been undertaken for 10 regions. The model of regional authority-'open corporation' is more effective in attracting additional external investments for the federal <b>assistance</b> <b>money.</b> The model of regional authority-'closed partnership' is more effective in decreasing transaction costs of utilising federal money in social projects to fight inequalities. In the ethnic republics federal assistance sometimes in reality can increase disparities as it is chanelled for the clan in power and not distributed evenly among all the groups and localities. The paper concludes by suggestion for the improvement of the contemporary federal regional policy in Russia. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{funding of}} civil society has become a key aspect of the {{governance}} agenda for international aid. This arises out {{of a number of}} theories linking civil society to better governance through the leveraging of social capital. These theories find their genesis in a distinctly liberal body of work that has drawn its findings from Western historical experience. In particular, the work of Robert Putnam and many like him in the 1990 's draws its inspiration from Alexis d'Tocqueville's observations of democratic life {{in the early nineteenth century}} United States. Here, civic associational, according to Tocqueville, played a key part in the vibrant democratic spirit of the USA. Putnam's own findings, on the difference between governance outcomes in Southern and Northern Italy, mirror those of Tocqueville. Although the formulations {{of civil society}} and social capital inherent in this liberal tradition are but one among many theories, they are the ones that have influenced the international donors and the allocation of development <b>assistance</b> <b>money</b> has reflected this. Civil society funding generally goes to ideal types of organisations that most resemble a Western conception of civil society. In particular, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO's) have proliferated to take advantage of this. This may well be overlooking many key forms of civil society that already exist in developing countries. A liberal reading of civil society that focuses on the associative values of civil society organisations would miss groups that are characterised more by kin, ethnicity or tribal ties. The fa'asamoa (or 'Samoan way') is an example of just such an institution that may be viewed as too traditional and backward looking by liberal theory, but upon reflection performs many of the key roles ascribed to civil society including as an important provider of social capital. It could be that donors concerned with good governance would do better to further engage with traditional institutions such as the fa'asamoa, than to simply create a new class of civil society, dominated by NGO's over the top of existing social structures...|$|E
