5|$|<b>Atopic</b> {{dermatitis}} is {{a chronic}} dermatitis {{associated with a}} hereditary tendency to develop allergies to food and inhalant substances.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} <b>atopic</b> dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),â€¦, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E
5|$|Phase II {{clinical}} trials {{with one of}} the candidate compounds, mapracorat (code names BOL-303242-X and ZK245186), started in summer 2009. One was a double blind dose finding study for an ointment against <b>atopic</b> dermatitis conducted by Intendis, a part of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals specialized on dermatology. A Phase III trial started in November 2010, evaluating an ophthalmic suspension for the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery, conducted by Bausch & Lomb.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate <b>atopic</b> dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Others use {{the term}} eczema to {{specifically}} mean <b>atopic</b> dermatitis. <b>Atopic</b> dermatitis {{is also known as}} <b>atopic</b> eczema. In some languages, dermatitis and eczema mean the same thing, while in other languages dermatitis implies an acute condition and eczema a chronic one.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of S. aureus in persons with <b>atopic</b> dermatitis {{is not an}} indication to treat with oral antibiotics, as evidence has not shown this to give benefit to the patient. The relationship between S. aureus and <b>atopic</b> dermatitis is unclear.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atopic</b> {{dermatitis}} (AD), {{also known}} as <b>atopic</b> eczema, {{is a type of}} inflammation of the skin (dermatitis). It results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin. Clear fluid may come from the affected areas, which often thicken over time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atopic</b> {{dermatitis}} is {{an allergic}} disease {{believed to have}} a hereditary component and often runs in families whose members have asthma. Itchy rash is particularly noticeable on head and scalp, neck, inside of elbows, behind knees, and buttocks. It is very common in developed countries, and rising. Irritant contact dermatitis is sometimes misdiagnosed as <b>atopic</b> dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|Probiotic {{supplements}} {{taken during}} pregnancy or infancy {{may help to}} prevent <b>atopic</b> dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|Finally, IgA {{deficiency}} is {{also sometimes}} {{associated with the}} development of autoimmune and <b>atopic</b> phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Skin conditions: A 2016 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis found that passive smoking {{was associated with}} a higher rate of <b>atopic</b> dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{dust mite}} {{infestation}} {{in the home}} {{has been linked to}} <b>atopic</b> dermatitis and epidermal barrier damage has been documented.|$|E
25|$|UV rays also treat certain skin conditions. Modern {{phototherapy}} {{has been}} used to successfully treat psoriasis, eczema, jaundice, vitiligo, <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, and localized scleroderma.|$|E
25|$|Cortisone is {{also used}} by dermatologists to treat keloids, relieve the {{symptoms}} of eczema and <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, and stop the development of sarcoidosis.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{dermatitis}} including <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, and seborrheic eczema. Many use the term dermatitis and eczema synonymously.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{evidence}} suggests that acupuncture may reduce itching in those affected by <b>atopic</b> dermatitis. There is currently no scientific evidence for the claim that sulfur treatment relieves eczema.|$|E
25|$|T-cell {{receptor}} peptide vaccines {{are under}} development for several diseases using models of Valley Fever, stomatitis, and <b>atopic</b> dermatitis. These peptides {{have been shown}} to modulate cytokine production and improve cell-mediated immunity.|$|E
25|$|Because {{dextromethorphan}} {{can trigger}} a histamine release (allergic reaction), <b>atopic</b> children, who are especially susceptible to allergic reactions, should be administered dextromethorphan only if absolutely necessary, and only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.|$|E
25|$|The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) {{published}} a position paper in 2001, which simplifies the nomenclature of allergy-related diseases, including <b>atopic</b> and allergic contact eczemas. Non-allergic eczemas are {{not affected by}} this proposal.|$|E
25|$|Evidence in peer-reviewed {{journals}} shows that some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions in some individuals, {{especially those with}} severe or <b>atopic</b> asthma. Many fragrance ingredients can also cause headaches, allergic skin reactions or nausea.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these indications, ciclosporin is also used in severe <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, Kimura disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, chronic autoimmune urticaria, acute systemic mastocytosis, and, infrequently, in rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases, although it is only used in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} {{who are at risk}} for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having atopy), <b>atopic</b> syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding {{for more}} than four months may prevent <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, cow's milk allergy, and {{wheezing}} in early childhood. Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective. Specifically, early exposure to eggs and peanuts reduces the risk of allergies to these.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} to be very {{effective}} in eczema and <b>atopic</b> dermatitis in researches, {{even though it is}} not commonly used. The British National Eczema Society lists it as a third-line treatment for severe to moderate cases of these skin diseases.|$|E
25|$|A type of {{dermatitis}} may {{be described}} by location (e.g., hand eczema), by specific appearance (eczema craquele or discoid), or by possible cause (varicose eczema). Further {{adding to the}} confusion, many sources use the term eczema interchangeably for the most common type: <b>atopic</b> dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine {{can also}} be used for the {{treatment}} of allergic conditions, such as chronic urticaria, <b>atopic</b> or contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus. These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system or urinary tract.|$|E
25|$|Cidoxepin {{is under}} {{development}} by Elorac, Inc. {{for the treatment}} of chronic urticaria (hives). As of 2017, it is in phase II clinical trials for this indication. The drug was also under investigation {{for the treatment of}} allergic rhinitis, <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, and contact dermatitis, but development for these indications was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{is used as}} a pill {{to treat}} major {{depressive}} disorder, anxiety disorders, chronic hives, and for short-term help with trouble remaining asleep after going to bed (a form of insomnia). As a cream it is used for short term treatment of itchiness to due <b>atopic</b> dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus.|$|E
25|$|The {{skin and}} the lens have the same embryological origin and so can be {{affected}} by similar diseases. Those with <b>atopic</b> dermatitis and eczema occasionally develop shield ulcers cataracts. Ichthyosis is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with cuneiform cataracts and nuclear sclerosis. Basal-cell nevus and pemphigus have similar associations.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{symptoms}} of <b>atopic</b> dermatitis vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin. Typical affected skin areas include {{the folds of the}} arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face and hands. Perioral dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to other}} breeds, Shar Peis have {{increased}} risk of developing <b>atopic</b> dermatitis, a chronic allergic skin disease. Dogs with allergic skin disease often get allergy-induced skin infections. Shar Peis are also at {{increased risk of}} demodicosis, a disease which happens when Demodex canis mites proliferate and cause skin irritation, inflammation and infection.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA) {{used as a}} pill to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, chronic hives, and for short-term help with trouble remaining asleep after going to bed (a form of insomnia). As a cream it is used for short term treatment of itchiness to due <b>atopic</b> dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atopic</b> {{individuals}} can {{have up to}} ten times the normal level of IgE in their blood (as do sufferers of hyper-IgE syndrome). However, {{this may not be}} a requirement for symptoms to occur as has been seen in asthmatics with normal IgE levels in their bloodâ€”recent research has shown that IgE production can occur locally in the nasal mucosa.|$|E
