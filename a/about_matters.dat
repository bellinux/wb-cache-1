40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this paper is designed around the notion that learning involves the recognition and development of students’ representational resources. This paper describes a classroom sequence in Ideas <b>about</b> <b>Matter</b> that focuses on representations and their negotiation, and reports {{on the effectiveness of}} this perspective in guiding teaching, and in providing further insight into student learning. Classroom sequences involving two experienced teachers (2008, Year 8 students) and an inexperienced teacher (2010, Year 7 students) were videotaped using a combined focus on the teacher and groups of students. Video analysis software was used to code the variety of representations used teachers and students, and sequences of representational negotiation. The paper reports on the effect of this approach on teacher pedagogy and on student learning of Ideas <b>about</b> <b>Matter.</b> The paper will present data from video of classroom activities, students’ work samples, student and teacher interviews and pre and post-unit testing, to explore what a representational focus might entail in teaching Ideas <b>about</b> <b>Matter,</b> and the role of representations in learning and reasoning and exploring scientific ideas. <br /...|$|R

25|$|The two {{approaches}} are complementary rather than competitive, {{but they do}} result in different perspectives, and occasionally conflicts of opinion <b>about</b> <b>matters</b> of substance. In addition, {{for most of the}} twentieth century, comparative psychology developed most strongly in North America, while ethology was stronger in Europe. From a practical standpoint, early comparative psychologists concentrated on gaining extensive knowledge of the behaviour of very few species. Ethologists were more interested in understanding behaviour across a wide range of species to facilitate principled comparisons across taxonomic groups. Ethologists have made much more use of such cross-species comparisons than comparative psychologists have.|$|E
25|$|The {{activities}} of the Photographic Section continued after 1961 when it became the West Cameroon Photographic Section (part of the Federal Republic) and thereafter, under the United Republic of Cameroon (formed after a referendum in 1972). The photographers working for the Information Service produced not only photographs but also movies, which were subsequently shown by mobile cinemas units in rural and urban areas all over the territory. These movies' primary purpose was the information and education of the population <b>about</b> <b>matters</b> such as health, hygiene or the importance of schooling. These photographers were also responsible for covering the Presidents’ and Prime Minister’s activities {{as well as any}} official events of public interest. From its inception and through the 1980s the Photographic Division was active and able to preside directly over all the phases of photo production, from shooting to development and print.|$|E

25|$|Pacific Coast Women's Press Association (PCWPA; September 27, 1890 - 1941) was a press {{organization}} for women located on the West Coast of the United States.

Discussions were not permitted of any partisan movements on the subjects of politics, religion, or reform. The members of the association took on causes related to certain public improvements in the way of roads, streets, parks, libraries, village improvement societies, free exhibits of county resources, the suppression of criminal details of sensational cases in newspapers, the suppression of criminal advertising, the development of the kindergartens — things that tended to the building up of the country. To facilitate the work, the association issued printed monographs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The science {{learning}} process improves when the contents {{are connected to}} students' lives. Particle physics has had a great impact in our society {{in the last years}} and has changed the theoretical picture <b>about</b> <b>matter</b> fundamental dynamics. Thus, we think that academic contents <b>about</b> <b>matter</b> components and interactions should be updated. With this study we aim to characterize the level of knowledge of high school students about this topic. We built a test with questions about classical atomic models, particle physics, recent discoveries, social implications and students opinions about it. Contrary to our first suspicion, students' answers show a high variability. They have new physics ideas and show a great interest towards modern concepts. We suggest including an updated view of this topic as part of the curriculum...|$|R

25|$|While Hoveyda {{remained}} personally free of corruption, due to {{his experiences}} he increasingly showed tolerance (either real or feigned) towards the practice of corruption and abuses of power among others in the government. When briefing the Shah <b>about</b> <b>matters</b> of state, he began {{to take part in}} the glossing over the political troubles that the government's policies were creating. He also helped to secure his own position of power by feeding into the Shah's vanity by carrying out policies that increased the ever-growing cult of personality surrounding the monarch, while at the same time executing the Shah's every wish in politics. The Shah responded favorably to these displays of fealty, and these actions secured Hoveyda's place as a loyal member of the Shah's government. The toleration of corruption, as well as constant attacks in the press towards him (usually by journalists who wanted to indirectly criticize the Shah, but were unable to do so openly because of censorship laws) made Hoveyda an increasingly disliked and mocked figure among common Iranians. Hoveyda himself due to the isolating nature of Iranian politics became increasingly unaware of those tensions himself. No longer considered a reformer by most, he was seen instead as an ultimate insider, who not only kowtowed to the government's policies, but actively promulgated it.|$|E
500|$|De Castries' {{seclusion}} in his bunker, {{combined with}} his superiors' inability to replace him, created a leadership vacuum within the French command. On 24 March, an event took place which {{later became a}} matter of historical debate. The historian Bernard Fall records, based on Langlais' memoirs, that Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de Castries in his bunker on 24 March. They {{told him he would}} retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it. De Castries is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the [...] "truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries became 'commander emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice <b>about</b> <b>matters</b> in Dien Bien Phu". Jules Roy, however, makes no mention of this event, and Martin Windrow argues that the [...] "paratrooper putsch" [...] is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and Marcel Bigeard were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.|$|E

Soon after the inauguration, Nixon appointed Agnew as head of the Office of Intergovernmental Relations, to head government commissions such as the National Space Council and assigned him to work with state governors to bring down crime. It became clear that Agnew would not be in the inner circle of advisors. The new president preferred to deal directly with only a trusted handful, and was annoyed when Agnew tried to call him <b>about</b> <b>matters</b> Nixon deemed trivial. After Agnew shared his opinions on a foreign policy matter in a cabinet meeting, an angry Nixon sent Bob Haldeman to warn Agnew to keep his opinions to himself. Nixon complained that Agnew had no idea how the vice presidency worked, but did not meet with Agnew to share his own experience of the office. Herb Klein, director of communications in the Nixon White House, later wrote that Agnew had allowed himself to be pushed around by senior aides such as Haldeman and John Mitchell, and that Nixon's [...] "inconsistent" [...] treatment of Agnew had left the vice president exposed.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{teachers}}' cognitions (their beliefs, feelings, and under standings) <b>about</b> subject <b>matter.</b> The teachers {{discussed in the}} paper teach English to secondary students in Hong Kong. Their cognitions are all concerned with grammar and grammar pedagogy. Drawing on analyses of quantitative and qualitative data, the paper addresses four questions: 1. Are there associations between particular cognitions <b>about</b> subject <b>matter</b> and specific factors of teacher background? 2. Are there associations between particular cognitions <b>about</b> subject <b>matter</b> and levels of knowledge of subject matter? 3. Are there general patterns in teachers' cognitions <b>about</b> subject <b>matter?</b> 4. Are there patterns of association between teachers' cognitions <b>about</b> subject <b>matter</b> and their perceived pedagogical practice? In relation to the first two questions, survey data from 170 teachers revealed no significant associations between their cognitions <b>about</b> subject <b>matter</b> and such background factors as {{years of teaching experience}} and place or subject of first degree. There were, however, interesting patterns of association between the data about the teachers' beliefs and test results indicating those teachers' levels of language proficiency and explicit knowledge of grammar and grammatical terminology. Interviews (supported by classroom observation) were the main source of data relating to the third and fourth questions. Data from 17 teachers revealed patterns of cognitions <b>about</b> subject <b>matter,</b> which appeared to associate with certain pedagogical practices. At the same time, there was considerable variation between individuals. A follow-up paper will examine the uniqueness of the individual teacher's cognitions and of their association with pedagogical practice, using a case-study approach involving classroom data and interview. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

He wrote about performers he admired, including Otto Klemperer, Alfred Brendel, and Kiri Te Kanawa.
