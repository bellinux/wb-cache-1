500|$|... 3 December 2016: A Su-33 {{based on}} the Admiral Kuznetsov {{aircraft}} carrier crashed while making a second landing attempt after a combat sortie over Syria. The pilot survived without injuries and was immediately recovered by search and rescue teams. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the plane was lost after an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> ruptured. [...] Afterwards, the Russian Navy transferred the carrier's remaining aircraft to an air base in Syria to continue operations while the carrier's issue was resolved.|$|E
50|$|Although STOVL {{aircraft}} {{are capable of}} taking off vertically from {{a spot on the}} deck, using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight. As catapults are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment, vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> and related hardware. Russian, Chinese, and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> and a tailhook on their aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Currently Finland conducts drills on its road bases (maantietukikohta), around once a year. In the Baana 16 {{exercise}} in 2016 the Finnish Air Force flew F/A-18C and BAE Hawk, Pilatus PC-12 and C295M aircraft from a highway in Lusi. The Finnish Air Force uses <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> to quickly stop F/A-18s, which were {{originally designed to}} operate from aircraft carriers. The Swedish Air Force also {{took part in the}} 2015 and 2016 exercises, flying Gripen fighters.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> or wires, cross deck {{pendants}} are flexible steel cables which are spanned across the landing {{area to be}} engaged by the arresting hook of an incoming aircraft. On aircraft carriers there are either three or four cables, numbered 1-4 from aft to forward. Pendants are made of 1 inch (25 mm), 1-1/4 (32 mm) inch or 1-3/8 inch (35mm) diameter wire rope. Each wire rope {{is made up of}} numerous strands twisted about an oiled hemp center core, which provides a [...] "cushion" [...] for each strand and also supplies cable lubrication. The cable ends are equipped with terminal couplings designed for quick detachment during replacement and are able to be rapidly detached and replaced (in about 2-3 minutes on aircraft carriers). On U.S. carriers, the <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> are removed and replaced after each 125 <b>arrested</b> landings. Individual <b>cables</b> are often removed and left [...] "stripped" [...] in order to perform maintenance on other components of the arresting gear during aircraft recoveries (using other, on line, systems). Wire supports raise the deck pendants several inches so that they may be picked up by the tailhook of a landing aircraft. The wire supports on carriers are merely curved steel leaf springs that can flex to allow an aircraft to taxi over the installed deck pendant. On land based systems, [...] "donut" [...] shaped rubber supports raise the cable off the runway surface a minimum of 2 inches (51 mm).|$|R
2500|$|Prior {{to making}} an [...] "arrested landing", the pilot lowers the hook {{so that it}} will contact the ground as the {{aircraft}} wheels touch down. [...] The hook then drags along the surface until an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable,</b> stretched across the landing area, is engaged. [...] The cable lets out, transferring the energy of the aircraft to the arresting gear through the cable. [...] A [...] "trap" [...] is often-used slang for an arrested landing. [...] An aircraft which lands beyond the arresting cables is said to have [...] "boltered." [...] Occasionally, the tailhook bounces over {{one or more of the}} wires, resulting in a [...] "hook skip bolter." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 December 2016, an Su-33 {{crashed into}} the sea after {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} carrier. According to a report, the combat plane crashed at its second attempt to land on the aircraft carrier in good weather conditions. The pilot was safely recovered by a search and rescue helicopter. Initially it was suspected that the plane missed the wires and failed to go around, falling short of the bow of the warship, but later it was revealed that the <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> failed to hold the aircraft, and was damaged in the attempt. [...] Following the two incidents, the air wing was transferred to shore at Khmeimim Air Base near Latakia, Syria to continue military operations while the carrier's arresting gear issues are resolved.|$|E

50|$|In 1958, surplus J33s {{were used}} in jet donkeys pushing dead loads at 200 knots to test {{aircraft}} carrier <b>arresting</b> gear <b>cables</b> and tailhooks at Lakehurst.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the first}} A-4Es were flown in Vietnam in early 1965, the A-4Cs {{continued}} to be used until late 1970. On 1 June 1965, the Chu Lai Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) was officially opened {{with the arrival of}} eight A-4 Skyhawks from Cubi Point, Philippine Islands. The group landed with the aid of <b>arresting</b> <b>cables,</b> refueled and took off with the aid of JATO, with fuel and bombs to support Marine combat units. The Skyhawks were from Marine Attack Squadron VMA-225 and VMA-311.|$|R
50|$|The island {{on these}} ships {{was small and}} cramped, and located well forward of the funnels (unlike on a normal-sized carrier where the funnels were {{integrated}} into the island). Although the first escort carriers had only one aircraft elevator, having two elevators (one fore and one aft), along with the single aircraft catapult, quickly became standard. The carriers employed the same system of <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> and tail hooks as on the big carriers, and procedures for launch and recovery {{were the same as}} well.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arresting</b> <b>cable</b> {{systems were}} invented by Hugh Robinson and were {{utilized}} by Eugene Ely {{on his first}} landing on a ship - the armored cruiser USS Pennsylvania, on January 18, 1911. These early systems had cables run through pulleys and attached to dead weights, such as sandbags. More modern arresting cables were tested on HMS Courageous in June 1931.|$|E
50|$|The Arresting Gear Officer (AGO) is {{responsible}} for arresting gear operation, settings, and monitoring landing area deck status (the deck is either clear and ready to land aircraft or foul and not ready for landing). Arresting gear engines are set to apply varying resistance (weight setting) to the <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> based {{on the type of}} aircraft landing.|$|E

50|$|During the April {{mobilization}} at Capitol Hill {{that resulted}} in 400 <b>arrests,</b> <b>cable</b> television devoted minimal coverage to the protests. CNN spent zero time covering the protests, while MSNBC gave Democracy Spring ~12 seconds and Fox News ~17 seconds. Additionally, MSNBC and Fox News misrepresented the protests, saying they were for voting rights issues rather than to stop systemic political corruption. While cable news did not give Democracy Spring much air time, other organizations including NPR, Al Jazeera, Democracy Now, The Young Turks, and CSPAN covered the protests {{with a number of}} featured segments.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the design}} {{never left the}} {{channels}} of bureaucracy, Dräger did include a first draft of the KFT in his proposal. It was a preliminary design {{as a base for}} discussions and purposefully omitted several details (like weapons, for example). The KFT had a displacement of 3500t, an overall length of 101.6m (waterline: 96m) and a draft of 4m. The landing deck was 90m in length and 17m in width, equipped with several <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> and three aircraft elevators. At the bow was a catapult for launch, the hangar had a capacity for 4 Ju-87D-4 Torpedo/Bomber aircraft and 2 Bf-109T fighter aircraft, with an option for a third fighter launch-ready on deck. The main engines had 9000HP power for a top speed of 19kn (range: 4000sm or 14000sm/9kn).|$|R
50|$|In 1947 an {{enormous}} crane with a 630-ton capacity was completed {{at the site}} by the American Bridge Company. It was the largest crane in the world. This {{was used to remove}} the turrets of battleships so the guns could be quickly replaced while the old set was being refurbished on land. In 1959, a 230-foot tall trapezoidal tower was added {{to the top of the}} crane, bringing its total height to nearly 500 feet. This made the crane the tallest man-made structure in San Francisco until the completion of 44 Montgomery in 1967. The addition was created to facilitate Operation Skycatch, where Polaris missiles were fired and caught via a string of <b>arresting</b> <b>cables,</b> before being lowered to the ground for testing. Previous versions of the test had the missiles flung out into the bay and retrieved from the ocean floor. The crane dominates the landscape in the area as is easily visible from miles around.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purchase}} {{cable is}} a wire rope that looks {{very similar to}} the <b>arresting</b> <b>cable.</b> They are much longer, however, and are not designed to be easily removed. There are two purchase cables per <b>arresting</b> <b>cable,</b> and they connect to each end of the arresting wire. Purchase cables connect the arresting wire to the arresting gear engines and [...] "pay out" [...] as the arresting wire is engaged by the aircraft. As an incoming aircraft engages the deck pendant, the purchase cable transmits the force of the landing aircraft from the deck gear to the arresting engine. The pendant (arresting wire) is [...] "swaged" [...] (attached) to the purchase cable by means of a loop created with zinc heated to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This onboard fabrication is considered dangerous, and it is reported the Navy is testing the use of an automated press to accomplish it more safely. On land based systems, heavy nylon tapes are used in place of purchase cables, but they serve the same function.|$|E

[...] Afterwards, the Russian Navy transferred the carrier's remaining aircraft to an air base in Syria to continue operations while the carrier's issue was resolved.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} flight deck, the KFT had three {{additional}} decks. The upper deck housed the bridge, radio and navigation {{room in the}} front, workshops for engines and planes, med-bay, boats and <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> machines {{in the middle and}} back. Along the whole deck were cabins for the 80 soldiers for both ships and planes plus the pilots. The middle deck housed anchors and catapult mechanisms, aircraft fuel tanks, main and auxiliary engines, food storage and rudder control. Also included were additional cabins and the upper hangar levels. The lowest deck housed the main engines, water tanks, additional aircraft fuel tanks, bombs, torpedoes and spare parts storage and the hangar floor.|$|E
5000|$|Landing {{larger and}} faster {{aircraft}} {{on a flight}} deck was made possible {{through the use of}} <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> installed on the flight deck and a tailhook installed on the aircraft. Early carriers had {{a very large number of}} arrestor cables or [...] "wires". Current U.S. Navy carriers have three or four steel cables stretched across the deck at 20 ft intervals which bring a plane, traveling at 150 mph, to a complete stop in about 320 ft. The cables are set to stop each aircraft at the same place on the deck, regardless of the size or weight of the plane. During World War II, large net barriers would be erected across the flight deck so aircraft could be parked on the forward part of the deck and recovered on the after part. This allowed increased complements but resulted in a lengthened launch and recovery cycle as aircraft were shuffled around the carrier to allow take-off or landing operations.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{decision}} was made in the mid-1960s to phase out fixed wing carrier operations Hermes was slated to become a [...] "Commando Carrier" [...] for Royal Marine operations (similar in concept to a US Navy LHA). Therefore, Hermes was docked down in number 10 Dock in Devonport Dockyard between 1971 and 1973, undergoing a conversion in which her <b>arresting</b> <b>cables,</b> steam catapults, and 3-D radar were removed. Landing craft and berthing for 800 troops were added and her airwing became approximately 20 Sea King helicopters. By 1976, with the Soviet submarine threat becoming apparent and through NATO pressure, a further mild conversion was performed for Hermes to become an anti-submarine warfare carrier to patrol the North Atlantic. Hermes underwent one more conversion and new capabilities were added when she was refitted at Portsmouth from 1980 to June 1981, during which a 12-degree ski-jump and facilities for operating Sea Harriers were incorporated. After this refit the air wing comprised: ...|$|R
50|$|After the {{cease-fire}} in Vietnam in 1973, Enterprise proceeded to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, where the carrier was altered and refitted {{to support the}} Navy's newest fighter aircraft - the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. Two of four jet blast deflectors were enlarged to accommodate the Tomcat. The No. 4 propulsion shaft was replaced; it had been bent when its screw became fouled in a discarded <b>arresting</b> gear <b>cable.</b>|$|R
50|$|The runway {{was painted}} with a {{contoured}} outline of Graf Zeppelins flight deck and simulated deck landings were then conducted over an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> strung width-wise across the airstrip. The cable {{was attached to}} an electromechanical braking device manufactured by DEMAG (Deutsche Maschinenfabrik A.G. Duisburg). Testing began in March 1938 using the Heinkel He 50, Arado Ar 195 and Ar 197. Later, a stronger braking winch was supplied by Atlas-Werke of Bremen and this allowed heavier aircraft, such as the Fieseler Fi 167 and Junkers Ju 87, to be tested. After some initial problems, Luftwaffe pilots performed 1,500 successful braked landings out of 1,800 attempted.|$|E

50|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout.

50|$|The Navy {{used two}} {{modified}} F9F-7s to conduct experiments landing on British-inspired flexible decks {{which did not}} {{require the use of}} landing gear. The reasoning was that since an airplane's landing gear comprises some 33% of the total weight, a plane without landing gear would gain a greater range and would be able to carry more ordnance. The aircraft were fitted with a 3-inch-deep false bottom under the center fuselage to help balance the plane during landings on the flex-deck made up of a lubricated rubberized fabric. The deck, built by Goodyear was 1/2 inch thick and featured several <b>arresting</b> <b>cables.</b> The planes were launched using a ramp and a handling dolly which served as temporary landing gear. The two F9F-7 aircraft in the test were equipped with the powerful J48-P8 engine instead of the Allison J33 engine originally used with the F9F-7. While the landing tests yielded positive results and proved that landing was clearly possible, the project was terminated in 1955 as it would have been difficult to move the aircraft around the carrier deck once they landed. It also required a highly skilled pilot to perform the landings and would have made it impossible to divert to a land base if necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Lakehurst conducts {{the unique}} mission of {{supporting}} and developing the Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment and Support Equipment for naval aviation. Since the 1950s, aviation boatswain's mates {{have been trained}} at Lakehurst to operate catapults and arresting systems on aircraft carriers using rail guided jet donkeys pushing dead loads at 200 knots tested carrier <b>arresting</b> gear <b>cables</b> and tailhooks. [...] The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System and the Advanced Arresting Gear system that will replace the existing steam catapults and the Mk-7 arresting gear are being developed and tested at Lakehurst at full-scale shipboard representative test facilities here.|$|R
2500|$|When {{leaving her}} port in Detroit {{for the last}} time heading for her refit it was {{reported}} that the Greater Buffalo was [...] "saluted" [...] by those on board the other vessels in the area. Sable was converted at the Erie Plant of American Shipbuilding Company at Buffalo, New York. The cabins and superstructure of the ship were removed leaving the main deck. Along with additional supports, a steel flight deck was installed instead of the originally planned Douglas-fir wooden deck similar to what was installed on [...] The steel deck also allowed Sable to be used for the testing a variety of non-skid coatings applied to the flight deck. The deck of Sable was equipped with eight sets of <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> as well. A [...] bridge island or superstructure was constructed on the starboard side of the ship along with outriggers forward of the island for storing damaged aircraft. On the main deck a lecture room, along with projection equipment, was constructed that could accommodate more than forty aviators with bunks for twenty one aviators. She was also equipped with a sick bay, operating room, laundry, tailor shop, crew quarters, a cafeteria style galley for the crew, a mess hall for the officers, storerooms and a refrigerator. Sable lacked a hangar deck, elevators or armament, as her role was for the training of pilots for carrier take-offs and landings. A number of crew members assigned to the Sable prior to her commissioning were survivors of the USS Lexington which had been lost earlier during the Battle of the Coral Sea. Sable was commissioned on 8 May 1943 with Captain Warren K. Berner in command.|$|R
50|$|On 3 December 2016, an Su-33 {{crashed into}} the sea after {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} carrier. According to a report, the combat plane crashed at its second attempt to land on the aircraft carrier in good weather conditions. The pilot was safely recovered by a search and rescue helicopter.

50|$|In another scene, Tallman {{flew the}} plane through an {{airplane}} hangar at about 150 knots, with only 23 feet of clearance from wingtips to walls and only 15 {{feet from the}} top of the tail to the hangar ceiling. Known as a Butler building, the hangar was built during World War II and is still in use today at the Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport, next to the Pacific Coast Air Museum, in Santa Rosa. At the end of the sequence, the airplane is shown crashing through a plate glass window covering an open airport hangar, made to look like a restaurant, and stopping abruptly. No special effects were used in this scene, which was filmed with the actors and plane in the same space at the same time, with real propellers destroying the window framework. Careful viewing of this incredibly dangerous stunt reveals an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> that was tied to the tail of the airplane at just the right length to make the airplane stop as it hit a curbing. The aircraft that the Crumps chartered was a vintage Standard J trainer.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{carriers}} {{typically have}} three or four arresting cables laid across the landing area. All U.S. carriers in the Nimitz-class, along with Enterprise, have four wires, {{with the exception of the}} USS Ronald Reagan and USS George H.W. Bush, which have only three. The Gerald R. Ford-class carriers will also have three. Pilots aim for the second or third wire (depending on ship configuration) to reduce the risk of landing short. Aircraft coming in to land on a carrier are at approximately 85% of full throttle. At touchdown, the pilot advances the throttles to full power. In the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler aircraft, the aircraft automatically reduces engine thrust to 70% once the deceleration of a successful arrestment is detected. This feature can be overridden by the pilot by selecting max afterburner. If the aircraft fails to catch an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable,</b> a condition known as a [...] "bolter", the aircraft has sufficient power to continue down the angled flight deck and become airborne again. Once the arresting gear stops the aircraft, the pilot brings the throttles back to idle, raises the hook and taxies clear.|$|E
50|$|The brief rest {{ended when}} the task group sailed {{back to the}} Bonins on 30 June. The task force's planes struck at Iwo Jima on 3 and 4 July, interdicting Japanese efforts to {{reinforce}} Guam. The warship's crew, however, suffered another loss on 4 July when ad <b>arresting</b> gear <b>cable</b> snapped and killed one man and injured three others. In preparation for the landings planned for Guam in mid-July, Bataans aircraft conducted sweeps over Pagan Island on 5 July and then repeatedly bombed Guam from 6 to 11 July. On 12 July, her forward elevator failed permanently and she received orders to head home for repairs. She steamed by way of Eniwetok and Oahu before arriving in San Francisco on 30 July.|$|R
