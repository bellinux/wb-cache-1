50|$|Applications {{for asylum}} from Colombians in the UK started {{to rise in}} 1996, peaked in 1997 and has been falling since then (with the {{exception}} of 1999 which saw a sharp increase).

Also the sharp drop in applications in 1998 could be associated with the introduction of visa restrictions.

He briefly and reluctantly teams up with the Punisher to stop a drug cartel that kidnapped a friend of Brock's. In [...] "The Return of Anti-Venom" [...] (2011), Brock is unable to expose Negative's true identity, believing no one will trust him. Anti-Venom starts a crusade against Negative, attacking his criminal operations. When Anti-Venom realizes that May Parker also knows Negative's identity, he decides to attack Negative directly before Negative can silence her. Brock teams up with Spider-Man and the new Wraith to fight Negative. Wraith uses her technology to publicly reveal Mister Negative is Martin Li, sending him into hiding. Spider-Man and Anti-Venom call a truce to their rivalry.|$|E
