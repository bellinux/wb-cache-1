5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force.

In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged <b>and</b> <b>remain</b> fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E

5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot <b>and</b> <b>remain</b> in {{sunlight}} when cold.

Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E
