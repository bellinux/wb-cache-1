5|$|Grow Home is an {{adventure}} platform video game developed by Ubisoft Reflections {{and published by}} Ubisoft. It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 4, 2015, and for PlayStation 4 on September 1, 2015. The game follows a robot named B.U.D., who is tasked with growing a plant that will oxygenate its home planet. Players explore an open world, moving B.U.D. and individually using each of its arms to climb <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> with objects.|$|E

5|$|Later Myst titles {{improved}} on {{the integration}} of live action sequences in the prerendered environments of the games. s developers filmed all the scenes using standard definition cameras, which producer Dan Irish would look back on as a mistake; without using high definition video cameras, the video did not look crisp at high resolutions.

5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|E

When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons why one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Legendia is a console {{role-playing}} game set in {{a fantasy}} world featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. The game is presented from a top-down perspective, and players must move their character {{through a number of}} locales, battle monsters, <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> with non-player characters to advance the story. Unlike previous games in the series where monsters were visible before being encountered, Tales of Legendia features randomized battles that occur every few steps while inside dungeons or other hostile areas.|$|E
5|$|The novel—Grossman's first—was written {{during his}} tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes cope with their powers <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> with one another. The potential motivations and perspectives of supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008.|$|E

5|$|The player {{constructs}} {{and manages}} a dungeon, recruiting and catering for minions {{to run it}} and defend it from enemy invaders. The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon, carry them around, and drop them. The hand allows the player to 'slap' creatures and objects, <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> with them. Dungeon Keeper gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who will follow the player and provide assistance in combat against enemies. As they are often key to the story, friendly characters must not be killed in combat except during scripted events. In between combat missions, the player can move around the USS Voyager <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> with other members of its crew, often performing non-combat tasks to progress the story.|$|E
5|$|Whedon {{was also}} keen on {{utilizing}} vertical space; thus, having the crew's quarters accessible by ladder was important. Another {{benefit of the}} set design was that it also allowed the actors {{to stay in the}} moment <b>and</b> <b>interact,</b> without having to stop after each shot and reset up for the next. This helped contribute to the documentary style Whedon strove for.|$|E

5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E
