5000|$|Many modern {{motorcycles}} {{feature a}} device called quickshifter for up-shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes {{pressure on the}} gear shift rod and quickshifter sends {{a signal to the}} ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power.

40|$|IntroductionThe failed or {{difficult}} airway is a rare, but life-threatening situation. <b>Alternative</b> airway <b>devices</b> to direct laryngoscopy are essential aids to manage these scenarios successfully. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine which <b>alternative</b> airway <b>devices</b> are currently available in public emergency centres in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted in 15 emergency centres. Data regarding the availability of different classes of <b>alternative</b> airway <b>devices</b> were documented on a standardised data collection sheet by a single investigator via direct observation. Incomplete or non-functional equipment was classified as unavailable. Summary statistics were used to describe the data. ResultsTwenty-six different types of <b>alternative</b> airway <b>devices</b> were documented. Three centres (20 %) had no <b>alternative</b> airway <b>device.</b> Five centres (33. 3 %) stocked only one device, three centres (20 %) had two devices and four centres (26. 7 %) had more than two devices. Most centres (n= 12, 80 %) stocked supraglottic airways (only one centre (6. 7 %) had paediatric sizes). Tracheal tube introducers were available in five centres (33. 3 %). Four centres (26. 7 %) had video-laryngoscopes, but none had optical laryngoscopes. Retroglottic devices and needle cricothyroidotomy equipment were available in two centres (13. 3 %). Although surgical cricothyroidotomy equipment was available, the equipment was widely dispersed and only three centres (20 %) had pre-packed sets available. None of the specialised paediatric centres had needle cricothyroidotomy equipment readily available. DiscussionThe study demonstrated that Western Cape public emergency centres are currently inadequately stocked with regard to <b>alternative</b> airway <b>devices.</b> A guideline regarding the procurement and implementation of these devices is needed...|$|R

40|$|NREL {{study may}} provide future {{guidance}} in improving CdS/CdTe photovoltaic device performance. The majority of minority carrier lifetime (MCL) studies performed on CdS/CdTe photovoltaic (PV) devices have correlated device performance primarily with the fast decay observed in time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements (t{sub 1 }). This decay {{is believed to}} be associated primarily with recombination in depletion width (W{sub D}), and therefore should be a good indicator of device quality if carrier generation occurs primarily within WD. However, although previous studies have shown that t 1 can be a good indicator of broad device quality, it does not correlate as well with small changes in device performance and/or with differences observed between superstrate and substrate devices. Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have shown that in this case, the parameter t{sub 2 } (from the longer-term decay of TRPL) may not only provide a better correlation with device open-circuit voltage (V{sub OC}) for superstrate devices but may also provide guidance for inter-comparison with <b>alternative</b> <b>device</b> designs (e. g., substrate devices). It is also suggested that previous studies may yield added value if a larger number of TRPL parameters (i. e., t{sub 1 }, t{sub 2 }, and respective amplitudes) are re-examined as a function of device performance. The parameter t{sub 2 } may not only provide a better correlation with device VOC for superstrate devices but may also provide guidance for inter-comparison with <b>alternative</b> <b>device</b> designs (e. g., substrate devices) ...|$|E
