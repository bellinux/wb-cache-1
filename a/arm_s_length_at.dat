40|$|<b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> is an idiomatic English phrase {{which refers}} to a metaphor that uses the human body as a measure. The hand is not {{directly}} joined to the body, it maintains an undeniable distance from the body, equivalent {{to the length of}} an arm. In this sense, the metaphorical meaning of being <b>at</b> <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> means to be at a certain distance, not too close and not too far away. The expression is often used in contract law, and a contract concluded between parties <b>at</b> <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> will ensure that the parties are independent and on equal footing when concluding the agreement. The National Credit Act applies to every credit agreement between parties dealing <b>at</b> <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length.</b> <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> is a novel concept in the South African credit vocabulary and not defined in the Act.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three chapters. In Chapter I (Price Caps with Capacity Precommitment), we study the effectiveness of price cap regulation in a monopolistic setting under demand uncertainty. In our model, a monopolist facing an uncertain demand. In the absence of capacity precommitment, price caps remain an effective regulatory instrument, {{just as they are}} when demand is deterministic. Price caps are also an effective instrument to regulate a monopoly that makes irreversible capacity investments ex-ante, and then chooses its output up to capacity upon observing the realization of demand. In this scenario, however, the optimal price cap must trade off the incentives for capacity investment and capacity withholding, is well above the unit cost of capacity and, when the unit cost of capacity is low, is below the price cap that maximizes capacity. Moreover, a price cap alone cannot eliminate inefficiencies. Under standard regularity assumptions on the demand distribution, the comparative static properties of price caps above the optimal price cap are analogous to those they have in the absence of capacity precommitment. The Chapter II and Chapter III are aimed at analyzing the competitive consequences of imposition of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle (ALP, henceforth) requirements for international transfer pricing. In order to discourage tax shifting activities by multinational fi rms, most countries follow taxation policies that are based on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, which recommend that, for tax purposes, internal pricing policies be consistent with ALP (i. e., that transfer prices between companies of multinational enterprises for tax purposes be established on a market value basis, thus comparable to transactions between independent, unrelated, parties). Moreover, ALP puts associated and independent enterprises on a more equal footing for tax purposes, it avoids the creation of tax advantages that would otherwise distort the relative competitive positions of either type of entity. The failure to comply with the ALP may result in a penalty. The OECD s recommendation that transfer prices between parent firms and their subsidiaries be consistent with the ALP for tax purposes does not restrict internal pricing policies. In Chapter II (Strategic Incentives for Keeping One Set of Books under the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle), we show that under imperfect competition parent rms accounting policies determine the properties of market outcomes: if parents keep one set of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices are consistent with the ALP), then competition in the external (home) market softens (intensi es) relative to an equilibrium where parent fi rms and subsidiaries are integrated. In contrast, if rms keep two sets of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices differ from those used for tax purposes) or maintain asymmetric accounting policies, then competition intensi es in both markets. Keeping one set of books turns out to be an equilibrium for most of the parameter space. In Chapter III (The Non-Neutrality of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle with Imperfect Competition), we show that under imperfect competition the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle is non-neutral: a strict (lax) application of the ALP softens competition among subsidiaries (parents). Thus, under imperfect competition regulating transfer pricing optimally requires trading off its impact on market outcomes and tax revenue...|$|R

This paper tests these hypotheses using an unbalanced panel of 9, 000 listed firms from 41 developed and developing markets, from 1990 to 2006. The empirical results confirm that managers use {{the information contained in}} the price-earnings ratios to make investment decisions.

40|$|Many studies into {{construction}} procurement methods reveal {{evidence of}} a {{need to change the}} culture and attitude in the construction industry, transition from traditional adversarial relationships to cooperative and collaborative relationships. At the same time there is also increasing concern and discussion on alternative procurement methods, involving a movement away from traditional procurement systems. Relational contracting approaches, such as partnering and relationship management, are business strategies that align the objectives of clients, commercial participants and stakeholders. It provides a collaborative environment and a framework for all participants to adapt their behaviour to project objectives and allows for engagement of those subcontractors and suppliers down the supply chain. The efficacy of relationship management in the client and contractor groups is proven and well documented. However, the industry has a history of slow implementation of relational contracting down the supply chain. Furthermore, there exists little research on relationship management conducted in the supply chain context. This research aims to explore the association between relational contracting structures and processes and supply chain sustainability in the civil engineering construction industry. It endeavours to shed light on the practices and prerequisites for relationship management implementation success and for supply sustainability to develop. The research methodology is a triangulated approach based on Cheung. s (2006) earlier research where questionnaire survey, interviews and case studies were conducted. This new research includes a face-to-face questionnaire survey that was carried out with 100 professionals from 27 contracting organisations in Queensland from June 2008 to January 2009. A follow-up survey sub-questionnaire, further examining project participants. perspectives was sent to another group of professionals (as identified in the main questionnaire survey). Statistical analysis including multiple regression, correlation, principal component factor analysis and analysis of variance were used to identify the underlying dimensions and test the relationships among variables. Interviews and case studies were conducted to assist in providing a deeper understanding as well as explaining findings of the quantitative study. The qualitative approaches also gave the opportunity to critique and validate the research findings. This research presents the implementation of relationship management from the contractor. s perspective. Findings show that the adaption of relational contracting approach in the supply chain is found to be limited; contractors still prefer to keep the suppliers and subcontractors <b>at</b> <b>arm.</b> <b>s</b> <b>length.</b> This research shows that the degree of match and mismatch between organisational structuring and organisational process has an impact on staff. s commitment level and performance effectiveness.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{subjective}} straight-ahead {{direction is}} a very basic perceptual reference for spatial orientation and locomotion. The perceived straight-ahead along the horizontal and vertical meridian is largely determined by both otolith and somatosensory inputs which are altered in microgravity. The Straight Ahead in Microgravity (SAM) experiment will be conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) to examine how this spatial processing changes {{as a function of}} spaceflight. METHODS Data will be collected before the flight, at one-month intervals during long-duration stay (180 days) on board ISS, and after return to Earth. Control studies will also be performed during parabolic flights. Three different protocols will be used in each test session: (1) Fixation: The subject will be asked to look at actual targets (normal vision) and then to imagine these same targets (occluded vision) in the straight-ahead direction. Targets will be located <b>at</b> near distance (<b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length,</b> ~ 0. 5 m), medium distance (~ 1 m), and far distance (beyond 2 m). This task will be successively performed with subject s body aligned with the spacecraft interior, and with subject s body tilted forward and backward by an operator. (2) Saccades: The subject will be asked to make horizontal and vertical saccades, first relative to the spacecraft interior reference system, and then relative to the subject s head reference system. This task will be successively performed with subject s body aligned with the spacecraft interior, and with subject s body tilted in roll or in pitch by an operator. (3) Linear Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) : The subject will be asked to stare at actual visual targets (normal vision) at various distances (near, medium, far) in the straight-ahead direction. Vision will then be occluded, and the subject will be asked to continue staring at the same imagined targets while he/she is passively translated forward-backward, up-down, or side-to-side. The subject's body motion will be performed by the restrained operator while the subject is free-floating. EXPECTED RESULTS The coupling of downward gaze with vergence eye movements observed on Earth is expected to increase in microgravity. Saccadic eye movements made in darkness along perceived axes are expected to be more closely aligned with the body s longitudinal axis in 0 g compared to 1 g, as the reference system for spatial orientation moves from an allocentric (gravitational) to an egocentric (idiotropic) vector. Changes in the linear VOR will reflect adaptive changes in otolith-ocular reflex contributions to the perceived straight-ahead. DISCUSSION A change in an individual's egocentric reference might have negative consequences on evaluating the direction of an approaching object or on the accuracy of reaching movements or locomotion. Consequently, investigating how microgravity affects the egocenter is important for understanding the problems associated with long-term effects of microgravity on astronauts' and how they re-adapt to the return of gravitational forces on Earth or other planetary surfaces.

Solute injection experiments were done in study catchments comprised of sandstone-siltstone (site l), volcanic tuff (site 2), and granite-gneiss (site 3).

40|$|This article {{examines}} the current transfer pricing regime to consider {{whether it is a}} sound model to be applied to modern multinational entities. The arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> price methodology is examined to enable a discussion of the arguments in favour of such a regime. The article then refutes these arguments concluding that, contrary to the very reason multinational entities exist, applying arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> rules involves a legal fiction of imagining transactions between unrelated parties. Multinational entities exist to operate in a way that independent entities would not, which the arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> rules fail to take into account. As such, there is clearly an air of artificiality in applying the arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> standard. To demonstrate this artificiality with respect to modern multinational entities, multinational banks are used as an example. The article concluded that the separate entity paradigm adopted by the traditional transfer pricing regime is incongruous with the economic theory of modern multinational enterprises...|$|R

The significance of these three parameters is determined from temperature comparison obtained by 3 D Silvaco-Atlas device simulator. The first three simulations focus on temperature variation with the three factors at different output power density respectively. The results indicate that both the thinner die thickness and the broaden pitch <b>S</b> <b>length</b> have distinct advantages over the shorter finger width. The device, at the same time, exhibits higher temperature at a larger output power density. Simulations are further carried out on structure with combination of different pitch <b>s</b> <b>length</b> and die thickness at a large 1 W/mm output power density and the temperature reduction reaches as high as 55 %...|$|R
40|$|Suppose X 1,X 2,⋯ is a {{sequence}} of independent and identically distributed random elements taking values in a finite set S of size |S|≥ 2 with probability distribution P(X=s) =p(s) > 0 for s∈S. P. Pevzner [Kvantl 5 (1987), 4 [...] 15; per bibl. ] has conjectured that for every probability distribution P there exists an N> 0 such that for every word A with letters in <b>S</b> whose <b>length</b> is <b>at</b> least N, there exists a second word B of the same length as A, such that the event that B appears before A in the sequence X 1,X 2,⋯ has greater probability than that of A appearing before B. In this paper it is shown that a distribution P satisfies Pevzner's conclusion {{if and only if}} the maximum value of P, p, and the secondary maximum c satisfy the inequality c>p(1 −p) /(1 +p). For |S|= 2 or |S|= 3, the inequality is true and the conjecture holds. If c≤p(1 −p) /(1 +p), then the conjecture is true when A is not allowed to consist of pure repetitions of that unique element for which the distribution takes on its mode...|$|R
