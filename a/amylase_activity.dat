5000|$|In {{areas where}} high-gluten hard wheat is readily {{available}} {{the need for a}} complex polyculture of bacteria and yeast can often be reduced or removed by adding a large proportion of hard wheat flour to the rye flour. Its added gluten compensates for <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> on the starch in the dough, allowing the bread to retain its structure as it bakes. The [...] "deli rye" [...] tradition in the United States is based upon this mixing of grains. Use of high-gluten wheat flour also makes possible multigrain breads, such as the [...] "rye and Indian" [...] bread of the American colonies, which combined rye and wheat with cornmeal in one loaf.|$|E
50|$|Sprouting or pre-harvest {{germination}} {{is caused}} by damp or rainy weather conditions during {{the final stage of}} maturation of the crop. The germination causes an accelerated production of the starch degrading enzyme alpha-amylase. Severely sprouted grain kernels can contain several thousand times the amount of enzyme of sound unsprouted kernels. Because of this, very low levels of severely sprouted kernels mixed into sound wheat can cause the entire lot to exhibit significant <b>amylase</b> <b>activity.</b> Since its introduction in the early 1960s, the FN test has become a world standard in the grain and flour milling industries for measuring alpha-amylase activity in wheat, durum wheat, triticale, rye and barley, as well as milled products made from these grains.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of two <b>amylase</b> <b>activities</b> which {{differ in their}} substrate specificity and subcellular location {{as well as a}} chloroplast-associated R-enzyme (debranching activity) are reported. An extrachloroplastic amylase is resolved by gel filtration chromatography into two activities of 80, 000 and 40, 000 daltons. Both extrachloroplastic activities hydrolyze amylopectin and shellfish glycogen and only slowly hydrolyze rabbit liver glycogen, β-limit amylopectin, and amylose. In contrast, the major chloroplastic amylase attacks all of these glucans at comparable rates. Glucan hydrolysis by both the extrachloroplastic and chloroplastic amylase generates not only maltose but appreciable amounts of other oligosaccharides, whereas maltotetraose hydrolysis produces glucose, maltose, and maltotriose. The action patterns displayed by the <b>amylase</b> <b>activities</b> indicate that both are endoamylases, although they lack the typical Ca 2 + requirement or heat stability of seed endosperm α-amylases.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether hyperglycaemia or hyperlipidaemia causes pancreatitis in cats and to assess the effect of excess serum glucose and lipids on <b>amylase</b> and lipase <b>activity.</b> Ten-day hyperglycaemic and hyperlipidaemic clamps were carried out in five and six healthy cats, respectively. Ten healthy cats received saline and served as controls. The <b>activity</b> of <b>amylase</b> was below the normal range in 4 of 5 hyperglycaemic cats by day 10. The activity of lipase did not vary in any of the cats. Samples of exocrine pancreas were normal on histological examination, but the number of tissue neutrophils was increased in hyperglycaemic cats (P< 0. 05). In a retrospective study 14 of 40 (35 %) cats with naturally occurring diabetes mellitus had <b>amylase</b> <b>activities</b> below the reference range at the time of admission. <b>Amylase</b> <b>activities</b> normalised within 1 week of insulin therapy and subsequent glycaemic control. Lipase activity was increased in 26 of 40 (65 %) diabetic cats and remained elevated despite glycaemic control. In conclusion, hyperglycaemia, but not hyperlipidaemia, increases pancreatic neutrophils in cats. However, because the histological morphology of the exocrine pancreas was normal, hyperglycaemia may play only a minor role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis. Low <b>amylase</b> <b>activities</b> in diabetic cats may reflect an imbalance in glucose metabolism rather than pancreatitis...|$|R

5000|$|Amylase {{is found}} in saliva and breaks starch into maltose and dextrin. This form of amylase is also called [...] "ptyalin" [...] It will break large, {{insoluble}} starch molecules into soluble starches (amylodextrin, erythrodextrin, and achrodextrin) producing successively smaller starches and ultimately maltose. Ptyalin acts on linear α(1,4) glycosidic linkages, but compound hydrolysis requires an enzyme that acts on branched products. Salivary amylase is inactivated in the stomach by gastric acid. In gastric juice adjusted to pH 3.3, ptyalin was totally inactivated in 20 minutes at 37 °C. In contrast, 50% of <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> remained after 150 minutes of exposure to gastric juice at pH 4.3. Both starch, the substrate for ptyalin, and the product (short chains of glucose) are able to partially protect it against inactivation by gastric acid. Ptyalin added to buffer at pH 3.0 underwent complete inactivation in 120 minutes; however, addition of starch at a 0.1% level resulted in 10% of the activity remaining, and similar addition of starch to a 1.0% level resulted in about 40% of the activity remaining at 120 minutes.|$|E

Brain and liver samples were taken at 6, 12 and 24 h after drug administration. Brain and liver tissues alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase and <b>amylase</b> <b>activities</b> were measured by auto-analyzer.
