5|$|Preventing Aβ <b>aggregation</b> is a {{promising}} method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a literature review article. In 2008, Folding@home simulated {{the dynamics of}} Aβ <b>aggregation</b> in atomic detail over timescales {{of the order of}} tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used {{the results of this study}} to identify a beta hairpin that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future <b>aggregation</b> studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the <b>aggregation</b> process.|$|E
5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular <b>aggregation</b> is induced. <b>Aggregation</b> in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that <b>aggregation</b> is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular <b>aggregation</b> mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular <b>aggregation</b> enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} genetic disorder {{that is associated with}} protein misfolding and <b>aggregation.</b> Excessive repeats of the glutamine amino acid at the N-terminus of the Huntingtin protein cause <b>aggregation,</b> and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with rational drug design methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the Huntingtin protein accelerates this <b>aggregation,</b> and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.|$|E

50|$|<b>Aggregations</b> {{are common}} among diapausing {{tropical}} insects, {{especially in the}} orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera. <b>Aggregations</b> {{may be used as}} protection against predation, since aggregating species are frequently toxic and predators quickly learn to avoid them. They can also serve to reduce water loss, as seen in the fungus beetle, Stenotarsus rotundus, which forms <b>aggregations</b> of up to 70,000 individuals, which may be eight beetles deep. Relative humidity is increased within the <b>aggregations</b> and beetles experience less water loss, probably due to decreased surface area to volume ratios reducing evaporative water loss.|$|R
50|$|Having {{aggregates}} and atomic data {{increases the}} complexity of the dimensional model. This complexity should be transparent to the users of the data warehouse, thus when a request is made, the data warehouse should return data from the table with the correct grain. So when requests to the data warehouse are made, aggregate navigator functionality should be implemented, to help determine the correct table with the correct grain. The number of possible <b>aggregations</b> is determined by every possible combination of dimension granularities. Since it would produce a lot of overhead to build all possible <b>aggregations,</b> {{it is a good idea}} to choose a subset of tables on which to make <b>aggregations.</b> The best way to choose this subset and decide which <b>aggregations</b> to build is to monitor queries and design <b>aggregations</b> to match query patterns.|$|R

5|$|Social <b>aggregation</b> is well {{documented}} in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant adult females have been observed slowly swimming in circles in shallow water, occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations in shallow water from March to June. The number of sharks per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the <b>aggregation</b> area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest {{part of the day}} in the afternoon, and dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the <b>aggregation</b> site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be taking advantage of the warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.|$|E

40|$|How sociality evolves and is {{maintained}} remains {{a key question}} in evolutionary biology. Most studies to date have focused on insects, birds, and mammals but data from {{a wider range of}} taxonomic groups are essential to identify general patterns and processes. The extent of social behaviour among squamate reptiles is under-appreciated, yet they are a promising group for further studies. Living in <b>aggregations</b> is posited as an important step in the evolution of more complex sociality. We review data on <b>aggregations</b> among squamates and find evidence for some form of <b>aggregations</b> in 94 species across 22 families.

40|$|Fish {{navigate}} a sea {{of chemical}} signatures, which can guide their movements through their environment. Chemoreception is integral to how larval fish find reef habitat and adult fish find home. Yet, the chemicals responsible for driving fish behavior are largely unknown, and the chemical seascapes through which fish navigate are changing with shifting environmental conditions. To investigate the possible suite of chemical cues employed by fishes {{in their search for}} foraging hot-spots, we collected 10 l samples of water from the center of natural foraging <b>aggregations.</b> These <b>aggregations</b> were composed of multiple fish species from several trophic levels over the reefs of Belize. We then conducted bioassays on wild-caught Abudefduf saxatilis (N = 84) in laboratory flow tanks using previously frozen seawater samples and extracted compounds from foraging <b>aggregations</b> and paired control sites. Capturing seawater from the midst of natural foraging <b>aggregations,</b> filtering this over C 18 resin, and presenting the eluted compounds to a reef fish elicited a significant behavioral response of spending more time in water that contained C 18 extracts from fish <b>aggregations</b> compared to controls (p = 0. 03).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Researches on roadkill <b>aggregations</b> are {{important}} tools for wildlife conservation. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine wild vertebrate roadkill <b>aggregations</b> on a stretch of 96 kilometers of the BR- 050 highway, between the cities of Uberlândia and Uberaba, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The survey was conducted between April 2012 and March 2013. Roadkill monitoring was performed by car, at a speed of approximately 60 km/h, and forty two (42) weekly trips, totaling 8064 km, were performed. The 2 D Ripley's K-Statistics test from the Siriema v 1. 1 program was used to detect the scales of roadkill <b>aggregations</b> and 2 D HotSpot Identification test was used to identify the location of these hotspots. <b>Aggregations</b> extended from the following kms: 14 to 33, 38, 41 to 51, 66 to 70 and 78 to 94.

40|$|Many {{coral reef}} fishes migrate to form {{short-lived}} <b>aggregations</b> at predictable sites and times {{in order to}} spawn. For {{the purposes of this}} review, such spawning <b>aggregations</b> are defined as any temporary <b>aggregations</b> formed by fishes that have migrated for the specific purpose of spawning. Spawning <b>aggregations</b> are known to be formed by 164 species from 26 families of coral reef fishes, but the actual number is likely to be much higher. Aggregative spawners share a number of common features. (1) All except one species release pelagic eggs. (2) They tend to have large body sizes. (3) They are more abundant in some phylogenetic groups, such as the Labridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Acanthuridae, and Lutjanidae, although they are relatively uncommon in all but the least speciose families of Albulidae, Chanidae, Gerreidae, and Scombridae. (4) They are more likely to come from large populations with high densities. However, these features are not independent and their relative importance is not easily assessed. Known spawning <b>aggregations</b> form at the same sites over successive, predictable spawning seasons. However, from the limited data presently available, spawning <b>aggregations</b> do not appear to form consistently on predictable reef structures. The periodicity of spawning <b>aggregations</b> can differ greatly for the same species with relatively small degrees of spatial separation. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain why, when, and where spawning <b>aggregations</b> are formed. These include those that predict that the phenomenon of aggregative spawning (1) reduces predation on spawning adults and their eggs (the predator satiation hypothesis), (2) increases the degree of mate selectivity, and (3) allows individuals to assess sex ratios of populations and make decisions on sex change accordingly. Other hypotheses predict that the location and timing of spawning <b>aggregations</b> (1) reduce predation on both eggs (the egg predation hypothesis) and spawning adults (the predator evasion hypothesis), (2) increase the probability that larvae will settle on reefs (the egg dispersal hypothesis and the larval retention hypothesis), and (3) enhance the survival of larvae during their pelagic phase (the pelagic survival hypothesis). However, very little quantitative research addressed at an appropriate scale has been conducted to distinguish among these hypotheses, many of which make common predictions. Spawning <b>aggregations</b> of commercially important coral reef fishes have been lost in many locations throughout the tropics because unsustainable fishing targets the spawning <b>aggregations</b> themselves. The live reef food-fish trade has proven to be unsustainable in almost all locations in which it has operated, leading to widespread impoverishment and eradication of spawning <b>aggregations.</b> Appropriate management, legislation, and enforcement are essential to protect the stocks of commercially important aggregative spawners, as is a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of spawning <b>aggregations...</b>|$|R

50|$|Slimehead {{behaviour}} is {{not well}} studied, but some species sporadically form dense <b>aggregations.</b> In {{the case of the}} orange roughy, these <b>aggregations</b> (possibly segregated according to sex) may reach a population density of 2.5/m²;. The <b>aggregations</b> form in and around geologic structures, such as undersea canyons and seamounts, likely where water movement and mixing is high, ensuring dense concentrations of prey items. The <b>aggregations</b> do not necessarily form for the purpose of spawning; it is thought that the fish cycle through metabolic phases (feeding and resting) and seek areas with ideal hydrologic conditions to congregate during their inactive and active phases. Observations of orange roughy <b>aggregations</b> during submersible dives have also shown the fish lose almost all pigmentation while inactive, during which time they are very approachable. The orange roughy's metabolic phases are thought to be related to seasonal variations in the fish's prey concentrations, with the inactive phase being a means to conserve energy during lean periods.|$|R
