5|$|Halley's <b>apparition</b> of 1456 {{was also}} {{witnessed}} in Kashmir and depicted {{in great detail}} by Śrīvara, a Sanskrit poet and biographer to the Sultans of Kashmir.

Some claim that Genghis Khan was inspired to turn his conquests toward Europe by the 1222 <b>apparition.</b> The 1301 <b>apparition</b> may have been seen by the artist Giotto di Bondone, who represented the Star of Bethlehem as a fire-colored comet in the Nativity section of his Arena Chapel cycle, completed in 1305. Its 1378 appearance is recorded in the Annales Mediolanenses {{as well as in}} East Asian sources.|$|E

5|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final <b>apparition</b> of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in the face of his {{accepted}} impending death and suggesting that they may share an afterlife now. He finally understands and embraces his death, moments before the star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's <b>apparition</b> picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E

5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female <b>apparition</b> in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) {{performed}} the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime.

50|$|The Catholic Church {{has made}} {{successive}} {{comments on the}} status of the Medjugorje <b>apparitions.</b> Each has declared non constat; that is, it cannot confirm the supernatural nature of the <b>apparitions</b> and that more study of the <b>apparitions</b> would be needed.

25|$|The Catholic church {{distinguishes between}} the <b>apparitions</b> within divine revelation - {{such as the}} risen Jesus' <b>apparitions</b> to the Apostles and {{the sign of the}} woman in the Book of Revelation - and <b>apparitions</b> without divine revelation – such as Our Lady of Fatima and the <b>apparitions</b> to Saint Mary Magdalene – because the age of divine revelation was closed with the {{completion}} of the New Testament when the last of the Apostles died.|$|R

5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an <b>apparition</b> of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, {{descending}} through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The <b>apparition</b> is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E
5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an <b>apparition</b> of the murdered Banquo, along with eight of his descendants. The scene carries deep significance: King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was {{believed}} to be separated from Banquo by nine generations. What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, a very real fulfilment of the witches' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take the throne. This <b>apparition</b> is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E
