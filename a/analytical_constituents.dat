They are tephrosin (1), 6 a, 12 a-dehydrodeguelin (2), vitexin (3), afrormosin- 7 -O-β-d-glucopyranoside (4), 2 ″-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl isovitexin (5), rutin (6), chrysoeriol (7), 7 -O-methylluteolin (8), trans-p-coumaric acid (9), 2 -benzyl- 4, 6 -dihydroxybenzoic acid- 4 -O-β-d-glucopyranoside (10), formononetin (11), quercetin (12), apigenin (13), β-sitosterol (14), and β-daucosterol (15). Compounds 3, 4, 5, and 7 – 9 were isolated from A. fruticosa L. for the first time. Cytotoxicity of individual compounds 3 – 10 and 90 % ethanol extract against human cancer cell lines HCT 116 and HepG 2 were reported. The results suggested that compounds 7 and 8, and the crude extract exhibited inhibitory effects on human cancer cell line HCT 116, at concentrations of 100  μg/mL, 5  μg/mL, and 25  μg/mL at < 60 % of cell viability rate, respectively. In addition, a valid high-performance liquid chromatography diode array detector method was established to quantitatively analyze compounds 1 – 12 in the leaves of A. fruticosa L., which was harvested at three different stages of maturity from May 20 to August 10, 2014.

40|$|The paper, {{written for}} the centennial celebration of Kalecki’s birth, {{considers}} the legacy for modern macroeconomics of Kalecki’s theory of income determination, which is reconstructed in its <b>analytical</b> <b>constituent</b> parts, referring in detail to the original sources. Kalecki’s macroeconomics is notable for having {{been the first to}} be built, unlike Keynes’ but alike the contemporary New- Keynesian macroeconomic models, in an imperfectly competitive framework and, at the same time, for linking the theory of distribution, on the one side, and the theory of income determination, on the other. Kalecki’s theory of income distribution is based, notwithstanding the sometimes heroic simplifications on which it rests, on the basic idea that the structure of distribution in a market economy depends on the structure of market imperfections and of market power. This is an important idea which leads to a deep understanding of the way the capitalist economy actually works and which constitutes a lasting contribution to modern economics. Important pieces of Kalecki’s theoretical construction, such as the basic idea of building the theory of income determination in an imperfectly competitive framework, the implicit assumption of the isoelastic transposition of demand curves, his use of the notion of the degree of monopoly in the framework of macroeconomic models, have been a lasting legacy to the toolkit of modern economics in general and modern macroeconomics in particular. Unlike part of contemporary macroeconomic theorizing, which takes place in the framework of abstract models, following an intrinsic logical development with a momentum of its own, Kalecki was always much concerned, in his theoretical constructions, with real world data and burning real world policy issues. Yet his basic message, dating back to his contributions in the early thirties, that demand creation by governments could provide the basic solution to the unemployment issue, a solution which in capitalist economies would remain unimplemented in practice for the political difficulties it implies, has proved of non-lasting value, aside from its continuing ideological impact. ...|$|R

In order to complement these studies with the analytical aspect, the Unidad de Arqueometría (UA) of the Instituto de Ciencia de los Materiales (ICMUV) of the Universitat de València, has developed Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) equipment, applied to the art work analysis.

This work considers piezoelectric materials that respond linearly to changes in electric field, electric displacement, mechanical stress and strain and thermal effects. This combination of electric fields and thermo-mechanical response in smart composite structures is characterized by piezoelectric and thermal expansion coefficients. The problem is represented by unit-cell and the models are developed using the AHM and the FEA to determine the effective piezoelectric and thermal expansion coefficients. Each unit cell contains a number of orthotropic inclusions in the form of structural reinforcements and actuators.

The molecular weight profiles of carboxylic acids and of “neutral ” metabolites in the urine of patients with infectious hepatitis were compared with those in urine of normals. The “neutral ” metabolites showed 24 characteristic spectral differences in the range 68 to 215 atomic mass units, which provided correct diagnoses in 100 % of the cases and a “diagnostic power” 6 f unity. These results are even more encouraging than those obtained earlier with the acidic metabolites, where 11 mass numbers were found in the same mass range to be useful for correct diagnoses in 91 % of the cases.

40|$|The archival body of {{knowledge}} had its origin in the legal disciplines and developed over the centuries through integration with philological and historical disciplines. In other words, archival science grew out of humanistic knowledge and reached its maturity as a humanistic science, which addressed its own research questions using a method derived from its body of interdisciplinary theory, the "archival method," {{as it was called}} when developed in the 19 th century. In the past half century, archival science has slowly but consistently moved towards the social sciences, primarily because of the Anglo-Saxon tendency to include archival programs of education in schools of library and information studies. The movement to the social sciences is less common {{in other parts of the}} world, but it has had a strong impact on the nature of the discipline and on the character of the research conducted by its specialists. Increasingly, social sciences methods are used to solve archival problems and to address archival research questions. Although these methods are valid for certain types of issues, primarily of a practical nature, they have shown significant weaknesses in addressing issues that affect the core of archival theory and which, at this time of fast and seemingly uncontrollable use of new and emerging technologies, loom larger and larger.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{robustness}} of remote sensing algorithms for lakes, {{it is vital to}} understand the variability of inherent optical properties (IOPs) and their mass-specific representations (SIOPs). In this study, absorption coefficients for particulate and dissolved constituents were measured at 38 stations distributed over a biogeochemical gradient in Lake Balaton, Hungary. There was a large range of phytoplankton absorption (a ph(λ)) over blue and red wavelengths (aph(440) = 0. 11 – 4. 39 m− 1, aph(675) = 0. 048 – 2. 52 m− 1), while there was less variability in chlorophyll-specific phytoplankton absorption (a*ph(λ)) in the lake (a*ph(440) = 0. 022 ± 0. 0046 m 2 mg− 1, a*ph(675) = 0. 010 ± 0. 0020 m 2 mg− 1) and adjoining wetland system, Kis-Balaton (a*ph(440) = 0. 017 ± 0. 0015 m 2 mg− 1, a*ph(675) = 0. 0088 ± 0. 0017 m 2 mg− 1). However, in the UV, a*ph(350) significantly increased with increasing distance from the main inflow (Zala River). This was likely due to variable production of photoprotective pigments (e. g., MAAs) in response to the decreasing gradient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The slope of CDOM absorption (SCDOM) also increased from west to east due to larger terrestrial CDOM input in the western basins. Absorption by nonalgal particles (aNAP(λ)) was highly influenced by inorganic particulates, {{as a result of the}} largely mineral sediments in Balaton. The relative contributions to the absorption budget varied more widely than oceans with a greater contribution from NAP (up to 30 %), and wind speed affected the proportion attributed to NAP, phytoplankton, or CDOM. Ultimately, these data provide knowledge of the heterogeneity of (S) IOPs in Lake Balaton, suggesting the full range of variability must be considered for future improvement of <b>analytical</b> algorithms for <b>constituent</b> retrieval in inland waters...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{of surface}} waters is {{primarily}} done {{to detect the}} status and trends in water quality and to identify whether observed trends arise form natural or anthropogenic causes. Empirical quality of surface water quality data is rarely certain and knowledge of their uncertainties is essential to assess the reliability of water quality models and their predictions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the uncertainties in selected surface water quality data, i. e. &nbsp;suspended sediment, nitrogen fraction, phosphorus fraction, heavy metals and biological compounds. The methodology used to structure the uncertainty is based on the empirical quality of data and the sources of uncertainty in data (van Loon et al., 2006). A literature review was carried out including additional experimental data of the Elbe river. All data of compounds associated with suspended particulate matter have considerable higher sampling uncertainties than soluble concentrations. This is due to high variability's within the cross section of a given river. This variability is positively correlated with total suspended particulate matter concentrations. Sampling location has also considerable effect on the representativeness of a water sample. These sampling uncertainties are highly site specific. The estimation of uncertainty in sampling can only be achieved by taking at least a proportion of samples in duplicates. Compared to sampling uncertainties measurement and analytical uncertainties are much lower. Instrument quality can be stated well suited for field and laboratory situations for all considered <b>constituents.</b> <b>Analytical</b> errors can contribute considerable to the overall uncertainty of surface water quality data. Temporal autocorrelation of surface water quality data is present but literature on general behaviour of water quality compounds is rare. For meso scale river catchments reasonable yearly dissolved load calculations can be achieved using biweekly sample frequencies. For suspended sediments none of the methods investigated produced very reliable load estimates when weekly concentrations data were used. Uncertainties associated with loads estimates based on infrequent samples will decrease with increasing size of rivers...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{years of}} {{groundwater}} monitoring at the 200 Area Treated Effluent Disposal Facility (TEDF) {{have shown that}} the uppermost aquifer beneath the facility is unaffected by TEDF effluent. Effluent discharges have been well below permitted and expected volumes. Groundwater mounding from TEDF operations predicted by various models has not been observed, and waterlevels in TEDF wells have continued declining with the dissipation of the nearby B Pond System groundwater mound. <b>Analytical</b> results for <b>constituents</b> with enforcement limits indicate that concentrations of all these are below Practical Quantitation Limits, and some have produced no detections. Likewise, other constituents on the permit-required list have produced results that are mostly below sitewide background. Comprehensive geochemical analyses of groundwater from TEDF wells has shown that most constituents are below background levels as calculated by two Hanford Site-wide studies. Additionally, major ion proportions and anomalously low tritium activities suggest that groundwater in the aquifer beneath the TEDF has been sequestered from influences of adjoining portions of the aquifer and any discharge activities. This inference is supported by recent hydrogeologic investigations which indicate an extremely slow rate of groundwater movement beneath the TEDF. Detailed evaluation of TEDF-area hydrogeology and groundwater geochemistry indicate that additional points of compliance for groundwater monitoring would be ineffective for this facility, and would produce ambiguous results. Therefore, the current groundwater monitoring well network is retained for continued monitoring. A quarterly frequency of sampling and analysis is continued for all three TEDF wells. The constituents list is refined to include only those parameters key to discerning subtle changes in groundwater chemistry, those useful in detecting general groundwater quality changes from upgradient sources, or those retained for comparison with end-of-pipe discharge chemistry. Volatile and semivolatile organic compounds, ammonia, total organic carbon, oil and grease, and radium are removed from the constituent list. Annual analysis for low-level tritium is added to the constituent list to help confirm that groundwater beneath the TEDF remains isolated from operational influences...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{employs a}} finite element (FE) method for numerically {{simulating}} the mechanical response of constituents in a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite to indentation. Indentation {{refers to a}} procedure that subsumes a rigid indenter of specific geometry to impress {{the surface of a}} relatively softer material, with a view of estimating its mechanical properties. FE analyses are performed on a two-dimensional simplified microstructure of the FRP composite comprising perfectly bonded fiber, interphase and matrix sections. Indentation response of the constituents is first examined within the context of linearized elasticity. Time-dependent response of the polymer matrix is invoked by modeling the respective constituent section as a linear isotropic viscoelastic material. Furthermore, indentation responses to non-mechanical stimulus, like moisture absorption, is also simulated through a sequentially coupled analysis. A linear relationship describing the degradation of elastic moduli of the individual constituents with increasing moisture content has been assumed. The simulations subsume a point load idealization for the indentation load eventually substituted by indenter tips with conical and spherical profiles. Results from FE analyses in the form of load-displacement curves, displacement contours and stress contours are presented and discussed. With the application of concentrated load on linearly elastic constituents for a given/known degree of heterogenity in the FRP, simulations indicated the potential of indentation technique for determining interphase properties in addition to estimating the matrix-fiber interphase bond strength. Even with stiffer surrounding constituents, matrix characterization was rendered difficult. However, fiber properties were found to be determinable using the FE load-displacement data, when the load-displacement data from experimentation is made available. In the presence of a polymer (viscoelastic) matrix, the surrounding elastic constituents could be characterized for faster loading rates when viscoelastic effects are insignificant. Displacements were found to be greater {{in the presence of a}} polymer matrix and moisture content in comparison with a linearly elastic matrix and dry state. As one would expect, the use of different indenter tips resulted in varying responses. Conical tips resulted in greater displacements while concentrated load produced greater stresses. Further it was found that, despite the insignificant effects due to surrounding <b>constituents,</b> <b>analytical</b> (Flamant) solution for concentrated, normal force on a homogeneous, elastic half-plane becomes inapplicable in back calculating the elastic moduli of individual FRP constituents. This can be attributed to the finite domain and the associated boundary conditions in the problem of interest...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{absorption}} spectroscopy {{is a widely}} used <b>analytical</b> tool for <b>constituent</b> analysis in many applications. According to the Beer-Lambert law, the transmitted light intensity through a homogeneous medium is an exponential function of {{the product of the}} concentration, the total pathlength, and the absorption cross-section of the absorbing substance. By studying the intensity loss at the unique absorption band of the absorbing substance, its concentration can be retrieved. However, this method will encounter some difficulties if the light is not only absorbed but also strongly scattered in the material, e. g., in a turbid medium (biological tissues, porous ceramics, wood), which results in an unknown absorption pathlength. Such a problem can be solved by studying light propagation with different theoretical models, and the scattering and absorption properties are then retrieved. One aim of the present thesis work is to develop a new experimental approach to study light propagation in turbid media – frequency-modulated light scattering interferometry (FMLSI), originating from the well-known frequency-modulated continuous-wave technique in telecommunication field. This method provides new possibilities to study optical properties and Brownian motion simultaneously, which is particularly useful in biomedical applications, food science, and for colloidal suspensions in general. Another important application of {{absorption spectroscopy}} is to monitor gas concentration in turbid media, where the gas absorption pathlength is a priori unknown due to heavy light scattering in the porous medium. The technique is referred to as gas in scattering media absorption spectroscopy (GASMAS), and is based on the principle that the absorption spectrum of gases is much narrower than that for the solid- or liquid-phase host materials. By linearly scanning the wavelength of the light source across an absorption line of the gas and examining the absorption imprint superimposed on the transmitted light signal, the very weak intensity loss due to the gas of interest can be measured for gas concentration assessment. In order to obtain the absolute gas concentration, a focus in the present thesis work is to determine the gas absorption pathlength in turbid media. The FMLSI technique is proposed to obtain the mean optical pathlength – the total pathlength through both the pores and the matrix material. The combined method of FMLSI and GASMAS techniques is then developed to study porous media, where an average gas concentration in the porous media can be obtained. A conventional method for pathlength or optical properties determination – frequency domain photon migration – is also combined with the GASMAS technique to study the total gas absorption pathlength and the porosities of ceramics, which, as a result, also contributes to further understanding of light propagation in porous media. Another method is also proposed to get the absolute gas concentration without knowing the optical pathlength. It is based on absorption line shape analysis – relying {{on the fact that the}} line shape depends upon the concentration of the buffer gas. This method is found to be very useful for, e. g., gas concentration monitoring in food packaging...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{which has}} been dealt with in this paper {{is a continuation of}} earlier work carried out in 1932 on species of grasses grown on separate plots and exposed to the same climatic conditions while being subjected to the following system of cutting: A portion of each plot was cut at monthly intervals, another portion of the plot was cut at two-monthly intervals, a third portion at three-monthly intervals, and so on, up to twelve months, when a sample of twelve months’ growth was taken off each plot. The grass resulting from each cutting was weighed when air-dry and sampled for <b>analytical</b> purposes. The <b>constituents</b> determined were crude protein, crude fibre, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, and chlorine, while the determination of soluble or silica-free ash was included {{towards the end of the}} investigation. Detailed data relating to all the cuts obtained from individual species from February, 1933, to February, 1934, are tabulated in an appendix. Average values for all the species combined have been chosen as a basis for discussion. (1) Grasses cut at monthly intervals are highest in percentage phosphorus and crude protein and lowest in percentage crude fibre. With decreased frequency of cutting the crude fibre content rises to a maximum at maturity, while the phosphorus and crude protein contents drop markedly to minima in the old mature herbage cut prior to the commencement of new growth in the following season. (2) The different frequencies of cutting do not appreciably influence the lime and magnesia contents of the herbage. (3) Pure species grown on the same soil and exposed to the same climatic conditions show appreciable differences in mineral and protein content when harvested after definite intervals, e. g. one month. (4) Fluctuations in the chemical composition of species cut at, say, monthly intervals during the growing season are indicated. These variations are attributed mainly to the stage of growth attained by the species and to the rainfall in so far as it influences the stage of growth. (5) Rainfall is the most important factor governing the yield from monthly cuts. (6) During dry seasons the phosphorus content of herbage cut at monthly intervals tends to be low. At the same time the percentage lime is high. The crude protein content does not appear to be adversely affected by drought. (7) The percentage of mineral constituents and crude protein are low and crude fibre high during seasons of plentiful rain. (8) Cutting at monthly intervals impairs the persistency of most species, Pennisetum ciliare and Cynodon dactylon being the only grasses not visibly affected by the severe treatment. (9) The highest yield of dry matter is obtained from pasture species by cutting at two-monthly intervals during the growing season. The evidence suggests that while the yield from fewer cuts or a single harvest may not be much smaller the herbage will definitely be of lower nutritive value. (10) The aggregate production of crude protein and phosphate is highest by cutting at two-monthly intervals. (11) The difference in nutritive value between herbage cut at monthly and two-monthly intervals becomes insignificant during seasons of dry weather conditions. (12) The date on which a system of cutting is initiated is found to exercise a determining influence on the productiveness of herbage plants in the course of the growing season. The production of dry matter seems to be depressed by a first cut during the period when active growth commences. (13) The practical suggestion which is a corollary to this investigation is that an attempt should be made to prevent natural pastures from growing undisturbed during the entire season if economic utilization of such pasture is to be made. Provided the effects of periodic cutting are at all comparable with grazing by animals this object appears to be attainable by following a system of management in which the pasture is grazed down at least once every two months during the active growing season depending, of course, on the prevailing climatic conditions and the botanical composition of the pasture.
