5|$|At Trenton, {{the highway}} crosses the Trent Canal {{and returns to}} an {{agricultural}} setting. It then crosses the Moira River <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through Belleville before heading eastward to Kingston. The Kingston portion of the highway, originally named the Kingston-Bypass, {{was one of the}} first sections of the highway to be completed; it is now mostly three lanes each way.|$|E
5|$|In North White Plains, {{the area}} that the road passes through becomes a little less {{developed}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> over a gentle rise from which a short connector runs downhill to the traffic circle where the BRP ends and the Taconic State Parkway begins, just south of Kensico Dam.|$|E
5|$|Pumping {{stations}} {{maintain the}} momentum of the oil <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through the pipeline. Pump Station 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but Pump Station 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with Pump Station 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|E

5|$|SR 198 then intersects Interstate 5 (I-5) in Fresno County {{near the}} Harris Ranch Airport before {{becoming}} a freeway west of Lemoore. The landscape becomes a bit less rural <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through Hanford and passes near the Hanford Municipal Airport, where it continues as a four-lane expressway from the intersection with SR 43 until SR 198 encounters a freeway-to-freeway interchange with SR 99 as it enters Visalia, the largest city it passes through, and goes by the Visalia Municipal Airport. It remains a freeway until east of Visalia, intersecting SR 65 and passing by College of the Sequoias. The road starts to climb the forested Sierra Nevada and ends at Sequoia National Park, near Lake Kaweah. This {{is one of the}} main routes providing access to Sequoia National Park, the other being SR 180 to the north.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{reaching}} Taylorsville, {{the highway}} intersects I-215. Shortly thereafter, the road passes Salt Lake Community College and enters West Valley City. It soon reaches a single-point urban interchange at SR-201 that {{lies on the}} border of West Valley City and Salt Lake City. The highway loses one lane in each direction past the frontage road of SR-201. West of Salt Lake City, the highway passes over the surplus canal of the Jordan River <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through the neighborhoods of Glendale and Poplar Grove. It arrives at an interchange with I-80 east of Salt Lake City International Airport. The road loses one lane northbound beyond 1000 North as it proceeds through the neighborhood of Rose Park in the northwestern portion of the city; the second southbound lane is lost north of 1300 North. The highway crosses the Jordan River before exiting the county.|$|E
5|$|The car speeds {{over the}} French {{countryside}} {{and into the}} Alps, leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> At the gates of Dijon, town officials {{try to stop the}} car to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends its way across the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such speed that, rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults up the stairs and crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly.|$|E

5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) later {{reports to}} Reyes and Scully that Comer has died. Reyes accuses Toothpick Man {{and others in}} the room of killing Comer. Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be {{protecting}} William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture of the craft began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises up out of the ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Route 182 intersection, the route crosses the Musconetcong River into Washington Township, Morris County, where it heads back into rural surroundings. About a mile into Morris County, US 46 divides {{and becomes a}} four-lane highway, turning north and {{crossing}} over a mountain. It continues into Mount Olive Township, taking a sharp turn to the east before the road becomes undivided while remaining four lanes. The road passes rural areas and development <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through Budd Lake. In this community, the route passes {{to the south of}} the namesake lake as it begins to turn northeast and then north. The road heads northeast again before it enters Netcong and becomes a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with I-80/US 206. Within this interchange, the lanes of US 46 split. From this point, the route narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and runs through developed areas of Netcong a short distance to the south of New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. US 46 meets Route 183 at an intersection (formerly Netcong Circle) before widening into a four-lane undivided road and leaving Netcong for Roxbury Township. Here, the road passes through wooded areas, meeting I-80 at another interchange and briefly becoming a divided highway at the crossing under I-80 and again at the actual interchange. US 46 remains a divided highway with jughandles past this point, continuing southeast into the Ledgewood area.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the younger version of Clarkson sitting at {{the back seat of}} a station wagon. Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts to the present day where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in a backyard party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.|$|E
5000|$|Reacting to {{the confessions}} Armstrong made in an {{interview}} with Oprah Winfrey, broadcast on 17 and 18 January 2013, Walsh said that [...] "the interview was fine in <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> but <b>it</b> did not <b>go</b> nearly far enough, and even in <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> I was particularly disappointed that he didn't admit {{what might be called the}} hospital room admission from 1996". Walsh was also disappointed that Armstrong failed to “name names".|$|R

25|$|The {{university}} hospital is actually {{older than the}} university, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> back to the earliest hospital, founded in Uppsala in 1302, much later merged with the university clinic. This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702 which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala. A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place, but was {{moved out of the}} town in 1811.|$|E
25|$|As {{all stripes}} are of {{different}} sizes, RAID-Z reconstruction has to traverse the filesystem metadata {{to determine the}} actual RAID-Z geometry. This would be impossible if the filesystem and the RAID array were separate products, whereas it becomes feasible {{when there is an}} integrated view of the logical and physical structure of the data. Going through the metadata means that ZFS can validate every block against its 256-bit checksum <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> whereas traditional RAID products usually cannot do this.|$|E
25|$|Michael Evans (main character): Michael {{does not}} appear onstage as a child, but his {{presence}} is alluded to by the other characters, while the adult Michael speaks his lines {{from the side of}} the stage. As a child, Michael is seen as being surrounded by love, since all five of the sisters dote on him. Michael also acts as a narrator, not only dictating the action <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on, but revealing the futures of the other characters in the play.|$|E

Comparison with surviving Greek and Latin fragments recommends the translation as literal and accurate so far <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> but suggests {{that some of the}} original content is missing. There are thought to be twelve original books, six on Genesis and six on Exodus.|$|E
25|$|A Web crawler {{starts with}} a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds. As the crawler visits these URLs, it {{identifies}} all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit, called the crawl frontier.

If the crawler is performing archiving of websites it copies and saves the information <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> The archives are usually stored in such a way they can be viewed, read and navigated as they were on the live web, but are preserved as ‘snapshots'.|$|E
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
