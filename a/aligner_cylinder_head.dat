5000|$|A {{crossflow}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> {{that features}} the {{intake and exhaust}} ports on opposite sides.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a piezoelectric sensor {{to pick up}} compression oscillations from combustion engines and its force-fitted clamped arrangement {{in the region of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gasket between the cylinder block and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> characterized by the following features: the piezoelectric component (4) is secured permanently to a fixed axial housing wall (2 a) within a housing (2) whose thickness is definable; said housing wall (2 a) is located in a directly or indirectly elastic clamping arrangement against one of the sealing surfaces of the cylinder block (20) or <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> (21) adjacent to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gasket (11). The sensor (1) can be supported, preferably by its housing wall (2 a), in a recess (23) in one of the sealing surfaces of the cylinder block (20) or the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> (21) adjacent to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gasket (11) and is thus arranged extending through the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gasket (11) and a groove (24) ...|$|R

5000|$|In engine technology, a {{reverse-flow}} or non-crossflow <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is {{one that}} locates the intake and exhaust ports {{on the same side}} of the engine.

5000|$|The [...] "K" [...] type engine had 2-valve <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> and ran at 600-680 rpm. The Mark I [...] "RK" [...] and [...] "V" [...] types had 2-valve <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b> The Mark II [...] "RK" [...] and [...] "V" [...] types had 4-valve <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b> They ran at 750-900 rpm, {{and were}} {{available}} with turbochargers and intercoolers.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem with}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> was the {{arrangement}} of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> fixing studs, half of which were vertical {{and the other half}} at an angle. The angled studs when heated and cooled, expanded and contracted at a different rate to the alloy heads, causing sideways forces which caused premature failure of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gaskets. Anecdotally this arrangement was to reduce production costs as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> mounting studs and bolt were all accessible with the rocker covers fitted. This allowed the factory to completely assemble the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> assembly before fitting to the engine. However this was not possible in the end due to the cam chain fitting and setting of the cam timing requiring the removal of the rocker covers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of modern automobile engines place the camshaft on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> in an overhead camshaft (OHC) design. There {{may be one}} or two camshafts in the cylinder head; a single camshaft design is called single overhead camshaft (SOHC). A design with two camshafts per <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is called double overhead camshaft (DOHC). Note that the camshafts are counted per <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> so a V engine with one camshaft in each of its two-cylinder heads is still an SOHC design, and a V engine with two camshafts per <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is DOHC, or informally a [...] "quad cam" [...] engine.|$|R

50|$|The OM 138 has one <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> for {{all four}} cylinders. The main part are the pre{{combustion}} chambers. They are located in a 45° angle above the combustion chamber {{and placed in a}} bulge in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> Like other early OM diesel engines, the OM 138 has a sieve for fuel spraying purposes between the main combustion chamber and precombustion chamber. The injection nozzles inject fuel into the precombustion chambers, they are mounted on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and can be maintained with ease. The glowplugs are mounted underneath the injection nozzles and are easily accessible as well. On it′s precombustion chamber side, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> also has the pushrods necessary for the OHV valvetrain.

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to predict the design {{performance}} based on the stress/strain and thermal stress behaviour of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> under various operating conditions. The effects of engine operating conditions such as combustion gas temperature and maximum internal pressure, components initial temperature and engine speed on the stress and thermal stress behaviour of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> have been analyzed. The analysis was carried out using a finite element analysis (FEA) software package, MSC. NASTRAN which is use to simulate and predict the von-Mises stress and strain pattern and thermal distribution of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> structure during the combustion process in the engine and the geometry modelling was carried out using a popular computeraided engineering tool, CATIA V 5. The result {{can be used to}} determine the quality of the design as well as identify areas which require further improvement. In this investigation, structural analyses of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> highlight several areas of interest. The maximum stress is found not exceeding the material strength of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> and thus the basic design criteria, namely no yielding and no structural failure under firing load case, can be satisfied. In addition, the effect of thermal stress/strain provides a good indication on structural integrity and reliability of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> which can be improved {{in the early stages of}} design. This steadystate finite element method (FEM) stress analysis can play a very effective role in the rapid prototyping of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R
