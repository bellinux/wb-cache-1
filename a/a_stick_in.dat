5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned to death with <b>a</b> <b>stick.</b> <b>In</b> Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E

25|$|In the North, {{the troops}} of ’Ali Ben Ghedhahem tried {{to oppose the}} advance of a General Rustum's column as it {{approached}} El Kef. Some of his close allies were however betrayed and {{handed over to the}} Bey's forces. His lieutenant was given a thousand strokes with <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> front of the women of the harem in the Bardo palace, and thrown barely alive into a dungeon. Soon a second mhalla under Ali Bey joined up with Rustum's forces. To avoid annihilation, Ben Ghedhahem and 5,000 of his men slipped away over the Algerian border to take refuge with the Nemencha people in January 1865. With him out of the way, the northwest was subjected to the same exactions as the Sahel and fines were imposed, though as more of the population were nomadic they could more easily evade the army by moving around. Crops and herds were seized as elsewhere, but as prices collapsed there was little value in them. The army therefore resorted to gruesome extorsions from even those settled areas which had remained loyal.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl {{lozenges}} (Actiq) are a solid {{formulation of}} fentanyl citrate on <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of}} a lollipop that dissolves slowly in the mouth for transmucosal absorption. These lozenges are intended for opioid-tolerant individuals and are effective in treating breakthrough cancer pain. It has also been used for breakthrough pain for patients with nonmalignant (not cancer related) pain, but this application is controversial. The unit is a berry-flavoured lozenge on a stick swabbed on the mucosal surfaces inside the mouth—inside of the cheeks, under and on the tongue and gums—to release the fentanyl quickly into the system. It is most effective when the lozenge is consumed within 15 minutes. About 25 % of the drug is absorbed through the oral mucosa, resulting in a fast onset of action, and the rest is swallowed and absorbed in the small intestine, acting more slowly. The lozenge is less effective and acts more slowly if swallowed as a whole, as despite good absorbance from the small intestine there is extensive first-pass metabolism, leading to an oral bioavailability of about 33 % as opposed to 50 % when used correctly, (25 % via the mouth mucosa and 25 % via the gut).|$|E

500|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to be intentionally flown into by a reconnaissance aircraft. During the morning hours of July27, British pilots were training at Bryan Field in Bryan, Texas and were alerted about a hurricane approaching the Galveston area. Upon becoming informed that the planes {{would need to be}} flown away from the storm, they criticized this policy. Instead, Colonel Joe Duckworth made a bet with the British pilots that he could fly his AT-6 Texan trainer directly into the storm. Duckworth requested that Lt. Colonel Ralph O'Hair, the only navigator at the field, fly into the hurricane with him. Because neither Duckworth nor O'Hair believed that the headquarters would approve the flight, they decided to proceed without permission. Thus, Duckworth and O'Hair became the first hurricane hunters. O'Hair later compared the weather encountered during the flight to [...] "being tossed about like <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> a dog's mouth". After returning to Bryan Field, Lt. William Jones-Burdick requested to fly into the hurricane with Duckworth, while O'Hair decided to exit the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|McCay was {{evacuated}} {{to hospital}} in Alexandria. He rejoined his brigade at Anzac on 8 June but the wound had not fully healed {{and he was}} lame, walking {{with the aid of}} <b>a</b> <b>stick.</b> <b>In</b> the meantime, General Bridges had been mortally wounded on 18 May and the Australian government sent the Chief of the General Staff, Major General James Gordon Legge, to replace him as commander of the 1st Division. [...] McCay, Monash and Colonel Harry Chauvel were all disappointed at being passed over for the command, and protested to Birdwood and the Australian government, but to no avail. However, Legge chose McCay to command the 2nd Division, then forming in Egypt. Unfortunately, on 11 July, the day before he was due to leave for Egypt, McCay's leg snapped where the bone had been broken at Krithia. He was evacuated again, this time to Malta, and then to the United Kingdom, where he was visited by Sir George Reid, now the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. McCay's wife Julia died while he was in hospital. Several weeks later his father died as well. McCay was therefore sent back to Australia on compassionate leave. He arrived back in Melbourne on RMS Malwa on 11 November 1915, accompanied by his two teenage daughters and his brother Hugh, who had joined the ship in Adelaide, to a hero's welcome. For his service at Gallipoli, McCay was mentioned in despatches for his [...] "great promptitude in supporting the threatened flank of the covering force" [...] during the landing and his [...] "conspicuous gallantry" [...] at Krithia. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and bestowed the Croix de Commander de la Légion d'honneur by the President of France.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{shooting}} genre players {{prefer a}} mouse over a gamepad analog stick because the mouse is a linear input device, {{which allows for}} fast and precise control. Holding <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> a given position produces a corresponding constant movement or rotation, i.e. the output is an integral of the user's input, and requires that time be spent moving to or from its null position before this input can be given; in contrast, the output of a mouse directly and instantaneously corresponds to how far it is moved in a given direction (often multiplied by an [...] "acceleration" [...] factor derived from how quickly the mouse is moved). The effect {{of this is that}} a mouse is well suited to small, precise movements; large, quick movements; and immediate, responsive movements; all of which are important in shooter gaming. This advantage also extends in varying degrees to similar game styles such as third-person shooters.|$|E

[...] Deeley wasn't surprised by the Universal response: [...] "The Deer Hunter was a United Artists sort of picture, whereas Convoy was more {{in the style of}} Universal. I'd muddled and sold the wrong picture to each studio." [...] Deeley did agree with Universal that the film needed to be shorter, not just because of pacing but also to ensure commercial success. [...] "A picture under {{two and a half hours}} can scrape three shows a day," [...] wrote Deeley, [...] "but at three hours you've lost one third of your screenings and one third of your income for the cinemas, distributors, and profit participants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{arriving}} at Thebes, Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a legendary beast {{with the head}} and breast of a woman, {{the body of a}} lioness, and the wings of an eagle. [...] The Sphinx was sent to the road approaching Thebes as a punishment from the gods, and would strangle any traveler who failed to answer a certain riddle. [...] The precise riddle asked by the Sphinx varied in early traditions, and is not stated in Oedipus Rex, as the event precedes the play; but the most widely-known version is, [...] "what is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three in the evening?" [...] Oedipus correctly guesses, [...] "man", who crawls on all fours as an infant, walks upright in maturity, and leans on <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> old age. [...] Bested by the prince, the Sphinx throws herself from a cliff, thereby ending the curse. Oedipus' reward for freeing Thebes from the Sphinx is its kingship, and the hand of the dowager queen, Jocasta; none then realize that Jocasta is Oedipus' true mother. Thus, unknown to all of the characters, the prophecy has been fulfilled.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{category}} are the bimembranophone tambores (Brea and Millet 1993:200), mentioned in documents {{as early as}} 1916 (Pérez I 1988:217) [...] There are three tambores: one requinto and two galletas. The requinto (Brea and Millet 1993:198), first mentioned in writing as early as 1931 (Pérez II 1988:9), is shaped somewhat like a snare drum- about 50% wider than it is tall. It is hung from the left shoulder with {{the top of the}} drum slightly skewed to the left and is played with a stick on the right-hand skin while the left hand mutes or opens the left-hand skin. [...] Its part is simple with few variations. [...] The galletas (also called congas- Orovio 1981:186) are like bass drums, but flatter. [...] They are both played with <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> a manner similar to the requinto, except that they are hung from the shoulders {{in such a way that}} the skins are nearly horizontal to the ground. [...] The higher pitched of the two is called a redoblante (Brea and Millet 1993:197). It measures approximately 2 feet in diameter and 5inches high. [...] In addition to its basic pattern, there are many floreos (variations) that it can play. [...] The lower-pitched galleta is called a pilón (Brea and Millet 1993:196) or pilonera (Ortíz II 1952-5:242). [...] It measure about 2inches larger in each dimension than the redoblante. This drum plays a basic pattern with few variations. All three of the drums utilize a metal hardware system for attaching the skins to the drum shells.|$|E
