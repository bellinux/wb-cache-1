While his artworks do not utilize the same materials as seen in traditional basket making, he sees his creation process as similar to theirs: [...] "Cahuilla basket makers go out and gather materials, and they put them together to produce something that is both functional and aesthetic. I kind of do my work the same way. I go out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> these things. I combine them." ...|$|E

60|$|The Archduchess {{stared at}} me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> {{that she was}} not used to {{anything}} save implicit obedience from those to whom she made suggestions. She stared, and then she laughed softly. There was more than a spice of malice in her mirth.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{not going}} to prove much of a difficulty, {{particularly}} as it's one Mrs. Hunter has provided for. As it happens, Hall looked in on us last night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> that he hadn't a very high opinion of your cookery and catering." ...|$|R

60|$|They drifted {{under the}} great twelve-inch pinned timbers of the foot-bridge towards the bench, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>gathered,</b> {{the time was}} very near at hand.

I kissed a rose, that's all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> that you have done as much and very likely a great deal more. But it is of the lady I am speaking, not of the ball.

He’s not well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> that you and he are to some extent opposed. Now I can’t expect you to sacrifice your interest, but you might try to avoid any heated dispute as far as possible. Excitement isn’t good for him.” ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR MR. MALLESON,--Many {{thanks for}} the pamphlet. You ask me to send you any remarks I may have to make on the Letters, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> from your note at the {{beginning}} of the Letters as they now stand, that you intend making use of any remarks sent you that may commend themselves to your judgment. I am not vain enough to think mine of any special value. I will, however, write you my feelings about them, encouraged to do so by your statement in the note to the pamphlet, that the use made of remarks sent you will be anonymous, if it is so desired.|$|E
60|$|His {{may not be}} the best, nor the {{ultimate}} philosophy, but it is a philosophy, and one of which we may some day feel the want. I read the stilted criticisms, the pedantic carpings of some modern men who cannot write their own language, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> that Dumas is out of date. There is a new philosophy of doubts and delicacies, of dallyings and refinements, of half-hearted lookers-on, desiring and fearing some new order of the world. Dumas does not dally nor doubt: he takes his side, he rushes into the smoke, he strikes his foe; but there is never an unkind word on his lip, nor a grudging thought in his heart.|$|E
60|$|We parted {{from our}} kind {{friends in the}} morning; came back <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sat a while to Mr. Burnard, the sculptor, who entertained me with various anecdotes. He had taken the bust of the Prince of Wales; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> from his {{statements}} that young princes have {{very much the same}} feelings and desires that other little boys have, and that he has a very judicious mother.|$|R
60|$|I {{opined that}} {{conversation}} {{was not to}} his wish, but this only made me more determined to talk, and {{to talk to him}} above all others in London. The desire took hold of me to irritate him--to break down the imperturbable calm within which he moved and had his being; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> myself together, <b>and</b> settled down to the task.|$|R
60|$|I {{would have}} excused myself, for indeed <b>I</b> was weary, <b>and</b> {{the thought of}} a bath and rest at home was more attractive. But the Duke had a way of expressing his wishes in a manner which it was {{scarcely}} possible to mistake, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> that he desired me to accept his invitation. We all descended the stairs together.|$|R
60|$|But the Sea Lady made no reply, {{and leaned}} back, scrutinising their advance. Certainly {{they made a}} {{handsome}} pair. Coming out of the veranda into the blaze {{of the sun and}} across the trim lawn towards the shadow of the ilex trees, they were lit, as it were, with a more glorious limelight, and displayed like actors on a stage more spacious than the stage of any theatre. The figure of Chatteris must have come out tall and fair and broad, a little sunburnt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> even then a little preoccupied, as indeed he always seemed to be in those latter days. And beside him Adeline, glancing now up at him and now towards the audience under the trees, dark and a little flushed, rather tall--though not so tall as Marcella seems to have been--and, you know, without any instructions from any novel-writer in the world, glad.|$|E

To put it as {{it could only be}} put here on the spot--by personal pressure. My dear lady," [...] he lucidly pursued, [...] "my work, you see, is really done, and my reasons for staying on even another day are none of the best. Chad's in possession of our case and professes to do it full justice. What remains is with himself. I've had my rest, my amusement and refreshment; I've had, as we say at Woollett, a lovely time. Nothing in it has been more lovely than this happy meeting with you--in these fantastic conditions to which you've so delightfully consented. I've a sense of success. It's what I wanted. My getting all this good is what Chad has waited for, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> that if I'm ready to go he's the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because he died first, that's all. It {{was this}} way. He, or rather his firm, {{which is only}} another name for him, for he owned three-fourths of the capital, got some {{tremendous}} shipping contract with the Government arising out of the war, that secures an enormous profit to them; how much I can't tell you, but {{hundreds and hundreds of}} thousands of pounds. He had been very anxious about this contract, for his terms were so stiff that the officials who manage such affairs hesitated about signing them. At last one day after a long <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather,</b> stormy interview with I don't know whom, in the course of which some rather strong language seems to have been used, the contract was signed and delivered to the firm. My father came home to this house with a copy of it in his pocket. He was very triumphant, for he looked at the matter solely from a business point of view, not at all from that of the country. Also he was very tired, for he had aged much during the last few years, and suffered occasionally from heart attacks. To keep himself up he drank a great deal of wine at dinner, first champagne and then the best part of a bottle of port. This made him talkative, and he kept me sitting there to listen to him while he boasted, poor man, of how he had 'walked round' the officials who thought themselves so clever, but never saw some trap which he had set for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it?" [...] he rejoined. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, I have not read the letter through. I saw your name in it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> from your message that you wished to see me here. I sent my note to your hotel--and then went on with {{something}} else. Pray pardon me. Is this a professional consultation? For your own sake, I sincerely hope not!" ...|$|R
60|$|Among {{the most}} assiduous of the negresses who had watched my couch during my illness {{there was one}} old crone who {{appeared}} to exert considerable authority over the others.

60|$|Well, {{there we}} stood in that well-remembered drawing-room in which first I had made the {{acquaintance}} of Harût and Marût; also of the beautiful Miss Holmes as Lady Ragnall was then called.

6000|$|I was {{extremely}} {{interested in your}} Fiji legend, and perhaps even more so in your capital account of the CURACOA'S misadventure. [...] Alas! we have nothing so thrilling to relate.

A hundred black boys and about a score draught-oxen perished, or at least barely escaped with their lives, from the mud-holes on our road, bringing up the materials.

There {{are many}} things {{relating}} to the promises, as to the largeness and straitness of words, as to the freeness and conditionality of them, which we are not able so well to understand; and, therefore, when Satan dealeth with us about them, we quickly {{fall to the ground}} before him; we often conclude that the words of the promise are too narrow and strait to comprehend us; we also think, verily, that the conditions of some promises do utterly shut us out from hope of justification and life; but our Advocate, who is for us with the Father, he is better acquainted with, and learned in, this law than to be baffled out with a bold word or two, or with a subtle piece of hellish sophistication (Isa 50:4). He knows the true purport, intent, meaning, and sense of every promise, and piece of promise that is in the whole Bible, and can tell how to plead it for advantage against our accuser, and doth so. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> it not only from his contest with Satan for Joshua, (Zech 3), and from his conflict with him in the wilderness, (Matt 4), and in heaven, (Rev 14), but also from the practice of Satan's emissaries here; for what his angels do, that doth he. Now there is here nothing more apparent than that the instruments of Satan do plead against the church, from the pretended intricacy, ambiguity, and difficulty of the promise; whence I gather, so doth Satan before the tribunal of God; but there we have one to match him; [...] "we have an Advocate with the Father," [...] that knows law and judgment better than Satan, and statute and commandment better than all his angels; and by the verdict of our Advocate, all the words, and limits, and extensions of words, with all conditions of the promises, are expounded and applied! And hence it is that it sometimes so falleth out that the very promise we have thought could not reach us, to comfort us by any means, has at another time swallowed us up with joy unspeakable. Christ, the true Prophet, has the right understanding of the Word as an Advocate, has pleaded it before God against Satan, and having overcome him at the common law, he hath sent to let us know it by his good Spirit, to our comfort, and the confusion of our enemy.
