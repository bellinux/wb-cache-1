5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{construction}} the Albert Dock was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite the Albert Dock's <b>advanced</b> <b>design,</b> the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.|$|E
5|$|Harry's Walls are {{the remains}} of an {{unfinished}} artillery fort, started in 1551 {{by the government of}} Edward VI to defend the island of St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. Constructed to defend the harbour of Hugh Town from possible French attack, the fortification incorporated Italianate-style bastions with protective orillons and would have been the most <b>advanced</b> <b>design</b> in the kingdom at the time. It was not completed, probably due to a shortage of funds and the passing of the invasion threat, and only the south-west side remains. In the 21st century, Harry's Walls are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the An-70 {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began {{preliminary}} design work on a successor for the An-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, were looking for a replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft with a quick loading time, the ability to operate from short unprepared airfields, could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The initial contract for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began <b>advanced</b> <b>design</b> work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations from the former Soviet Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The M-10 {{was much}} more <b>advanced</b> <b>design</b> {{compared}} to older Soviet 152mm howitzers. It had modern split trail carriage, which allowed for much larger traverse. The trails were of riveted construction. The carriage was equipped with suspension and with wheels from the ZiS-5 truck, meaning higher transportation speed.|$|E

25|$|Kootenay had {{a wooden}} hull, which {{proved to be}} a {{disadvantage}} because it required constant maintenance and easily became weak and waterlogged.

25|$|The GAU-8/A {{ammunition}} is linkless, reducing {{weight and}} avoiding {{a great deal}} of potential for jamming.

The feed system is based on that developed for later M61 installations, but uses more <b>advanced</b> <b>design</b> techniques and materials throughout, to save weight.|$|E
