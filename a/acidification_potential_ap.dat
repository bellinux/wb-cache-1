Environmental pollution has become a major challenge to construction projects due to the huge amount of pollution caused by construction projects. There are different types of environmental impact indicators, such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint, eutrophication potential (EP), <b>acidification</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>AP),</b> human health (HH) particulate, ozone depletion, and smog. Each of these environmental impact indicators can be linked to different phases of the construction projects.

The tree crops are traditionally cultivated in two representative areas in Greece, namely Aegina island, Attica region, for pistachios and Agia, East Thessaly region, central Greece, for apples and almonds. The impact categories considered include global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential (EP), <b>acidification</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>AP)</b> and cumulative energy demand (CED). Based upon the results obtained, it is deduced that pistachios and almonds show minor differences for all impact categories considered, while apples exhibit the best environmental profile. The phases of fertilizers production, irrigation system and field management were identified as the main “hot-spots” for all crops, exhibiting the highest environmental impacts and energy consumption. A sensitivity analysis was performed to explore actions that can be considered at farm scale, such as water desalination for irrigation purposes, transition to organic production and use of renewable energy, in order to reduce water requirements and promote energy conservation, especially in semi-arid and arid Mediterranean regions which suffer from water shortage and are prone to salinization.

For each case the environmental indicators (global warming potential, abiotic depletion potential, human toxicity <b>potential,</b> photochemical <b>potential,</b> <b>acidification</b> <b>potential,</b> eutrophisation potential) were evaluated in order to estimate the environmental effects on the coal life cycle with CO 2 capture process.

40|$|Sustainable dairy {{production}} requires {{farms that}} are economically viable, environmentally sound and socially acceptable. A low {{environmental impact of}} milk production is not necessarily associated with an economically viable farm. To gain insight into a possible “trade-off” between economic and environmental sustainability, {{the relation between the}} environmental and economic indicators of dairy farms was quantified, and farm characteristics that influence this relation were identified. Economic and environmental indicators were quantified for 119 specialized dairy farms in 2005, based on data from the Dutch Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Economic indicators used were: gross value added expressed per kg fat-and-protein-corrected milk (FPCM) or expressed per unit of labour, i. e. labour productivity. Environmental indicators used were: land use per kg FPCM, energy use per kg FPCM, global warming potential per kg FPCM, eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>potential</b> per kg FPCM or per ha of land. Environmental indicators were deduced from a life cycle assessment. High labour productivity on dairy farms was associated with low on-farm energy use, total and on-farm land use, total and on-farm global warming potential, and total and off-farm <b>acidification</b> <b>potential</b> per kg FPCM. High labour productivity, however, was associated also with high on-farm eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>potential</b> per hectare. From partial least squares regression analysis, it was concluded that relations between economic and environmental indicators were affected mainly by milk production per ha, annual milk production per cow, farm size, and amount of concentrates per kg FPCM. An increase in annual milk production per cow, for example, not only increased labour productivity, reduced energy use and global warming potential per kg FPCM but also, {{in the case of an}} unchanged stocking density, increased eutrophication and acidification per ha. To be economically and environmentally sustainable, animal production in the Netherlands, therefore, should focus on high animal productivity, i. e. high annual milk production per cow and efficient use of feed per kg milk, and moderate stocking density, provided that a good animal welfare standard is guarantee...|$|R
40|$|Simple {{models are}} often {{used to assess the}} {{potential}} impact of acidifying and eutrophying substances released during the life cycle of products. As fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity are not included in these models, environmental life-cycle assessment of products (LCA) may produce incorrect results for these impact categories. This paper outlines the spatially explicit regional air pollution information and simulation model (RAINS-LCA), which was developed for the calculation of acidification and terrestrial eutrophication potentials of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) air emissions and <b>acidification</b> <b>potentials</b> for sulfur dioxide (SO 2) air emissions for Europe and a number of European regions, taking fate, background depositions and effects into account. Two impact definitions are explored in the calculations: 1) the marginal change in the hazard index of all ecosystems in Europe and 2) the marginal change in the hazard index of ecosystems in Europe where the critical load is actually exceeded. The inclusion of fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity results in a different ranking of substances compared to simpler model outcomes. In the context of acidification, emissions of nitrogen compounds are regarded as about a factor 2 less important relative to sulfur compounds. Furthermore, using RAINS-LCA as opposed to simpler models, it was found that region-specific differences in terrestrial eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>potentials</b> range up to 1. 5 and 3. 5 orders of magnitude, respectively. By means of scenario analysis, it was also shown that "only above critical load" terrestrial eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>potentials</b> for the years 1995 and 2010 differ up to 0. 6 order and 1 order of magnitude, respectively.

Currently almost all the industrial hydrogen need worldwide is produced using fossil fuels. Electrolytic hydrogen production based on electricity generated from renewable resources and hydrogen's energetic use could contribute to the global need for a sustainable energy supply. However, these technologies are also not free from environmental burdens. A life cycle assessment (LCA) helps to identify such impacts considering the entire life cycle of the process chains. This paper reviews twenty-one studies that address the LCA of hydrogen production technologies, a majority of them employing electrolytic technologies. It has been observed that global warming potential (GWP) is the impact category analyzed by almost all the authors. <b>Acidification</b> <b>potential</b> (<b>AP)</b> ranks second. Other categories such as toxicity potential are often not analyzed. The main environmental concern associated with electrolytic hydrogen production is electricity supply.
