Tagged in motion meanwhile was an experiment to connect augmented reality and graffiti.

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{declared}} [...] "Greg Pikitis" [...] one of {{the episodes}} he would suggest to newcomers seeking {{to become familiar with}} Parks and Recreation, calling it [...] "the version of Parks and Recreation that I most enjoy: silly, but also intentionally small in scale". He particularly praised Louis CK and some of the smaller jokes in the episode, like the fact that a gay character's [...] "straight guy" [...] Halloween costume is identical to Mark's regular wardrobe. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the episode [...] "demonstrated how an episode of P can work wonders—dial up the conditions that might drive a character insane, as they did to Leslie, <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> squirm". He also said the episode featured every supporting character well, but that Ann was less funny without a [...] "wacky person to play off of". Time magazine critic James Poniewozik said it was a [...] "strong episode that hit office and personal sides of the characters equally well". Poniewozik praised Pratt and Louis C.K. in particular, but also said Leslie was pushed [...] "a little too far into the crazy-obsessive end of the spectrum". Not all reviews were positive. Linda Stasi of New York Post said the episode was [...] "a big yawn", although she praised the performance of Cody Klop as Greg Pikitis.|$|E
500|$|Desiring a {{realistic}} depiction of vulpine behavior and habits, Mannix {{spent more than}} a year studying the behaviors of a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home. He stated that they were [...] "so tame [...] could turn them loose <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> hunt, fight, make love, and live an almost normal life." [...] Additionally, he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers, hunters, game wardens, and [...] "Masters of Hounds" [...] to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do. In the novel's postscript, Mannix discusses this research. [...] To defend his novel against charges of improbability, he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people's stories about fox behavior. Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters, he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story's events. For example, he notes that while people have told him that foxes do not really run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds, he himself used to watch them do just that from his bedroom window. In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching, Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales—near Thorndale, Pennsylvania—who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the Trenton Cutoff using this method.|$|E

[...] Visitors can drive through the lion compound in buses with specially designed chutes which they can use to push live chickens into the enclosure. In the Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village near Guilin in south-east China, live cows and pigs are thrown to tigers to amuse visitors.|$|E

However, {{following}} its release, Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac largely because of his desire not to tour and the strain he was feeling within the band. [...] "I needed to get some separation from Stevie especially, because I don't think I'd ever quite gotten closure on our relationship," [...] he said. [...] "I needed {{to get on with}} the next phase of my creative growth and my emotional growth. When you break up with someone and then for the next 10 years you have to be around them and do for them <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> move away from you, it's not easy."

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by LucasArts subsidiary spin-off Lucas Learning.

Of her character's development, Morey explained [...] "She has become a lot more self-assured and she has learnt to trust herself again. I think when we first met her, she was quite closed off and didn't want to let anyone in fear of hurting them." [...] Sonya decides to give up her job as a guide dog trainer to buy and turn the community garden into a garden nursery. Morey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life.
