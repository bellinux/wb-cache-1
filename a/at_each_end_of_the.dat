5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle {{on the center of}} the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn {{at the same time as}} the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E
5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, leading towards East Finchley {{to the north and}} Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, roundabouts were {{constructed}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Causeway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic on the bridges {{and the distribution of}} traffic back into the road network. The roundabout at the eastern end, connecting with Great Eastern Highway, opened in 1952. In 1973 construction began on upgrading that intersection to a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange. The interchange opened on 8 March 1974, having cost AUS$1.3 million.|$|E
50|$|The {{bathrooms}} in Public Auditorium were renovated to {{make them}} accessible as well as modern, and all public spaces in Public Auditorium were retiled, repainted, and replastered, while furniture received new upholstery. The north terrace was rebuilt in four different colors of granite. New taxicab stands were built <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Public Auditorium, and small gardens placed <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> taxi stand.|$|R
50|$|TransMilenio {{stations}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a line {{have large}} bicycle parking facilities to facilitate cyclists using the system.|$|R

5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field for the Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E
5|$|There {{are flat}} {{junctions}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill diverge. Thameslink and Southeastern services cross each other's paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes. The station {{also has a}} turnback siding on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for a Thames bridge, {{only three}} of Chiswick Bridge's five spans cross the river; the shorter spans <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge cross the former towpaths. To allow {{sufficient}} clearance for shipping without steep inclines, the approach roads to the bridge are elevated from some distance back from the river.|$|E

50|$|The {{station has}} two platforms, and is fully {{accessible}} to wheelchair users since the addition <b>of</b> lifts <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a footbridge.|$|R
5000|$|Slider - A device {{which allows}} the bell {{to go over the}} balance <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> its swing, but not to over-rotate.|$|R
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class carriages <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it {{is equipped with a}} pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E

50|$|Alec Bedser and Eric Bedser (2015) are life-size bronzes which {{celebrate}} cricketing twins Alec and Eric from Horsell, erected <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Bedser Bridge in Woking.|$|R
5|$|Except for its two stations—one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The {{line was}} built {{in less than three}} months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it {{was not included in the}} 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1950, the Queen Mother {{travelled}} {{the line}} {{as far as}} Cranbrook when she visited the National Sanatorium at Benenden. The five-coach Royal Train was pulled by a Maunsell E1 class 4-4-0 No. 31067, Her Majesty using a Pullman car named Malaga, which was flanked by two corridor composites; there was a corridor third brake <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train. Malaga was one of six twelve-wheel first-class kitchen cars which had been built in 1920–1; and following an extensive refit in late 1949, was occasionally used in the Royal Train. It was withdrawn in 1961, and is preserved close to Shepperton railway station.|$|E

5|$|Roundabouts were {{constructed}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Causeway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic on the bridges {{and the distribution of}} traffic back into the road network. The eastern roundabout opened in 1952, while the western one did not open until December 1954. Guides on the usage of the roundabouts were published in newspapers. In 1973 construction began on a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange at the eastern end of the Causeway. The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} still under {{construction}} in January 1928, {{and at that time}} the estimated date of completion was only a month away. The bridge finally opened to traffic on 14 April. The official opening of the bridge by the NSW Governor Dudley de Chair occurred on 10 July, and was celebrated by the cutting of the ribbon and an opening of the gates <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lift span. In return he was presented with a silver cigarette case.|$|E
5|$|The design {{incorporated}} many novel features, {{such as the}} use of thermic siphons, bogies and cabs <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive, {{resulting in}} its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E
25|$|Before European settlement, thick forest covered {{most of the}} Hutt Valley, with {{areas of}} {{marshland}} close to the river's mouth. Māori inhabited the shoreline, with a pa <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Petone beach.|$|R

5|$|Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea {{each had}} their own {{separate}} rooms <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was {{large enough to accommodate}} the recording equipment. For over thirty days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment which allowed him to complete the rest of the lyrics. During production, the band agreed to let Flea's brother-in-law document the creative process on film. When the album's recording was complete, the Chili Peppers released the film, titled Funky Monks.|$|E
5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the plant}} {{consisted}} of the company offices and the large Manufacturing Building. The Mason house, which would become the company office was originally constructed in 1861. It is a two-story brick Italianate style house that was converted {{to be used as}} an office building and significantly modified throughout the years. The 1929 addition added a wing that connected it to the metal products building which was built that year. In 1942, a two-story front addition was added and another addition to the west was added around 1950. These additions also resulted in the removal of the cupola, brick chimneys, front entry, and veranda. The Manufacturing building, constructed from 1912 to 1913, is three stories high on the river side and two stories on the east. It is divided into 31 bays with pilasters. <b>At</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building are stairs and elevator towers. The structural remains of the original glass house survive as a sub-basement in a one-story extension {{at the south end of}} the building.|$|E
