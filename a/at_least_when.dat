5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{evidence}} shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries the area around Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland. This left little timber, and may have factored into the use of stone as a building material. The earliest castles in England typically used timber, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> they were first built, and building in stone was more expensive than earth and timber. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meteorologist}} David Roth {{assessed the}} storm as making landfall on August19 at Isle Dernière {{to the west}} of New Orleans, a research paper from the American Meteorological Society estimated that the hurricane moved ashore about 40mi (60km) southeast of New Orleans. Modern research suggests the storm was the equivalent of a major hurricane (a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale), or with winds of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> , <b>when</b> it made landfall. It passed just southwest of the city, becoming the closest major hurricane to New Orleans. The wind diameter was average to slightly below-average, and the forward speed was normal. Due to its movement, the hurricane likely maintained much of its strength after making landfall and by the time it affected New Orleans. The hurricane gradually weakened over land, passing near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi on August20. Heavy rainfall was reported in eastern Ohio beginning on August21, potentially from the remnants of the storm merging with a cold front.|$|E

5|$|Plant spirals {{can be seen}} in phyllotaxis, the {{arrangement}} of leaves on a stem, and in {{the arrangement}} (parastichy) of other parts as in composite flower heads and seed heads like the sunflower or fruit structures like the pineapple and snake fruit, {{as well as in the}} pattern of scales in pine cones, where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together. Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from Fibonacci ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In hazel the ratio is 1/3; in apricot it is 2/5; in pear it is 3/8; in almond it is 5/13. In disc phyllotaxis as in the sunflower and daisy, the florets are arranged in Fermat's spiral with Fibonacci numbering, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the golden angle, 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.|$|E

25|$|Rapalogs, {{which are}} the first {{generation}} mTOR inhibitors, have proven effective {{in a range of}} preclinical models. However, the success in clinical trials is limited to only a few rare cancers. Animal and clinical studies show that rapalogs are primarily cytostatic, and therefore effective as disease stabilizers rather than for regression. The response rate in solid tumors where rapalogs have been used as a single-agent therapy have been modest. Due to partial mTOR inhibition as mentioned before, rapalogs are not sufficient for achieving a broad and robust anticancer effect, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> used as monotherapy.|$|E
25|$|The Lombard {{state was}} {{relatively}} Romanized, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> {{compared to the}} Germanic kingdoms in northern Europe.

For a decade {{following the death of}} Cleph in 575, the Lombards did not even elect a king; this period is called the Rule of the Dukes. The first written legal code was composed in poor Latin in 643: the Edictum Rothari. It was primarily the codification of the oral legal tradition of the people.|$|E

25|$|An {{explanation}} for this log-normal distribution for biological parameters is: The event where a sample has half {{the value of the}} mean or median tends to have almost equal probability to occur as the event where a sample has twice the value of the mean or median. Also, only a log-normal distribution can compensate for the inability of almost all biological parameters to be of negative numbers (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> measured on absolute scales), with the consequence that there is no definite limit to the size of outliers (extreme values) on the high side, but, on the other hand, they can never be less than zero, resulting in a positive skewness.|$|E
25|$|Some positives and negatives of {{recovery}} models were highlighted {{in a study}} of a community mental health service for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Cultural biases and uncertainties were also noted in the 'North American' model {{of recovery}} in practice, reflecting views about the sorts of contributions and lifestyles that should be considered valuable or acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} of the mint was at first entrusted to the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church; direct supervision, however, was exercised by the senate, from the time <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> that body took possession of the mint, until the reign of Pope Martin V. The sindaco and the conservators of the Camera Capitolina appointed the masters of the mint, while the minting was witnessed by {{the heads of the}} guild of goldsmiths and silversmiths. In 1322 John XXII created the office of treasurer for the mint of Avignon, and its incumbent, little by little, made himself independent of the Camerlengo. Later, the office of prelate president of the mint was created. According to Lunadori (Relaz. della Corte di Roma, 1646), the establishments for the coining of money were in charge of a congregation of Cardinals.|$|E

25|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the galley, there was no clear distinction between ships of trade and war other than their actual usage. River boats plied the waterways of ancient Egypt during the Old Kingdom (2700–2200 BC) and seagoing galley-like vessels were recorded bringing back luxuries from across the Red Sea in the reign of pharaoh Hatshepsut. Fitting rams to the bows of vessels sometime around the 8th century BC resulted in a distinct split in the design of warships, and set trade vessels apart, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> it came to use in naval warfare. The Phoenicians used galleys for transports that were less elongated, carried fewer oars and relied more on sails. Carthaginian galley wrecks found off Sicily that date to the 3rd or 2nd century BC had a length to breadth ratio of 6:1, proportions that fell between the 4:1 of sailing merchant ships and the 8:1 or 10:1 of war galleys. Merchant galleys in the ancient Mediterranean were intended as carriers of valuable cargo or perishable goods that needed to be moved as safely and quickly as possible.|$|E

500|$|Directional couplers, power splitters, {{and power}} {{combiners}} [...] are all {{essentially the same}} type of device, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>when</b> implemented with passive components.

[...] Many designs of power splitter can be used in reverse, whereupon they become power combiners.|$|E
