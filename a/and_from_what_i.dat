2500|$|Parker {{predicted}} the inevitable {{success of the}} abolitionist cause this way: [...] "I do not pretend to understand the moral universe; the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways; I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. <b>And</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see I am sure it bends towards justice." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2008, {{the artist}} has added one song to his sophomore LP, which may {{be out on the}} last quarter of 2008 or first quarter of 2009. Lewis told the interviewers that he is very excited to premiere his new songs, and he has learned some lessons from his [...] "A.D.D." [...] era. On an interview, he said, [...] "Where to start… Orchestral Drive-By: KJ and I are about 5 songs deep now. Can’t wait for you all to hear this. I haven’t been this excited in a while. I haven’t been able to produce in a year and half, besides a couple songs on ‘A.D.D.’ <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have learned in the last year, it sure has paid off. STOKED!!!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with criticism mostly directed towards its pacing and confusing narrative. Guy Lodge of Variety states {{in his review}} that [...] "A major disappointment from a major filmmaker, Diaz's latest super-sized tapestry of historical fact, folklore and cine-poetry is typically ambitious in its expressionism—but sees the helmer venturing {{into the kind of}} declamatory, didactic rhetoric that his recent stunners Norte, the End of History <b>and</b> <b>From</b> <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> Before so elegantly avoided." ...|$|R
60|$|Perceiving the {{violence}} of their rage, <b>and</b> persuaded <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said, that much suffering at sea must have maddened them; Borabolla thought fit to confine them for the present; {{so that they could}} not molest me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{was handed}} over to me by Count Piper himself; <b>and</b> moreover, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have seen of him, I am myself {{confident}} {{that he can be}} trusted. He is of Swedish descent, and is, I think, a very honest fellow." ...|$|R
60|$|Such was {{the land}} unto which Launcelot was brought, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{have told you}} you may see what a wonderful, {{beautiful}} place it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your politeness will {{at least}} teach them a lesson," [...] she said. [...] "I am used to travel by the P. & O. <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have seen of this steamer--" ...|$|E
60|$|I made no reply. I {{had my own}} inferences to draw, {{from what}} I knew through the {{housekeeper}} <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw before me, and I did not choose to share them with Count Fosco.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It seems egotistical {{to begin}} by saying so much about myself,' he resumed, 'but {{whatever}} I say to you seems, even in my own ears, below <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say, <b>and</b> different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say. I can't help it. So it is. You are the ruin of me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How? By the way {{she seemed}} not to do it! <b>And</b> because <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know of that stupid Pasmer pride it would be {{perfectly}} impossible for any one who was a Pasmer to take her deprecatory manner toward me of herself. You ought to have seen it! It was simply perfect." ...|$|R
6000|$|Once {{having seen}} her clasp with fond embrace [...] This Child, I chanted to myself a lay, [...] 10 [...] Endeavouring, in our English tongue, to trace [...] Such things as she unto the Babe might say: [4] [...] <b>And</b> thus, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> heard <b>and</b> knew, or guessed, [5] [...] My song the {{workings}} of her heart expressed.|$|R
6000|$|Mdlle. Reuter and I entered upon business. She {{said she}} was not {{absolutely}} certain of {{the wisdom of the}} step she was about to take, because I was so young, and parents might possibly object to a professor like me for their daughters: [...] "But it is often well to act on one's own judgment," [...] said she, [...] "and to lead parents, rather than be led by them. The fitness of a professor {{is not a matter of}} age; <b>and,</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have heard, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> observe myself, I would much rather trust you than M. Ledru, the music-master, who is a married man of near fifty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can see a}} {{good deal}} of it against the sky!" [...] exclaimed Miriam. [...] "What tall pillars! It looks like a Greek temple in front. <b>And</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can make out, it's pretty much all front." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,--the Eustace diamonds! And they didn't {{belong to}} her {{any more than}} they did to you. They've been taken, anyway; <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hear I shouldn't be at all {{surprised}} if she had arranged the whole matter herself." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a moonless night, {{according}} to the Vaudoux fashion; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had already read in West Indian books that the orgies would not commence till midnight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{go wrong}} when we don't go right. That's just it, {{we must go}} some way. <b>And</b> I'm sure, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> gather, that she isn't wholly {{satisfied}} with Syndicalism." ...|$|R
5000|$|Menon was a {{great team}} builder, he had a passion for music and he loved {{entertaining}} and hanging out with musicians. Just like the incredible team that built Warner, Elektra <b>and</b> Atlantic. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> remember of Bhaskar Menon, his kindness, generosity and sharp intellect were appreciated by the stable of talent the company acquired and held on to in those years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did not see}} {{the list}} of passengers, but there were twelve or {{fourteen}} aft, <b>and,</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw, I should think as many more forward. There were twenty-three men in the crew. I suppose, altogether, there were some fifty on board." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Peterson's Troupe," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I was {{on when they}} come in last week. One of 'em was dead in his box, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could see of him it looked mighty like he'd had the tar knocked outa him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{get some}} country girl {{to take care}} of it when I am busy," [...] he said, [...] "and the rest of the time I'll attend to it myself.

6000|$|Once did I see her clasp the Child about, [...] And {{take it to}} herself; and I, next day, [...] 10 [...] Wish'd in my {{native tongue}} to fashion out [...] Such things as she unto this Child might say: [...] <b>And</b> thus, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> knew, had heard, and guess'd, [...] My song the {{workings}} of her heart express'd.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's old stock, too," [...] Saxon said. [...] "He told {{me while}} you were undressing. His folks came by Panama before the {{railroad}} was built, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> he said <b>I</b> guess he's got plenty of money." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, do {{write to}} me soon again! Have you read Dr. Arnold's Life? I have not, but am very anxious to do so, from the admirable {{extracts}} in the 'Examiner' of last Saturday, <b>and</b> also <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hear of it in other quarters.

6000|$|ANTONIUS. [...] If you prosper, Our Senate, wearied {{of their}} tetrarchies, Their quarrels with themselves, their spites at Rome, Is like enough to cancel them, and throne One king above them all, who shall be true To the Roman: <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> heard in Rome, This {{tributary}} crown may fall to you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will consider,' {{replied the}} old gentleman. 'I {{have nothing to}} say just now. I am a man of business, Mr. Pickwick.

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should like}} it very much," [...] Julian said. [...] "There can't be much risk, for {{there has not}} been {{anything}} like a regular fight anywhere along this part of the coast for the last two years, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have heard, there must have been twenty cargoes run in that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{not that}} sort of man," [...] said Dick warmly. [...] "He was {{talking to me about}} her yesterday, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> he said, <b>I</b> am sure he thinks she is the finest girl in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw no birds, and {{of animals}} only an {{occasional}} muskdeer.

60|$|Pilate, too, I noted, showed heavy anxiety. That {{they were}} giving him a hard time of it was patent. But I will say, as you shall see, that he matched their subtlety with equal subtlety; <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw of him I have little doubt but {{what he would have}} confounded many a disputant in the synagogues.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the {{slightest}} objection, my boy," [...] said the medical gentleman, heartily. [...] "Good news seldom kills, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> learn, {{it is only}} that which you have to tell.

6000|$|... "And miss my shopping? No, thank you. Besides, the Upolu is not {{a regular}} {{passenger}} steamer, and she is just as liable to sail ahead of time as on time. <b>And</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hear about those Guvutu sybarites, {{the best time to}} shop will be in the morning. And now you'll have to excuse me, for I've got to pack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so {{glad that}} I spoke to you on this matter," [...] said Lady Corisande, [...] "for there is {{something}} in you which encourages me. As you say, if they were certain, they would be silent; <b>and</b> yet, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hear, their hopes are high.

6000|$|... "Just {{a little}} stone {{building}} {{actually on the}} beach," [...] Hamel explained. [...] "There is a large shed which Mr. Fentolin keeps locked up, and the habitable portion consists just of a bedroom <b>and</b> sitting-room. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can see, Mr. Fentolin has been making a sort of hobby of the place.

Nevertheless, he was sometimes very shy and Docter found it difficult getting him to say all of his lines.|$|R
