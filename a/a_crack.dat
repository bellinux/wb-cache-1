40|$|<b>A</b> <b>cracked</b> {{database}} is <b>a</b> datastore continuously reorganized {{based on}} operations being executed. For each query, {{the data of}} interest is physically reclustered to speed-up future access to the same, overlapping or even disjoint data. This way, <b>a</b> <b>cracking</b> DBMS self-organizes and adapts itself to the workload. So far, cracking has been considered for static databases only. In this paper, we introduce several novel algorithms for high-volume insertions, deletions and updates against <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> database. We show that the nice performance properties of <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> database can be maintained in a dynamic environment where updates interleave with queries. Our algorithms comply with the cracking philosophy, i. e., a table is informed on pending insertions and deletions, but only when the relevant data is needed for query processing just enough pending update actions are applied. We discuss details of our implementation {{in the context of}} an open-source DBMS and we show through a detailed experimental evaluation that our algorithms always manage to keep the cost of querying <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> datastore with pending updates lower than the non-cracked case...|$|R

Cornwallis was followed by Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage. The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing was happening. The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly north toward the heights.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E

Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player.
