5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} in discerning the relationships within family Lemuridae, not all authorities agree on the taxonomy, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the primatological community favors the current classification.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> {{his works}} were in Polish, he tried {{his hand at}} several works in French {{language}} (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci). Many of his works were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He also left notes on works that he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> {{the music}} has been {{released}} only in Japan, the first soundtrack was released worldwide and tracks from the Kingdom Hearts series have been featured in Video Games Live at multiple venues. The music has overall been well received and several tracks have received particular praise. The two main themes were well received by both video game and music critics, and did well on Japan's Oricon Weekly Singles chart.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the {{restaurant}} locations are privately held by individual owners and its financial dependence on those owners, Burger King's relationship with its franchises {{has not always}} been harmonious. Occasional disagreements between the two have caused numerous issues, and in several instances the company's and its licensees' relations have degenerated into precedent-setting court cases.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, {{the first}} World Percheron Congress {{was held in}} Great Britain, and has been held {{annually}} ever since. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the shows have been held in North America, four– in 1980, 1989, 2001 and 2011– have been held in France.

5|$|Priestley {{tried to}} {{continue}} his scientific investigations in America {{with the support of}} the American Philosophical Society. He was hampered by lack of news from Europe; unaware of the latest scientific developments, Priestley was no longer on the forefront of discovery. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> his publications focused on defending phlogiston theory, he also did some original work on spontaneous generation and dreams. Despite Priestley's reduced scientific output, his presence stimulated American interest in chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{name was}} changed to Tillingbourne Bus Company in May 1972, {{following}} {{the introduction of a}} service between Horsham and Colgate, with a new livery of blue, yellow and grey introduced. A new Managing Director, Barry King, joined Tillingbourne from North Downs Coaches in the same year. In 1974, a small garage in Ewhurst was acquired and maintenance work transferred there, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the fleet continued to be based in Gomshall.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the {{abolition}} of slavery was felt quickly. When the Thirteenth Amendment became operational, the scope of Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation was widened to include the entire nation. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky's slaves had been emancipated, 65,000–100,000 people remained to be legally freed when the Amendment went into effect on December 18. In Delaware, where a large number of slaves had escaped during the war, nine hundred people became legally free.|$|E

5|$|The {{subsequent}} hurricane {{was also}} previously unrecognized until contemporary research, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> its track remains unknown. The only indication that a tropical cyclone existed was the ship David G. Wilson, which was dismasted by a severe storm on September 17. As no other {{information is available}} on the hurricane, it is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a single point in the central Atlantic (at 28.5°N, 50°W).|$|E
5|$|Marshall did {{not believe}} in rule by the masses, {{frequently}} expressing his disdain for the common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} signing, the Act {{was taken to}} Germany and handed to parties in the Reichstag. On February 18, the text was reprinted in German newspapers, {{including}} Das Neue Litauen, Vossische Zeitung, Taegliche Rundschau and Kreuzzeitung. In Lithuania a text of the proclamation was prepared for printing in newspapers, particularly in Lietuvos aidas, the Council's newspaper established by Antanas Smetona; but the German authorities prohibited this publication. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the copies of the issue were confiscated, the newspaper's editor, Petras Klimas, managed to hide about 60 of them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> {{languages}} {{for creating}} dynamic web pages have libraries {{to help with}} common tasks, web applications often require specific libraries for particular tasks, such as creating HTML (for example, JavaServer Faces).|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group's {{actions have}} been cloaked in secrecy, {{a select few}} details have been developed. Before making the plan public, the PDNG {{undertook}} several important steps to ensure the plan's success.|$|R
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> commercial-grade ammolite {{has been}} treated in some way, a small {{fraction}} of production requires no treatment other than cutting and polishing. Ideally, any treatments should be disclosed at the time of sale.|$|R
5|$|The band {{initially}} {{planned to}} record their debut album {{in the space of}} two weeks. However, tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between September 1999 and April–May 2000. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Parachutes' tracks were recorded at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios (where they accessed three studio rooms). The mixing process on all songs for the album was done by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York. During that period, they played on the Carling Tour, which showcased up-and-coming acts.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{building}} is not well documented, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century {{on the site of}} a 12th-century wooden building. The current front wall was added in the 16th century. It {{has been used as a}} merchant's house and possibly a shop and school. It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings, hence the title Tribunal, however there is no evidence this ever occurred. One of the ground floor rooms still has the window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era. The front room upstairs has an arched braced, wooden, truss roof.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{varieties}} of short-period comet: Jupiter-family comets (those with semi-major axes of less than 5AU) and Halley-family comets. Halley-family comets, named for their prototype, Halley's Comet, are unusual in that although they are short-period comets, it is hypothesized that their ultimate origin lies in the Oort cloud, not in the scattered disc. Based on their orbits, it is suggested they were long-period comets that were captured by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System. This process may have also created the present orbits of a significant fraction of the Jupiter-family comets, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc.|$|E
