Notably, in Belgium, the prevalence of <b>analgesic</b> <b>nephropathy</b> among people having dialysis was 17.9% in 1984 and 15.6% in 1990.

40|$|The {{association}} between heavy consumption of <b>analgesics</b> and <b>nephropathy</b> was first described in Canada in 1961 [1]. Thirty-seven such patients {{were reported in}} 1968 [2, 3], and an additional 314 were reported in 1972 from a survey of Canadian nephrologists [4], which provides a baseline from which {{an evaluation of the}} effect of removal of phenacetin can be made...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{suggestion that}} an association {{exists between the}} ingestion of large amounts of analgesics {{and the development of}} interstitial nephropathy was made in 1953 [1]. Since that time, many hundreds of cases illustrating this association have been reported from around the world [2, 3]. Presently, most authors refer to the renal disease which develops in patients who consume large amounts of analgesics as <b>analgesic</b> “abuse” <b>nephropathy.</b> There are, however, in our opinion, a number of disadvantages {{to the use of the}} word “abuse” in that designation. The major disadvantage lies in the judgmental nature of the word abuse. This word implies that something about the patients' use of analgesics is consciously inappropriate. There are, however, no data to support this implication. As we will discuss subsequently, it is not proven that only doses of analgesics beyond those prescribed by physicians or needed for relief of pain are associated with the development of renal disease. We, therefore, prefer to refer to this entity as <b>analgesic</b> “associated” <b>nephropathy</b> (AAN); and we will do so throughout this paper...|$|R
40|$|Relationship between nonphenacetin {{combined}} analgesics and nephropathy: A review. BackgroundThe {{debate on}} the association between nonphenacetin-containing combined analgesics and renal disease has lasted for several years. MethodA peer review committee of scientists, selected jointly by the regulatory authorities of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and the pharmaceutical industry was asked to critically review data {{on the relationship between}} nonphenacetin combined <b>analgesics</b> and <b>nephropathy.</b> ResultsThe committee regarded epidemiologic evidence on nonphenacetin combined analgesics as inconclusive because of sparse information and substantial methodological problems. The committee also noted that a diagnosis of analgesic-associated nephropathy (AAN) in clinical practice usually depends on information about exposure before or {{in the early stages of}} the disease and is seldom accompanied by specific histologic evidence. The morphologic finding of papillary calcification can arise from other conditions and is not specific for AAN. For these reasons, the identification criteria for AAN should be reappraised with scientific methods to validate the diagnostic procedure. In the limited amount of experimental pharmacological data in humans and animals, the committee found no convincing evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that nonphenacetin combined analgesics are more nephrotoxic than single formulations. For caffeine taken with combined analgesics, the currently available information is not sufficient to postulate a harmful toxicological effect. ConclusionThe committee's two main conclusions were that sufficient evidence is absent to associate nonphenacetin combined <b>analgesics</b> with <b>nephropathy</b> and that new studies should be done to provide appropriate data for resolving the question...|$|R
25|$|As {{the use of}} {{phenacetin}} declined, so too did {{the prevalence}} of <b>analgesic</b> <b>nephropathy</b> {{as a cause of}} end-stage kidney disease. Data from Switzerland, for example, demonstrated a decline in the prevalence of <b>analgesic</b> <b>nephropathy</b> among people with end-stage kidney disease, from 28% in 1981 to 12% in 1990. An autopsy study performed in Switzerland suggested that the prevalence of <b>analgesic</b> <b>nephropathy</b> in the general population has likewise decreased; the prevalence was 3% in 1980 and 0.2% in 2000.|$|E

25|$|How {{phenacetin}} {{and other}} analgesics lead to this damage is incompletely understood.

Patients were classified according to serum level S beta 2 m {{to take into account}} the possibility of overflow proteinuria at S beta 2 m > or = 5 mg/liter. Three patients (CHN 0) with a S beta 2 m or = 5 mg/liter had a markedly increased excretion of all LMWP, albumin and NAG (CHN 1 vs. CHN 2, P < 0. 05) as well as a further increase in total proteinuria and SCr. The urinary LMWP/albumin concentration ratio was strikingly higher in CHN patients than in patients with glomerular albuminuria (CHN 1 vs. DN and NS, P < 0. 01) or moderate renal failure with elevated S beta 2 m level (CHN 2 vs. GN, P < 0. 01), confirming the existence of a tubular proteinuria independent of glomerular albuminuria or overflow proteinuria. A similar proteinuria pattern was present in the two toxic nephropathies (CdN and AN). This pattern was no longer recognizable after transplantation.

40|$|Abstract Background An ad hoc peer-review {{committee}} was jointly appointed by Drug Authorities and Industry in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in 1999 / 2000 {{to review the}} evidence for a causal relation between phenacetin-free <b>analgesics</b> and <b>nephropathy.</b> The committee found the evidence as inconclusive and requested a new case-control study of adequate design. Methods We performed a population-based case-control study with incident cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) {{under the age of}} 50 years and four age and sex-matched neighborhood controls in 170 dialysis centers (153 in Germany, and 17 in Austria) from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2004. Data on lifetime medical history, risk factors, treatment, job exposure and intake of analgesics were obtained in a standardized face-to-face interview using memory aids to enhance accuracy. Study design, study performance, analysis plan, and study report were approved by an independent international advisory committee and by the Drug Authorities involved. Unconditional logistic regression analyses were performed. Results The analysis included 907 cases and 3, 622 controls who had never used phenacetin-containing analgesics in their lifetime. The use of high cumulative lifetime dose (3 rd tertile) of analgesics in the period up to five years before dialysis was not associated with later ESRD. Adjusted odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were 0. 8 (0. 7 – 1. 0) and 1. 0 (0. 8 – 1. 3) for ever- compared with no or low use and high use compared with low use, respectively. The same results were found for all analgesics and for mono-, and combination preparations with and without caffeine. No increased risk was shown in analyses stratifying for dose and duration. Dose-response analyses showed that analgesic use was not associated with an increased risk for ESRD up to 3. 5 kg cumulative lifetime dose (98 % of the cases with ESRD). While the large subgroup of users with a lifetime dose up to 0. 5 kg (278 cases and 1365 controls) showed a significantly decreased risk, a tiny subgroup of extreme users with over 3. 5 kg lifetime use (19 cases and 11 controls) showed a significant risk increase. The detailed evaluation of 22 cases and 19 controls with over 2. 5 kg lifetime use recommended by the regulatory advisors showed an impressive excess of other conditions than analgesics triggering the evolution of ESRD in cases compared with controls. Conclusion We found no clinically meaningful evidence for an increased risk of ESRD associated with use of phenacetin-free analgesics in single or combined formulation. The apparent risk increase shown in a small subgroup with extreme lifetime dose of analgesics is most likely an indirect, non-causal association. This hypothesis, however, cannot be confirmed or refuted within our case-control study. Overall, our results lend support to the mounting evidence that phenacetin-free analgesics do not induce ESRD and that the notion of "analgesic nephropathy" needs to be re-evaluated. </p...|$|R
