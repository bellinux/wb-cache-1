40|$|The {{formation}} {{of ice in}} detached kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) fruit was investigated in a freeze chamber by thermal analysis. Ice nucleation (IN) occurred between - 3. 1 and - 4. 9 -degrees-C. The distribution of IN temperatures followed a normal distribution with a mean (+/- SD) at - 3. 9 +/- 0. 5 -degrees-C. Forth-three cases were also monitored in the field, where a sample of fruit was checked for frost damage whenever the air temperature dropped below zero. The field data obtained confirmed that exposure of fruits to air temperatures below - 3 -degrees-C creates the conditions for a freezing event in kiwifruit fruit. The longer the exposure of fruits to temperatures below - 3 -degrees-C and/or the lower the temperature, the higher the probability of ice nucleation. The relationship between air temperature and the temperature of fruits under field conditions is discussed for two different hoar frost cases: <b>advective</b> <b>frost</b> and radiation frost...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{equipment}} available for evaluating frost hardiness of forest tree planting stock. The {{procedures and precautions}} necessary in under-taking such work are also outlined. The most common and accessible method of evaluating frost hardiness is to raise plants at one or more field sites where plants grow, harden and freeze naturally. However, the frequency and severity of frosts {{in the field are}} unpredictable and uncontrollable. To overcome these problems various commercial cold rooms and cabinets, often modified to provide controlled rates of freezing and thawing, have been used. In some cases these cabinets are portable to allow field plants to be frosted in situ. Freezing bars have also been developed which allow samples of plants to be frosted over a range of temperatures at the same time. Recently, specialised radiation and <b>advective</b> <b>frost</b> rooms have been designed which, although costly to construct and operate, provide very precise, controlled and reproducible ''natural " frosts. Most techniques can distinguish differences in frost tolerance between plants, but only those providing control of all phases of the frost treatment will allow the results to be extrapolated confidently from laboratory to the field. Access to more than one frost temperature is essential if differences in frost tolerance are to be quantified. The final test of the frost tolerance of forest planting stock, however, must remain its performance in the field...|$|E
40|$|Seedlings of Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) {{raised in}} seven {{nurseries}} in New Zealand {{were subjected to}} <b>advective</b> <b>frosts</b> in controlled-environment rooms in autumn (May), winter (August), and spring (October) to determine their seasonal patterns of frost tolerance. At each of these times four levels of frost were provided which allowed differences in frost tolerance to be quantified. The seedlings from Kaingaroa and Athol nurseries withstood frosts of- 11 °,- 12 °, and- 10 °C in May, August, and October respectively, whereas Bulls stock tolerated- 6 °,- 9 °, and- 5. 5 °C at these times. Stock from Edendale, Rangiora, Te Teko, and Owhata were intermediate in their responses. Although there was general agreement with published work that changes in temperature and daylength appeared to relate to frost tolerance, a more precise relationship could not be found. In fact, generally, the higher the altitude of the nursery the greater was the frost tolerance of the stock produced...|$|R
