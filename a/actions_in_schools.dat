The object of inquiry in this paper is the movement of meaning aimed by educational <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> education system and a material of the object is found in the discussion concerning educational <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the situation of coping with "school non-attendance" phenomena.

I take up structure, function and meaning as main moment which materializes school education system. I classify some phases of the connection of educational action on the basis of relation among structure, function and meaning <b>in</b> <b>school</b> education system.

As a result of inquiry I argue the following. The fluctuation from the framework of conventional meaning system <b>in</b> existing <b>school</b> education sysytem can be perceived through the movement of meaning aimed by educational <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the situation of coping with "school non-attendance" phenomena. The means for creating educational <b>action</b> <b>in</b> which meaning enrichment is gained in teacher-pupil relation and teachers' mutual relation can be found through self-reference on meaning of micro-educational action.

This article aims to enhance our understanding of the connections between school inspections and their impact on school improvement, using a longitudinal survey of principals and teachers in primary and secondary education. Random effects models and a longitudinal path model suggest that school inspections in particular have an impact on principals, but less so on teachers. The results indicate that the actual impact on improved school and teaching conditions, and ultimately student achievement, is limited. Schools in different inspection categories report different mechanisms of potential impact; the lack of any correlation between accepting feedback, setting expectations and stakeholder sensitivity and improvement <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> suggests that the impact of school inspections is not a linear process, but operates through diffuse and cyclical processes of change...|$|E

In the implementation stage, policies are converted to <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> through the use of explicit and implicit programmes and pedagogic activities. However, as different schools manage reforms at different rates, and because they adopt different strategies, the reforms produce varying degrees of the desired change. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} show that despite the government’s support for putting in place an educational system that promotes the concept of Teach Less, Learn More, this concept may not be being effectively translated into practice at the school level. In the case study school, the reforms were implemented through the “safe ” strategy of Learn More, Teach More. This paper addresses this policy translation process at three levels. First, it looks at the MOE Science syllabus to study the overall recommended changes made by the govern-ment and the ministry that schools were supposed to adopt in their curriculum. Second, it examines a school’s science schemes of work in 2002, before the implementation of the 2004 educational reforms, and in 2005, after the implementation of the reforms. Third, it includes a general comparison of several websites in Singapore to understand how other school curriculum documents trace this policy translating process...|$|E

Trachoma recurrence that is common after implementing the SAFE strategy 3, 5 or even 7 times evidence that the cognitive processes requiring assimilation and integration of knowledge did not register with parents, caretakers and children. Moreover, repeated awareness campaigns to improve hygiene did not systematically produce irreversible changes of behavior in neglected populations. In view of this evidence, the rational behind mass drug administration as the mainstay of preventable blindness elimination demands a wider scope than simple mathematical models. The reluctance to see disappointing outcomes that leads to repeated interventions may suggest from a sociologic point of view that the strategies are products of those evaluating the activities of those who fund them and vice versa. A similar articulation emerges for reciprocal interactions between researchers and those judging the pertinence and quality of their work. So far, the lack of autocritic elimination strategy approaches may expose inbred circles that did not properly grasp the fact that antibiotics, trichiasis surgery and education limited to improvement of hygiene are inefficient if not associated with long-term basic educational <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools...</b>|$|E

The strength of the visual approach in interrogating school cultural norms and the problematising of the tangled complexities of knowing about schooling, identity and pedagogy are outlined. An {{important aspect of the}} study is the foregrounding of educational practice as a social act occurring in response to historical circumstances and changing social contexts (Brown & Jones, 2001). We see this work as an important step towards democratization of the research relationship and empowerment of students to contribute to the way they are educated. But also we are wary of how representation through visual methods also can 2 ̆ 7 frame 2 ̆ 7 participants and the researchers. We recognise that one way to uncover how school practices are exemplified in Ghana is to put students in the middle of researching their experiences. In this way, our research moved from constructing students as simply consumers of adult designed and managed products to practices based on democratic participation (Thomson & Gunter, 2007). Throughout the research journey we were guided by the fact that knowledge is not neutral or to be discovered. Culture and communicative processes are essential determinants of reality. In this study the students as researchers, produced photographs that trigger dialectical conversations of students’ perspectives that foreground their experiences at school.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the methods of}} risk assessment from exposure to radon. Proposed methods implement a differentiated approach to the risk estimates calculation procedure which depends on the purpose of risk assessment. This approach {{is based on the}} analysis of the results of practical tests of different risk assessment models on arrays Russian medical and demographic data with and without consideration of the synergistic effect of smoking, in simple and complex exposure scenarios. All of these tests were performed in previous 5 years (results are available elsewhere). In this work the evaluation of effectiveness of radon mitigation <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> was used as a test task and results obtained using 4 models («EPA- 2003 », «Wismut- 2006 », «FCZ» and «Tomasek- 2014 ») were compared. If it is important to evaluate the effect of reduction of radon concentration on the health of children and adolescents in terms of lifetime lung cancer risk, «Tomasek- 2014 » model will be the best choice. It is as sensitive as «FCZ» model and ERR is close to that from «Wismut- 2006 » model, which was earlier proposed by other authors for use with some modifications in Russia. If the data on radon concentration are limited (for example data from radiation-hygienic passports of territories) and constant lifelong exposure scenario is considered, it seems reasonable to apply more simple «Darby- 2005 » model. Thus, the proposed methods could be used by specialists in various fields {{in a wide range of}} tasks, from the risk assessment for  the purposes of radiation-hygienic certification and comparative assessment of radiation safety of the population of different regions of Russia on the basis of the generalized statistical data, to the risk assessment in practical works where large amounts of measurement data on the radon concentration and complex exposure scenarios are used...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to describe and explain teachers’ and students’ actions related to instruction in compulsory education classrooms in Sweden. In order to approach these issues, I will focus on social mechanisms (processes) that can explain teachers’ and students’ actions in the classroom. I argue that such mechanisms and <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> have been sparsely studied in previous research. Study I deals with the research question, Why does the teaching practice of individual work and class teaching occur in Swedish classrooms? Study II deals with the research question, Why does usage of instructional materials (whiteboards, laptops, paper-based materials, textbooks) vary across Swedish classrooms? Study III deals with the research question, Why does student behavioral disengagement occur and reoccur in Swedish classrooms? Study IV deals with the research question, Why and how do students’ expectations about school, teacher–student relations, students’ commitment to school, and truancy mediate the effects of student social background on mathematics achievement across Swedish schools? For the first three studies, I used video data that I analyzed using multiple methods such as descriptive statistics, cox regression, field notes, transcripts, and pictures. In Study IV, I used secondary data from Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development analyzed with structural equation modelling (SEM). In Studies I and II, the school class was the unit of analysis. In Studies III and IV, the individual student was the unit of analysis. Study I indicates the increasing individualization of teaching. Furthermore, Study I indicates that subject area predicts teaching practice. Study II indicates that teachers use text-based materials more than textbooks or laptops. The study also suggests that class size affects students’ usage of instructional materials in teaching practice, as do school subjects. Study III indicates that peer encouragement and school subject can predict student behavioral disengagement. Study IV indicates {{that the relationship between}} student background and mathematics achievement is mediated by school expectations, truancy, and commitment. Moreover, I also identify an independent indirect effect of the teacher–student relationship on the average predicted mathematics achievement...|$|E
40|$|Nesta dissertação buscamos entender como a Psicologia Educacional e Escolar, juntamente com a Arte, pode contribuir para a formação continuada de educadores. Sabemos que o trabalho em Educação requer a todo o momento partilhar e pensar conjuntamente práticas abrangendo todos os profissionais destes contextos. Além da atuação no cotidiano da escola, é preciso pensar-se também nos referenciais teóricos que sustentam estas ações de modo que possam integrar-se efetivamente às atividades educacionais. Considerando esta articulação entre teoria e prática e oferecendo espaços para que educadores possam compartilhar e estudar sobre aspectos que envolvem seus fazeres, oferecemos uma proposta de formação continuada, em grupo, buscando contribuir com o desenvolvimento do educador nos aspectos cognitivos, afetivos, sociais e estéticos. Escolhemos a Arte para ser nosso mote por considerarmos que ela, em suas diferentes linguagens, instiga de forma diferenciada o desenvolvimento das funções psíquicas superiores e também amplia o repertório {{cultural}} dos sujeitos, além de trabalhar a expressividade, criatividade e outros aspectos imprescindíveis para a função docente. Além disto, para que o profissional consiga propor atividades diferenciadas em sala de aula, que provoquem processos de aprendizagem no estudante e que considerem as particularidades dos sujeitos é preciso que ele também vivencie, se aproprie e, assim, possa compartilhar essas vivências com outrem. Assim, propusemos dez encontros, com quatro horas de duração cada, em um centro de formação da Prefeitura Municipal da cidade de Uberlândia MG, que teve participação voluntária de educadores da rede municipal. Reunimo-nos durante um semestre e cada encontro foi pensado em uma estrutura que abrangeu primeiramente uma parte teórica e posteriormente uma parte prática e partilha de experiências. Os encontros tiveram temáticas que envolveram artes visuais, literatura, música, teatro, cinema, e também versaram sobre aspectos de formação teórico-conceitual dos participantes, especialmente o enfoque histórico-cultural e a formação continuada de educadores. Durante todos os encontros foram propostas atividades que buscassem contribuir para o desenvolvimento profissional e pessoal do educador e oferecer ferramentas para pensar e repensar sua atividade em contextos educacionais. Analisamos a proposta realizada por meio de registros dos participantes efetuados em seus diários de bordo, no Caderno do Grupo e pela observação e participação da pesquisadora durante o curso. Por meio da leitura minuciosa do material elencamos três principais eixos de análise, os quais se agregaram por similaridade no que tange ao conteúdo: a) Educadores no curso de extensão: trajetórias e reflexões, b) A Arte como possibilidade diferenciada de formação e c) Reflexões sobre a atuação do psicólogo educacional e escolar em contextos de formação. Assim, tecemos algumas interlocuções a partir destes registros pensando nos diálogos entre Educação, Arte e Psicologia bem como as contribuições para a formação continuada de educadores. Salientamos a importância do psicólogo educacional e escolar inserido nestes contextos, e principalmente colocamos a Arte como elemento diferenciado de formação, construindo fazeres que visem contribuir tanto com o campo da Psicologia como da Educação. In this dissertation we {{aimed at}} understanding how Educational and School Psychology, together with Art, {{could contribute to}} the continuing formation of educators. We know that working in education demands disposition all the time/at any time to share and think together about practices that can encompass professionals working on those contexts. In addition to performing <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> daily routines, {{it is necessary to}} think of theoretical framework that helps to underpin those actions, in order to effectively integrate them into educational activities. Taking into consideration this articulation between theory and practice and offering spaces for educators to share and study about issues involving their jobs, we offer a proposal of continuing education, in groups, wishing to {{contribute to the development of}} the educator in cognitive, affective, social and aesthetic aspects. We chose art as our main object in this work, because we consider it to instigate the development of higher mental functions due to its different languages and also because it broadens the cultural repertoire of subjects, in addition to working expressiveness, creativity and other aspects which are essential to the teaching function. Moreover, in order that the professional can propose different activities within the classroom, which stimulate the student s learning processes and take into consideration the particularities of each person, it is necessary that the teacher experience it too, take ownership of it and thus he will be able to share those experiences with other people. Thus, we proposed ten meetings, with four hours each, at a formation center located in the Municipality of Uberlândia Minas Gerais, with voluntary participation of municipal teachers. We joined together during a semester and each meeting was organized in a format that primarily involved a theoretical part and later a practical part with a moment dedicated to share experiences. The meetings themes involved visual arts, literature, music, theater, movies, and also included theoretical and conceptual formation aspects of the participants, especially the cultural-historical approach and continuing training/formation of teachers/educators. In all meetings we proposed activities that sought to contribute to educators personal and professional development and to provide tools to think and rethink their activity in educational contexts. The proposal was analyzed by means of records made by the participants in their logbooks, in the Group s Notebook and by observation and participation of the researcher during the course. After a close reading of the material, we selected three main guiding points of analysis, which were aggregated by similarity with respect to their content, as follows : a) Educators in extension course: trajectories and reflections, b) Art as a differentiated formation possibility and c) Reflections on the role of educational and school psychologists in formation contexts. So forth, we have established some dialogues based on those records, thinking of dialogues between education, Art and Psychology as well as its contributions to the continuing formation of educators. We would like to highlight the importance of the educational and school psychologist inserted in these contexts, and we especially used Art as a distinguished element of formation, constructing works which aim at helping both Psychology and Educational areas...|$|E

The demand for {{research in the area of}} human health and environmental safety management of nanotechnologies is present since a decade and identified by several landmark reports and studies. Several guidance documents have been published. It is not the intention of this compendium to report on these as they are widely available. It is also not the intention to publish scientific papers and research results as this task is covered by scientific conferences and the peer reviewed press. The intention of the compendium is to bring together researchers, create synergy in their work, and establish links and communication between them mainly during the actual research phase before publication of results. Towards this purpose we find useful to give emphasis to communication of projects strategic aims, extensive coverage of specific work objectives and of methods used in research, strengthening human capacities and laboratories infrastructure, supporting collaboration for common goals and joint elaboration of future plans, without compromising scientific publication potential or IP Rights. These targets are far from being achieved with the publication in its present shape. We shall continue working, though, and hope with the assistance of the research community to make significant progress. The publication will take the shape of a dynamic, frequently updated, web-based document available free of charge to all interested parties.

The preponderance of males was explained by the type of mainly manual professional training offered at the schools. 2 / 3 of the students lived in Lausanne or other urban areas. 10 % were found to be well informed, 70 % relatively well informed, and 20 % poorly informed about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. 75 - 98 % responded correctly to a list of questions about transmission modes of HIV infection, a higher proportion than found in American studies of comparable cohorts. 94 % of males and 76 % of females had handled condoms and 58 % of males and 17 % of females had bought them, but only 23 % of males and 10 % of females used them regularly. 76 % of males and 66 % of females were sexually active; by age 19, over 90 % of both sexes were sexually active. 20 % of males and 40 % of females had 1 partner. 40 % of the sample had 2 - 4 partners, and 40 % of males and 20 % of females had 5 or more partners. 45 % of males and 63 % of females had used contraception since their 1 st sexual relation, but 20 % of males and 13 % of females had never used contraception. There was no significant difference in attitude toward condoms or in condom use between respondents with different numbers of partners. The data indicate that these students are well informed on the whole about the transmission of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, but that they have difficulty in putting their knowledge into practice. The figures should be interpreted cautiously and limitations in the representativeness of the sample and in the survey methodology should be kept in mind. Individual counseling by physicians treating adolescents and preventive <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> and elsewhere should be intensified to help adolescents modify their behavior and make it more congruent with their level of knowledge. oai:serval. unil. ch:BIB_B 28 A 9 CDEC 67 A 2017 - 11 - 29 T 16 : 08 : 57 Z [URL] Relationship between autonomic neuropathy and thermogenesis in non diabetic and diabetic obese patients. info:pmid: 3569633 Golay, A. Schutz, Y. Dusmet, M. Felber, J. P. Jequier, E. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 1987 Diabète and Métabolisme 13152 - 57 <![CDATA[Autonomic neuropathy is a well known complication of diabetes. Diabetes is often superimposed on obesity. A reduction in the variability of the heart rate in the resting state has been demonstrated in 16 obese diabetic subjects as well as in 34 obese non-diabetic subjects. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the heart rate during 30 minutes of resting was significantly decreased in both obese groups (3. 9 +/- 0. 2 % for the diabetics; 5. 2 +/- 0. 2 %, p less than 0. 01 for the non diabetics) as compared to their own controls (4. 5 +/- 0. 6 % and 6. 5 +/- 0. 4 %, respectively). Age also contributes to decreased heart rate variability. Furthermore, this defect of autonomic function has been correlated with the blunted glucose-induced thermogenesis (GIT) seen in both obese groups (r = 0. 52, p. less than 0. 001) : the increase in energy expenditure over basal values following a 100 g oral glucose load was only 4. 8 +/- 0. 8 % for the diabetic obese group (p less than 0. 001), and 8. 5 +/- 0. 7 % for the non-diabetic obese group (p less than 0. 001) as opposed to their own controls (12. 4 +/- 1. 3 % and 13. 3 +/- 0. 6 % respectively). Measurement of the variability of heart rate in obese individuals may be of predictive value in assessing blunted glucose-induced thermogenesis in non diabetic and diabetic obese patients...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{unequivocally}} {{indicate that}} teachers {{have a more}} significant effect on learner performance than any other school factor and that their professional development leads to improved teacher learning and increased learner performance. However, the conceptualisation of professional development for teachers {{for the sake of}} meaningful change in education remains a great challenge. In line with international trends, professional development has become a key priority in South Africa. For this reason the National Policy Framework for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa and the Integrated Strategic Planning Framework for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa, 2011 – 2025 are regarded as government initiatives to meet the need for qualified professional teachers. This article focuses on the matters that should be taken into account in order to apply continuing professional development successfully according to South African teacher education policy documents in order to improve teacher learning, learner performance and, eventually, education itself. In this article I use primarily adult learning and the different orientations of teacher learning to understand teachers' professional development and to maximise opportunities for teachers' growth and development in order to improve teaching and learning practice in schools. According to current organisation learning, adult learning is proposed on two levels, namely individual learning and collective learning, which means that individual learning is an essential but insufficient condition for collective learning in the development of personnel. Because teacher learning is a dynamic process, it cannot be clearly understood unless teachers' development is separated from the school environment in which they work. A further extension of the model identifies three types of influence on teachers' learning: individual learning orientations, school-level or collective learning, and the way both of these affect the learning activities in which teachers participate. Individual learning orientations lead to values, experiences and instruction practices, while school-level orientations with regard to professional development are the result of interaction and collective values relating to teacher learning and development. Both individual and collective learning then imply changes in teacher learning that can bring about changes in convictions, in teaching practice and in learner performance. In light of the above, a number of guidelines are proposed according to which the policy of continuing personnel development for South African teachers can be better understood. Criticism of the two current frameworks – the National Policy Framework for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa and the Integrated Strategic Planning Framework for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa – indicates that there are insufficient guidelines for the effective application of professional development. The following guidelines are proposed: 1. Professional development should be ongoing and intensive and should be linked to classroom practice. Development programmes usually {{take the form of a}} passive transfer of knowledge and are often not contextualised, with little cooperation among colleagues. When professional development is reconceptualised in order to meet the needs of adult learners, workshops are replaced with learning opportunities that become part of teachers' daily activities and responsibilities, experimenting with new ideas and the analysis of these <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools.</b> 2. Continuing professional development should focus on specific curriculum content and learner achievement. Development activities that are aimed at the improvement of subject content and skills in teaching the subject promote teachers' knowledge and skills. These developmental activities are effective because they make the professional development applicable and authentic for teachers' daily classroom practice. However, in practice it would seem that professional development programmes often bear no relation to teachers' classroom practice and for this reason teachers' needs are not being sufficiently met. When teachers are involved in identifying their needs, the learning experience will be practical and applicable to their classroom practice. One condition for effective professional development is, however, is, however, the teachers' willingness, desire and dedication to learn and develop professionally and to apply the new knowledge and skills in practice. 3. Personnel development should be brought in line with school development priorities and objectives. Professional learning is strongly shaped by the context in which the teacher works. This means that the teachers’ professional learning can be better understood when the role that schools play in teachers' learning is thoroughly understood. Studies have shown that teachers make greater changes to their classroom practice when they actively participate in professional learning activities at school. Therefore, professional development programmes should be mainly school-based and should focus on the learning processes of teachers and on methods to improve their teaching practices. 4. Professional development implies strong collective relationships among teachers. Collective participation by and cooperation between teachers are regarded as extremely important for effective teachers’ learning. This implies intensive interaction in which teachers openly participate and during which they examine their beliefs and practices and then debate them. In teams, teachers take responsibility for using a cycle of continuing learner improvement to identify learners' needs and the areas in which teachers should meet these needs in order to create the learning experiences required to do so, and that will enable them to apply the new skills in the classroom. These skills should then be evaluated and, finally, the improvement cycle repeated using new objectives. In these communities teachers also have the opportunity to share their teaching experiences and instructional material and also to receive feedback on their classroom practice in a safe, supportive environment. This community practice framework rests in particular on the assumption that individual knowledge construction does not take place in a vacuum, but that the construction of knowledge, skills, attitudes and convictions is culturally and socially situated. Because intensive involvement is required, mere membership of such network practices is inadequate for improving school and learner performance. The connectedness has to be strong and profound. 5. The school leadership plays an important role in professional development. In particular it is the school culture that school principals create that can contribute to the way in which personnel associate professionally and that fosters the community culture, collegiality, support and trust that is firmly grounded in democratic convictions and values. In this regard the following matters play a role: the development of a vision of new learner possibilities, involvement in own professional development, giving guidance for learning, organising of learning opportunities and monitoring of and feedback on professional development. 6. The influence of professional development on practice should be evaluated. Without it the effectiveness of teachers' professional development with regard to practice is questioned. Currently, the quality of the evaluation of professional development programmes and systems is not as desired. However, evaluation is important because it provides decision-makers and funders with proof of the effectiveness of programmes, it can lead to the improvement of such programmes and it reassures teachers that their time and investment in professional development are not in vain. Although, according to the literature, ongoing attempts are being made to refine key aspects of professional development and much progress has already been made, the professional development of teachers is a complex issue. For this reason the effective application of professional development policy holds certain challenges. The key question is whether the implementation of the proposed policy for continuing professional development can really contribute to improved classroom and teacher practice. The implementation of this policy and the questions over its effectiveness in turn raise the following questions: • Are the duration and intensity of the various professional development activities sufficient and are they adequately related to classroom practice and teachers' responsibilities? How are professional development activities linked to school contexts? • Do professional development activities focus sufficiently on curriculum content and learner performance? • Does professional development make sufficient provision for strong, collective relationships among teachers? How can teachers be given feedback when they apply their newly acquired knowledge and skills? • How can the crucial role played by school leadership in the professional development of teachers be emphasised? Until there is a sound conception of the way individual teachers and schools influence each other it will remain difficult to indicate the ways in which the professional development of teachers can be made more effective. Nevertheless, the findings of this study could enable policymakers to conceptualise the professional development of teachers further by creating professional development opportunities that are of longer duration, supporting schools to create more cooperative learning environments and developing opportunities for teacher feedback after the establishment of programmes and suitable evaluation in order to determine the results of professional development.
