40|$|Iron-reducing {{bacteria}} {{have been}} reported to reduce humic acids and low-molecular-weight quinones with electrons from acetate or hydrogen oxidation. Due to the rapid chemical reaction of <b>amorphous</b> ferric <b>iron</b> with the reduced reaction products, humic acids and low-molecular-weight redox mediators may {{play an important role in}} biological iron reduction. Since many anaerobic bacteria that are not able to reduce <b>amorphous</b> ferric <b>iron</b> directly are known to transfer electrons to other external acceptors, such as ferricyanide, 2, 6 -anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS), or molecular oxygen, we tested several physiologically different species of fermenting bacteria to determine their abilities to reduce humic acids. Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Lactococcus lactis, and Enterococcus cecorum all shifted their fermentation patterns towards more oxidized products when humic acids were present; P. freudenreichii even oxidized propionate to acetate under these conditions. When <b>amorphous</b> ferric <b>iron</b> was added to reoxidize the electron acceptor, humic acids were found to be equally effective when they were added in substoichiometric amounts. These findings indicate that in addition to iron-reducing bacteria, fermenting bacteria are also capable of channeling electrons from anaerobic oxidations via humic acids towards iron reduction.

50|$|Lepidocrocite and {{goethite}} are {{the first}} <b>amorphous</b> <b>iron</b> oxyhydroxides that appear upon oxidation of iron. High corrosion rates are initially observed. Then, an essential chemical reaction intervenes: slag and unreduced iron oxides (second phase particles) in the iron microstructure alter the polarisation characteristics and enrich the metal-scale interface with phosphorus, thus indirectly promoting passivation of the iron (cessation of rusting activity). The second-phase particles act as a cathode, and the metal itself serves as anode, for a mini-galvanic corrosion reaction during environment exposure. Part of the initial iron oxyhydroxides is also transformed into magnetite, which somewhat slows down the process of corrosion. The ongoing reduction of lepidocrocite and the diffusion of oxygen and complementary corrosion through the cracks and pores in the rust still contribute to the corrosion mechanism from atmospheric conditions.The next main agent to intervene in protection from oxidation is phosphorus, enhanced at the metal-scale interface by the same chemical interaction previously described between the slags and the metal. The ancient Indian smiths did not add lime to their furnaces. The use of limestone as in modern blast furnaces yields pig iron that is later converted into steel; in the process, most phosphorus is carried away by the slag. The absence of lime in the slag {{and the use of}} specific quantities of wood with high phosphorus content (for example, Cassia auriculata) during the smelting induces a higher phosphorus content (> 0.1%, average 0.25%) than in modern iron produced in blast furnaces (usually less than 0.05%). One analysis gives 0.10% in the slags for 0.18% in the iron itself. This high phosphorus content and particular repartition are essential catalysts in the formation of a passive protective film of misawite (d-FeOOH), an <b>amorphous</b> <b>iron</b> oxyhydroxide that forms a barrier by adhering next to the interface between metal and rust. Misawite, the initial corrosion-resistance agent, was thus named because of the pioneering studies of Misawa and co-workers on the effects of phosphorus and copper and those of alternating atmospheric conditions in rust formation.|$|E

An analysis of the spectra with the method of Lines and Eibschutz yields average magnetic hyperfine fields of 29. 1 and 25. 9 T at 78 and 295 K, respectively. The corresponding moments of 1. 9 mu(B), and 1. 7 mu(B), agree well with values obtained from earlier magnetization studies and, further, provide strong experimental support for earlier calculations of the magnetic moments in <b>amorphous</b> <b>iron.</b> The observed average isomer shifts of 0. 27 and 0. 14 mm/s obtained at 78 and 295 K, respectively, correspond to {{a decrease in the}} s-electron density at the iron- 57 nucleus as compared to that of alpha-iron, a decrease which is consistent with the decreased coordination number of <b>amorphous</b> <b>iron.</b> The similarity of the 295 K iron K-edge x-ray-absorption spectrum of <b>amorphous</b> <b>iron</b> and alpha-iron, up to 7130 eV, indicates that the d-electron density of states just above the Fermi level is similar in both forms of iron. The absence of structural details above 7130 eV in the spectrum of <b>amorphous</b> <b>iron</b> indicates, in agreement with multiple-scattering calculations, that long-range order does not extend beyond the third shell of neighbors in <b>amorphous</b> <b>iron.</b> Greatly reduced extended x-ray-absorption-fine-structure scattering is observed at the iron K edge of <b>amorphous</b> <b>iron</b> as compared to alpha-iron.
