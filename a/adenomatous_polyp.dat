40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{etiology}} of colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps,</b> although they are generally considered to be precursor lesions to colorectal carcinoma. To investigate the associations of colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> with dietary intake of calcium, total fat and fiber, a case comparison study was conducted among 98 persons who had first occurrences of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> and 408 persons who did not have colorectal polyps. ^ The study population comprised Black, White and Hispanic males and females ages 35 to 80 inclusive, who underwent a sigmoidoscopy or total colonoscopy at collaborating clinics in the Texas Medical Center at Houston between September 1991 and November 1992, and met the eligibility criteria. Case participants were those who had a first-time diagnosis of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> Comparison participants were individuals who underwent the same diagnostic procedure as the cases and met the same eligibility criteria but had no colorectal polyps. A food frequency questionnaire was administered by interview to obtain information about diet during the 28 days preceding the interview. ^ Dietary intake of total fiber was inversely associated with risk of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> An increment of 15 gm/day in energy-adjusted intake of fiber was associated with a relative odds of 0. 39 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 20 to 0. 79, after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, cigarette smoking, family history of colorectal cancer and intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. No association between dietary intake of total fat and risk of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> was observed. When total fat was analyzed as percent of energy, an increment of 15. 3 % in intake was associated with a relative odds of 0. 98 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 53 to 1. 80. However, few persons in the study group had intakes below 25 % of energy from total fat. An inverse association was observed between energy-adjusted intake of dietary calcium and risk of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps,</b> but this was not statistically significant; an increment of 638 mg/day was associated with a relative odds of 0. 77 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 41 to 1. 38. Intake of calcium did not appear to strongly modify the association between intake of fat and risk of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps,</b> perhaps because the study group included few people with calcium intake below 400 mg/day. ^ These results support the idea that dietary fiber decreases risk of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> Further studies are needed on the association of dietary calcium and fat with risk of colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> in populations where individuals vary widely in intake of these nutrients. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In recent years, the {{incidence}} of early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) has markedly increased in the population within the Republic of Korea. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinicopathologic features of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> in TNM stage I CRC patients and in the general population. Methods: Between March 2003 and September 2009, 168 patients with stage I CRC were enrolled in this study. In addition, the records of 4, 315 members of the general population without CRC, as determined by colonoscopy during a health check-up, were reviewed. Results: Of the 168 patients with stage I CRC, 68 (40. 5 %) had coexisting colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> and of the 4, 315 members of the general population, 1, 112 (26. 0 %) had coexisting <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> (P = 0. 006). The prevalences of ad-enomatous polyp multiplicity in early CRC and in the general population were 32 % and 15 %, respectively (P = 0. 023). Pa-tients with coexisting <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> had a higher frequency of tubulovillous or villous adenomas than members of the general population with polyps (7. 5 % vs. 2. 0 %, P = 0. 037). Furthermore, a subgroup analysis showed that the occur-rence (44 % vs. 34 %, P = 0. 006) and the multiplicity (32 % vs. 15 %, P = 0. 023) of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> were greater for T 2 than T 1 cancer. Conclusion: The prevalence and the multiplicity of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> in TNM stage I CRC is higher than it is in the gen-eral population. The findings of this study suggest that depth of invasion of early stage CRC affects the prevalence and the number of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> in the remaining colon and rectum...|$|R
50|$|According to the {{guidelines}} {{established by the}} American Cancer Society, individuals who reach the age of 50 should perform an occult blood test yearly. Colon polyps as they grow can sometimes cause bleeding within the intestine, which can be detected {{with the help of}} this test. Also, persons in their 50s are recommended to have flexible sigmoidoscopies performed once in 3 to 5 years to detect any abnormal growth which could be an <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp.</b> If adenomatous polyps are detected during this procedure, it is most likely that the patient will have to undergo a colonoscopy. Medical societies recommend colonoscopies every ten years starting at age 50 as a necessary screening practice for colon cancer. The screening provides an accurate image of the intestine and also allows the removal of the polyp, if found. Once an <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> is identified during colonoscopy, there are several methods of removal including using a snare or a heating device. Colonoscopies are preferred over sigmoidoscopies because they allow the examination of the entire colon; a very important aspect, considering {{that more than half of}} the colonic polyps occur in the upper colon, which is not reached during sigmoidoscopies.|$|E

50|$|Colon polyps are not {{commonly}} associated with symptoms. Occasionally rectal bleeding, and on rare occasions pain, diarrhea or constipation may occur because of colon polyps. Colon polyps are a concern {{because of the potential}} for colon cancer being present microscopically and the risk of benign colon polyps transforming over time into malignant ones. Since most polyps are asymptomatic, they are usually discovered at the time of colon cancer screening. Common screening methods are occult blood test, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy (usually flexible sigmoidoscopy, using a flexible endoscope, but more rarely the older rigid sigmoidoscopy, using a rigid endoscope), lower gastrointestinal series (barium enema), digital rectal examination (DRE), and virtual colonoscopy. The polyps are routinely removed at the time of colonoscopy either with a polypectomy snare (first description by P. Deyhle, Germany, 1970) or with biopsy forceps. If an <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> is found with sigmoidoscopy or if a polyp is found with any other diagnostic modality, the patient must undergo colonoscopy for removal of the polyp(s). Even though colon cancer is usually not found in polyps smaller than 2.5 cm, all polyps found are removed since the removal of polyps reduces the future likelihood of developing colon cancer. When adenomatous polyps are removed, a repeat colonoscopy is usually performed in three to five years.|$|E

40|$|Background: Colorectal {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. The {{detection}} and removal of the precursors to colorectal cancer, <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps,</b> is the key for screening. The aim of this study was to develop a clinically scalable (high throughput, low cost, and high sensitivity) mass spectrometry (MS) -based urine metabolomic test for the detection of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> Methods: Prospective urine and stool samples were collected from 685 participants enrolled in a colorectal cancer screening program to undergo colonoscopy examination. Statistical analysis was performed on 69 urine metabolites measured by one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify key metabolites. A targeted MS assay was then developed to quantify the key metabolites in urine. A MS-based urine metabolomic diagnostic test for <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> was established using 67 % samples (un-blinded training set) and validated using the remaining 33 % samples (blinded testing set). Results: The MS-based urine metabolomic test identifies patients with colonic <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> with an AUC of 0. 692, outperforming the NMR based predictor with an AUC of 0. 670. Conclusion: Here we describe a clinically scalable MS-based urine metabolomic test that identifies patients with <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> at a higher level of sensitivity (86 %) over current fecal-based tests (< 18 %) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the relation between cirrhosis and colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> after adjustment for alcoholism and other confounding variables. Four groups of patients aged 40 years or above were studied. Group I included 100 consecutive outpatients with irritable bowel syndrome, group II 100 consecutive alcoholic inpatients without cirrhosis, group III 100 consecutive inpatients with alcoholic cirrhosis, and group IV included 36 consecutive inpatients with non-alcoholic cirrhosis. All patients underwent colonoscopy. The prevalence of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> was 13 % in group I, 26 % in group II, 58 % in group III, and 22 % in group IV (p less than 0. 001).

40|$|Background: The C 1561 T {{variant of}} the {{glutamate}} carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) gene is critical for natural methylfolylpolyglutamte (methylfolate) absorption, and {{has been associated with}} perturbations in folate metabolism and disease susceptibility. However, little is known on C 1561 T-GCPII as a risk factor for colorectal cancer. Therefore, this study examined whether C 1561 T-GCPII influences folate metabolism and <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> occurrence. Materials and Methods: 164 controls and 38 <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> cases were analysed to determine blood folate and plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level, dietary intake of natural methylfolate, synthetic pteroylglutamic acid (PteGlu), vitamin C and C 1561 T-GCPII genotype. Results: In controls and cases, 7. 3 and 18. 4 percent of subjects respectively, were found to have the CT genotype, increasing the risk for <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> occurrence 2. 86 times (95 % CI: 1. 37 - 8. 0, p= 0. 035). Total dietary folate, methylfolate and PteGlu intake and the level of erythrocyte folate and plasma Hcy did not predict the occurrence of an <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp.</b> However, dietary natural vitamin C intake was associated with <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> risk within C 1561 T-GCPII CT genotype subjects (p= 0. 037). Conclusions: The findings suggest that C 1561 T-GCPII variation may be associated with risk for <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp,</b> and vitamin C may modify risk by interacting with the variant gene, its expression product and/or folate substrates...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} life style for {{colorectal}} cancer risk suggest that serum lipids and glucose might {{be related to}} adenomatous polyps as well as to colorectal carcinogenesis. This case-control study was conducted to investigate the associations between serum lipids, blood glucose, and other factors and the risk of colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp.</b> Male cases with colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp,</b> histologically confirmed by colonoscopy (n= 134), and the same number of male controls matched by age for men were selected in hospitals in Seoul, Korea between January 1997 and October 1998. Serum lipids and glucose levels were tested after the subjects had fasted for at least 12 hr. Conditional logistic regression showed that there was a significant trend of increasing <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> risk with the rise in serum cholesterol level (Ptrend= 0. 07). Increasing trend for the risk with triglyceride was also seen (Ptrend= 0. 01). HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol had increasing trends for the risk, which were not significant. In particular, it was noted that higher fasting blood glucose level reduced the <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> risk for men (Ptrend= 0. 001). This study concluded that both serum cholesterol and triglyceride were positively related to the increased risk for colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> in Korea.

40|$|Pseudo{{invasion}} or pseudocarcinomatous {{invasion in}} an <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> {{of the colon}} can be unfamiliar to an endoscopist. Pseudoinvasion in an <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> represents prolapse of the adenomatous epi-thelium into its stalk. In most cases its morphology does not differ from of general adenomatous polyps, {{but in some cases}} it can morphologically mimic a ma-lignant polyp with submucosal invasion due to mass-like lesioning of its stalk.

We present a patient with a preoperative histology proved diagnosis of isolated duodenal tubulovillous <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> with high-grade dysplasia for whom we performed laparoscopic antrectomy. Case Report: The patient was a 56 -year-old male with vague upper abdominal pain. Investigations revealed a 3 -cm x 3 -cm mass arising from the duodenal mucosa with no evidence of extraserosal spread. Histopathology documented an <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> with high-grade dysplasia, so a laparoscopic antrectomy was performed. Results: The patient had an uneventful postoperative period, requiring only 2 doses of parenteral analgesics. He was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. The final histopathological findings were consistent with benign hamartoma. No recurrence has been reported after 14 months of follow-up with endoscopy. Discussion: Many procedures have been described for polyps, such as endoscopic excision, duodenectomy, pancreatoduodenectomy, and laparoscopic polyp excision. In our patient, the decision to perform duodenectomy was based on the preoperative findings of a sessile tubulovillous <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> with high-grade dysplasia.

AIMS: Sulindac was given to patients with sporadic colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> to evaluate its effects on them, and histological analysis was performed to elucidate the mechanism of the polyp regression, as well the kind of adenomatous polys that are susceptible to the agent. SUBJECTS: 20 <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> in 15 patients were studied. METHODS: Sulindac (300 mg daily) was given for four months, followed by colonoscopy with removal of the residual polyps. Polyp size, degree of atypia, inflammatory cell infiltration in the polyps, and immunostaining for mutant p 53 product were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: 13 of the 20 polyps shrank or disappeared. Patient sex, polyp location, size, degree of atypia, or p 53 mutation did not affect the response, but polyps in older patients were more sensitive to sulindac. The degree of atypia or inflammatory cell infiltration was not affected by the treatment. A polyp containing a focal cancer was unresponsive.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gastric polyps {{are small}} gastric lesions, {{asymptomatic}} {{in most cases}} and are generally discovered inadvertently during upper digestive endoscopy. AIM: To retrospectively review the characteristics and frequency of gastric polyps, derived from the gastric mucosal epithelium in a large series of endoscopies. METHODS: One hundred and fifty three patients {{in a series of}} 26, 000 consecutive upper digestive endoscopies done over a 5 -year period, being that each patient had only one examination were analyzed and their histological and Yamada classification, as well as their location, size, histopathological findings and treatment studied. All patients had at least one gastric polyp, as confirmed by histological examination. RESULTS: The polyps were classified as hyperplastic, adenomatous and fundic gland polyps. The most of them measure less than 1 cm (hyperplastic polyps - 60, 5 %; <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> - 73, 6 %; fundic gland polyps - 72 %). Hyperplastic polyps were the most frequent and accounted for 71. 3 % of the cases, whereas fundic gland polyps accounted for 16. 3 % and <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> for 12. 4 %. Hyperplastic and <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> were primarily single, whereas fundic gland polyps tended to be multiple. A carcinoma was detected in one hyperplastic polyp (0. 9 %) and in two <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> (10. 5 %).

40|$|Obesity {{has been}} {{investigated}} as {{a risk factor for}} various malignancies, includ-ing colon cancer. A case-control study was conducted on patients in three colonoscopy practices in New York City to determine possible risk factors for colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps,</b> a known precursor lesion for most cases of colorectal cancer. Among 301 case subjects with incident <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> (174 men and 127 women) and 506 control subjects (223 men and 283 women), an increased risk was ob-served with increasing body mass index in women (odds ratio 2. 1, 95 % con...|$|R
40|$|This {{retrospective}} {{study shows that}} endoscopic polypectomy is the technique of choice to remove the majority of polyps; follow-up and pathologic examinations {{shed light on the}} carcinogenesis of colorectal lesions. From January 1990 to December 2001, 1302 <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> were removed, 1175 endoscopically, 127 with surgical procedures. The anatomical and morphologic conditions of the colon and some characteristics of the polyps represent limits to the feasibility and to the efficacy of polypectomy, and the most important variables for the correct management of the patients affected by colorectal <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Authors {{report a}} case of {{intestinal}} bleeding due to lipoma of the epatic flexure. Lipomas are the commonest mesenchymal benign tumors {{that can be found}} in the colon and are second as frequence only to the <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> They are most frequent in the right colon and shown an opposite distribution in comparison with adenocarcinomas and <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> When tumor size is greater than 3 cm, lipomas become symptomatic. Radiological and endoscopic investigations provide orientative elements for diagnosis. In lipomas less than 2 cm in diameter an endoscopic treatment is feasible...|$|R
