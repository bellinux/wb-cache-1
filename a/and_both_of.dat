5|$|According to biographer Vijay Singh, it was {{unheard of}} for Cariappa {{to use his}} power and status for {{personal}} purposes.

According to the rules, children were forbidden to attend the officers' mess. As chief Cariappa might have taken them to the mess but he did not.|$|E

5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable skin disease, was cured after taking a bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them {{were involved in the}} actual renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby making it difficult to identify the right king.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Japan's 10th Army was {{storming}} Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated {{directly in front of}} Zhonghua Gate on Nanking's southern side. The 10th Army's progress was slow and casualties were heavy as Yuhuatai was built like a fortress of interlocking pillboxes and trenches manned by three Chinese divisions, including the German-trained 88th Division, though the Chinese were also apt to counterattack and some Japanese units were forced to spend more time defending than attacking. Close to every single man that the 88th Division had deployed on Yuhuatai was killed in action, including three of its four regimental commanders <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> its brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese were made to suffer 2,240 casualties including 566 dead. Yuhuatai was finally overrun at noon on December 12.|$|E

5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, {{it would}} seem that cricket was a normal {{activity}} at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson. A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during {{the first quarter of the}} 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Edward was {{the oldest}} of six siblings, {{and some of his}} {{brothers}} had distinguished military careers as well, including Lieutenant Colonel William Burke Nicolls (1780–1844) of the British Army's 2nd West India Regiment, and Commander Jonathan Frederick Nicolls (1782–1845) of the Royal Navy. All five of Edward Nicolls' brothers <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his sons died in or as the result of public service. Nicolls was educated at a grammar school in Coleraine and at Royal Park Academy near Greenwich prior to entering the Marines on 24 March 1795. He was not yet 16 years old when he received his commission as a second lieutenant in His Majesty's Marine Forces, in 1795, and he was promoted to first lieutenant on 27 January 1796.|$|E
5|$|Fénix was {{commissioned}} under Captain John Carter Allen in February 1780 and renamed HMS Gibraltar on 23April. She joined George Darby's fleet in the English Channel until 29November, {{when she left}} for Samuel Hood's squadron in the West Indies under Captain Walter Stirling. In 1781, under Captain Charles Knatchbull, Gibraltar became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Francis Samuel Drake and {{was present at the}} Capture of St Eustatius in February. Following the outbreak of war between the Dutch Republic and Britain in December 1780, Rodney received orders from London to seize the island. A British expedition of 3,000 troops from St Lucia, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Vaughan, arrived off St Eustatius on 3February 1781. Rodney, in command of the naval forces, positioned his fleet so as to neutralise any shore batteries, but instead of disembarking the troops and launching an immediate assault, Rodney sent a message to Governor Johannes de Graaff suggesting that he surrender to avoid bloodshed. DeGraaff agreed to the proposal and capitulated. The only shots fired were from Gibraltar <b>and</b> , <b>both</b> <b>of</b> which, without orders, briefly engaged Mars, the only Dutch warship in the roadstead.|$|E

5|$|In 1787, Hamilton {{served as}} assemblyman from New York County in the New York State Legislature and {{was chosen as}} a {{delegate}} for the Constitutional Convention by his father-in-law Philip Schuyler. Even though Hamilton had {{been a leader in}} calling for a new Constitutional Convention, his direct influence at the Convention itself was quite limited. Governor George Clinton's faction in the New York legislature had chosen New York's other two delegates, John Lansing, Jr. and Robert Yates, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them opposed Hamilton's goal of a strong national government. Thus, whenever the other two members of the New York delegation were present, they decided New York's vote, to ensure that there were no major alterations to the Articles of Confederation.|$|E

The government of Dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. Martinique's main airport <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> St. Lucia's commercial airports closed when the last airplanes landed on the night of August 16 and the storm's outer rainbands began to sweep over the island.|$|E

Red Bull introduced minor improvements to their car's F-duct system <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> their drivers used a front wing specification which courted controversy at the preceding British Grand Prix. McLaren used a blown diffuser which was discarded after the Friday practice sessions at the previous Grand Prix and was changed for the German Grand Prix. The diffuser been moved outwards but had a longer inner section, the pipe was cut off at an angle, and the carbon materials for its side channel were changed. Sauber came to the circuit with their car carrying several aerodynamic upgrades which included a modified diffuser.|$|E

5|$|The {{other story}} about the balance between THSR {{construction}} and the environment is the protection plan of “300-year-old camphor tree and the temple”(保護金山面老樹及伯公廟) in the Hsinchu City for more than 10 years. The tree and the temple are located on the main route of the THSR, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them faced removal because of railway construction. The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there. In 1998, THSRC adjusted the line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with local government and people to protect the old tree and the temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, the Environment and the Resources Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the long-term growth {{and the health of}} the tree.|$|E
