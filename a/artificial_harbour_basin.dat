50|$|V.O.C Port is an <b>artificial</b> {{deep sea}} <b>harbour</b> formed with rubble mound type {{parallel}} breakwaters projecting into sea up to 4 km. The Length of North Breakwater is 4098.66 m, length of South Breakwater is 3873.37 m {{and the distance}} between breakwaters is 1275 m.

25|$|An early {{idea for}} {{temporary}} harbours was sketched by Winston Churchill in a 1917 memo to Lloyd George. This memo was for <b>artificial</b> <b>harbours</b> {{to be created}} off the German islands of Borkum and Sylt. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away. In 1940 the civil engineer Guy Maunsell wrote to the War Office with a proposal for an <b>artificial</b> <b>harbour,</b> but the idea was not at first adopted.|$|R

40|$|AbstractEstimation of {{littoral}} drift {{and direction}} of net drift are needed for design of harbour projects. Different methods are used to study shoreline changes in the coastal area. Among them, mathematical modelling is considered as an effective technique. The current study addresses this issue {{through the use of}} mathematical models viz. spectral wave model to derive nearshore wave climate, Boussinesq wave model for evolving the harbour layout to provide adequate wave tranquillity in the <b>harbour</b> <b>basin</b> and one line model for prediction of shoreline changes in the adjacent shoreline of the project. In the present study, the mathematical models were applied for design of a layout for fishing harbour, on the West Coast of India in Kerala State. Different alternatives of the harbour layout were tested in order to reduce siltation in the harbour and also to achieve the desired tranquillity in the <b>harbour</b> <b>basin.</b> In the first alternative, the southern breakwater was extended by 340 m. However it was observed that after two to three years, the shoreline will advance and the drift will start entering the <b>harbour</b> <b>basin.</b> Therefore, in the second alternative, the mouth of the harbour was further taken into deeper water to minimize the drift entering in the harbour. With this alternative the wave tranquility studies showed that the layout is adequate to provide desired tranquility in the <b>harbour</b> <b>basin</b> and the wave heights will remain within 0. 3 m almost round the year. Thus, mathematical modelling technique was used to evolve a harbour layout that satisfies the tranquillity criteria and also ensures minimum siltation in the <b>harbour</b> <b>basin...</b>|$|R

50|$|The new harbour {{built by}} the burgh lies {{to the south of}} the town and in 1818 {{consisted}} of a breastwork, an area of quay running parallel to the river with a rubble and wood frontage and a small rectangular basin of a similar construction. The harbour is of the simplest form with a quay and the addition of a basin that provided extra berths rather than protection from the elements.

For the construction of the <b>harbour</b> <b>basin</b> and the granaries forced labour was employed.|$|R

40|$|Surveys {{on water}} quality, {{including}} dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, water temperature and salinity were performed {{inside and outside}} the Piraeus <b>Harbour</b> <b>basin.</b> In the present paper spatial DO distribution and seasonal variation of the measured parameters are presented, as well as the dependence of DO upon wind characteristics. DO concentrations are found to increase with wind velocity. An empirical expression, based on the measured values is suggested for the correlation of the difference between DO concentrations outside and inside the <b>harbour</b> <b>basin,</b> with wind velocity. The effect of the rainfall inflow on water quality is also investigated. Reduction of DO is observed after storm events because of the poor quality of urban inflow. © 2005 Old City Publishing, Inc...|$|R
