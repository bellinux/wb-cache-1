5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Backlash was between Chris Benoit, Triple H, <b>and</b> <b>Shawn</b> Michaels over the World Heavyweight Championship. Chris Benoit won the title one month prior at WrestleMania XX when he {{defeated}} Michaels and then-champion Triple H in a Triple Threat match. Benoit won the match by forcing Triple H {{to submit to}} the Crippler Crossface. The following night on Raw, Benoit and Michaels defeated Evolution (Randy Orton, Ric Flair, and Batista) in a 3-on-2 Handicap tag team match.

Four days later on the March 25 episode of SmackDown!, SmackDown! General Manager Kurt Angle announced that Triple H had been traded back to Raw in exchange for The Dudley Boyz and Booker T.

5|$|Fish <b>and</b> <b>Shawn</b> McGrath {{collaborated on}} a puzzle game that became Fez. When McGrath left the project due to {{creative}} differences, Fish, the game's artist, pursued a platform game direction with Renaud Bédard, the game's programmer, {{who wrote the}} game's level editor and game engine from scratch. Levels were built in 3D by extruding surfaces with Photoshop-created textures. Bédard and Fish were joined by three different animators and other collaborators. The game was first announced in June 2007 and won an award at the 2008 Independent Games Festival and entered the public spotlight. Fish created a studio, Polytron Corporation, and was later aided by nearby developer-publisher Trapdoor when Polytron ran out of money. Fez won several more prerelease awards, including the 2012 Seumas McNally Grand Prize.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Austin Mast, Eric Jones <b>and</b> <b>Shawn</b> Havery {{published}} {{the results of}} their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia. They inferred a phylogeny very greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.spinulosa is placed in B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E

5|$|In January 2003, Triple H {{formed a}} stable known as Evolution with Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista. Triple H and Flair {{challenged}} Rob Van Dam and Kane for the World Tag Team Championship, but {{they lost the}} match. The group was pushed on Raw from 2003 to 2004 and the height of their dominance occurred after Armageddon, where every member of Evolution left the pay-per-view holding a title. Triple H held the World Heavyweight Championship for most of 2003, defending it at a match against Booker T at WrestleMania XIX in an angle with racist undertones. He lost the title after 280 days in September 2003 at Unforgiven to Bill Goldberg, in a match with the stipulation that had Goldberg lost, {{he would have to}} retire. After a failed attempt to win back the title from Goldberg in a rematch at the Survivor Series, he finally regained the championship against Goldberg in a triple threat match at Armageddon which also involved Kane. At the 2004 Royal Rumble, Triple H <b>and</b> <b>Shawn</b> Michaels fought in a Last Man Standing match to a double countout, so Triple H retained the title as a result. Triple H dropped the title to Chris Benoit at WrestleMania XX. Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown! brand on March 22 episode of Raw and failed to capture the WWE Championship from Eddie Guerrero. Triple H was drafted back to Raw without competing on SmackDown! and unsuccessfully tried to reclaim the World Heavyweight title from Chris Benoit in subsequent rematches, including a rematch from WrestleMania between Triple H, Benoit, <b>and</b> <b>Shawn</b> Michaels at Backlash, but came out unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In a dark match {{before the}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Adam Bomb pinned Kwang.

5|$|In {{the first}} main event of SummerSlam wrestlers from the Raw brand competed in an Elimination Chamber match, {{in which the}} ring is {{surrounded}} by a steel structure of chain and girders. The match was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, <b>and</b> <b>Shawn</b> Michaels. The buildup to the match began on July 22, 2003, when during the SummerSlam press conference, the authority figure Eric Bischoff, announced that Triple H would defend the championship against Goldberg in a standard wrestling match at the event. On August 4, 2003 during a television episode of Raw, Bischoff changed the stipulations of the match to No disqualification regulations. Later during the episode, another authority figure, Steve Austin, altered Bischoff's announcement, stating that the championship would be contested in an Elimination Chamber match, with Triple H defending his title against Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, <b>and</b> <b>Shawn</b> Michaels. Six days before SummerSlam, during an episode of Raw on August 18, 2003, the rivalry among the six competitors intensified during a promotional interview segment, in which each participant in the Elimination Chamber discussed the match and taunted the other wrestlers. During the show's main event, in which Orton wrestled Goldberg, Nash interfered in the match and attacked Goldberg. Michaels then came down to the ring, but {{as he was about to}} hit Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, Jericho ran into the ring and hit Michaels with a chair.|$|E
