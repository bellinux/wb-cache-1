25|$|According to {{an article}} in the 24 November 1923 issue of the Auckland Star, in 1919 an <b>additional</b> <b>report</b> had been {{published}} in an unspecified Glasgow newspaper which suggested that the crew had been sighted on shore in 1891, but that the passing ship had been unable to rescue them. This would seem to be taken in part from the 1891 report by the Canadian sealing schooner Maud S. According to the Auckland Star, the Glasgow story also repeated the first story about the ship being discovered in 1913 with a dead crew on board.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to aforementioned shortcoming in the tsunami warning system, JMA have started investigation in year 2011 and updated their system in 2013. In the updated system, for powerful earthquake with possibility {{to cause the}} JMA magnitude scale to saturate, no quantitative prediction will be released in the initial warning, and instead there will be words that describe the situation's emergency. It have been planned to install new teleseismometers with ability to measure larger earthquake to prevent the inability to calculate moment magnitude scale in timely manner. A simpler empirical method to integrate data from GPS tidal meter as well as undersea water pressure meter into tsunami warning have been deployed, {{and there are also}} plan to install more of these meters and develop further technology to utilize data observed from them. To prevent under-reporting tsunami height, early quantitative observation data that are smaller than expected amplitude will be overridden and public will instead get told the situation is under observation.An <b>additional</b> <b>report</b> on possibility of tsunami about 90 seconds after earthquakes will also be included into observation report in order to warn people before JMA magnitude can be calculated.|$|E
500|$|Prior to September 2005, {{comparative}} bullet-lead {{analysis was}} performed on bullets found at a scene that were too destroyed for striation comparison. The technique would attempt to determine the unique elemental breakdown of the bullet and compare it to seized bullets possessed by a suspect. Review of the method found that the breakdown of elements found in bullets could be significantly different enough to potentially allow for two bullets from separate sources to be correlated to each other. However, {{there is not enough}} differences to definitely match a bullet from a crime scene to one taken from a suspect's possession. An <b>additional</b> <b>report</b> in 2004 from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found that the testimony given regarding comparative bullet-lead analysis was overstated and potentially [...] "misleading under the federal rules of evidence". In 2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicated that they would no longer be performing this type of analysis.|$|E
