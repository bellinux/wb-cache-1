5000|$|In 2022, {{conditions}} in the United States get worse {{with the collapse of}} the financial system and an <b>Asian</b> bird <b>flu</b> epidemic that claims six million lives, forcing the Mexican government to quarantine the country by setting up immigration quotas as the <b>Asian</b> bird <b>flu</b> continues throughout the United States. By 2024, Korea's annexation has continued throughout Southeast Asia, including its emerging economic powers, giving the GKR an empire reminiscent of Imperial Japan. [...] Finally, in 2025, the Greater Korean Republic, now a major superpower, launched a supposed advanced GPS satellite that would be a signal of peace, but is actually a secret orbital weapon that detonated a high-altitude nuclear device over the U.S., creating an EMP blast that wipes out much of the nation's electrical infrastructure. In the ensuing chaos, the Korean People's Army (KPA) launches an instant amphibious invasion, starting the Korean-American War. They seize control of Hawaii and much of the U.S. Pacific Coast. Korean paratroopers are deployed over the Midwestern United States, and with the U.S. military severely crippled and scattered, launches a final offensive to take control of the remaining states. However, the Americans were able to counterattack, leaving the Eastern States free and effectively dividing the nation at the irradiated Mississippi River, with the Western States under GKR occupation, known as the [...] "New Korean Federation of Occupied America", a puppet state of the GKR.|$|R

25|$|In February 2004, avian {{influenza}} virus was detected in birds in Vietnam, increasing {{fears of the}} emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the {{avian influenza}} virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the Spanish Flu, or the lower mortality pandemics such as the <b>Asian</b> <b>Flu</b> and the Hong Kong Flu.|$|E

50|$|In {{the event}} of another pandemic, US {{military}} researchers have proposed reusing a treatment from the deadly pandemic of 1918 in order to blunt {{the effects of the}} flu. Some military doctors injected severely afflicted patients with blood or blood plasma from people who had recovered from the flu.Data collected during that time indicates that the blood-injection treatment reduced mortality rates by as much as 50 percent. Navy researchers have launched a test to see if the 1918 treatment will work against deadly <b>Asian</b> bird <b>flu.</b> Results thus far have been inconclusive. Human H5N1 plasma may be an effective, timely, and widely available treatment for the next flu pandemic. A new international study using modern data collection methods, would be a difficult, slow process. But many flu experts, citing the months-long wait for a vaccine for the next pandemic, are of the opinion that the 1918 method is something to consider.|$|R
40|$|Director of the WHO CC for {{epidemiology}} {{and prevention of}} cardiovascular and other chronic diseases Madam Chairperson, dear ladies and gentlemen, {{as director of the}} WHO collaborating centre for {{epidemiology and}} prevention of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases at the university of Münster I recently had the honour to deliver a welcome address to the audience of the annual German epidemiology congress in Münster. The main topic of the address was the so called swine flu pandemic. I criticised the hysterical announcements and reactions of ministries, scientific bodies and not least the media, sharply contrasting the mounting epidemiological evidence of a mild viral infection compared to previous influenza seasons. In the meantime a number of physicians, health scientists and others are questioning the decision of WHO to declare the H 1 N 1 pandemic. What are the facts? Neither WHO nor the National Pandemic Expert Committees nor the Governments have informed the general public that the H 1 N 1 virus is not a new virus but is known to us for decades. It has been carried to the US by soldiers coming from Vietnam as the so called <b>Asian</b> swine <b>flu</b> in the 1970 ies. In 1976, actually triggered by Legionnaires Disease in Philadelphia (a bacterial, not a viral disease), and initiated by President Gerald Ford, a vaccination campaign was started in the US and about 40 million US-citizens were vaccinated because the infectious disease specialists at the CDC were convinced that H 1 N 1 was similar to the virus that had caused the Spanish influenza in the fall of 1918 with millions of deaths 1. However, the H 1 N 1 vaccination campaign was stopped abruptly when it was realized that the virus produced only a mild disease without complications among only 500 infected and one death, while the vaccine produced a number of severe neurological side effects, namely Guillain-Barre-Syndrome. This story was reported again in the Washingto...|$|R
2500|$|Evolution {{of disease}} {{presents}} {{a major threat}} in modern times. [...] For example, the current [...] "swine flu" [...] or H1N1 virus is a new strain of an old form of flu, known for centuries as <b>Asian</b> <b>flu</b> based on its origin on that continent. [...] From 1918–1920, a post-World War I global influenza epidemic killed an estimated 50–100 million people, including half a million in the United States alone. [...] H1N1 is a virus that has evolved from and partially combined with portions of avian, swine, and human flu.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this success, the Miracles became the first Motown act to appear on Dick Clark's [...] "American Bandstand" [...] on December 27, 1960. The Miracles had modest success with their next few singles, {{including}} [...] "Ain't It Baby", [...] "Mighty Good Lovin'", [...] "Brokenhearted" [...] and [...] "Everybody's Gotta Pay Some Dues", as 1961 continued. During this early period, the group suffered some problems as Robinson caught <b>Asian</b> <b>Flu</b> and had to be bedded for a month, leaving wife Claudette Robinson to lead the Miracles on tour until he recovered. Claudette herself had her share of problems, having suffered her first miscarriage that occurred after a car accident and Pete Moore was drafted to serve in the United States Army. The group's next charted successes included [...] "What's So Good About Goodbye", and the string-laden [...] "I'll Try Something New".|$|E
