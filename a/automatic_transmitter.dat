2500|$|Although the {{intrusion}} {{was a minor}} annoyance to viewers, the Federal Communications Commission with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the jamming. MacDougall surrendered to the authorities and was served with a court subpoena after a tourist overheard him talking about the incident while on a pay phone off Interstate 75. Under an agreement with his attorney, he plea bargained and received a $5,000 fine, one year unsupervised probation, and his amateur radio license was suspended for one year. The jamming received much attention in American society, with one executive dubbing {{the intrusion}} an act of [...] "video terrorism". As {{a consequence of the}} Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion, the United States Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. [...] ), making satellite hacking a felony. The <b>Automatic</b> <b>Transmitter</b> Identification System was also developed in response to this incident.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of MacDougall's jamming, and ambiguity about the federal misdemeanor charge made against him under 47 U.S.C. § 301, the United States Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. [...] ) which made satellite hijacking a felony. The FCC subsequently implemented strict requirements that all radio and television transmitters must have an electronic name tag for tracking purposes. The <b>Automatic</b> <b>Transmitter</b> Identification System (ATIS) was developed {{in response to the}} Captain Midnight jamming incident. It allows satellite operators to quickly identify unauthorized uplink transmissions. In 2009, HBO and Elmer Musser were awarded a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for ATIS. Although HBO has not been targeted since the channel's signal power was increased to {{make it more difficult for}} hijackers to intrude, there have been multiple instances of uplink video piracy across the United States. One such incident happened in November 1987, when WGN-TV in Chicago had its transmission briefly interrupted by a man in a Max Headroom mask, and that same evening, the signal of PBS affiliate WTTW was overridden for one-and-a-half minutes, where the same person mooned the viewing audience and had his buttocks struck with a fly swatter. The jamming did not appear to affect HBO's pricing policies in the long-term.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Automatic</b> <b>Transmitter</b> Identification System (ATIS) is {{a marine}} VHF radio system used and {{mandated}} on navigable inland waterways in Europe for identifying the ship or vessel {{that made a}} radio transmission.

This contrasts to the Automatic identification system(AIS) used globally on ships that transmit continuously. A short post-transmission message is sent by the radio with the vessel identity {{and is in the}} form of an encoded call sign or Maritime Mobile Service Identity, starting with number [...] "9" [...] and the three country-specific maritime identification digits.|$|E

A crack in the antenna's mast was noted; the electrical condition of the channel 2 antenna is continuing to degrade and by July 2008, the VHF 2 signal was operating at 30% of licensed power.
