5|$|Following the uptake of Sanger sequencing, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (then {{known as}} The Sanger Centre) had begun {{cataloguing}} sequence reads along with quality {{information in a}} database called The Trace <b>Archive.</b> The Trace <b>Archive</b> grew substantially with the commercialisation of high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies by companies such as Roche and Illumina.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the EBI {{combined}} the Trace <b>Archive,</b> EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (now {{also known as}} EMBL-Bank) and a newly developed Sequence (or Short) Read <b>Archive</b> (SRA) {{to make up the}} ENA, aimed at providing a comprehensive nucleotide sequence <b>archive.</b> As a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, the ENA exchanges data submissions each day with both the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank.|$|E

5|$|The ENA {{operates}} {{an instance}} of the Sequence Read <b>Archive</b> (SRA), an archival repository of sequence reads and analyses which are intended for public release. Originally called the Short Read <b>Archive,</b> the name was changed in anticipation of future sequencing technologies being able to produce longer sequence reads. Currently, the <b>archive</b> accepts sequence reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer and ABI SOLiD {{as well as some}} corresponding analyses and alignments. The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is the fastest-growing repository in the ENA.|$|E

5|$|The museum's Photograph <b>Archive</b> {{preserves}} {{photographs by}} official, amateur and professional photographers. The collection includes the official British photographic {{record of the}} two world wars; the First World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Ernest Brooks and John Warwick Brooke. The <b>archive</b> also holds 150,000 British aerial photographs from the First World War, the largest collection of its kind. The Second World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Bill Brandt, Cecil Beaton and Bert Hardy. Like the Film <b>Archive,</b> the Photograph <b>Archive</b> is an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, and as such continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. In 2012 the museum reported {{the size of its}} photographic holdings as approximately 11 million images in 17,263 collections.|$|E

50|$|On {{the basis}} of the General Rules for <b>Archives</b> {{published}} in 1983, historical <b>archives</b> were being expanded at the provincial and county levels. Two of the most important <b>archives</b> were the First Historical <b>Archives</b> of China (FHAC), located in Beijing containing the <b>archives</b> of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the Second Historical <b>Archives</b> of China (SHAC), located in Nanjing containing the <b>archives</b> of the Kuomintang period. And the Central <b>Archives</b> (the State <b>Archives</b> Administration) contains the <b>archives</b> of the Communist Party and the People's Republic. A number of foreign scholars have been granted access to these <b>archives.</b> In 1987 public and research libraries still faced serious space, management, and service problems. Even with the special efforts being made to solve these problems, it was clear {{that they would not be}} quickly resolved.|$|R

5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single <b>archive.</b> They are scattered between the State <b>Archive</b> of the Russian Federation, the <b>archive</b> of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical <b>Archive.</b> Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E
5|$|Already by 1985, the Getty had {{acquired}} the complete <b>archive</b> of the American sculptor Malvina Hoffman. In 2011, it acquired Harald Szeemann’s substantial <b>archive,</b> consisting {{of more than}} 1,000 boxes of correspondence, research files, drawings, and ephemera, {{as well as some}} 28,000 books and 36,000 photographs. It also owns several art dealers' archives, including records for the Goupil & Cie and Boussod Valadon galleries, Knoedler Gallery, and the Duveen Brothers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Archives</b> Nationales {{are under}} the {{authority}} of the French <b>Archives</b> Administration (Service interministériel des <b>Archives</b> de France) in the Ministry of Culture. The <b>Archives</b> of France also manage the 100 departmental <b>archives</b> located in the préfectures of each of the 100 départements of France, as well as various other local <b>archives.</b> These departmental and local <b>archives</b> contain all the <b>archives</b> from the decentralized branches of the French state, as well as all the <b>archives</b> of the pre-French Revolution provincial and local institutions seized by the revolutionaries (parlements, chartered cities, abbeys, churches, etc.). Thus, in addition to the 252 mi of documents kept by the <b>Archives</b> Nationales, at least 1753 mi of documents are kept in the departmental and local <b>archives,</b> in particular the church records and notarial records used by genealogists.|$|R

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that due to the events of the French Revolution, the pre-French Revolution <b>archives</b> kept by the <b>Archives</b> Nationales are not just the <b>archives</b> of the central state, but also the many local <b>archives</b> of the Paris region, such as all the <b>archives</b> of the abbeys {{surrounding}} Paris (e.g. the Basilica of St Denis), the <b>archives</b> of the churches of Paris, and the <b>archives</b> of the medieval Paris city hall. Thus, the <b>Archives</b> Nationales serve as the <b>archives</b> of the French central state for records from 1790 onwards, but for records before 1790 they serve as both the <b>archives</b> of the central state and the local <b>archives</b> of Paris and its region. The <b>Archives</b> Nationales, however, do not keep the church records of Paris (baptisms, marriages and burials). These were entirely destroyed by fires set by extremists {{at the end of the}} Paris Commune in 1871.|$|R
5|$|Also, cinematographic {{improvements}} that modern viewers would find relatively minor were noted in their day. In the attic scenes, for instance, Hepworth's use of arc lights was celebrated {{for being an}} early use of harsh lighting conditions to create ambiance and indicate a dangerous setting. Prints have been saved both in the Library of Congress film <b>archive,</b> and the National Film and Television <b>Archive</b> of the British Film Institute.|$|E
