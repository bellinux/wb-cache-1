The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes), {{but at the end of}} the fourth century the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the Swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of Germanic tribes.|$|E

In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E
