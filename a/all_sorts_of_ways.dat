500|$|Kings and {{the most}} wealthy lords could afford to {{redesign}} castles to produce palace-fortresses. Edward III spent £51,000 on renovating Windsor Castle; this was over {{one and a half}} times Edward's typical annual income. In the words of Steven Brindle the result was a [...] "great and apparently architecturally unified palace... uniform in <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> as to roof line, window heights, cornice line, floor and ceiling heights", echoing older designs but without any real defensive value. The wealthy John of Gaunt redesigned the heart of Kenilworth Castle, like Windsor the work emphasised a unifying, rectangular design and the separation of ground floor service areas from the upper stories and a contrast of austere exteriors with lavish interiors, especially on the 1st floor of the inner bailey buildings. By the end of the 14th century a distinctive English perpendicular style had emerged.|$|E
500|$|Edward's new palace {{consisted}} of three courts along {{the north side of}} the Upper Ward, called Little Cloister, King's Cloister and the Kitchen Court. At the front of the palace lay the St George's Hall range, which combined a new hall and a new chapel. This range had two symmetrical gatehouses, the Spicerie Gatehouse and the Kitchen Gatehouse. The Spicerie Gatehouse was the main entrance into the palace, whilst the Kitchen Gatehouse simply led into the kitchen courtyard. The great hall had numerous large windows looking out across the ward. The range had an unusual, unified roof-line and, with a taller roof than the rest of the palace, would have been highly distinctive. The Rose Tower, designed for the king's private use, set off the west corner of the range. The result was a [...] "great and apparently architecturally unified palace... uniform in <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> as to roof line, window heights, cornice line, floor and ceiling heights". With the exception of the Hall, Chapel and the Great Chamber, the new interiors all shared a similar height and width. The defensive features, however, were primarily for show, possibly to provide a backdrop for jousting between the two-halves of the Order of the Garter.|$|E
2500|$|As {{soon as it}} is {{admitted}} that, in the real world, all economic goods can trade at prices above or below their real production-cost, {{it can no longer}} be true, that the only source of all profits is the exploitation of wage labor. The reason is, that profit income can arise simply from selling the same priced good for more than it was purchased for, resulting in a capital gain for the seller, where this capital gain can be completely unrelated (or quite disproportional) to any identifiable labor cost. Effectively, more labor can exchange for less labor, and vice versa, and in the real world, this happens – fortunately or unfortunately – all the time. That insight is the basis of the theory of unequal exchange. According to this theory, exploitation is not something that is limited only to [...] "the point of production" [...] of the revolutionary classical orthodox Marxists. Exploitation could occur in <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> including at the level of international trade. In turn, that means that profit rates can be influenced by the terms of market trade, quite independently of production (as long as everybody can make gains, then even if the gains are not equal, it may attract no attention; but when incomes fall, the problem becomes manifest). Profit rates may not fall, because products are made cheaply {{in one part of the}} world, and resold somewhere else for a much higher price. The financial gain involved in the resales is not made explicit by value-added statistics, except indirectly.|$|E

2500|$|Clarkson is a soprano, {{with a range}} {{spanning}} from E♭3 to G6. Clarkson can {{ascend to}} the whistle register as well as possessing the ability to sing complex melisma. Describing Clarkson's voice, Arion Berger of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "her high notes are sweet and pillowy, her growl is bone-shaking and sexy, and her mid-range is amazingly confident." [...] In reviewing a live performance of Clarkson's Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated she [...] "showed off a voice that moved in <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> without ever appearing to strain" [...] continuing [...] "Ms. Clarkson, who has a malleable voice and a boatload of vocal confidence, might be a soul siren in the making". However, in a separate review of Stronger Caramanica stated that Clarkson's voice is [...] "too huge, too violent" [...] for warmer and sweeter vocal stylings, stating [...] "she's {{on a par with}} Taylor Swift when it comes to vengeance, and she'll do it louder and with more brutality in comparison to her contemporary." [...] In a live review as part of her Stronger Tour, Sophie Sinclair of Hit The Floor claimed [...] "Kelly's strong and powerful voice was flawless throughout the night and some may even say she sounds better live than she does on her albums". Mark Deming from Phoenix New Times stated that [...] "in an era when pop music means over-singing a song into a bloody pulp, Clarkson has consistently displayed both charisma and a welcome sense of restraint, knowing how to sound passionate and heartfelt without forgetting where the melody and the root note is supposed to go." ...|$|E

5|$|In {{biological}} classification humans are animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J.

In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|R

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film's premiere, Trier {{published}} a [...] "director's statement", where {{he wrote that}} he had started to regret having made such a polished film, but that he hoped it would contain some flaws {{which would make it}} interesting.

[...] His scripts then focused on {{what it would be like}} for each character to live through an actual murder investigation and its aftermath.

5000|$|CinemaArt {{released}} {{the film in}} the Czech Republic on 6 March 2009. Peter Debruge compared the film to Toy Story in a reviews for Variety, and complimented the animation: [...] "despite their inflexible faces, Barta conceives <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> inventive <b>ways</b> to bring these inanimate objects to life. … Should a given shot prove too tricky to accomplish practically, Barta has no qualms about using digital compositing to blend multiple stop-motion plates. Though rudimentary, fire and water effects are especially effective." [...] About the film's commercial prospects, Debruge wrote: [...] "For all its charms, In the Attic feels vaguely sinister and may prove too intense for younger kids - {{a testament to the}} film's pacing and score, as well as how deeply auds emotionally connect with these occasionally macabre toy characters." [...] The film has been honored with awards including an Excellence Prize for animation at the 2010 Japan Media Arts Festival, those for best feature at the 2010 New York International Children's Film Festival and the 2011 Tehran International Animation Festival, in both winning over The Secret of Kells, and the Kecskemét City Award at the 7th Festival of European Animated Feature Films and TV Specials in 2011.|$|R
6000|$|There were Tories in {{the town}} who gave the enemy all the {{information}} they could gather; therefore much caution was necessary in making plans, lest these enemies should betray them.

She had been employed several times before in the same way, and had proved herself quick-witted, stout-hearted, and light-footed. Now, as she trotted along in her scarlet cloak and hood, she was wishing she could still further distinguish herself by some great act of heroism; for good Parson Emerson had patted her on the head and said, [...] "Well done, child!"

There is nowhere they can come in, there is nothing they can do. The scattered invisible marksmen with their supporting guns will shatter their masses, pick them off individually, cover their line of retreat and force them into wholesale surrenders. It will be more like herding sheep than actual fighting. Yet the bitterest and cruellest things will have to happen, thousands and thousands of poor boys will be smashed in <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> dreadful <b>ways</b> and given over to every conceivable form of avoidable hardship and painful disease, before the obvious fact that war is no longer a business for half-trained lads in uniform, led by parson-bred sixth-form boys and men of pleasure and old men, but an exhaustive demand upon very carefully-educated adults for the most strenuous best that is in them, will get its practical recognition.[43]...|$|R
