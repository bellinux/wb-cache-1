40|$|The {{state of}} the {{environmental}} laboratories involved in monitoring environmental pollution control in Nigeria has been studied in this research. The research was undertaken by visiting four analytical laboratories involved in environmental pollution control in Nigeria. The analytical laboratories visited are those of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Kaduna, Ashaka cement factory, regional laboratory of the Federal Ministry of Water Resources Gombe, and the National Reference laboratory Lagos. In these laboratories results were collected in the laboratories, interviews were carried out and <b>analytical</b> <b>instruments</b> available were documented. It was discovered that, in these laboratories many standard <b>analytical</b> <b>instruments</b> needed for quality environmental pollution control and monitoring are lacking. Comparison of <b>analytical</b> <b>instruments</b> found in these laboratories with those found in literature revealed that many needed <b>analytical</b> <b>instruments</b> are missing. It is the {{position of this work}} that the gap between the environmental <b>analytical</b> <b>instruments</b> found in literature and that found in the research laboratories is very large and calls for concern...|$|R
