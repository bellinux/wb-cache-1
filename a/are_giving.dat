5|$|The {{black vulture}} also {{occasionally}} feeds on livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures to approach it. The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures. Black vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|E

5|$|The game cuts to September 1978, as Reza and his pacifist friend Babak Azadi (Omid Abtahi) watch crowds {{chanting}} {{about the}} revolution from a rooftop, and Reza takes photographs. The two then walk the streets, and {{arrive at a}} protest where revolution leaders <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> speeches. Reza's cousin Ali Shirazi (Nicholas Guilak) arrives and, when the protest is interrupted by soldiers and the crowd begins to disperse, he tries to convince Reza to throw rocks at the soldiers. Babak opposes, and Reza is left {{to decide whether to}} act aggressively and throw rocks, or act passively and voice his concerns instead. When the soldiers start threatening the crowds by firing, Reza and Babak flee into an alley, shortly followed by Ali and an injured Abbas (Ray Haratian), one of the revolution leaders who was stabbed in the commotion. After briefly being tended to, Abbas is escorted away by Ali and Bibi Golestan (Mozhan Marn√≤).|$|E
5|$|Years later, {{six months}} after the Battle of New York, Stark's {{experiences}} during the alien invasion <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.|$|E

25|$|In July, 2011, GoDaddy {{introduced}} {{a policy of}} blocking DNS queries from some outside DNS servers, {{in order to prevent}} other DNS queries from being too slow. Among other things, this prevents some bots from visiting websites, forcing some search engines to exclude domains hosted with GoDaddy. This policy affects search engine ranking for various GoDaddy customers who have multiple domains with different registrars. GoDaddy has refused to comment on the policy or the perception that their servers cannot handle the load or they <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> preference to their platinum level customers. It has also interfered with projects that collect Internet statistics.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It {{is caused by the}} extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.|$|E
25|$|The cap also {{includes}} a provision to close a potential loophole that would provide incentives for teams to skirt the cap by signing an older player to a long-term deal that would not end until after the team expects the player to retire. Cap analyst Larry Coon outlined how this potential loophole would work:For example, suppose the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception is $9 million. With 5% raises, a three-year contract would total $28.35 million. But if they added a fourth year to the contract, the salary would total $38.7 million. If the player retires after three seasons and continues drawing his salary for the additional season, then he effectively will be paid $38.7 million for three years' work. In essence, they <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> the player a three-year contract with additional deferred compensation.|$|E

25|$|Due to faster tribal {{population}} growth in forest / tribal areas, naturally available forest resources (NTFP) in a sustainable manner are becoming inadequate for their basic livelihood. Many tribal <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> up their traditional livelihood and taking up farming and cattle rearing in the forest areas causing irreparable damage to forests. The erstwhile protectors of forests are slowly turning into the bane of forests and its wildlife. The government should devise schemes to avert this process and save the dwindling forest area and its flora and fauna. Tribal people have extraordinary understanding of forest flora and fauna which can be productively utilized.

25|$|The Attorney General is a non-cabinet {{minister}} {{who leads the}} Attorney General's Office. The rule that no Attorney General may be a cabinet minister is a political convention rather than a law, and {{for a short time}} the Attorney General did sit in cabinet, starting with Lord Birkenhead in 1915 and ending with Douglas Hogg in 1928. There is nothing that prohibits Attorneys-General from attending meetings of the cabinet, and on occasion they have been asked to attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude Attorneys General from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which they <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> legal advice. As a government minister, the Attorney General is directly answerable to Parliament.|$|E

Satellite networks have tracked the migration and territorial movements of caribou. Electronic tags <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> scientists a complete, accurate picture of migration patterns. Using radio transmitters to track one herd of caribou, scientists learned that the herd moves much more than previously thought and they learned that each year the herd returns to about the same place to give birth. Environment Canada uses Landsat satellite imagery, for example, to identify anthropogenic disturbance (human-caused disturbance) to the natural landscape.

Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources {{but also as a}} working platform. Technology has gotten so sophisticated that MT services and MT departments work closely with programmers and information systems (IS) staff to stream in voice and accomplish seamless data transfers through network interfaces.
