40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objectives}} {{of our study}} were to assess whether coronal reformations improve the diagnostic performance of MDCT in patients with acute flank pain and suspected urinary stone disease; and to determine if performing such reformations from 3 -mm-thick sections is sufficient {{or if it is}} necessary to perform reformations from thinner sections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 147 consecutive patients (72 women and 75 men; mean age +/- SD, 58 +/- 18. 1 years) with suspected urinary stone disease who underwent unenhanced MDCT. Scans were obtained with a 4 x 1 mm collimation and were reconstructed with a section thickness of 1. 25 and 3 mm. We compared the diagnostic yield of 3 -mm <b>axial</b> <b>sections</b> with that of coronal reformations reconstructed from 1. 25 - and 3 -mm <b>axial</b> <b>sections.</b> Imaging data were evaluated in random order by two radiologists. The significance of the difference between the <b>axial</b> <b>sections</b> and coronal multiplanar reformations (MPRs) was tested for the number, size, and location of uroliths and for the presence of alternative diagnoses. The time required for review by both observers was recorded. RESULTS: We found uroliths in 72 patients. There was no difference between 3 -mm <b>axial</b> <b>sections</b> and coronal reformations from 1. 25 -mm sections with regard to the number of detected stones (n = 264 for both protocols), whereas coronal reformations from 3 -mm sections revealed significantly fewer calcifications (n = 255, p = 0. 016). Coronal reformations did not improve the localization of calcifications. Review time, however, was significantly shorter for coronal reformations than for <b>axial</b> <b>sections</b> (p = 0. 001); however, coronal reformations were less sensitive than <b>axial</b> <b>sections</b> for the detection of additional findings suggestive of alternative diagnoses in 16 (30 %) of 53 patients. CONCLUSION: Coronal reformations from MDCT do not improve urinary stone detection but may reduce evaluation time; however, there is the danger of missing additional findings. Coronal reformations reconstructed from thick (i. e., 3 - 5 mm) <b>axial</b> <b>sections</b> may result in reduced detection of small stones and should therefore be avoide...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} composite pressurizable structures which are overwound with fibres or are braided.

30|$|The {{radiological}} {{material was}} then analyzed with AgfaWeb 1000 v 5.1. 2., and representative <b>axial</b> <b>sections</b> of the lateral ventricles were obtained {{at the level}} of maximal lateral ventricle width. This approach was chosen as a substantial number of hydrocephalus patients are often initially seen at facilities where only axial plane CT imaging is available. CT reconstructions of the sagittal and coronal planes are available at various radiology departments, but the often higher quality <b>axial</b> <b>sections</b> serve as the primary imaging material in clinical practice. The imaging results were categorized in groups purely based on their visual morphologic appearance, taking into consideration factors such as the size, shape, and symmetry of the AP and LR axes of the lateral ventricles. The EI was calculated for all patients. Although debated Moore et al. (2012); Ambarki et al. (2010); Pakkenberg et al. (1989); Penn et al. (1978), EI {{is still one of the}} most used quantitative measures among clinicians and therefore supported our choice of <b>axial</b> <b>sections.</b> It is important to remember that it can be a biased estimator for ventricular volume (VV) as its ordinary interpretation assumes that all ventricular systems share the same shape. Assessment of VV was not possible based on limitations in a majority of the imaging material.|$|R
