5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, <b>Aurora</b> <b>Australis,</b> which were sewn and bound using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E

5000|$|September 1, 1859: English astronomers Richard Carrington and Richard Hodgson {{observed}} solar flares for {{the first}} time in recorded history, working independently and in ignorance of each other. We now know that one of the resulting coronal clouds was the largest and most powerful ever produced. The resulting electric storm was so powerful that the <b>Aurora</b> Borealis and <b>Australis</b> could both be seen far from the poles, extending to near the equator. Telegraph equipment users reported so much electric energy that their equipment delivered an electrical shock when touched as current flowed through the person inadvertently acting as a ground. Even after the devices were disconnected from their batteries, because telegraphs were simple switches to make or break the circuit between stations, that is, they contained no electronic components, like micro-circuitry to be destroyed, they could still be used to send messages, thanks to the electric current induced in the wires by the storm.|$|R
2500|$|A Birkeland {{current is}} a set of {{currents}} that flow along geomagnetic field lines connecting the Earth’s magnetosphere to the Earth's high latitude ionosphere. In the Earth’s magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field and by bulk motions of plasma through the magnetosphere (convection indirectly driven by the interplanetary environment). The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in the magnetosphere (e.g. during substorms). [...] Small scale variations in the upward current sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons which, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the <b>Auroras</b> Borealis and <b>Australis.</b> In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland currents close through the region of the auroral electrojet, which flows perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere. [...] The Birkeland currents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets. [...] One pair extends from noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector. [...] The other pair extends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector. [...] The sheet on the high latitude side of the auroral zone {{is referred to as the}} Region 1 current sheet and the sheet on the low latitude side is referred to as the Region 2 current sheet.|$|R

25|$|In {{northern}} latitudes, {{the effect}} {{is known as the}} Aurora Borealis or the Northern Lights. The former term was coined by Galileo in 1619, from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north wind. The southern counterpart, the <b>Aurora</b> <b>Australis</b> or the Southern Lights, has features that are almost identical to the Aurora Borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone. The <b>Aurora</b> <b>Australis</b> is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia.|$|E
25|$|An aurora (plural: auroras), {{sometimes}} referred to as polar lights, northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (<b>aurora</b> <b>australis),</b> is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) regions.|$|E
25|$|Rakiura is {{the more}} {{commonly}} known and used Māori name. It is usually translated as Glowing Skies, possibly {{a reference to the}} sunsets for which it is famous or for the <b>aurora</b> <b>australis,</b> the southern lights that are a phenomenon of southern latitudes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the traditions}} of Aboriginal Australians, the <b>Aurora</b> <b>Australis</b> is {{commonly}} associated with fire. For example, the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria called auroras puae buae ('ashes'), while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world. The Dieri people of South Australia say that an auroral display is kootchee, an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia refer to auroras seen over Kangaroo Island as the campfires of spirits in the 'Land of the Dead'. Aboriginal people in southwest Queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the Oola Pikka, ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.|$|E

500|$|The <b>aurora</b> <b>australis,</b> {{commonly}} known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full solar winds that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is diamond dust, a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation.

The Black Watch is {{the oldest of the}} highland regiments. The 1958 <b>Aurora</b> <b>Australis</b> (the school yearbook) explained the tartan's origin: [...] "This tartan was specially designed for the regiment to prevent the jealousy which would have been aroused, if any existing clan tartan had been used." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{following}} winter Joyce, with Wild's help, printed {{copies of the}} expedition book <b>Aurora</b> <b>Australis,</b> edited by Shackleton. About 25 or 30 copies of the book were printed, sewn and bound. Otherwise Joyce was busy preparing equipment and stores for the next season's journey to the Pole in which, in view of his experience, he fully expected to be included. However, various mishaps had {{reduced the number of}} ponies to four, so Shackleton cut the southern party to that number. One of those dropped was Joyce, on advice from expedition doctor Eric Marshall, who noted that Joyce had a liver problem and the early stages of heart disease. Frank Wild, who along with Marshall and Jameson Adams was selected for the southern journey, wrote in his diary after the party's bid to reach the Pole had fallen short: [...] "If we only had Joyce and Marston here instead of these two useless grub-scoffing beggars" [...] – (Marshall and Adams)– [...] "we would have done it easily." [...] Joyce showed no particular resentment at his exclusion; he assisted the preparatory work and accompanied the polar party on the southward march for the first seven days. In {{the following}} months he took charge of enhancing the depots, to ensure adequate supplies for the returning southern party. He deposited a special cache of luxuries at Minna Bluff, together with life-saving food and fuel, earning Wild's spontaneous praise when the cache was discovered.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2011, Tobruk was at Garden Island Naval Dockyard {{for heavy}} repairs to the {{propeller}} shaft. As a result, {{she was not}} available to participate in Operation Yasi Assist following Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi and, due to both ships of the Kanimbla class being out of service with mechanical problems, the Navy {{did not have an}} amphibious transport capacity at the time. Minister for Defence Stephen Smith stated afterwards that he was misinformed about when Tobruk would be ready to put to sea if required. Temporary repairs were completed by 7 March, and the ship was returned to [...] "48-hours deployment notice" [...] status, although more permanent repairs will be required in the future. Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, Tobruk and Sydney were placed on alert to transport supplies and Australian Army engineers to Japan if this was requested by the Japanese Government. In May 2011, the ship began a two-month-long maintenance period in Sydney. To provide an amphibious capability during this refit, the civilian icebreaker <b>Aurora</b> <b>Australis</b> was chartered from May until August. Although Tobruk was to be active during late August and early September, she would then return to dockyard hands for further maintenance during September and October in preparation for the 2011–12 tropical cyclone season. The Australian Customs vessel Ocean Protector was used for humanitarian and disaster relief operations during Tobruk docking.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} appearances are {{as noted}} in my journal at the time. They so entirely resembled auroral beams, that I had no hesitation in pronouncing {{them at the time}} to be such. This opinion has, however, been dissented from by some meteorologists, who consider that certain facts connected with the geographical distribution of auroras (if I may use the term), are opposed to it. I am well aware of the force of these arguments, which I shall not attempt to controvert; but for the information of those who may be interested in the matter, I may remark, that I am very familiar with the Aurora borealis in the northern temperate zone, and during the Antarctic expedition was in the habit of recording in the log-book the appearance presented by the <b>Aurora</b> <b>australis.</b> The late Mr. Williams, Mr. Haddon, and Mr. Theobald, who were also witnesses of the appearances on this occasion, considered it a brilliant display of the aurora.|$|E
