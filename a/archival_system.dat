25|$|S. Lyman Tyler was {{appointed}} library director in 1954 {{and from the}} beginning of his administration was particularly interested in establishing a university archival program. Tyler {{was a member of the}} Society of American Archivists (SAA), and looked to the organization for guidance on how to establish a university archive. As early as the year he {{was appointed}} library director, Tyler was having informal conversations with university administrators about the importance of establishing a university <b>archival</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 26 March 1956, BYU President Ernest L. Wilkinson {{sent out}} a {{university}} directive that stated, [...] "The director of libraries is also designated historian and archivist for the Unified Church School System." [...] Effectively, this directive authorized the library director as an archivist as well, putting Tyler in an administrative position to create an <b>archival</b> <b>system</b> at BYU. [...] Later that year in August, Tyler appointed [...] Ralph Hansen to establish an archive at BYU. He began his efforts in September, housing the first documents in the attic of the Karl G. Maeser Building. This established the first archives at a Utah institution of higher learning.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of Archives Ready To Archival Information Packages (AIP) Transmission a PREMIS Based Project (ARTAT). Following the project approach, the starting phase consisted of prototyping a layer conveying preservation metadata, which can be encoded from the existing <b>archival</b> <b>systems,</b> and exchanged with other repositories. This layer called Preservation Metadata Layer (PML) uses PREMIS semantics as the common language to overcome <b>archival</b> <b>systems</b> differences, and to transmit out of its original context, relevant preservation information about content objects comprising an AIP. Since a repository, following the OAIS reference model, usually provides resources with metadata container objects, the experiment performed an analysis on commonly used container formats, in order to enable the traceability of semantics from a local to extra-local level, and the technological understandability of alien AIPs. The analysis has allowed {{the definition of a}} PML data model, laying the production of prototypes. The adoption of common semantics, like PREMIS, supports the opportunity of preserving correctly alien AIPs, coming from different technological environments, and hopefully enables the overcoming of obstacles to the interoperability among diverse <b>archival</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{framework}} {{for the development of}} an <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems</b> are proposed. IT community and long-term digital preservation research has not addressed the development of digital archival tools. It community addresses Archives and digital archiving almost as a storage place aimed for backup services. Long-term digital preservation research has put efforts in metadata research, and in the use of different preservation techniques in order to preserve digitally stored information. <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems</b> is and its development is a natural part of the field of Long-term Digital Preservation. <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems</b> are aimed to receive maintain, support digital preservation issues and give access to digitally stored information. This digitally stored information consists in different kind of documents or records physically manifested in computer files, databases, etc. <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems</b> are a special kind of Information Systems. As every specialized kind of Information <b>System,</b> <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems</b> development must be preceded by a specialized way of thinking. This thesis proposes a specialized way of thinking, a framework, for the development of <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems.</b> The proposed framework is based on The Records Continuum Model and The OAIS Reference Model as major fundaments. The framework consists on six levels of substitutionality. The lowest level, the software, is prone to high substitutionality. The highest levels are constituted by The OAIS Reference Model and The Records Continuum as the highest. The framework is a theoretical approach to <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems</b> Development and explained in terms of epistemological and ontological for it. Some important epistemological and ontological principles for <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems</b> are: Dealing with <b>Archival</b> Information <b>System</b> is dealing with making digital recorded information accessible. Records are logical rather than physical entities. Records have continuing value by means of information exchangeability. Forward Compatibility is achieved by means of open attitude and open standards. Accessibility and long-term preservation is stretching the longevity of records across time-space. This framework had been tested theoretically based on the expertise from Information Systems developers working in archival organizations. This evaluation shows strengths and weaknesses in the framework and the need of further development of it, and calls for putting forward efforts in deeper research of the framework, <b>Archival</b> Information <b>Systems</b> and long-term digital preservation issues.

40|$|In recent years, {{a variety}} of digital {{repository}} and <b>archival</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed and adopted. All of these systems aim at hosting {{a variety of}} compound digital assets and at providing tools for storing, managing and accessing those assets. This paper {{will focus on the}} definition of common and standardized access interfaces that could be deployed across such diverse digital respository and <b>archival</b> <b>systems.</b> The proposed interfaces are based on the two formal specifications that have recently emerged from the Digital Library community: The Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and the NISO OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive Services (OpenURL Standard). As will be described, the former allows for the retrieval of batches of XML-based representations of digital assets, while the latter facilitates the retrieval of disseminations of a specific digital asset or of one or more of its constituents. The core properties of the proposed interfaces are explained in terms of the Reference Model for an Open <b>Archival</b> Information <b>System</b> (OAIS) ...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : PLM for Sustainability, Traceability and PerformanceInternational audienceLong-term {{preservation}} of product data is imperative for many organizations. A product data archive {{should be designed}} to ensure information accessibility and understanding over time. Approaches such as the Open <b>Archival</b> Information <b>System</b> (OAIS) Reference Model and the Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories (ACTDR) {{provide a framework for}} conceptually describing and evaluating archives. These approaches are generic and do not focus on particular contexts or content types. Enterprise architecture provides a way to describe systems in their potentially complex environments. This paper proposes a holistic approach to formally describe the architecture and the environment of <b>archival</b> <b>systems.</b> This approach relies on the formal representation of the preservation terminology, including OAIS concepts, using the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF). The approach covers the various interactions of other business functions with the archive, and the information models necessary to ensure preservation and accessibility. This approach is a step toward a reference architecture for the formal description of <b>archival</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

50|$|For {{real-time}} journaling, {{the journal}} message is sent for further processing {{at the same}} time the actual electronic message is being sent. For periodic journaling, the journal message is stored in a secure, local storage area before being archived at the enterprise level on a periodic basis, typically after business hours. The processing of journal messages after their creation also varies. A journal message may be forwarded in real-time directly to an archival and storage system, where any storage system processing may then take over. Alternatively, a journal message may be forwarded in real-time to a journaling mailbox, and then retrieved from the journaling mailbox with periodic extractions to the <b>archival</b> <b>system,</b> where any <b>archival</b> <b>system</b> processing would then take over.|$|E
