25|$|Even {{with the}} UK's non-frustration {{principle}} directors always {{still have the}} option to persuade their shareholders through informed and reasoned argument that the share price offer is too low, or that the bidder may have ulterior motives that <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the company's employees, or for its ethical image. Under common law and the Takeover Code, directors must give out information to shareholders relevant to the bid, but not merely recommend the highest offer. The overriding common law rule, however, is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, which precludes using management powers for the purpose of frustrating takeovers. In Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd the director, purportedly concerned that a takeover bidder would make many workers redundant, issued a block of company shares to a trust, thus ensuring the bidder would remain outvoted. Buckley J held the power to issue shares creates fiduciary duty to only do so for the purpose of raising capital. Directors cannot plead they acted in good faith if a court determines their interests may possibly conflict. The result is that even though directors may wish to protect employees and stakeholders from ominous bidders, the law responds in other ways. UK workers have a minimal measure of job security, with very limited rights to be consulted, and no formal rights outside collective bargaining to participate in elections for the board or codetermine dismissal issues in works councils. Employees do have rights before dismissal or redundancies to reasonable notice, dismissal only for a fair reason, and a redundancy payment, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Moreover, any changes to workers terms and conditions, or redundancies, following a restructuring through an asset (as opposed to share) sale triggers protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 meaning good economic, technical or organisational reasons must be given.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to filing lawsuits, Thompson has pushed for measures against similar {{games in a}} variety of public settings. He wrote a joint article in the Christian Science Monitor with Eugene F. Provenzo, a University of Miami professor who studies the effects of video games on children. Originally brought together to provide opposing viewpoints on 60 Minutes {{in the aftermath of the}} Columbine High School massacre, they said they had become friends and were collaborating on a book. They described themselves as having [...] "a shared belief that first-person shooter video games <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> our children, teaching them to act aggressively and providing them with efficient killing skills and romanticized and trivialized scenarios for killing in the real world".|$|E

Bollenberg listed his favorite track as [...] "Hello, Helicopter!": [...] "it once again gets so very close to authentic Porcupine Tree with Portnoy introducing some tribal rhythms that go ever so well {{with the rest of}} the material. I simply melt once that superb sound of the Fender Rhodes enters, taking turns with synthesizer tweaks." [...] Gordon described the instrumental parts of the album as [...] "powerful and purposeful: an integral part of each composition rather than an excuse to merely 'jam.'" [...] Sander praised the tracks [...] "The New Math" [...] and [...] "Dirt from a Holy Place", but criticized the more experimental [...] "Horseshoes and B-52s": [...] "to me it sometimes sounds like some random cutting and pasting was done on this track, leaving out a couple of seconds here and there." [...] He criticized the track's video as [...] "nearly unbearable to watch. If some video games <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> people with epilepsy, this video is going to instantly kill them." ...|$|E

40|$|Consider {{the view}} that coming into {{existence}} <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> us. Can we hold this and yet deny that ceasing to exist {{would be good for}} us? I argue that we can. First, many animals have lives such that they would be better off not existing. Second, if persons and babies are distinct things then {{the same is true of}} babies. Third, even if persons and babies are not distinct things – rather they are phases that human beings go through – still it <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> babies that they come into existence. So it <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> us to come into existence. But most of us now enjoy worthwhile lives. So it would <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> us, now, to cease to exist...|$|R

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conditions}} in the theatre, Kemp explained that the soldiers in Afghanistan were experiencing more enemy fire in six months than most soldiers have faced in 25 years in intolerable conditions and stifling heat Soldiers were under [...] "a constant threat of snipers, RPG attacks and land mines" [...] inducing a distinct fear of IEDs or misplaced aircraft strikes.

2500|$|Percival was {{ultimately}} {{responsible for the}} men who served under him, and with other officers – notably Major-General David Murray-Lyon, commander of the Indian 11th Infantry Division – he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or {{the north shore of}} Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier Ivan Simson, with the comment [...] "Defences <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> morale – for both troops and civilians". In doing so, Percival threw away the potential advantages he could have derived from the 6,000 engineers under his command and perhaps missed his best chance to blunt the danger posed by the Japanese tanks.|$|E
