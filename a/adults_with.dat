5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} <b>adults,</b> <b>with</b> lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E
5|$|Low Fell compares very favourably {{with the}} wider Gateshead area {{in respect of}} <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> {{educational}} qualifications.

5|$|Many writers {{compare their}} {{perceptions}} of To Kill a Mockingbird as <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> when they first read it as children.

5|$|Most young {{octopuses}} hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending on the}} species and water temperature. They feed on copepods, arthropod larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling {{on the ocean floor}} and developing directly into <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae. Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea octopuses – do not have a paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E

5|$|Studies suggest {{antiparasitic}} treatment {{leads to}} parasitological cure {{in more than}} 90% of infants but only about 60–85% of adults treated {{in the first year}} of acute phase Chagas disease.
