5|$|A {{few other}} {{lines have been}} tried, with the outcome varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E
