2500|$|Noted logician and philosopher Arthur Prior (originator of tense logic) {{has also}} drawn a {{distinction}} between what he calls A-facts and B-facts. The latter are facts about tenseless relations, such {{as the fact that}} the year 2025 is 25 years later than the year 2000. The former are tensed facts, such as the Jurassic age being in the past, or the end of the universe being in the future. Prior asks the reader to imagine having a headache, and after the headache subsides, saying [...] "thank goodness that's over." [...] Prior argues that the B-theory cannot make sense of this sentence. It seems bizarre to be thankful that a headache is earlier than one's utterance, <b>anymore</b> <b>than</b> being thankful that the headache is later than one's utterance. Indeed, most people who say [...] "thank goodness that's over" [...] are not even thinking of their own utterance. Therefore, when people say [...] "thank goodness that's over," [...] they are thankful for an A-fact, and not a B-fact. Yet, A-facts are only possible on the A-theory of time.|$|E

Critics of Transactional Reader Response theory claim {{that there is a}} relationship between text and the reader. I discuss how Transactional Reader Response theory can be applied to Maxine Hong Kingston's works. Transactional Reader Response theory allows the reader to create a personal connection with a text. In reading I Love a Broad Margin To My Life a reader will have to create meaning with the poetic text. Chapter Two is about how Kingston has written her first narrative of the Fa Mu Lan story in The Woman Warrior: A Girlhood Among Ghosts. Critics of The Woman Warrior only wrote about how the story wasn't Chinese <b>anymore</b> rather <b>than</b> how meaning is created. In I Love a Broad Margin To My Life, Kingston changed the story of Fa Mu Lan, and now it represents a more believable narrative that is related to American war stories today. The final chapter discusses Kingston's poetry and how it creates for the reader an opportunity to relate to the text in a personal way and create a response. This chapter also discusses how Kingston has transformed from a prose writer to a poet and how the transformation has freed her to create stories. This book of poetry has inspired me to respond to the narrative to try to understand and interpret the way I felt about the story of Fa Mu Lan. I understand mother and child relationships in a unique way because I was adopted as a young child. Kingston carried over the Fa Mu Lan story into a new generation in a simple way for her readers to make connections to the text through their own experiences...|$|R

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system has a unique capability for estimating accurately forest canopy height, which has a direct relationship and can provide better understood to the aboveground carbon storage. To test the capacity of the large-footprint LiDAR for estimating canopy height in the montane cool temperate forest, the full waveform data of the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) was used to extract forest canopy height in Wangqing of China. In this study, the maximum forest canopy height was regressed as a function of waveform extent and the elevation change in terms of terrain slope ranges. Final regression model for slope range of 0 to < 5 ° explained 81 % variance of maximum canopy height. With the increasing of slope ranges, the model accuracies significantly declined. The regression model could explain 61 % and 47 % of variance at the plots of which the terrain slope within 0 to < 10 ° and 0 to < 15 ° respectively.

The study indicated the possibility of methodological pr blems (both conceptually and operationally), but also suggested that “research that has relied on subjective measures for both independent variables [...] . and dependent variables, such as system usage [...] . may not be uncovering true, significant effect, but mere artifacts ” (Straub et. al., 1995, p. 1336). Building upon the Straub et al. study, this paper examines these apparent discrepancies by 1) re-examining their study and 2) providing results from a new study using computer recorded measures of usage. In attempting to reconcile the discrepancies, potential misinterpretation due to methodological problems may be part of the reason. More importantly, this paper addresses the question of what constitutes “subjective ” versus “objective ” IT usage. By considering these issues in more detail, we suggest an alternative interpretation, where computer recorded measures of usage are not necessarily <b>anymore</b> “objective ” <b>than</b> self-reported usage.

6000|$|From {{these facts}} we may gather {{generally}} that monotony is, {{and ought to}} be, in itself painful to us, just as darkness is; that an architecture which is altogether monotonous is a dark or dead architecture; and of those who love it, it may be truly said, [...] "they love darkness rather than light." [...] But monotony in certain measure, used {{in order to give}} value to change, and above all, that transparent monotony, which, like the shadows of a great painter, suffers all manner of dimly suggested form to be seen through the body of it, is an essential in architectural as in all other composition; and the endurance of monotony has about the same place in a healthy mind that the endurance of darkness has: that is to say, as a strong intellect will have pleasure in the solemnities of storm and twilight, and in the broken and mysterious lights that gleam among them, rather than in mere brilliancy and glare, while a frivolous mind will dread the shadow and the storm; and as a great man will be ready to endure much darkness of fortune in order to reach greater eminence of power or felicity, while an inferior man will not pay the price; exactly in like manner a great mind will accept, or even delight in, monotony which would be wearisome to an inferior intellect, because it has more patience and power of expectation, and is ready to pay the full price for the great future pleasure of change. But in all cases it is not that the noble nature loves monotony, <b>anymore</b> <b>than</b> it loves darkness or pain. But it can bear with it, and receives a high pleasure in the endurance or patience, a pleasure necessary to the well-being of this world; while those who will not submit to the temporary sameness, but rush from one change to another, gradually dull the edge of change itself, and bring a shadow and weariness over the whole world from which there is no more escape.|$|E

What they call new ideas are very old ideas in the wrong place.

There is no brain-work in the thing at all; no root query of what sex is, of whether it alters this or that, and why, <b>anymore</b> <b>than</b> there is any imaginative grip of the humor and heart of the populace in the popular education.

6000|$|For example, in {{the spring}} of 1915 there was an appalling {{slaughter}} of our young soldiers at Neuve Chapelle and at the Gallipoli landing. I will not {{go so far as to}} say that our civilians were delighted to have such exciting news to read at breakfast. But I cannot pretend that I noticed either in the papers, or in general intercourse, any feeling beyond the usual one that the cinema show at the front was going splendidly, and that our boys were the bravest of the brave. Suddenly there came the news that an Atlantic liner, the Lusitania, had been torpedoed, and that several well-known first-class passengers, including a famous theatrical manager and the author of a popular farce, had been drowned, among others. The others included Sir Hugh Lane; but as he had only laid the country under great obligations in the sphere of the fine arts, no great stress was laid on that loss. Immediately an amazing frenzy swept through the country. Men who up to that time had kept their heads now lost them utterly. [...] "Killing saloon passengers! What next?" [...] was the essence of the whole agitation; but it is far too trivial a phrase to convey the faintest notion of the rage which possessed us. To me, with my mind full of the hideous cost of Neuve Chapelle, Ypres, and the Gallipoli landing, the fuss about the Lusitania seemed almost a heartless impertinence, though I was well acquainted personally with the three best-known victims, and understood, better perhaps than most people, the misfortune of the death of Lane. I even found a grim satisfaction, very intelligible to all soldiers, in the fact that the civilians who found the war such splendid British sport should get a sharp taste of what it was to the actual combatants. I expressed my impatience very freely, and found that my very straightforward and natural feeling in the matter was received as a monstrous and heartless paradox.

6000|$|Lastly, {{there is}} the admirable study of Toots, who may be {{considered}} as being {{in some ways the}} masterpiece of Dickens. Nowhere else did Dickens express with such astonishing insight and truth his main contention, which is that to be good and idiotic is not a poor fate, but, on the contrary, an experience of primeval innocence, which wonders at all things. Dickens did not know, <b>anymore</b> <b>than</b> any great man ever knows, what was the particular thing that he had to preach. He did not know it; he only preached it. But the particular thing that he had to preach was this: That humility is the only possible basis of enjoyment; that if one has no other way of being humble except being poor, then it is better to be poor, and to enjoy; that if one has no other way of being humble except being imbecile, then it is better to be imbecile, and to enjoy. That is the deep unconscious truth in the character of Toots--that all his externals are flashy and false; all his internals unconscious, obscure, and true. He wears loud clothes, and he is silent inside them. His shirts and waistcoats are covered with bright spots of pink and purple, while his soul is always covered with the sacred shame. He always gets all the outside things of life wrong, and all the inside things right. He always admires the right Christian people, and gives them the wrong Christian names. Dimly connecting Captain Cuttle with the shop of Mr. Solomon Gills, he always addresses the astonished mariner as [...] "Captain Gills." [...] He turns Mr. Walter Gay, by a most improving transformation, into [...] "Lieutenant Walters." [...] But he always knows which people upon his own principles to admire. He forgets who they are, but he remembers what they are. With the clear eyes of humility he perceives the whole world as it is. He respects the Game Chicken for being strong, as even the Game Chicken ought to be respected for being strong. He respects Florence for being good, as even Florence ought to be respected for being good. And he has no doubt about which he admires most; he prefers goodness to strength, as do all masculine men. It is through the eyes of such characters as Toots that Dickens really sees the whole of his tales. For even if one calls him a half-wit, it still makes a difference that he keeps the right half of his wits. When we think of the unclean and craven spirit in which Toots might be treated in a psychological novel of to-day; how he might walk with a mooncalf face, and a brain of bestial darkness, the soul rises in real homage to Dickens for showing how much simple gratitude and happiness can remain in the lopped roots of the most simplified intelligence. If scientists must treat a man as a dog, it need not be always as a mad dog. They might grant him, like Toots, a little of the dog's loyalty and the dog's reward.|$|E

Sir, I have stood at the door and heard her whipped, when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart, and I couldn't do anything to help her; and she was whipped, sir, for wanting to live a decent Christian life, such as your laws give no slave girl a right to live; and at last I saw her chained with a trader's gang, to be sent to market in Orleans,--sent there for nothing else but that,--and that's the last I know of her. Well, I grew up,--long years and years,--no father, no mother, no sister, not a living soul that cared for me more than a dog; nothing but whipping, scolding, starving. Why, sir, I've been so hungry that I have been glad to take the bones they threw to their dogs; and yet, when I was a little fellow, and laid awake whole nights and cried, it wasn't the hunger, it wasn't the whipping, I cried for. No, sir, it was for my mother and my sisters,--it was because I hadn't a friend to love me on earth. I never knew what peace or comfort was.

But if any man tries to stop me, let him take care, for I am desperate. I'll fight for my liberty to the last breath I breathe.
