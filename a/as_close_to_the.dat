Classical objects possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Though the inclinations of scattered objects are similar to the more extreme KBOs, very few scattered objects have orbits <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ecliptic as much of the KBO population.|$|E

5|$|Beecham {{began making}} {{recordings}} in 1910, when the acoustical process obliged orchestras {{to use only}} principal instruments, placed <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for HMV, were of excerpts from Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann and Johann Strauss's Die Fledermaus. In 1915, Beecham began recording for the Columbia Graphophone Company. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925–26) {{made it possible to}} record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had to be broken into four-minute segments to fit on 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemeal– his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier's España was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart. Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.|$|E
5|$|The PSP remake's {{localization}} {{was similar}} to those done for Persona 3 and 4, with the dialogue being in tune with modern youth and keeping <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original dialogue as possible except for Japan-specific cultural references. To provide a reference for their work, the localization team played through the original version of Persona. The changes made to character names and appearances were all changed back to how they appeared in the original Japanese release, {{with the exception of}} a couple of lines that had become fan favorites. These were included as a kind of homage to both players and the company's history of game localization. The entire Snow Queen quest was also reinstated.|$|E

Iraqi {{refugees}} were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but director Kathryn Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, {{she wanted to get}} <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraq border. She had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, {{the two had}} a major {{argument}} over the country's budget, as Banza adamantly opposed Bokassa's extravagant spending. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he felt he could safely run the government without {{having to worry about}} Banza's thirst for power. In the meantime, Banza tried to obtain a support base within the army, spending much of his time in the company of soldiers. Bokassa recognized what his minister was doing, so he sent military units most sympathetic to Banza to the country's border and brought his own army supporters <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital as possible. In September 1967, he took a special trip to Paris, where he asked for protection from French troops. Two months later, the government deployed 80 paratroopers to Bangui.|$|E
5|$|When fielding, Barnes {{stationed}} himself <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bat {{as possible}} at either forward short-leg or point. The {{report of the}} tour in the 1949 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, stated that Barnes's fielding was as important a factor as his batting in The Invincibles success: Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler running up, but equally important {{was the fact that}} the knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction. The Barnes demeanour in the field illustrated the general purposefulness of the Australians.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Army {{developed}} the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from {{experiences in the}} European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals {{for the treatment of}} wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea, all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport, making it very difficult for the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea, being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries.|$|E

5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{front line}} as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than {{the time to}} travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As {{a result of its}} proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus, a {{widespread}} genus of bats in Africa, southern Eurasia, and Australia, was first recorded from Madagascar by George Edward Dobson, who mentioned the larger Miniopterus schreibersii {{and the smaller}} M.scotinus (currently M.natalensis) in his 1878 catalog of the bats in the British Museum. In 1906, Oldfield Thomas named the larger species M.majori and the smaller M.manavi. He regarded M.manavi <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland African M.minor, and in 1971, R.W. Hayman and J.E. Hill placed it as a subspecies of that species. In their 1995 Faune de Madagascar review of Malagasy bats, however, Randolph Peterson and colleagues again separated M.manavi as a species, with M.manavi griveaudi (currently Miniopterus griveaudi) from Grande Comore as a subspecies. Peterson, who died before the review was completed, had originally divided M.manavi into several species occurring in different areas, but his collaborators decided conservatively to keep M.manavi as a single species, recommending reassessment {{of the status of}} those forms as new material would become available.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{was joined}} {{soon after the}} {{surrender}} of Argo by the 74gun ship of the line HMS Powerful under Captain William O'Bryen Drury and together the ships took possession of the frigate while the chase of {{the remainder of the}} Batavian squadron continued. At 10:00 two of the brigs turned towards the Batavian coastline to seek shelter and two of the leading British ships, Pegasus and the 50gun HMS Leander under Captain Maurice Delgarno, turned in chase. Donnelly sought to interpose his ships between the brigs and the coast, but found that this would have slowed his vessels so much that the Batavian brigs would have an opportunity to escape. He therefore maintained pursuit and watched the Batavian ships, Gier and Echo driven ashore at the Batavian village of Bosch. Sailing <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore line as safely possible, Delgarno detached cutters to investigate the state of the grounded ships, determining that one had been damaged beyond repair while the other, having initially grounded, had been driven over the shoal into deeper water on the far side. In his report on the action, Duncan considered that a storm which swept the area on the day following the action probably drove the brig back onto the shoal and destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|Rommel {{believed}} that Germany's best chance {{was to stop}} the invasion at the shore. He requested that the mobile reserves, especially tanks, be stationed <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast as possible. Rundstedt, Geyr, and other senior commanders objected. They {{believed that}} the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches. Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified. He also noted that, in the Italian Campaign, the armoured units stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment. Rommel's opinion was that, because of Allied air supremacy, the large-scale movement of tanks {{would not be possible}} once the invasion was under way. Hitler made the final decision, which was to leave three Panzer divisions under Geyr's command and give Rommel operational control of three more as reserves. Hitler took personal control of four divisions as strategic reserves, not to be used without his direct orders.|$|E
