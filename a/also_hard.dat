5|$|Acadia Parish was <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> hit, {{recording}} wind gusts exceeding , and 5tornadoes {{touched down}} in the parish. Thousands of homes were damaged with over 2,500 suffering severe damage. Power across the parish was knocked out, 2people were injured and one was killed after the storm. Schools in the parish also sustained $1.6million (2002USD; $1.9million 2007USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of Lone Grove, the area north of Ardmore was <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> hit. Several buildings, {{including}} those of the Beaver Academy and the Ardmore Adventist Academy, were destroyed. Although damage centered on the Ardmore Academy gymnasium, most of the campus was considered a total loss. In Ardmore, eight homes were destroyed and another 20sustained damage.|$|E
5|$|Xangsane {{made its}} second and final {{landfall}} in central Vietnam, causing severe flooding and strong winds that caused nearly 10 trillion Vietnamese đồng ($629million, 2006USD) in damage and killed 71people. The worst structural damage {{occurred in the}} city of Da Nang, where 26people were killed. The provinces of Quảng Nam and Nghệ An were <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> hit, with a total of 25people killed. The storm damaged or destroyed around 320,000 homes, downed thousands of trees and power lines, and flooded major streets.|$|E

5|$|The {{helicopter}} and boat chase scenes {{were not in}} the original novel but were added to create an action climax. The former was inspired by the crop-dusting scene in Hitchcock's North by Northwest and the latter by a previous Young/Broccoli/Maibaum collaboration, The Red Beret. These two scenes would initially be shot in Istanbul but were moved to Scotland. The speed-boats could not run fast enough due to the many waves in the sea, and a rented boat filled with cameras ended up sinking in the Bosphorus. A helicopter was <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> to obtain, and the special effects crew were nearly arrested trying to get one at a local air base. The helicopter chase was filmed with a radio controlled miniature helicopter. The sounds of the boat chase were replaced in post-production since the boats were not loud enough, and the explosion, shot in Pinewood, got out of control, burning Walter Gotell's eyelids and seriously injuring three stuntmen.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{problems}} persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which {{were difficult to}} start and maintain in tandem. Sufficient playback volume was <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project satisfactorily to fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed {{directly in front of}} the cumbersome recording devices (acoustical horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound.|$|E

50|$|The faster {{shutter speed}} allowed by fast moving {{subjects}} {{are easier to}} capture in a smoothly panned shot.

25|$|The Tutte {{polynomial}} {{can also}} be computed using a deletion-contraction recurrence, but its computational complexity is high: for many values of its arguments, computing it exactly is #P-complete, and it is <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> to approximate with a guaranteed approximation ratio. The point (1,1), at which it can be evaluated using Kirchhoff's theorem, {{is one of the}} few exceptions.|$|E
25|$|The North American Phalanx was <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> hit by {{the loss}} of its chief carpenter, a skilled horticulturalist, and other leading members in an 1853 {{succession}} to join the fledgling Raritan Bay Union. In short order Raritan Bay members and financial supporters owned fully one-sixth of the North American Phalanx's stock, further weakening the older phalanx's resolve to continue.|$|E
50|$|A {{shrapnel}} shell was {{more expensive than}} a high-explosive one and required higher grade steel for the shell body. They were <b>also</b> <b>harder</b> to use correctly because getting the correct fuze running time was critical in order to burst the shell in the right place. This required considerable skill by the observation officer when engaging moving targets.|$|R
50|$|Block sort {{does not}} exploit sorted ranges {{of data on}} as fine a level as some other algorithms, such as Timsort. It only checks for these sorted ranges at the two {{predefined}} levels: the A and B subarrays, and the A and B blocks. It is <b>also</b> <b>harder</b> to implement and parallelize compared to a merge sort.|$|R

25|$|Residents of the Isle of Man were greatly {{affected}} by the sinking {{as a number of}} bodies washed up on her shores. The funeral procession for the Bayano victims numbered in the thousands even though the victims were not from the island. <b>Also</b> <b>hard</b> hit was the Colony of Newfoundland, then a part of the British Empire. A dozen men from the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve were lost on the Bayano.|$|E
25|$|As the banded tunnelweb spider is a {{relatively}} undocumented species, {{there is little to}} no information on the parasite species that live on the banded tunnelweb spider and the Hexathelidae family. It is known that rodents sometimes eat hexathelid spiders, although this is rare due to their sometimes painful bite. They are <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> to catch as they are usually very reclusive and will retreat inside their burrow at any sign of movement.|$|E
25|$|The 1998 Gainesville–Stoneville tornado {{outbreak}} was {{a deadly}} tornado outbreak that struck {{portions of the}} southeastern United States on March 20, 1998. Particularly hard hit were rural areas outside of Gainesville, Georgia, where at least 12 {{people were killed in}} an early morning F3 tornado. The entire outbreak killed 14 people and produced 12 tornadoes across three states with the town of Stoneville, North Carolina, being <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> hit by the storms.|$|E

25|$|Compared with {{protest and}} noncooperation, nonviolent {{intervention}} {{is a more}} direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory.

50|$|A {{four-year}} government {{eradication campaign}} begun in 1989 sought to convert 55 percent of coca areas into legal crops. Coffee and citrus fruits were offered as alternative crops to coca {{despite the fact}} that their return was a fraction of that of coca. These crops were <b>also</b> <b>harder</b> to sell and transport. Coca has a much longer shelf-life than that of fruit crops, which require rapid transportation.|$|R
25|$|The attack {{destroyed}} most of {{the city}} centre and the city's medieval cathedral; 568 people were killed, 4,330 homes were destroyed and thousands more damaged. Industry was <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> hit with 75% of factories being damaged, although war production was only briefly disrupted with much of it being continued in shadow factories around the city and further afield. Aside from London and Plymouth, Coventry suffered more damage than any other British city during the Luftwaffe attacks, with huge firestorms devastating {{most of the}} city centre.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{property}} losses, the economic ones were <b>also</b> <b>hard.</b> While {{most of the}} year's crop had been harvested by mid-October, {{it had not been}} brought in, and it was either submerged or swept away by the flood. It is estimated that more than 500000 bags of onions, a similar amount of celery, as well as millions of bushels of other crops were taken by the flood, and were left to rot in the water. While no one died at Holland Marsh, total damages were up to $10,000,000 (2009: $81,600,000).|$|E
25|$|Many space {{missions}} are {{more suited to}} telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are {{the only way to}} explore them. Telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that are vulnerable to contamination by Earth micro-organisms since spacecraft can be sterilized. Humans can not be sterilized {{in the same way as}} a spaceship, as they coexist with numerous micro-organisms, and these micro-organisms are <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> to contain within a spaceship or spacesuit.|$|E

25|$|While market {{saturation}} was {{one reason}} for the fall in YAG production levels, another was the recent introduction of the other artificial garnet important as a diamond simulant, gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG; Gd3Ga5O12). Produced in much the same manner as YAG (but with a lower melting point of 1750nbsp&°C), GGG had an RI (1.97) close to, and a dispersion (0.045) nearly identical to diamond. GGG was <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> enough (hardness 7) and tough enough to be an effective gemstone, but its ingredients were also much more expensive than YAG's. Equally hindering was GGG's tendency to turn dark brown upon exposure to sunlight or other ultraviolet source: this was {{due to the fact that}} most GGG gems were fashioned from impure material that was rejected for technological use. The SG of GGG (7.02) is also the highest of all diamond simulants and amongst the highest of all gemstones, which makes loose GGG gems easy to spot by comparing their dimensions with their expected and actual weights. Relative to its predecessors, GGG was never produced in significant quantities; it became more or less unheard of by the close of the 1970s. Commercial names for GGG included Diamonique II and Galliant.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Indian {{political}} circles started to take a serious look at Bangladeshi illegal immigration into India. Bangladesh is under pressure from India as a source of rebellion in Indian North-East for this Indian perception. It is <b>also</b> <b>hard</b> pressed to convince India that encouraging migration is not a state policy of Bangladesh. The state of Bangladesh denied the existence of these immigrants while stripping them of their Bangladeshi citizenship. According to Jyoti M. Pathania of South Asia Analysis Group the reasons for Bangladeshi immigration to India are: basic need theory i.e. food, shelter and clothing, economic dictates i.e. employment opportunity, better wages and comparatively better living conditions, demographic disproportion especially for minorities (Hindus) in this densely populated country having roughly a density of 780 per km2 as against half that number on Indian side of the border, and being cheap labor the Bangladeshis find easy acceptance as “domestic helps” in Indian homes, which keeps proliferating by ever increasing demand for domestic helps. The Centre for Women and Children Studies estimated in 1998 that 27,000 Bangladeshis have been forced into prostitution in India.|$|E
500|$|With the {{bullish stock}} market of the 1990s, equity-heavy {{investing}} approaches outperformed risk parity {{in the near}} term. However, after the March 2000 crash, there was an increased interest in risk parity, first among institutional investors in the United States and then in Europe. USA investors include the Wisconsin State Investment Board and the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System (PSERS) which have invested hundreds of millions in the risk parity funds of AQR, BlackRock and Bridgewater Associates.
