50|$|For {{complete}} expansion to ambient pressure, {{and hence}} maximum nozzle thrust or efficiency, the required area ratio increases with flight Mach number, Mn. If the divergence {{is too short}} giving too small an exit area the exhaust will not expand to ambient pressure in the nozzle {{and there will be}} lost thrust potential With increasing Mn there may come a point where the nozzle exit area is as big as the engine nacelle diameter or aircraft <b>afterbody</b> diameter. Beyond this point the nozzle diameter becomes the biggest diameter and starts to incur increasing drag. Nozzles are thus limited to the installation size and the loss in thrust incurred is a trade off with other considerations such as lower drag, less weight.Examples are the F-16 at Mn2.0 and the XB-70 at Mn3.0.|$|E

5000|$|Pure spherical entry {{vehicles}} {{were used in}} the early Soviet Vostok and Voskhod and in Soviet Mars and Venera descent vehicles. The Apollo Command/Service Module used a spherical section forebody heat shield with a converging conical <b>afterbody.</b> It flew a lifting entry with a hypersonic trim angle of attack of −27° (0° is blunt-end first) to yield an average L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) of 0.368. [...] This angle of attack was achieved by precisely offsetting the vehicle's center of mass from its axis of symmetry. Other examples of the spherical section geometry in manned capsules are Soyuz/Zond, Gemini and Mercury. Even these small amounts of lift allow trajectories that have very significant effects on peak g-force (reducing g-force from 8-9g for a purely ballistic (slowed only by drag) trajectory to 4-5g) as well as greatly reducing the peak reentry heat.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between equilibrium and frozen {{is important because}} it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, viscosity etc.) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature. Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle. During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle's shock wave. Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing. The frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle. Correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult. Thermal protection shield (TPS) heating in the vehicle's <b>afterbody</b> is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} axisymmetric {{shape is}} the sphere or spherical section. This {{can either be}} a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a converging conical <b>afterbody.</b> The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory. Likewise, the spherical section's heat flux can be accurately modeled with the Fay-Riddell equation. [...] The static stability of a spherical section is assured if the vehicle's center of mass is upstream {{from the center of}} curvature (dynamic stability is more problematic). Pure spheres have no lift. However, by flying at an angle of attack, a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some cross-range capability and widening its entry corridor. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and computational fluid dynamics was still embryonic. Because the spherical section was amenable to closed-form analysis, that geometry became the default for conservative design. Consequently, manned capsules of that era were based upon the spherical section.|$|E

SIRCA was also the primary TPS material for the unsuccessful Deep Space 2 (DS/2) Mars impactor probes with their 0.35 m base diameter aeroshells. SIRCA is a monolithic, insulating material that can provide thermal protection through ablation. It is the only TPS material that can be machined to custom shapes and then applied directly to the spacecraft.

50|$|McKay's {{designs were}} {{characterized}} by a long fine bow with increasing hollow and waterlines. He was perhaps influenced by the writings of John W. Griffiths, designer of the China clipper Rainbow in 1845. The long hollow bow helped to penetrate rather than ride over the wave produced by the hull at high speeds, reducing resistance as hull speed is approached. Hull speed is the natural speed of a wave the same length as the ship, in knots, , where LWL = Length of Water Line in feet. His hulls had a shorter <b>afterbody,</b> putting the center of buoyancy farther aft than {{was typical of the}} period, as well as a full midsection with rather flat bottom. These characteristics led to lower drag at high speed compared to other ships of similar length, as well as great stability which translated into the ability to carry sail in high winds (more power in extreme conditions). His fishing schooner design was even more radical than his clippers, being a huge flat-bottomed dinghy similar in form to 20th century planing boats. These design changes were not favorable for light wind conditions such as were expected on the China trade, but were profitable in the California and Australian trades.|$|E

40|$|Radiative heating is {{identified}} as {{a major contributor to}} <b>afterbody</b> heating for Earth entry capsules at velocities above 10 km/s. Because of rate-limited electron-ion recombination processes, a large fraction of the electronically-excited N and O atoms produced in the high temperature/pressure forebody remain as they expand into the <b>afterbody</b> region, which results in significant <b>afterbody</b> radiation. Large radiative heating sensitivities to electron-impact ionization rates and escape factors are identified. Ablation products from a forebody ablator are shown to increase the <b>afterbody</b> radiation by as much as 40 %. The tangent-slab radiation transport approach is shown to over-predict the radiative flux by as much as 40 % in the <b>afterbody,</b> therefore making the more computationally expensive ray-tracing approach necessary for accurate radiative flux predictions. For the Stardust entry, the <b>afterbody</b> radiation is predicted to be nearly twice as large as the convective heating during the peak heating phase of the trajectory. Comparisons between simulations and the Stardust Echelle observation measurements, which are shown to be dominated by <b>afterbody</b> emission, indicate agreement within 20 % for various N and O lines. Similarly, calorimeter measurements from the Fire II experiment are identified as a source of validation data for <b>afterbody</b> radiation. For the <b>afterbody</b> calorimeter measurement closest to the forebody, which experiences the largest <b>afterbody</b> radiative heating component, the convective heating alone is shown to under-predict the measurement, even for the fullycatalytic assumption. Agreement with the measurements is improved with the addition of <b>afterbody</b> radiation. These comparisons with Stardust and Fire II measurements provide validation that the significant <b>afterbody</b> radiation values proposed in this work are legitimate...|$|E
