Then, in 1988, having been out of Hollywood for eleven years, she sold all her assets to produce The Beat, about <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>in</b> a tough neighbourhood trying to teach poetry to local gangs. It was a critical and commercial disaster, grossing less than $5,000 at the box office, and Phillips turned to penning her scathing memoir to escape her financial difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{law also}} forbids the {{consumption}} of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by {{the order in which}} they are consumed and by community, and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>in</b> its mother's milk, this rule is mostly derived from the Oral Torah, the Talmud and Rabbinic law. Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of kashrut, but the prohibition is Rabbinic, not Biblical.|$|E

500|$|There were {{allegations}} that the film was plagiarized from a 1967 script, The Alien, by Indian Bengali director Satyajit Ray. He stated, [...] "E.T. {{would not have been}} possible without my script of The Alien being available throughout the United States in mimeographed copies." [...] Spielberg denied this claim, stating, [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>in</b> high school when his script was circulating in Hollywood." [...] Star Weekend Magazine disputes Spielberg's claim, pointing out that he had graduated from high school in 1965 and began his career as a director in Hollywood in 1969. Director and Spielberg’s friend, Martin Scorsese, has also alleged the film was influenced by Ray's script. When Ray attempted to sue Spielberg in 1983, Spielberg was quoted as saying, [...] "It's the people you've never heard of who crawl out of the woodwork like cockroaches to sue you".|$|E

500|$|During {{the search}} for a {{suitable}} conductor, Disney and Walt Disney Feature Animation president Thomas Schumacher invited Metropolitan Opera conductor James Levine and manager Peter Gelb to a meeting in September 1991. Disney recalled: [...] "I asked James what his thought was on a three minute version of Beethoven's fifth symphony. He paused and went 'I think the right three minutes would be beautiful'". In November 1992, Disney, Schumacher, Levine, Gelb, and Butoy met in Vienna to discuss a collection of story reels developed, one of them being Pines of Rome, which Levine took an immediate liking to. Butoy described Levine's enthusiasm toward the film as [...] "like <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>in</b> a candy store". Because Katzenberg continued to express some hostility towards the film, Disney held development meetings without him and reported directly to Eisner instead, something that author James B. Stewart wrote [...] "would have been unthinkable on any other future animation project." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Ray wrote {{a script}} {{for a film}} to be called The Alien, based on his short story [...] "Bankubabur Bandhu" [...] ("Banku Babu's Friend"), which he wrote in 1962 for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine. Columbia Pictures was the {{producer}} for what was a planned US-India co-production, and Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers were cast as the leading actors. Ray found that his script had been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Mike Wilson. Wilson had initially approached Ray through their mutual friend, Arthur C. Clarke, to represent him in Hollywood. Wilson copyrighted the script credited to Mike Wilson & Satyajit Ray, although he contributed only one word. Ray later said that he never received a penny for the script. After Brando {{dropped out of the}} project, the project tried to replace him with James Coburn, but Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta. Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s, but nothing came of it. When E.T. was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film to his earlier Alien script. Ray claimed that this film plagiarized his script. Ray said that Steven Spielberg's movie [...] "would not have been possible without my script of 'The Alien' being available throughout America in mimeographed copies." [...] Spielberg denied any plagiarism by saying, [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>in</b> high school when this script was circulating in Hollywood." [...] (Spielberg actually graduated high school in 1965 and released his first film in 1968). Besides The Alien, two other unrealised projects that Ray had intended to direct were adaptations of the ancient Indian epic, the Mahābhārata, and E. M. Forster's 1924 novel A Passage to India.|$|E
