50|$|The mining {{industry}} traditionally measures exposure using the <b>working</b> <b>level</b> (WL) index, and the cumulative exposure in <b>working</b> <b>level</b> months (WLM): 1 WL equals {{any combination of}} short-lived 222Rn progeny (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi, and 214Po) in 1 liter of air that releases 1.3 × 105 MeV of potential alpha energy; one WL is equivalent to 2.08 × 10−5 joules per cubic meter of air (J/m3). The SI unit of cumulative exposure is expressed in joule-hours per cubic meter (J·h/m3). One WLM is equivalent to 3.6 × 10−3 J·h/m3.

Among men whose exposure rates never exceeded 10 <b>working</b> <b>levels,</b> excess relative risks per unit exposure were greater in younger men, and exposures received in the periods 15 - 24, 25 - 34 and 35 + years previously were found to have 47, 24 and 0 % of the effect of exposures 5 - 14 years previously. Within this low-exposure-rate group excess relative risk increased linearly with time-weighted cumulative exposure and did not depend on exposure rate or duration of exposure. For men who spent less than 20 % of their employment at the Jáchymov mine the excess relative risk per <b>working</b> <b>level</b> month was 1. 36 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 52 - 3. 54) in the baseline category (age group 55 + and exposure received 5 - 14 years previously). For men who spent more than 20 % of their employment at Jáchymov, the corresponding excess relative risk per <b>working</b> <b>level</b> month was higher by a factor of 1. 80 (95 % confidence interval 1. 27 - 2. 97). The difference {{may be due to the}} fact that men who spent more than 20 % of their employment at Jáchymov were exposed to the much higher levels of arsenic in the dust at the Jáchymov mine than at other mines. When men with exposure rates above 10 <b>working</b> <b>levels</b> were included in the analysis, patterns of risk were complex and depended on both exposure rate and duration of exposure in addition to the factors mentioned above. If these findings are confirmed elsewhere, calculation of risk estimates for extrapolation to modern occupational or environmental exposures should be based on miners with exposure rates below about 10 <b>working</b> <b>levels.</b> Further investigation is desirable of the influence of dusts containing arsenic on lung cancer risk in miners exposed to radon...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to report}} {{the results of an}} {{investigation}} of the relationship between <b>working</b> capital <b>level,</b> measured by the cash conversion cycle and profitability of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The paper employs panel data regression analysis on a sample of 160 Alternative Investment Market (AIM) listed SMEs for the period from 2005 to 2010. The empirical results show that there is a concave relationship between <b>working</b> capital <b>level</b> and firm profitability and that there is an optimal <b>working</b> capital <b>level</b> at which firms’ profitability is maximised. Furthermore, an examination {{as to whether or not}} deviations from the optimal <b>working</b> capital <b>level</b> reduce firm profitability indicate that deviations above or below the optimum decrease profitability. The sample is limited to AIM listed SMEs, and therefore the findings cannot be generalised to all firms. Overall, the evidence suggests that firms should strive and attain the optimal <b>working</b> capital <b>level</b> in order to maximise their profitability.
