5|$|Near Channel Point, the cyclone {{brought a}} storm surge of , barely surpassing the highest <b>astronomical</b> <b>tide</b> {{in a few}} areas. In some cases, waves over topped sand dunes but no damage took place. Roughly 10-15% of trees in open areas were snapped or uprooted by high winds. Only two {{structures}} sustained direct wind damage while several others were struck by downed trees. Damage was more widespread in Darwin where roughly 15,000 homes, 60% of the city's residences, were left without power. Approximately 1,500 trees were downed in the city, falling on roads, homes and power lines. In the days following the storm's passage, the Adelaide and Katherine rivers continued to rise, of which the former exceeded minor flood levels. In the harbour, seven vessels washed ashore, each sustaining minor damage. Losses caused by the storm was placed at A$1.3million (US$1.1million).|$|E

50|$|Because the {{timeframe}} of both oscillations {{is comparable}} to naturally occurring (yet independent) <b>astronomical</b> <b>tides,</b> the two effects overlap and reinforce each other.

500|$|Waves {{and storm}} surges {{accompanying}} tropical cyclones erode undersea sands, erode shell deposits, break off corals from near shore reefs in their paths, and carry all this detritus landwards in a rolling wave {{of material that}} is deposited onshore, above highest <b>astronomical</b> <b>tide</b> as a ridge of sand, shell and coral. [...] For example, each severe tropical cyclone (i.e. Category4–5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale) crossing northeast Australia's tropical coastline since the last significant change in sea levels (about 5000years ago) has 'emplaced' such ridges within the coastal landscape forming, in some places, series of ridges and a geomorphological record of highest magnitude cyclones hitting the coast over 3000 – 5000years.|$|E
500|$|Strong surface winds cause surface {{currents}} at a 45° {{angle to}} the wind direction, by an effect known as the Ekman Spiral. Wind stresses cause a phenomenon referred to as [...] "wind set-up", which is the tendency for water levels to increase at the downwind shore and to decrease at the upwind shore. Intuitively, this {{is caused by the}} storm blowing the water toward one side of the basin in the direction of its winds. Because the Ekman Spiral effects spread vertically through the water, the effect is inversely proportional to depth. The pressure effect and the wind set-up on an open coast will be driven into bays {{in the same way as}} the <b>astronomical</b> <b>tide.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the Florida Keys, Ernesto {{produced}} {{tropical storm}} force wind gusts and light rainfall, causing minor flooding. Upon making landfall in southern Florida, the storm produced a storm tide of about 1foot (0.3m) above <b>astronomical</b> <b>tide</b> levels, though no beach erosion was reported. Winds were fairly minor across the state, reaching [...] at a station on Lake Okeechobee. Ernesto dropped heavy rainfall across southwest Florida, {{with a state}} maximum of 8.72inches (221mm) recorded at South Golden Gate. The rainfall caused the Fisheating Creek to overflow, and some flooding also occurred in portions of Collier County. Floodwaters entered at least 13homes in Palmdale. The storm resulted in more than 150canceled flights at Orlando International Airport, stranding several travelers. While moving through the state, Ernesto spawned two F0 tornadoes in Osceola County. One person died in each in Broward and Miami-Dade counties from traffic accidents; the deaths are considered indirectly related to Ernesto. Overall damage in the state was minor.|$|E

The Port of Melbourne Corporation, the Victorian State Government authority responsible for the channel deepening, has concluded that the largest increase in tidal height due to the channel deepening will be eight millimetres. This paper is an independent study on the effect of the channel deepening on the <b>astronomical</b> <b>tides.</b> The levels of tides for the existing topography and for the topography including the proposed channel deepening have been computed.

40|$|A hindcast {{of typical}} extratropical storm surge {{occurring}} in the Bohai Sea in October 2003 is performed using a three-dimensional (3 D) Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM). The storm surge model is forced by 10 [*]m winds obtained from the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model simulation. It is shown that the simulated storm surge and tides agree well with the observations. The nonlinear interaction between the surge and <b>astronomical</b> <b>tides,</b> the spatial distribution of the maximum surge level, and the hydrodynamic response to the storm surge are studied. The storm surge is {{the interaction of the}} surge and the <b>astronomical</b> <b>tides.</b> The currents change rapidly during the storm surge and turn to be the unidirectional at some places where the tidal currents are usually rectilinear. The results show that the local surge current velocity in each depth, with a magnitude of the same order as the astronomic tidal currents, increases or decreases rapidly depending on the relationship between the winds and current directions. Furthermore, the current pattern gets more complicated {{under the influence of the}} direction of the winds, which might affect sand movement in the coastal water of the Bohai Sea...|$|R

40|$|A two-way nested coupled tide-surge {{prediction}} model was established and {{applied in the}} Taiwan Strait and adjacent sea area in this study. This two-dimensional (2 D) model had a fine horizontal resolution and took into account the interaction between storm surges and <b>astronomical</b> <b>tides,</b> which made it suitable for depicting the complicated physical properties of storm surges in the Taiwan Strait. A two-way nesting technique and an open boundary condition developed from Flather's radiation condition and Roed and Smedstad's local mode idea, were successfully implemented in the model. A simulation experiment showed that the open boundary condition {{could be used in}} the coupled tide-surge model and that the performance of the two-way nested model was slightly superior in accuracy to that of the one-way nested one. The fluctuations of storm surge residuals with tidal period at Sansha and Pingtan tide stations during the period of typhoon Dan in 1999 were well reproduced by the model, with the coupling effect between storm surges and tides indicating that the effect of <b>astronomical</b> <b>tides</b> upon typhoon surges should be considered in a storm-surge {{prediction model}} for the Taiwan Strait. The forecast experiment during typhoon Talim in 2005 showed that the storm surge prediction outputs by the model were better in the early 20 h of the forecast period of each model run than those in the later period due to the prediction accuracy of the typhoon track, maximum winds, and central air pressures.

40|$|AbstractThe {{current state}} of {{understanding}} the North Sea’s physical system is presented.

A separate section is dedicated to the North Sea of Tomorrow, i. e. the prospective variations of the physical environment resulting from global changes in future decades. The statements are based on the long experience of the authors and their groups and include findings that are little known if at all.
