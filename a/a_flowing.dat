5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} to put <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> move {{together in the}} opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the Sangam age Tamil {{country were}} ruled over by several {{independent}} chieftains, alongside the three crowned monarchs. Among them, coins {{belonging to the}} chieftains of the Malayaman clan {{have been found in}} Tamil Nadu. Many of them contain a written legend on the obverse and all of them have the image of <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> river on their obverse. Based on the legends some of these coins have been assigned to specific rulers such as Tirukkannan, also known as Malaiyan Choliya Enadi Tirukkannan, and Tirumudi Kari. A series of coins without a legend but with a horse as the principal motif on the obverse have been assigned to the Malayaman chieftains, because of the river symbol on the obverse. Numismatist R. Krishnamurthy, dates these coins to the period between 100 BCE and 100 CE.|$|E

5|$|To collect water, on 20 June, Bidar Bakht {{and his men}} headed towards Jajau {{without knowing}} that Bahadur Shah was camped there. He came across a village where he found <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> stream of water. To inform Azam Shah, he sent his messenger, Iradat Khan, to him with the message. When he returned, he {{informed}} Bidar Bakht {{that he had seen}} Bahadur Shah's advance tents. Khan Alam Dakhvini and Munavvar Khan, who were in charge of the central wing of the troops, were dispatched to attack the tents. Azim-ush-Shan's 500 elephants failed to mount a resistance against the invading forces. The attackers looted the tents and then set them on fire.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Warner Brothers {{purchased}} the film {{rights for the}} novel from Max J. Rosenberg, of Vanguard Productions, who had {{purchased the}}m from E. P. Dutton. They later negotiated with Anice Terhune {{for the rights to}} the two follow up novels, hoping to produce a sequel and television series if the first film proved successful. Starring Peter Breck, Peggy McCay, Carroll O'Connor, and Angela Cartwright, the film blended several of the novel's stories with some modifications to make <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> narrative. Aram Avakian was initially selected to be the film's director, but his refusal to create a sentimental dog story resulted in his firing; he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. The film was released on June 6, 1962. Although it was praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film, and it was considered a low budget B-movie.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a dark room, dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> formalizes {{the idea}} of the motion of {{particles}} in <b>a</b> fluid. <b>Flows</b> are ubiquitous in science, including engineering and physics. The notion of flow is basic to the study of ordinary differential equations. Informally, <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> may be viewed as a continuous motion of points over time. More formally, <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> is <b>a</b> group action of the real numbers on a set.|$|R

40|$|Based on my {{fieldwork}} {{and research}} in Beijing and other Chinese urban cities in the 1990 s, this dissertation focuses on urban Chinese lifestyles caught up in historical and momentous dynamics of continuity and transition. It is to study how lifestyles are embodied by urban {{men and women in}} the 1990 s and played out in the bars, coffee shops, teahouses and Karoke halls in Beijing, as well as Shanghai and Zhengzhou. In general, this dissertation tries to explore how lifestyles become both reflexive and performative bodies in a complex of historical, political, social, cultural phenomena in <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> of fluxes and trends, <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> of information, <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> of history, <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> of modernity and <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> of globalization...|$|R

25|$|Microwave {{volumetric}} heating (MVH) is {{the newest}} available pasteurization technology. It uses microwaves to heat liquids, suspensions, or semi-solids in a continuous flow. Because MVH delivers energy evenly and deeply into the whole body of <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> product, it allows for gentler and shorter heating, so that almost all heat-sensitive substances in the milk are preserved.|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic {{precipitators}} An {{electrostatic precipitator}} (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> gas (such as air), using {{the force of}} an induced electrostatic charge.

5000|$|<b>A</b> {{barotropic}} <b>flow</b> is <b>a</b> {{generalization of}} a barotropic atmosphere. It is <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> {{in which the}} pressure {{is a function of}} the density only and vice versa. In other words, it is <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> in which isobaric surfaces are isopycnic surfaces and vice versa. One may have <b>a</b> barotropic <b>flow</b> of <b>a</b> non-barotropic fluid, but a barotropic fluid will always follow <b>a</b> barotropic <b>flow.</b> Examples include barotropic layers of the oceans, an isothermal ideal gas or an isentropic ideal gas.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, a new $3 million Mike the Tiger Habitat {{was created}} for Mike between Tiger Stadium and the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Its {{amenities}} include lush plantings, a waterfall, <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> stream that empties into a wading pond, and rocky plateaus. The habitat has, as a backdrop, an Italianate tower - a campanile - that creates a visual link to the Italianate architectural vernacular of LSU's campus.|$|E
25|$|In another {{description}} of his view {{on the concept of}} God, Sagan emphatically wrote: The idea that God is an oversized white male with <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.|$|E

40|$|Consider a space M {{endowed with}} two or more Lie group actions. Under a certain {{condition}} on the orbits of the Lie group actions, we show how to construct <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> on M that projects to prescribed flows on the orbit spaces of the group actions. Hence, in order to design <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> that converges to the intersection of given orbits, it suffices to design flows on the various orbit spaces that display convergence to the desired orbits, and then to lift these flows to M using the proposed procedure. We illustrate the technique by creating <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> for principal component analysis. The <b>flow</b> projects to <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> on the Grassmann manifold that achieves principal subspace analysis and to <b>a</b> <b>flow</b> on the "shape" manifold that converges to the set of orthonormal matrices...|$|R

25|$|Studies {{show that}} intercepting non-point {{pollution}} between {{the source and}} the water is a successful means of prevention. Riparian buffer zones are interfaces between <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> body of water and land, and have been created near waterways {{in an attempt to}} filter pollutants; sediment and nutrients are deposited here instead of in water. Creating buffer zones near farms and roads is another possible way to prevent nutrients from traveling too far. Still, {{studies have shown that the}} effects of atmospheric nitrogen pollution can reach far past the buffer zone. This suggests that the most effective means of prevention is from the primary source.|$|E
25|$|The style had waxed and waned {{in fashion}} for {{hundreds}} of years. The shape of the dresses also helped to lengthen the body’s appearance. The clothing can also be draped to maximize the bust. Lightweight fabrics were typically used to create <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> effect. Also, ribbon, sash, and other decorative features were used to highlight the waistline. The empire gowns were often with low neckline and short sleeves and women usually worn them as evening dresses. On the other hand, day gowns had higher neckline and long sleeves. The chemisette was a staple for fashionable ladies. Although there were differences between day dresses and evening dresses, the high waistline was not changed.|$|E
25|$|Even in the {{earliest}} times the chief qualifications demanded of the hazzan, in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature {{as well as the}} prayer motifs (known as steiger), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The hazzan was required to possess a pleasing appearance, to be married, and to have <b>a</b> <b>flowing</b> beard. Sometimes, according to Isaac of Vienna (13th century), a young hazzan having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. Maimonides decided that the hazzan who recited the prayers on an ordinary Sabbath and on weekdays need not possess an appearance pleasing to everybody; he might even have a reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach {{at the time of his}} appointment.|$|E
