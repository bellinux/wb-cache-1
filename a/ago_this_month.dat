The title of the novel and the family estate may well reflect Lord Mansfield, whose decision as Lord Chief Justice in a court case led {{to the end of}} slavery in Britain itself, and the name of Aunt Norris may be drawn from Robert Norris, the opposite of the judge, as Norris was [...] "an infamous slave trader and a byword for pro-slavery sympathies."

5000|$|The American scholar Susan Morgan called Mansfield Park {{the most}} {{difficult}} of all Austen’s novels as it features the weakest of all of Austen’s heroines who ends up the most beloved member of the Bertram family. Morgan argue that to understand the novel properly requires understanding of the capacity for characters to change or not to change. Mary Crawford, while possessing some good qualities and having much charm and vivacity is ultimately doomed by her superficiality, materialism and an inability to change. A telling example of Mary’s character occurs when says [...] "Look, where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be", as she assumes that what she sees before her is all that will ever be, and the possibility of anything else existing does not occur to her. Through not devoid of kindness, Mary has a strong competitive streak that leads her to see love as a game where one party conquers and controls the other, which coupled with her cynicism and narcissism makes her insensitive towards the feelings of others, as she insists that Edmund abandons his clerical career merely it is not prestigious enough for her and her inability to appreciate improvements, as she likes things whole and lacks the discernment to value change in one's moral character and the hard work necessary to bring it about. Price by contrast is unique amongst the Austen heroines in that her story begins when she is 10 and traces her story up to the age 17. When Price is sent to Mansfield Park, her tears at leaving the only home she has ever known, shows her awareness of the past, of who she is and was, and her wish to maintain her identity. Morgan wrote through Price is a flawed heroine, she possesses [...] "…the energy, open to us all, to struggle against selfishness, toward self-knowledge, and that generosity of mind which should illuminate our view of the people around us.". Austen also suggests change can be either for the worse or the better as Price almost succumbs to Henry Crawford’s charm and apparent reformation of character, even though she knows deep down that he is by nature malleable and undependable because he does not feel very much, and therefore whatever his passions are now will be easily replaced. Morgan argued that Price’s principle virtue is that of" [...] growing worth", her ability to understand the world around her, to use her reason, to care about others, to change yet remain true to herself.

5000|$|A {{newspaper}} {{report from}} Sunday Herald (June 23, 1895) gives {{a detailed account}} on the robbery and some further information on the company: ROBBING A MINE. Systematic Fleecing of Ore of the Richest Gold Properties.The Golden Fleece Mining company {{is one of the}} best paying gold producing properties in Colorado and it has no wonder that a great sensation followed the recent discovery that there had been a series of systematic robberies by which about half of the output has been stolen. The extent of the robbery may be at least partially realised when it is stated that the output last month was $35,000. During the four years that the mine has been worked it has been one of the best paying, investments ever uncovered in Colorado. With a capital stock of $600,000 the promoters have within a few years all become wealthy men. Four years ago a party of Denver men, among whom S. S. Kennedy now living in Highlands was a leading spirit, began to work the mine which was then for the first time known to contain large deposits of gold. When a company was formed two years <b>ago</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> to further develop the property it was not anticipated that the output would reach anything like the figure that are now shown. In the past two years the yield has averaged more than $20,000 a month and many months it has run as high as $40,000. It was no wonder that the fact that one-half of this large output has been systematically stolen should have created consternation among those interested in similar enterprises. Extraordinary Precaution.The opinion was generally expressed that this is only one instance of where similar practices have been consummated in mining camps. For many years old miners claim, that professional thieves have been working the mines when discovered that have produced big outputs. This gang, it is asserted, have toured the West, and no great mine has escaped the robbery that has followed. To such an extent has this been carried that in many of the larger mines the plan has finally been adopted of closing all except one entrance and requiring that persons going in and coming out shall make a complete change of clothing. In most new mines, however, this rule is not observed.The most sensational feature of the discovery is that the fact is borne home, that miners of Colorado must have lost in the last ten years millions of dollars by reason of the systematic scheme carried out in all its arranged details by a baud of professionals. As one of the officers of the Golden Fleece said yesterday, the work was not that of the miners themselves. As a rule, they are honest, and are content to receive the regular wages. Some bold thieves have, however, planned robberies on a gigantic scale, and it would appear have generally carried their schemes to a successful issue. Defensive Organisations.There is some talk of forming an organization of mining men for the purpose of running to earth and punishing the rascals who have plundered the rich mines of the State and pilfered their product from the rightful owners. There is no clue as to who the leaders of the gang of marauders are, but it is thought that with a perfect combination and the expenditure of enough money the perpetrators of this stupendous schema of robbery can he found.The specimens of rich tellurium ore exhibited in the company's office suggest the ease with which the stealing of enormous sums can be done. A small chunk of ore in the glass case not over two inches square is worth $65, while the large piece at the window which was shown at the World's Fair is worth more than $800.In May 1893, the Golden Fleece Mining Company was organised with a capital stock of $600,000. It has since not only paid its dividends, amounting to about 25 per cent per annum, but has besides expended large sums in developing and improving the property. The output is principally gold. About two mouths ago the officers of the company received a tip that the company was being systematically robbed, and the investigation was then begun which now results in the finding that for many months the corporation has lost over one-half of its ores, stolen under the vary eye of the managers. Vice President’s Statement.S. S. Kennedy, vice-president of the company, said he did not know the details of the result of the investigation except as he had read the same in The News. [...] "About two months ago," [...] Mr. Kennedy said, [...] "we received word that the ore was being stolen, and an investigation was then begun. A few days ago Misters Pierce and Lee were sent down to be on the ground and personally-endeavor to get the bottom facts. I believe no doubt the report in your paper is true, as it is in line with what we were prepared to hear." [...] Mr. Kennedy owns 120,000 shares of the stock. He was originally the owner of a quarter interest but a few weeks since he disposed 30,000 shares, retaining now a fifth interest in the property. [...] "Whenever a rich mine is opened" [...] continued Mr. Kennedy, [...] "professional thieves are sure to gather around. Genuine miners are all right. I do not think the stealing has been going on long, and I believe an organised hand of professionals is at the bottom of the whole affair."To much an extent has this species of theft been carried on in other mines that the owners have at times of late discharged the entire force, innocent as well as guilty, in the effort to locate the rascals. Some months ago the management of the Victor gold mine at Cripple Creek let out all of the men and it is rumored that this course will now be pursued at the Golden Fleece, although if the other officers feel as Mr. Kennedy does, there will be no occasion for this plan, as he has no doubt the men are without blame.|$|E
