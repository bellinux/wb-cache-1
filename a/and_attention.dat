5|$|A {{number of}} {{specific}} events have attracted the help <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> of Weiquan activists. In the March 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province, shoddy school construction {{resulted in the}} collapse of several schools full of students. A number of Weiquan lawyers, including Tan Zuoren, were involved in advocating for the rights of parents, and in investigating allegations that corrupt officials were responsible for the poor construction. Parents and lawyers met with reprisals from Chinese officials for their activism.|$|E

While Rad felt that the game presented little challenge as a minor complaint, Reiner considered its final puzzles disproportionately challenging.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare {{children}} with different ADHD subtypes and controls {{on measures of}} <b>attention,</b> <b>and</b> to examine the relationships between measures of <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> reading and spelling ability. Thirty-eight children with ADHD and sixteen controls were administered tests of four components of attention (viz., attention span, focused <b>attention,</b> selective <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> shifting <b>attention)</b> <b>and</b> two subtests (viz., reading and spelling) from the WRAT- 3. The children with ADHD-Combined subtype were found to show deficits in <b>attention</b> span <b>and</b> focused <b>attention,</b> while the children with ADHD-Inattentive subtype were found to show deficits in shifting <b>attention,</b> <b>and</b> subtler deficits in <b>attention</b> span <b>and</b> focused <b>attention.</b> Measures of attention span {{were found to be}} significant predictors of reading ability, <b>and</b> measures of <b>attention</b> span <b>and</b> selective <b>attention</b> were found to be significant predictors of spelling ability. These results suggest that different ADHD subtypes show different patterns of attentional problems that have different neuroanatomical bases. Furthermore, academic problems in children with ADHD may be related to their attentional problems. Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis review {{focuses on}} covert <b>{{attention}}</b> <b>and</b> how it alters early vision. I explain why attention {{is considered a}} selective process, the constructs of covert <b>attention,</b> spatial endogenous <b>and</b> exogenous <b>attention,</b> <b>and</b> feature-based <b>attention.</b> I explain how in the last 25 years research on attention has characterized the effects of covert attention on spatial filters <b>and</b> how <b>attention</b> influences the selection of stimuli of interest. This review includes the effects of spatial <b>attention</b> on discriminability <b>and</b> appearance in tasks mediated by contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution; the effects of feature-based attention on basic visual processes, and {{a comparison of the}} effects of spatial <b>and</b> feature-based <b>attention.</b> The emphasis of this review is on psychophysical studies, but relevant electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies and models regarding how and where neuronal responses are modulated are also discussed...|$|R
30|$|Finally, the Useful Field Of View test (UFOV®) [59] was {{performed}} to assess the speed of processing <b>and</b> visual <b>attention</b> of our participants.

It included three subtests, assessing processing speed, divided <b>attention,</b> <b>and</b> selective <b>attention.</b>|$|R
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> between different tasks or operations typically {{in response to a}} change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear.

Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, and the story died.|$|E

40|$|<b>Attention</b> <b>and</b> visual {{short-term}} memory (VSTM) are both associated with top-down activity in visual cortex. To-be-remembered visual input triggers persistent activity in visual cortex, <b>and</b> preparatory <b>attention</b> elicits visual activity {{in anticipation of}} an expected target stimulus. This brief review considers similarities, and differences, in top-down visual activity underlying VSTM maintenance <b>and</b> preparatory <b>attention.</b> The extant evidence suggests that top-down visual activity provides a common neural substrate for VSTM maintenance <b>and</b> preparatory <b>attention,</b> however the precise neural implementation depends on the specific task parameters. A similar neurobiological framework may also apply to other high-level visual phenomena, including visual imagery and awareness...|$|R
