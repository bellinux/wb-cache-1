40|$|This study {{develops}} an intertemporally linked {{market model}} {{to explore the}} relationships between price-cost margins, market concentration, and <b>advertising</b> <b>outlay.</b> The study used data from 48 four-digit SIC (standardized industrial classification) codes for the Food and Tobacco Processing Industries during the 1970 s, 1980 s, and 1990 s. The authors' findings provide evidence that both high {{and low levels of}} performance provide signals to industries to consolidate, but for obvious and different reasons. Further, increased consolidation leads to increased entry barriers (advertising) and higher profits to the industry. Our findings are supportive of both Chicago and Traditionalist Schools of thought about antitrust enforcement: Neither emerges in a dominant position. Endogeneity issues and findings within the intertemporal structure cast considerable doubt about overly simplistic structure-performance paradigms of firm behavior.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three essays {{that study}} {{the implications of}} online search activity for new-product marketing. Using the U. S. motion picture industry as a test case, the first essay examines the dynamic causal relationship between traditional media, consumers' media generation activity, media consumption activity, and market demand of movies. Consumers' media generation and consumption activities around movies are operationalized by the blog volume and search volume of those movies. I develop three separate models [...] a pre-launch period model, a post-launch period model, and an opening-week model [...] and {{examine the relationship between}} them separately for each period. As the focal variables are jointly determined, I introduce instruments and explain how to correct for endogeneity bias. I find that consumer searching activity is a key mediator between advertising, consumer blogging activity, and market demand. The second essay examines the pre-launch advertising effectiveness of new products using online search indexes as the response variable. I model the relationship between the advertising schedule and the online search volume process during the pre-launch period of movies. The model incorporates consumers' willingness-to-search and the time-varying effectiveness of advertising as key elements that influence online search volume at specific times. The model is represented in a Bayesian dynamic linear model framework and applied to the U. S. movie industry. The empirical analysis reveals important features of consumers' pre-launch interest development for new products. First, consumers' pre-launch responses to advertising are substantially influenced by the timing of advertising. Second, advertising effectiveness varies over time as a function of past <b>advertising</b> <b>outlay.</b> Third, the time-to-launch effect and time-varying advertising effectiveness vary substantially across movies. The estimation results are used to suggest a more effective pre-launch advertising schedule. The third essay provides an explanation of the varying predictive power of online search volume by examining the effects of consumers' quality perception on the search activity for and actual demand of new products. I hypothesize that both the perceived quality and quality uncertainty of a new product increase consumers' search activity for the new product, while only perceived quality positively influences the conversion of search activity into actual demand. Using the U. S. movie industry as a test case, I find that both perceived quality and quality uncertainty are positively associated with the pre-launch search volume of movies, whereas only perceived quality positively influences the conversion of pre-launch searches into opening-week revenue. Similar findings are maintained in the post-launch period analysis. These findings imply that systematic over-/under-prediction of market success may occur if managers use an online search index without considering the effects of quality and quality uncertainty of new products...|$|E
40|$|Consider a firm {{promoting}} a product in a fast expanding industry by using advertising as its single promotional tool. The firm 2 ̆ 7 s {{objective is to}} minimize the overall cost of advertising necessary for reaching certain target sales of the product {{by the end of}} a given planning period. We adopt the Student Work Control problem (SWC) framework for modeling this marketing context, in general, and the advertising-sales response function, in particular. We compare the SWC 2 ̆ 7 s optimal control budgeting principle with the solutions of equally effective, alternative advertising budgeting principles, which require strong regularity conditions on the path of either the <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays</b> or sales. In contrast to the other principles, SWC 2 ̆ 7 s optimal sales path is highly convex {{to the point that the}} firm may deliberately accept decreasing sales at the earliest periods. However, its optimal solution requires the firm to advertise in every period and to continue to accelerate its <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays.</b> The resulting <b>Advertising</b> Sales Response function, too, may therefore have a convex section with declining sales, a finding contributing to an optimization-driven explanation of threshold in advertising effect on sale...|$|R
40|$|I {{consider}} an oligopoly model where, prior to price competition, firms invest in persuasive advertising and induce brand loyalty in consumers {{who would otherwise}} buy the cheapest alternative on the market. This setting, in which persuasive advertising is introduced to homogeneous product markets, provides an alternative explanation for price dispersion phenomena. Despite ex ante symmetry, the equilibrium profile of <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays</b> is asymmetric. It follows that endogenously determined brand loyal consumer bases are not symmetric across firms. This raises a robustness question regarding Varian's "model of sales" where symmetry is exogenously assumed. Oligopoly Advertising Price dispersion Brand loyalty...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to identify a}} coherent Post Keynesian approach to advertising. Although the neoclassical explanation of advertising cost is encapsulated by the DorfmanâSteiner theorem, and static in character, the Post Keynesian theory provides a realistic and dynamic framework within which advertising {{can be viewed as}} strategic investment of firms, financed by their retained profits. The empirical part of the paper analyzes the impact of the flow of profits on <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays</b> for firms in a transition economy and the results confirm the relevance of the Post Keynesian approach. advertising expenditures, dependence effect, Dorfman-Steiner theorem, structure-conduct-performance paradigm, transition economics,...|$|R

Tourists have limited disposable income and time, and most travelers attempt to maximize their investment by avoiding places with unsavory or unsafe reputations. Small-town tourist destinations with limited resources face special challenges when trying to recover from crises that scare visitors away: they lack media attention and financial resources for large promotional campaigns. Moreover, although places cannot predict every possible crisis, place communication managers {{need to be aware}} of risk factors particular to their location, and prepare to address those risks. Featuring examples from Playas de Rosarito, Mexico, and San Luis Obispo County, California, places that have crisis communication plans, are media-aware, and know their target publics can more quickly recover from bad news, without expensive <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a quality-ladder model of endogenous growth {{to study the}} interplay between in-house R&D and combative advertising expenditure, {{and its implications for}} economic growth, firm size, and welfare. The analysis shows that, somewhat surprisingly, higher incentives to engage in advertising, although combative, unambiguously foster innovation activity of firms. This, possibly, leads to faster growth and even higher welfare. These results rest on two features of the model which are well-supported by empirical evidence. First, if firms incur higher sunk costs for marketing, concentration and firm size rise. Second, firm size and R&D expenditure are positively related as larger firms are able to spread R&D costs over higher sales. The analysis also suggests that R&D subsidies are conducive to R&D and growth without inducing firms to raise <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays.</b> Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine the {{incentives}} for voluntary disclosure of advertising expenditures for {{a sample of}} US firms for the period 1994 - 2003. I estimate proxies for the proprietary costs and valuation benefits of advertising with data from the mandatory disclosure period. My proxy for proprietary costs is {{an estimate of the}} spillover effects of advertising. It is measured by the association between a firm's advertising investments and its competitors' market values or future profitability. Valuation benefits are defined by an estimate of the relation between the firm's own <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays</b> and its market value or future operating income. I use these proxies to explain firms' discretionary disclosure decisions and I find that firms, which experienced high proprietary costs (valuation benefits) from advertising during the mandatory disclosure period, are less (more) likely to disclose their advertising expenses in the discretionary disclosure period...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which U. S. {{advertisers}} use in-house rather than indepen-dent advertising agencies and examines inter-industry variation in such internalization. Contrary to the widely-held impression that use of an in-house advertising agency is more the exception than the rule, we find that vertical integration of advertising services is much more widespread than has hitherto been appreciated. Drawing on concepts from research on scale economies and transaction costs, we develop a set of hypotheses about differences in the expected depth of internalization across industries. We test these hypotheses in cross sectional analyses of data covering 69 two digit SIC industries at two points in time, 1991 and 1999. In both years, approximately half of advertisers of all sizes operated an in-house agency. Across industries, we find that the likelihood of internalization of at least some advertising services decreases as the size of <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays</b> increase but increases as advertising intensity and technological intensity increase and is greater for “creative ” industries...|$|R
40|$|This work {{develops}} a diffusion model which incorporates word-of-mouth and advertising effects for two firms introducing competing brands {{of a new}} durable product. The competition between the two firms is formulated as a two-player, nonzero sum Markovian game. The firms are assumed to behave noncooperatively in choosing their advertising strategies and the solution concept is a Nash noncooperative equilibrium. Optimal advertising policies for this stochastic closed-loop control problem are obtained via dynamic programming. Our results indicate that both firms will start with high <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays</b> which will get reduced {{as the number of}} adopters increases. This is similar to the result obtained previously for a monopolist. Further, we find that there is a significant value in being the first brand to the market, and the greater the intensity of word-of-mouth effects, the greater the value in being first. The first entrant advantage is due to the goodwill generated by its stock of previous adopters. This first entrant advantage can only be overcome if the second entrant enters with a superior brand which is more enthusiastically endorsed by its adopters. advertising, diffusion, competition...|$|R
40|$|The common {{perception}} {{appears to}} be that vertical integration of advertising services is more the exception than the rule in the U. S. advertising industry. This study investigates the extent of such outsourcing and examines inter-industry variation {{in the use of}} in-house rather than independent advertising agencies by U. S. advertisers. While the vast majority of large advertisers employ outside agencies, it comes as a surprise to find that when advertisers of all sizes are considered, about half operate some form of in-house agency. Internalization of advertising services is much more widespread than has hitherto been appreciated and varies widely across industries. To explain this variation, we draw on concepts from research on scale economies and transaction costs to develop a set of hypotheses which we test in cross sectional analyses of data covering 69 two digit SIC industries at two points in time, 1991 and 1999. Across industries, we find that the likelihood of internalization of advertising services decreases as the size of <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays</b> increase but increases as advertising intensity and technological intensity increase and is greater for "creative" industries.

40|$|AMS subject classification: 90 B 60, 90 B 50, 90 A 80. Strategic {{behaviour}} {{has long}} been a crucial issue for modern corporations. To maximize potential profits and market share, firms are more than willing to invest in sales promotion to boost long term manufacturing output. Knowing that the sales of the firm not only respond to own advertising budgets, but also depend upon rivals’ advertising strategies, oligopolistic firms form part, therefore of a continuous race with reference to non-price competition. Efficient use of investment resources is crucial for business operations and long term strategic success. This paper aims to investigate the key issue of optimization of strategic <b>advertising</b> <b>outlays.</b> By using mathematical modelling techniques, strategic linkages between rival companies are identified and advertising impacts explained. Since advertising influences can persist through time, our discussion extends to explore this fundamental point by constructing a more advanced model to examine into the problems of optimization over time. Empirical data is used to test the predictive power of these models and assess relative efficiencies. All in all, this paper intends to highlight the importance of continuous strategic advertising investment and consequently provides comprehensive insights into the impact of modern advertising functions over time...|$|R
