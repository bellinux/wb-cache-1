Since the film would be very visual, the director wanted audiences to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the images, {{and not have to}} rely on subtitles.

5|$|Heraclius was {{fortunately}} {{warned in}} time and managed to escape, chased by the Avars {{all the way to}} Constantinople. However, many members of his court, as well as an alleged 70,000 Thracian peasants who came to see their Emperor, were captured and killed by the Khagan's men. Despite this treachery, Heraclius was forced to give the Avars a subsidy of 200,000 solidi along with his illegitimate son John Athalarichos, his nephew Stephen, and the illegitimate son of the patrician Bonus as hostages in return for peace. This left him more <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> his war effort completely on the Persians.|$|E

Upon its release, Sticky & Sweet Tour received mixed reviews from critics, with one group criticizing it for being lifeless, while others praised the album for the performances. It became Madonna's 19th top-ten album on the Billboard 200, while reached the top of the charts in Greece, Hungary, Mexico and Portugal. The album also reached the top-ten in the charts of Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, but had failed to reach the top-ten in Germany and the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A social agent {{such as a}} {{receptionist}} or an escort robot en-counters challenges when communicating with people in open areas. The agent must know not to react to distracting acoustic and visual events {{and it needs to}} appropriately handle situations that include multiple hu-mans, being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on active interlocutors and appropriately shift attention based on the context. We describe a multiparty interac-tion agent that helps multiple users arrange a common activity. From the user study we conducted, we found that the agent can discrimi-nate between active and inactive interlocutors well by using the skeletal and azimuth information. Participants found the addressee much clearer when an animated talking head was used. ...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{recapture}} of Constantinople a {{few months}} later however, Michael VIII was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> his attention on building up his own fleet. In the early 1260s, the Byzantine navy was still weak, and depended still greatly on Genoese aid. Even so, the allies were not able to stand up to Venice in a direct confrontation, as evidenced by the defeat of a combined Byzantine–Genoese fleet of 48 ships by a much smaller Venetian fleet in 1263. Taking advantage of the Italians' preoccupation with the ongoing Venetian–Genoese war, by 1270 Michael's efforts had produced a strong navy of 80 ships, with several Latin privateers sailing under imperial colours. In the same year, a fleet of 24 galleys besieged the town of Oreos in Negroponte (Euboea), and defeated a Latin fleet of 20 galleys. This marked the first successful independent Byzantine naval operation and the beginning of an organized naval campaign in the Aegean that would continue throughout the 1270s and would result in the recapture, albeit briefly, of many islands from the Latins.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

5|$|Blow {{created the}} Thekla, Inc. {{team for the}} {{development}} and publication of The Witness. Since December 2009, Blow was working remotely with two additional full-time roles, one a 3D artist, and another as a technical programmer. By 2015, Blow stated there were about eight full-time members on his team, though had had ten to eleven people involved around 2011, {{and as many as}} fifteen at its peak. The Witness incorporates other artists and programmer's contributions in smaller roles, such as David Hellman, who had previously worked with Blow on Braids art design and worked on conceptualizing the design of The Witness. Other contributors include Eric Urquhart, who has provided 3-D concept artwork for the game, and Ignacio Castaño, who has developed a rendering system for the game's illumination and visual effects. Blow gives much credit to Orsolya Spanyol, a freshly-graduated graphic artist he hired around 2011, for transforming the original sparse imagery of the island to the more vivid scenery that was included in the final game. By diversifying work on the game, Blow has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> more of his time on the core game design, allowing his team to implement his vision, in contrast to the development of Braid where he also had to program much of the game himself.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed in {{his failure}} to make a {{breakthrough}} in the NBA, Parker turned to Europe to resurrect his basketball career, intending {{to return to the}} NBA after a good season with a European club. Eventually he moved to Israel in the 2000–01 season, where he was signed by the Israeli EuroLeague powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv. Initially, Parker and his wife were intimidated by the occasional bomb attacks in the city, but they soon settled in and Parker was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on his basketball career. Within his first season with his new club, he became one of their most pivotal players. Parker was signed to fill the void left by Doron Sheffer's retirement at the shooting guard position, but ended up featuring as a both scorer and play-maker for Maccabi. He immediately brought to the team his ability to score, rebound, block shots, and even entertain the crowds with slam dunks. In Parker's inaugural season, Maccabi won the Israeli domestic championship and the Israeli National Cup, as well as the FIBA SuproLeague Cup. He continued his fine form for the club in the 2001–02 season, averaging 16.4 points per game and 5.2 rebounds per game as Maccabi again won both domestic titles, and even reached the Euroleague 2001–02 Final Four.|$|E
5|$|If the Venetians were idle, the Ottomans were not: {{with the}} signing of the Peace of Vasvár in 1664, they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> their {{strength}} against Crete. Grand Vizier Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed initiated large preparations in the winter of 1665/66, and dispatched 9,000 men to bolster the Ottoman forces in Crete. An Ottoman peace proposal, which would have allowed Venice to keep Candia against an annual payment of tribute was rejected, and in May 1666, the Ottoman army, under the personal leadership of the Grand Vizier, departed from Thrace for southern Greece, whence it would embark for Crete during the winter. In February 1667, the Venetians received significant reinforcements from France and Savoy, totaling 21 warships and some 6,000 men, but, as in past years, disagreements among the leaders of the various contingents over precedence (France, the Papal States, Malta, Naples, Sicily contributed ships and men) hampered operations. Francesco Morosini, now again Captain General, sought to engage the Ottomans, but they avoided battle, and using their superior resources and bases, they steadily kept their forces on Crete supplied. The only allied success in 1667 was the repulsion of an Ottoman raid on Cerigo (Kythera).|$|E
