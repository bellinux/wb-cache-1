25|$|New liberals {{began to}} adapt the old {{language}} of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other, or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied. More positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> of success.|$|E

While ASIO is <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> employer, {{there has been some}} media comment of its apparent difficulty in attracting people from a Muslim or Middle Eastern background. Furthermore, ASIO has undergone a period of rapid growth with some 70% of its officers having joined since 2002, leading to what Paul O'Sullivan, Director-General of Security from 2005 to 2009, called 'an experience gap'.|$|E

25|$|The Civil War era {{also showed}} {{a spirit of}} sexual revolution.

Women acquired power they had not previously had in Spanish society, fighting at the front and doing heavy jobs, things that had been forbidden to them until then. Free love became popular, although some parents' distrust produced the creation of the revolutionary weddings, informal ceremonies in which the couples declared their status, and that could be annulled if both parties didn't want to continue their relationship.|$|E

25|$|Throughout this time, Bert Bell, {{co-owner}} of the Philadelphia Eagles, felt his team's lack of competitiveness on the field {{made it difficult for}} the Eagles to sell tickets and to be profitable. Compounding the Eagles' problems were players signed with teams that offered the most money, or if the money being equal, players chose to sign with the most prestigious teams at the time, who had established a winning tradition. As a result, the NFL was dominated by the Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Giants, and Redskins. Bell's inability to sign a desired prospect, Stan Kostka, in 1935, eventually led Bell to believe the only way for the NFL to have enduring success was for all teams to have <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> to sign eligible players. At a league meeting on May 18, 1935, Bell proposed a draft be instituted to enhance the possibility of competitive parity on the field in order to ensure the financial viability of all franchises. His proposal was adopted unanimously that day, although the first draft would not occur until the next off-season.|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{the episode}} satirizes American {{politics}} and includes several {{references to the}} 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries. For example, when Homer appears on Head Butt, the news ticker features headlines such as [...] "Gingrich looks forward to winning... his fourth wife", [...] "Rick Perry mistakenly signs order to execute himself", and [...] "Satan tweets support for Santorum". At {{one point in the}} episode, the character Ned Flanders comments that he supports Nugent [...] "as long as he isn’t a Mormon", which is a reference to Mitt Romney. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote in a review that Homer's political movement [...] "is clearly a parody of the Tea Party", noting that [...] "as with the teabags of the teabagger movement, people everywhere are moved to wear gravy boats on their heads [...]" [...] Childs further mentioned that a follower of Homer holds a sign that references the Occupy movement, which he thought was [...] "a token of the show’s desire to be <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> offender." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the complaints, Fox removed {{any mention}} of Catholicism from the scene, {{resulting}} in the line [...] "The church..." [...] Scully was reportedly furious with Fox's actions. In an interview in Los Angeles Times, Scully said, [...] "people can say hurtful things {{to each other about}} their weight, their race, their intelligence, their sexual preference, and that all seems up for grabs, but when you get into religion, some people get very nervous." [...] Marisa Guthrie of Boston Herald also criticized the network, describing it as [...] "caving in" [...] to the Catholic League's protests. She wrote, [...] "Hollywood has always been gun shy of controversy, but recent displays of self-censorship on the part of entertainment industry executives make us cringe [...] Granted Catholics, as a group have endured an ample amount of bashing, but The Simpsons is <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> offender." [...] Howard Rosenberg, a writer for Los Angeles Times, criticized Fox's actions as well. He argued that the network had a biased opinion towards Catholicism and that, had the scene mentioned a different religion, it would have been accepted. He also wrote, [...] "Given its famous flaunting of sleaze and death-defying motorcycle leaps, the big news here is that Fox has standards. Its latest production is Censors Who Kill Jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|By early 1918, British {{women who}} had {{attained}} the age of 30 were given {{the right to vote}} and hold office. Following the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, which enabled women to become members of the legal profession, Macmillan applied to Middle Temple as a pupil barrister. She was called to the bar on 28 January 1924 and in 1926 joined the Western Circuit, becoming only the second women to be elected to its Bar Mess. Between then and 1929 she acted as counsel for defence in the six cases in which she appeared on the Circuit, and she took 65 cases in the North London Session courts between 1927 and 1936. From 1929, she appeared at the Central Criminal Court in five cases for the prosecution, and one for defence [...] There are no records available for her civil cases. As she was studying for the bar, she co-founded the Open Door Council for the repeal of legal restraints on women. Macmillan worked to lift restrictions and so give women of all stations <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> in the workplace. NUWSS was re-organised in 1918 as the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, but Macmillan disagreed with the group's stance on protective legislation for women workers. In 1929, she co-founded a global group, the Open Door International for the Economic Emancipation of the Woman Worker—she served as president of this group until her death.|$|E

2500|$|Supporters of Proposition 209 {{contended that}} {{existing}} {{affirmative action programs}} led public employers and universities to reject applicants based on their race, and that Proposition 209 would [...] "restore and reconfirm the historic intention of the 1964 Civil Rights Act." [...] The basic and simple premise of Proposition 209 is that every individual has a right, and that right {{is not to be}} discriminated against, or granted a preference, based on their race or gender. [...] Since the number of available positions are limited, discriminating against or giving unearned preference to a person based solely, or even partially on race or gender deprives qualified applicants of all races <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> to succeed.

2500|$|A {{number of}} occupations became [...] "professionalized" [...] through the 19th and 20th centuries, gaining {{regulatory}} bodies, and passing laws or regulations requiring particular higher educational requirements. As women's access {{to higher education}} was often limited, this effectively restricted women's participation in these professionalizing occupations. For instance, women were completely forbidden access to Cambridge University until 1868, and were encumbered with a variety of restrictions until 1987 when the university adopted <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> policy. Numerous other institutions in the United States and Western Europe began opening their doors to women over the same period of time, but {{access to higher education}} remains a significant barrier to women's full participation in the workforce in developing countries.

There were no children, no servants, no fowls. The only other inmates of the house were a large man and a small boy; the first a lodger, the second a production of Mrs. Bardell's. The large man was always home precisely at ten o'clock at night, at which hour he regularly condensed himself into the limits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlour; and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master Bardell were exclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters.
