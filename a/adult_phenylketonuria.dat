40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Adult</b> <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) {{patients}} often {{reduce their}} intake of amino acid mixture (AAM) {{to less than}} the prescribed amounts. Effects of reduced AAM intake on nutrient supply were evaluated. METHODS Nutrient intake was calculated in 20 adult PKU patients based on a structured food record and complemented by laboratory assessment of nutritional status. Patients were classified into 2 groups, (A) regular AAM intake, or (B) AAM intake below calculated requirements. RESULTS Group B consumed {{a higher proportion of}} natural protein (60 ± 23 vs. 33 ± 12 %, p = 0. 002); however, the total protein intake was below the recommended amounts in 60 % of patients in group B versus 7 % in group A (p = 0. 03). Fat intake was higher in group B (39 ± 9 % of energy vs. 31 ± 6 %, p = 0. 03), mainly from saturated fats. Selenium, folate, and vitamin B 12 intake was below the recommended intake in group B. However, serum concentrations of these analytes remained within the normal range in both groups, although vitamin B 12 levels were lower in group B. Plasma tyrosine correlated with AAM intake, and hydroxyproline correlated with the amount of natural protein consumed. CONCLUSION Relaxed AAM intake resulted in insufficient nutrient supply, despite a compensatory increase in consumption of natural protein. Care needs to be taken to ensure adequate nutrition in adults with PKU...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite early dietary {{treatment}} phenylketonuria {{patients have}} lower IQ and poorer executive functions compared to healthy controls. Cognitive problems in phenylketonuria {{have often been}} associated with phenylalanine levels. The present study examined the cognitive profile and mental health in <b>adult</b> <b>phenylketonuria,</b> in relation to phenylalanine levels and tetrahydrobiopterin treatment. METHOD: Fifty-seven early treated adult patients with phenylketonuria and 57 healthy matched controls (18 - 40 years) performed IQ subtests and executive function tests from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks. They also completed the Adult Self-Report on mental health problems. Analyses of variance were performed to examine group differences. RESULTS: Patients with phenylketonuria had normal IQs although lower than controls. They performed poorer on working memory, inhibitory control, and sustained attention tasks. Patients reported Depressive and Avoidant Personality problems more frequently. Specifically, patients with childhood and lifetime phenylalanine >/= 360 mumol/L had poorer cognitive and mental health outcomes than controls. In a subset of patients, comparisons between patients on and off tetrahydrobiopterin showed that nontetrahydrobiopterin users (matched for childhood, pretreatment phenylalanine) were slower (on number of tasks) and reported more mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients had lower IQ and poorer executive functions than controls, resembling problems observed in younger patients with phenylketonuria, {{as well as more}} internalizing problems. Group differences and phenylalanine-outcome associations were smaller than those observed in younger populations. A subset of nontetrahydrobiopterin users, matched for childhood phenylalanine level, had a poorer outcome on some tests than tetrahydrobiopterin users, which might indicate an impact of tetrahydrobiopterin treatment beyond lowering phenylalanine. However, clinical relevance needs further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Recor...|$|E

40|$|<b>Adults</b> with <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) {{experience}} {{disturbances in}} mood. This study used {{qualitative and quantitative}} techniques to adapt the 65 -item Profile of Mood States (POMS) {{for the assessment of}} key mood domains in adults with PKU. First, cognitive interviews on 58 POMS items (excluding 7 Friendliness domain items) among 15 adults and adolescents (age ≥ 16 years) with PKU were conducted to eliminate items poorly understood or considered irrelevant to PKU; 17 items were removed. Next, the remaining POMS items were quantitatively examined (Mokken scaling and Rasch analysis) in 115 adult patients with PKU. An additional 21 items were removed iteratively, resulting in the 20 -item draft PKU-POMS. Finally, the psychometric properties of the draft PKU-POMS were examined. The instrument displayed strong psychometric properties (reliability, validity, and responsiveness) over 6 domains (Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Activity, Tiredness, and Confusion) and all items were well understood in the final cognitive interviews with 10 adults with PKU...|$|R
40|$|Content {{validity}} of the 18 -item Investigator-Rated Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale IV (I-ADHD RS-IV) with adult prompts was investigated using qualitative interviews of US clinicians who had prior experience rating <b>adults</b> with <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) using the I-ADHD RS-IV. Fourteen qualitative interviews were conducted to obtain key symptom experiences of adults with PKU and assessed the relevance, clarity, and administration of the I-ADHD RS-IV. Participants (n = 13, 92. 9 %) endorsed the inattention symptoms as key experiences by adults with PKU and endorsed the instrument as fit for purpose for adults with PKU. Participants generally reported low frequencies of occurrence for the 9 I-ADHD RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity items. Despite some clinicians’ concerns {{for the lack of}} patient self-awareness, the participants reported no difficulty selecting a rating on these items. This in-depth study of the content {{validity of}} the I-ADHD RS-IV provides evidence that this clinician-reported instrument captures the severity of important inattention symptoms in adults with PKU...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Increasing {{concurrent}} phenylalanine to “off-diet” {{levels in}} <b>adults</b> with <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) {{has been shown}} to lead to mood disturbances. However, the impact of controlled phenylalanine exposure across the developmental life span and mood stability remains questionable. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate correlations between lifetime and concurrent phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) with levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in young adults maintaining a continuously treated diet for PKU. Method: Eight young adults (6 females, 2 males) aged 15 to 25 years (mean = 19. 37, SD = 3. 62) recruited through the Royal Children's Hospital Brisbane, with early and continuously treated PKU completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, which was correlated with lifetime and concurrent measures of Phe, Tyr, and Phe-Tyr ratios. Results: There was a strong significant correlation between lifetime Phe and levels of anxiety and stress (p less than. 01). Greater Phe-to-Tyr blood ratios were indicative of increased depression and anxiety levels (p less than. 01). Conclusions: An interaction between biochemical regulation and depression, anxiety, and stress levels was present in young adults with continuously treated PKU who were actively attempting to maintain dietary control. Strong associations were present with lifetime levels, suggesting a developmental impact of PKU-related biochemical exposure and the emergence of mood disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Left untreated, {{phenylketonuria}} biochemically {{results in}} high phenylalanine concentrations {{in blood and}} tissues, and clinically especially in severe mental retardation. Treatment consists of severe dietary restriction of phenylalanine with more or less normal intellectual outcome as result when started early enough. It is unclear whether treatment for life is necessary. A clear relationship between plasma phenylalanine concentrations and cerebral outcome exists, but the precise pathophysiological mechanism is not understood. In studies in mice with phenylketonuria, the cerebral protein synthesis rate is decreased when compared to controls. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the protein synthesis rate in relation to the plasma phenylalanine concentrations in-vivo in patients with phenylketonuria by positron emission tomography brain studies after an intravenous L-[1 -(11) C]-tyrosine bolus. Results showed a significant negative relationship (R(2) = 0. 40, p < 0. 01) between plasma phenylalanine concentration and the cerebral protein synthesis rate in 19 patients with phenylketonuria. At increased plasma phenylalanine concentrations, i. e. above 600 - 800 mu mol/l, the cerebral protein synthesis rate is clearly decreased compared to lower phenylalanine concentrations. These data suggest that cerebral protein metabolism in untreated <b>adults</b> with <b>phenylketonuria</b> can be abnormal due to high plasma phenylalanine concentrations, Hence, we speculate that it is important to continue dietary treatment into adulthood, aiming at plasma phenylalanine concentration...|$|R
40|$|At {{separate}} institutions, pattern reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) {{were recorded}} in children and older patients with phenylketonuria and compared with MRI of the brain. In nine patients aged less than 14 years, who were still on a diet low in phenylalanine, VEPs were clearly abnormal in only one and the abnormalities seen on MRI were mild. In 27 patients aged 14 - 31 years VEPs were abnormal in more than 80 %, with significant reduction of amplitude and prolongation of latency despite the general absence of visual symptoms and abnormalities on routine neuro-ophthalmological examination. Among the older patients {{there was no significant}} correlation between VEP measures and plasma phenylalanine or tyrosine concentrations; neither was the incidence of VEP abnormalities dependent on whether or not the patients were still on a low phenylalanine diet. Some VEP amplitude measures were inversely correlated with the MRI lesion score, perhaps reflecting the severity of white matter abnormalities in the parieto-occipital region. In the older patients the amplitude of VEPs to stimulation of the central 8 degrees of the visual field was significantly correlated with IQ. The study confirms the high incidence of subclinical visual pathway involvement in older children and <b>adults</b> with <b>phenylketonuria,</b> and suggests the possibility of a link between the abnormal appearance of subcortical white matter on MRI and a physiological index of function of the CNS. As {{there was no evidence of}} general intellectual decline, it is suggested that the correlation between central field VEP amplitude and IQ may reflect abnormal development during infancy. Abnormalities on MRI, on the other hand, seem to be more closely related to current dietary state and phenylalanine concentration...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There are few centres which specialise in {{the care}} of adults with inborn errors of {{metabolism}} (IEM). To anticipate facilities and staffing needed at these centres, it is of interest to know the distribution of the different disorders. METHODS: A survey was distributed through the list-serve of the SSIEM Adult Metabolic Physicians group asking clinicians for number of patients with confirmed diagnoses, types of diagnoses and age at diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty-four adult centres responded to our survey with information on 6, 692 patients. Of those 6, 692 patients, 510 were excluded for diagnoses not within the IEM spectrum (e. g. bone dysplasias, hemochromatosis) or for age less than 16 years, leaving 6, 182 patients for final analysis. The most common diseases followed by the <b>adult</b> centres were <b>phenylketonuria</b> (20. 6 %), mitochondrial disorders (14 %) and lysosomal storage disorders (Fabry disease (8. 8 %), Gaucher disease (4. 2 %)). Amongst the disorders that can present with acute metabolic decompensation, the urea cycle disorders, specifically ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, were most common (2. 2 %), followed by glycogen storage disease type I (1. 5 %) and maple syrup urine disease (1. 1 %). Patients were frequently diagnosed as adults, particularly those with mitochondrial disease and lysosomal storage disorders. CONCLUSIONS: A wide spectrum of IEM are followed at adult centres. Specific knowledge of these disorders is needed to provide optimal care including up-to-date knowledge of treatments and ability to manage acute decompensation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} original data on median dietary intake of 18 amino acids from amino acid medical foods, glycomacropeptide medical foods, and natural foods based on 3 -day food records obtained from subjects with phenylketonuria who consumed low-phenylalanine diets {{in combination with}} amino acid medical foods and glycomacropeptide medical foods for 3 weeks each in a crossover design. The sample size of 30 subjects included 20 subjects with classical phenylketonuria and 10 with a milder or variant form of phenylketonuria. Results are presented for the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery; the tests were administered {{at the end of}} each 3 -week dietary treatment with amino acid medical foods and glycomacropeptide medical foods. The data are supplemental to our clinical trial, entitled “Glycomacropetide for nutritional management of phenylketonuria: a randomized, controlled, crossover trial, 2016 (1) and “Metabolomic changes demonstrate reduced bioavailability of tyrosine and altered metabolism of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway with ingestion of medical foods in phenylketonuria, 2017 (2).

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown a relationship between prenatal teratogenic exposure and impaired cognitive functioning. However, data regarding the long-term outcome of prenatal teratogenic exposure are minimal. The present study investigated the long-term neuropsychological functioning (specifically attention and memory) of adults prenatally exposed to alcohol or phenylalanine, and examined whether there was {{evidence to suggest that}} there are effects specific to individual teratogens. Using a battery of attention and memory measures the performance of 17 adults diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and 13 <b>adults</b> with Maternal <b>Phenylketonuria</b> Syndrome (MPKUS) was assessed. In order to identify the pattern of deficits associated with prenatal teratogenic exposure, an age and CA and IQ matched control group was assessed. Attention was broadly assessed using Mirsky et al. 's (1991) neuropsychological model of attention. The memory and learning tests administered included a number of well standardized measures of verbal learning, verbal and visual recall, delayed recall, and recognition. Paired comparisons between the FAS group and age and CA and IQ matched controls indicated a unique pattern of attention and memory deficits consistent with previous research with children and adolescents. Specifically, adult individuals with FAS appear to have deficits in acquisition of new material, delayed recall of verbal material and in response inhibition. Paired comparisons between the MPKUS group and CA and IQ matched controls indicated that the pattern of attention and memory deficits seen in adults with MPKUS is difficult to distinguish when the effect of IQ is removed. A randomized block design using IQ as the blocking variable and group (FAS, MPKUS, or Controls) as the treatment variable was utilized to examine {{the question of whether the}} two prenatal teratogen groups differ from one another and from Controls in terms of attention and memory ability. Ten blocks of three participants (FAS, MPKUS and Control) matched on IQ were formed. The randomized block analyses revealed few differences between the groups and failed to reveal a number of the differences found in the paired comparisons between the prenatal teratogen groups and the CA and IQ matched Control group. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Phenylketonuria (PKU) is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} {{caused by the}} deficiency of the enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase. Phenylalanine accumulation in brain causes cognitive impairment and behavioral problems, which can be prevented by dietary restriction of phenylalanine. People with PKU have to maintain a highly restrictive low protein diet throughout their entire life. PKU is typically diagnosed at birth through newborn screening. In order for a patient to reach their optimal IQ and health status, they need to maintain their blood phenylalanine (phe) level within the recommended range of 60 - 360 µmol/L. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate attitudes of <b>adults</b> diagnosed with <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) and how they relate to their actions of management therapy recommendations. Adults with PKU completed an online survey through Survey Monkey. After receiving consent via email, the survey link was sent to them so they completed it at their convenience. The study asked questions such as, how often they tested their blood phe level and compared that to how often their clinic recommends getting tested. Then subjects were asked on a scale of one to five (with five meaning they strongly agree) if they agreed that getting their blood phe level tested as often as their clinic recommends is important. From the data we gathered information about different management practices, the perceived importance of certain dietary management practices, and whether certain factors, such as relationships between patient and clinic influence dietary management. There was no set universal method for counting phe intake. While there are three main methods, the two that were used the most were by counting exactly using milligrams (mg) of phe and the other was an estimation of counting in grams of protein. It was also found that the relationship with the clinic may have an impact on dietary management. Patients who had a good relationship with their clinic were more likely to follow their daily protein restriction, test their blood phe level more often, and realize the importance of testing their blood phe level as often as their clinic recommends.

40|$|Background: Specialized <b>adult</b> care of <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) {{patients}} is of increasing importance. Adult outpatient clinics for inherited errors of metabolism {{can help to}} achieve this task, but experience is limited. Ten years after establishment of a coordinated transition process and specialised adult care for inherited metabolic diseases, adult PKU care was evaluated with respect to metabolic control, therapy satisfaction, life satisfaction, sociodemographic data, economical welfare as well as pregnancy outcome. Methods: All PKU patients transferred from paediatric to adult care between 2005 and 2015 were identified. A retrospective data analysis and a cross-sectional survey in a sub-cohort of 30 patients including a questionnaire for assessing quality of life (FLZm) were performed as a single-centre investigation at the metabolic department of the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney-U-test, t-test for independent samples, ANOVA and chi square test were used as appropriate. Results: 96 PKU patients (56 females/ 40 males; median age 32 years, range 18 – 62) were included. In the last 3 -year period, 81 % of the transferred patients still kept contact to the adult care centre. Metabolic control was stable over the evaluation period and dried blood phenylalanine concentrations mostly remained within the therapeutic range (median 673. 0 μmol/l, range 213. 0 – 1381. 1). Sociodemographic data, economical welfare and life satisfaction data were comparable to data from the general population. However, differences could be revealed when splitting the cohort according to time of diagnosis and to management during childhood. 83 % of the PKU adults {{were satisfied with the}} transition process and current adult care. 25 completed pregnancies were supervised; three newborns, born after unplanned pregnancy, showed characteristic symptoms of maternal PKU syndrome. Conclusions: Continuous care for adult PKU patients in a specialized outpatient clinic is successful, leading to good to satisfactory metabolic control and social outcomes. Uninterrupted good metabolic treatment throughout childhood and adolescence positively influences educational, professional and economic success in later life. Further effort in specialized paediatric and adult metabolic care is needed to prevent loss of follow-up and to support the recommended life-long treatment and/or care...|$|R
