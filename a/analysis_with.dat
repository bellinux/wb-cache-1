5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can {{be considered in the}} <b>analysis</b> <b>with</b> the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces {{allow for}} many {{elliptic}} partial differential equations to be formulated {{in a similar}} way, and the Lax–Milgram theorem is then a basic tool in their <b>analysis.</b> <b>With</b> suitable modifications, similar techniques {{can be applied to}} parabolic partial differential equations and certain hyperbolic partial differential equations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson) {{attempted}} to interpret and formalise Keynes's writings {{in terms of}} formal mathematical models. In what had {{become known as the}} neoclassical synthesis, they combined Keynesian <b>analysis</b> <b>with</b> neoclassical economics to produce neo-Keynesian economics, which came to dominate mainstream macroeconomic thought for the next 40 years.|$|E

5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} {{has proven}} to be the more complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic <b>analysis</b> <b>with</b> at least two generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods must be used instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{first met}} Sigmund Freud in 1919 {{when he asked}} Freud for a reading list for a seminar {{concerning}} sexology. It seems they left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own <b>analysis</b> <b>with</b> Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E
5|$|Russell replaces Mill's <b>analysis</b> <b>with</b> an {{examination}} of the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E

5|$|Limusaurus was {{originally}} {{described as a}} basal ceratosaurian, with both it and Elaphrosaurus being recovered as the most basal ceratosaurians in various phylogenetic analyses. However, subsequent research has placed it in the more derived group Abelisauroidea, specifically {{as a member of}} the Noasauridae. An analysis conducted in the study of multiple individuals of different ages found Limusaurus and Elaphrosaurus to group in the clade Elaphrosaurinae, within the family Nodosauridae. Nodosauridae was placed in a position outside Neoceratosauria, the group containing Ceratosaurus and Abelisauridae. The phylogenetics within Noasauridae, from the version of the <b>analysis</b> <b>with</b> separate specimens of Limusaurus, are shown below. It is notable that all the juvenile specimens grouped to the exclusion of adult specimens, showing that its anatomy changed significantly through growth.|$|E

One of the mission's main {{goals is to}} map the Martian landscape with its high-resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO {{played an important role}} in choosing the landing site of the Phoenix Lander, which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley. The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders. After <b>analysis</b> <b>with</b> HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. Mars Science Laboratory, a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.|$|E
