5|$|Written by Victor Pemberton. Concerned an omniscient octopoid eye {{in space}} which drew things toward it. Doctor Who {{producer}} Peter Bryant asked Pemberton to develop <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> shortly after completing Fury from the Deep in late 1967. When Bryant left Doctor Who in early 1969, Pemberton {{decided not to}} pursue the story, {{and it was not}} formally commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea,</b> you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E
5|$|During this {{conflict}} and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using {{a mixture of}} friendship and business acumen. Sullivan asked {{to be released from}} the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s. When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, {{for the first time in}} the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> and began work in May 1884.|$|E

25|$|According to Kasparov, Kramnik's victory {{stemmed from}} his {{superior}} opening preparation. He {{relied on the}} Berlin Defence of the Ruy Lopez to defuse Kasparov's 1.e4, an opening Kasparov was not prepared for. Kramnik also won Game 2 with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> for White in Kasparov's favourite Grünfeld Defence, which Kasparov never played again in the match.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> that {{is still}} at {{the early stages of}} {{development}} is that semantic memory, like perception, can be subdivided into types of visual information—color, size, form, and motion. Thompson-Schill (2003) found that the left or bilateral ventral temporal cortex appears to be involved in retrieval of knowledge of color and form, the left lateral temporal cortex in knowledge of motion, and the parietal cortex in knowledge of size.|$|E

Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.|$|E
25|$|Tartikoff {{felt there}} had been strong {{elements}} to Good Morning, Miss Bliss and wanted to try the show again with a different time slot and a different approach. The elements featuring the kids had been well-received, so Tartikoff wanted to drop Miss Bliss from the show altogether and focus entirely on the teens. NBC had been losing {{the high end of}} their animated audience, kids from ten to twelve, so the idea was to create a live action comedy to air on Saturday mornings, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{commuter}} ferry is not <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea.</b> Tradition {{has it that}} Native Americans regularly {{crossed the}} Hudson River at the point between what is now Beacon and Newburgh, long before Europeans arrived in America. In 1743, an “official” ferry was established when Alexander Colden received a royal charter from King George II to carry passengers and goods for profit. The right to operate ferries between Beacon and Newburgh was bestowed upon the Ramsdell family by the heirs of Alexander Colden. They ran the ferry through the Steamboat Era until 1956 when NYSBA took over ferry services.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, {{the social}} {{reformer}} Ebenezer Howard {{wrote a book}} entitled To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (later republished as Garden Cities of To-morrow), in which he advocated {{the construction of a}} new kind of town, summed up in his Three Magnets diagram as combining the advantages of cities and the countryside while eliminating their disadvantages. Industry would be kept separate from residential areas—such zoning was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> at the time—and trees and open spaces would prevail everywhere. His ideas were mocked in the press but struck a chord with many, especially members of the Arts and Crafts movement and the Quakers.|$|E
25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August Major John N. Reynolds, {{squadron}} commander, led {{a formation}} of squadron aircraft {{to try out}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> that had been suggested. His aircraft was carrying bombs, and over Thiaucourt-Regniéville, he attacked several enemy targets and three bombs registered direct hits. On {{the way back to}} Gondreville, four German Pfalz D.VIII scout aircraft attacked the formation, and the squadron lost one observer, Lt Baker was mortally wounded. Although taken to a hospital upon landing, he died of his wounds on the 15th. During the remainder of August, good flying weather kept the squadron quite busy, {{and by the end of}} the month, practically every square foot of the sector had been photographed. Aerial combat was engaged in nearly every mission, however no German enemy aircraft were shot down. The 91st was reinforced with additional pilots and observers in preparation for a rumored offensive at St Mihiel. An additional squadron, the 24th, moved into Gondreville on 23 August, and underwent training in the Salmson 2A2.|$|E

25|$|Each February, Tim Hortons holds a {{marketing}} campaign called Roll Up the Rim to Win. As of 2007, over 31 million prizes were distributed each year, including vehicles, televisions, and store products. Customers {{determine if they}} have won prizes by unrolling the rim on their paper cups when they have finished their drink, revealing the result underneath. Prizes are not distributed randomly country-wide; each of the company's distribution regions has distinct prize-winning odds. The idea for the campaign began in 1985 when Roger Wilson of one of Tim Hortons' supplier of cups, Lily Cup company, approached Tim Hortons with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> to increase their sales. Wilson explained his company had created a new cup design that allowed a message to be printed under the rim; the cup type cost {{no more than the}} current one and could enable a promotion, like a contest. Recognizing the opportunity to promote coffee in the normally weak sales period in the spring, the Roll Up the Rim to Win campaign was first held in 1986 when the biggest prize was a snackbox of Timbits. In 2008, over 88% of major prizes were redeemed.|$|E
25|$|Huygens {{generally}} {{wrote in}} French or Latin. While still {{a college student}} at Leiden he began a correspondence with the intelligencer Mersenne, who died quite soon afterwards in 1648. Mersenne wrote to Constantijn on his son's talent for mathematics, and flatteringly compared him to Archimedes (3 January 1647). The letters show the early interests of Huygens in mathematics. In October 1646 there is the suspension bridge, and the demonstration that a catenary is not a parabola. In 1647/8 they cover the claim of Grégoire de Saint-Vincent to squaring the circle; rectification of the ellipse; projectiles, and the vibrating string. Some of Mersenne's concerns at the time, such as the cycloid (he sent Evangelista Torricelli's treatise on the curve), the centre of oscillation, and the gravitational constant, were matters Huygens only took seriously {{towards the end of}} the 17th century. Mersenne had also written on musical theory. Huygens preferred meantone temperament; he innovated in 31 equal temperament, which was not itself <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> but known to Francisco de Salinas, using logarithms to investigate it further and show its close relation to the meantone system.|$|E
25|$|The {{quicksort}} algorithm {{was developed}} in 1959 by Tony Hoare while in the Soviet Union, as a visiting student at Moscow State University. At that time, Hoare worked in a project on machine translation for the National Physical Laboratory. As {{a part of the}} translation process, he needed to sort the words of Russian sentences prior to looking them up in a Russian-English dictionary that was already sorted in alphabetic order on magnetic tape. After recognizing that his first idea, insertion sort, would be slow, he quickly came up with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> that was Quicksort. He wrote a program in Mercury Autocode for the partition but couldn't write the program to account for the list of unsorted segments. On return to England, he was asked to write code for Shellsort as part of his new job. Hoare mentioned to his boss that he knew of a faster algorithm and his boss bet sixpence that he didn't. His boss ultimately accepted that he had lost the bet. Later, Hoare learned about ALGOL and its ability to do recursion that enabled him to publish the code in Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, the premier computer science journal of the time.|$|E
