500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just think they may want to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>high</b> and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E

Howard Rheingold (2000) describes these globalised societies as self-defined networks, which resemble {{what we do}} in real life. [...] "People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange pleasantries and argue, engage in intellectual discourse, conduct commerce, make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, create <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>high</b> art and a lot of idle talk" [...] (Rheingold cited in Slevin 2000: 91). For Sherry Turkle [...] "making the computer into a second self, finding a soul in the machine, can substitute for human relationships" [...] (Holmes 2005: 184). New media has the ability to connect like-minded others worldwide.|$|E

60|$|Before the {{scientist}} could conclude his sentence, another and more impatient summons sounded from without; someone with swishing skirts was marshalled hurriedly down the corridor, {{and the door}} opened on a young girl, decently dressed but disordered and red-hot with haste.

60|$|They came forth at last in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>high</b> {{table-land}} of snow, where {{stood the}} last peaks of snow like the heart petals {{of an open}} rose. In {{the midst of the}} last deserted valleys of heaven stood a lonely building with brown wooden walls and white heavy roof, deep and deserted in the waste of snow, like a dream. It stood like a rock that had rolled down from the last steep slopes, a rock that had taken the form of a house, and was now half-buried. It was unbelievable that one could live there uncrushed by all this terrible waste of whiteness and silence and clear, upper, ringing cold.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, sir, look {{along your}} arm. You see you are {{pointing}} very nearly at {{the centre of}} the patch. You are just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>high.</b> Now try it with your left. There, you see, you are not quite so accurate this time--you are six inches {{to the left of the}} patch, and nearly a foot high. Remember that it's always better to aim a little low than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>high,</b> for the tendency of the hand in the act of pulling the trigger is to raise the muzzle. Now, sir, try that half a dozen times, using the hands alternately. Very good! Now take this empty pistol--no, don't hold it like that! Not one man in twenty, ay, not one in a hundred, holds a pistol right, they always want to get the first finger on the trigger. Now, you want the first finger to point with, the second finger is quite as good to pull with, in fact better, for going straight, as it does, with the arm, there is less tendency to throw up the muzzle. Now take it like this; you see my forefinger lies along in the line of the barrel, that is the really important point. Get into the way of always grasping your pistol so that the first finger is in an exact line with the barrel, then, you see, just as your finger naturally follows your eye and points at the spot, so your pistol must be in the same line. It is best to have the middle and third fingers both on the trigger, and the little finger and thumb alone grasping the butt.|$|E
6000|$|It {{may be as}} well to say at {{once that}} the house was all that an hotel ought to be, excepting, perhaps, that the prices were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>high.</b> The two sitting-rooms and the two bedrooms--with the maid's room, which had also been taken--did seem to be very heavy to Rachel, who knew down to a shilling--or rather, to a dollar, as she would have said--how much her father had in his pocket. Indefinite {{promises}} of great wealth had been also made to herself; but according to a scale suggested by Mr. Moss, a pound a night, out of which she would have to keep herself, was the remuneration immediately promised. Then a sudden thought struck Miss O'Mahony. They were still standing discussing the price in one of the sitting-rooms, and Mr. Moss was also there. [...] "Father," [...] she said, [...] "I'm sure that Frank would not approve." ...|$|E
60|$|This adopted niece was {{no child}} {{when she was}} thus placed under her aunt's charge. She was already fifteen, and though she was young-looking for her age,--having none of that {{precocious}} air of womanhood which some girls have assumed by that time,--she was a strong healthy well-grown lass, standing stoutly on her legs, with her head well balanced, with a straight back, and well-formed though not slender waist. She was sharp about the shoulders and elbows, as girls are--or should be--at that age; {{and her face was}} not formed into any definite shape of beauty, or its reverse. But her eyes were bright--as were those of all the Mackenzies--and her mouth was not the mouth of a fool. If her cheek-bones were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>high,</b> and the lower part of her face somewhat angular, those peculiarities were probably not distasteful to the eyes of her aunt.|$|E
