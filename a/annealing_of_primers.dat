The former is considered as source information and the latter destination information. An information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity of this information transfer process and thus a measure <b>of</b> similarity between <b>primer</b> and potential annealing site on template.

PCR {{can be used for}} gene cloning and manipulation, gene mutagenesis, DNA sequencing, forensic DNA typing and amplification of ancient DNA. Briefly, the principle is as follows. Short oligonucleotide primers are annealed to denatured DNA by using hybridization conditions ensuring that only primers with desired sequences will anneal. Two primers are complementary to the two 3 ' ends of DNA segment to be amplified, additionally; noncomplementary sequences at 5 ' ends such as a sequence to encode for restriction endonuclease cleavage can be added. Primers are extended using a DNA polymerase and the 4 -deoxynucleotide triphosphates.

It is a significant property of wheat grains and relates to milling quality and end product quality. Grain hardness is caused by the presence of puroindoline genes (Pina and Pinb). A collection of 25 genotypes of wheat with unusual grain colour (blue aleurone, purple and white pericarp, yellow endosperm) was studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diversity within Pina and Pinb (alleles: Pina-D 1 a, Pina-D 1 b, Pinb-D 1 a, Pinb- -D 1 b, Pinb-D 1 c and Pinb-D 1 d).

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis is}} presented with experimental confirmation to conclusively demonstrate {{the critical role}} that annealing plays in efficient PCR amplification of GC-rich templates. The analysis {{is focused on the}} <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>primers</b> at alternative binding sites (competitive annealing) and the main result is a quantitative expression of the efficiency (η) of annealing as a function of temperature (TA), annealing period (tA), and template composition. The optimal efficiency lies in a narrow region of TA and tA for GC-rich templates and a much broader region for normal GC templates. To confirm the theoretical findings, the following genes have been PCR amplified from human cDNA template: ARX and HBB (with 78. 72 % and 52. 99 % GC, respectively). Theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Optimum annealing times for GC-rich genes lie in the range of 3 – 6 s and depend on annealing temperature. Annealing times greater than 10 s yield smeared PCR amplified products. The non-GC-rich gene did not exhibit this sensitivity to annealing times. Theory and experimental results show that shorter annealing times are not only sufficient but can actually aid in more efficient PCR amplification of GC-rich templates...|$|E

These sequences were 95 % to 96 % homologous. Based on this nucleotide sequence similarity, PCR primers for CFTR exon 9 can potentially anneal with other homologous sequences in the human genome. Sequence alignment analysis of the CFTR exon 9 homologous sequences revealed that five registered mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database {{may be due to}} the undesired <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>primers</b> to a homologous sequence, resulting in inappropriate PCR amplification.

Material and Methods: In this study kidney stones from 52 patients were submitted to direct examination by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) after manual fracture and 27 calculi were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (E-MEM) and Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) for eight weeks at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 atmosphere. Twenty-seven powdered and demineralized stones were suspended in sterile PBS, filtered through 0. 22 m-pore-size sterile filters Millex (Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) and submitted to DNA extraction (Quiagen-Brazil). Platinum PCR SuperMIX (GIBCO-BRL), primers (Invitrogen), and Ultra Pure Water (Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, MD) were used for PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), which was generally conducted for 30 or 35 cycles with <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>primers</b> for 40 sec at 55 °C and extension for 1 min at 72 °C. Results: In 36 out 52 (69 %) kidney stones it was detected the presence of biofilm coating the mineral surface of the stone when examined by SEM, consisting of coccoid particles, isolated or clustered, with diameter of 500 nm or less. Eleven out 27 (41 %) kidney stone cultures produced white-colored sediment {{on the bottom of the}} tubes after eight-week incubation, revealing tiny structures similar to those observed directly by SEM. These structures were similar in size and morphology to spherical apatite particles previously observed in human kidney stones and named as nanobacteria (NB). No PCR products were observed in the samples. Conclusion: We found a strong correlation between renal stones and calcifying nanoparticles (CNP) in this study and these results open a new insight on this area to explore the etiology of stone formation. Whether NB/CNP are truly microorganisms or self-propagating mineral compounds is still controversial and its contribution, if any, in apatite nucleation and crystal growth remains uncertain...|$|E

RHA {{is a member}} of the DExH subclass of RNA helicases that uniquely contains two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) at its N terminus. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the interaction of RHA with HIV- 1 RNA both in vitro, using fluorescence polarization, and during viral replication, using an RNA-protein coprecipitation assay. In vitro, RHA binds to all the isolated regions of the HIV- 1 RNA genome tested, withKd (equilibrium dissociation constant) values ranging from 44 to 178 nM. In contrast, during viral replication, RNA-pro-tein coprecipitation assays detected only a major interaction of RHAwith the 5 =-untranslated region (5 =-UTR) and a minor in-teraction with the Rev response element (RRE) of HIV- 1 RNA. Since RHA does not associate well with all the highly structured regions of HIV- 1 RNA tested in vivo, the results suggest that other viral or cellular factors not present in vitromay modulate the direct interaction of RHAwith HIV- 1 RNA during virus replication. Nevertheless, a role for duplex RNA as a target for RHA binding in vivo is suggested by the fact that the deletion of either one or both dsRBDs eliminates the in vivo interaction of RHA with HIV- 1 RNA. Furthermore, these mutant RHAs do not promote the in vivo <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> tRNA 3 Lys to viral RNA, nor are they packaged into virions, demonstrating that the dsRBDs are essential for the role of RHA in HIV- 1 replication...|$|R

At its amino terminus are two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) that are essential for RHA-viral RNA interaction. Linking the dsRBDs to the core helicase domain is a linker region containing 6 predicted helices. Working in vitro with purified mutant RHAs containing deletions of individual helices reveals that this region may regulate the enzyme's helicase activity, since deletion of helix 2 or 3 reduces the rate of unwinding RNA by RHA. The biological significance of this finding was then examined during HIV- 1 production. Deletions in the linker region do not significantly affect either RHA-HIV- 1 RNA interaction in vivo or the incorporation of mutant RHAs into progeny virions. While the partial reduction in helicase activity of mutant RHA containing a deletion of helices 2 or 3 does not reduce the ability of RHA to stimulate viral RNA synthesis, the promotion <b>of</b> tRNA(Lys 3) <b>annealing</b> to viral RNA is blocked. In contrast, deletion of helices 4 or 5 {{does not affect the}} ability of RHA to promote tRNA(Lys 3) annealing, but reduces its ability to stimulate viral RNA synthesis. Additionally, RHA stimulation of viral RNA synthesis results in an increased ratio of unspliced to spliced viral RNA, and this increase is not inhibited by deletions in the linker region, nor is the pattern of splicing changed within the ∼ 4. 0 kb or ∼ 1. 8 kb HIV- 1 RNA classes, suggesting that RHA's effect on suppressing splicing is confined mainly to the first 5 '-splice donor site. Overall, the differential responses to the mutations in the linker region of RHA reveal that RHA participates in HIV- 1 RNA metabolism by multiple distinct mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Designing {{oligonucleotide}} primers {{is a crucial}} step for successful molecular biology experiments that {{require the use of}} the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

In the extension step, DNA polymerase extends the primers to produce DNA molecules that correspond to the region bracketed by the primers (the amplicons). All of these steps are temperature sensitive, and the common choice of temperatures is 94 degrees C, 60 degrees C, and 70 degrees C, respectively. Poorly designed primers may lead to no amplification product or additional undesired amplified fragments. The goals <b>of</b> <b>primer</b> design include good primer specificity, high annealing efficiency, appropriate melting temperature, proper GC content, and the prevention <b>of</b> <b>primer</b> hairpins or primer dimers...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella serovars {{show their}} diverse effects by joining the {{gastrointestinal}} epithelia. The infectious trait of this bacterium depends on colonization in GI epithelial surfaces. Fimbirae play the main {{role in this}} junction. Three kinds of fimbrial genes are more important and responsible for the pathogenecity and the attachment of Salmonella enteritidis to intestinal epithelium (sef 14, 17, 21). Therefore, researchers have attempted to study the significance of fimbriae genes by the molecular method. In first of all, the molecular method has to be optimized for investigating {{the presence of these}} genes in the confirmed isolates of S. enteritidis. About 45 isolates of S. enteritidis collected from 60 diarrheic feces of both livestock and avian population with clinical sign of diarrhea were considered. In order to trace the most important fimbrial genes, the multiplex PCR method was designed and optimized. The optimal <b>primers,</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>primers</b> and concentration <b>of</b> DNA template, MgCl 2 and Taq DNA polymerase were determined...|$|R
40|$|A typical PCR cycle {{includes}} an extension step at 72 C after denaturation of double-stranded DNA and <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> oligo-nucleotide <b>primers.</b> At this temperature the thermostable poly-merase replicates the DNA at an optimal rate {{that depends on}} the buffer and nature of the DNA template (1). Although the sizes of the fragments that can be amplified have been generally limited to < 5 kb (2), recent reports have shown that a blend of two polymerases (Taq + Pfu) allows replication and amplification of much larger fragments, including a 42 kb sequence from the bacteriophage λ genome (long PCR) (3, 4). This ability to amplify genomic DNA in vitro is of particular importance to studies of Plasmodium falciparum, as large DNA fragments from this malaria parasite are generally unstable in Escherichia coli (5). A common finding with P. falciparum DNA, however, is that even small fragments (< 2 kb) can be difficult or impossible to amplif...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of {{mutations}} in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) nucleocapsid (NC) sequence on tRNA 3 Lys genomic placement, i. e., the in vivo placement <b>of</b> <b>primer</b> tRNA 3 Lys on the HIV- 1 primer binding site (PBS). HIV- 1 produced from COS cells transfected with wild-type or mutant proviral DNA {{was used in this}} study. We have found that mutations in the amino acid sequences flanking the first Cys-His box in the NC sequence produce the maximum inhibition of genomic placement. A similar finding was obtained when the NC-facilitated <b>annealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>primer</b> tRNA 3 Lys to the HIV PBS in vitro was studied. However, since the genomic placement of tRNA 3 Lys occurs independently of precursor protein processing, the NC mutations studied here have probably exerted their effect through {{one or both of the}} precursor proteins, Pr 55 gag and/or Pr 160 gag-pol. One mutation in the linker region between the two Cys-His boxes, P 31 L, prevented packaging of both Pr 160 gag-pol and tRNA 3 Lys and prevented the genomic placement of tRNA 3 Lys. Both packaging and genomic placement were rescued by cotransfection with a plasmid coding for wild-type Pr 160 gag-pol. For other linker mutations [R 7 R 10 K 11 S, R 32 G, and S 3 (32 - 34) ], packaging of Pr 160 gag-pol and tRNA 3 Lys was not affected, but genomic placement was, and placement could not be rescued by cotransfection with plasmids coding for either Pr 55 gag or Pr 160 gag-pol. After placement, the initiation of reverse transcription within extracellular virions is characterized by a 2 -base DNA extension of the placed tRNA 3 Lys. This process requires precursor processing, and those NC mutations which showed the most inhibition of initiation were in either of the two NC Cys-His boxes. Destabilization of a U 5 stem-A-rich loop immediately upstream of the PBS (through deletion of four consecutive A’s in the loop) did not affect the in vivo genomic placement of tRNA 3 Lys but resulted in the presence in the extracellular virus of longer cDNA extensions of tRNA 3 Lys, with a corresponding decrease in the presence of unextended and 2 -base-extended tRNA 3 Lys...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the work}} was, using the {{database}} «The Arabidopsis Information Resource» TAIR, to select 12 SSLP-markers distributed along the Arabidopsis chromosomes and chromosome arms, to optimize the conditions of amplification of each fragment and for simultaneous amplification of several fragments. For identification of A. thaliana ecotypes and their hybrid, the SSLP sequences were used. These DNA markers are highly polymorphic in Arabidopsis and easy to use. Using this database, the primers were selected for 12 SSLP-markers distributed along all chromosomes and their arms. A. thaliana ecotypes Columbia and Landsberg erecta were used. The experiments revealed that two-stage PCR using two <b>annealing</b> temperatures <b>of</b> <b>primers</b> in each cycle allows efficient amplification of all the fragments considered. The conditions for carrying out two multiplex PCR, each of which allows the two fragments were amplified and a single multiplex PCR allowing three markers for amplification were defined. The developed system of DNA markers {{can be used to}} study the behavior and inheritance of each chromosome of maternal and paternal genomes of Arabidopsis hybrids and enables quick and efficient genetic analysis...|$|R
