5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} {{would have created}} a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form <b>and</b> <b>float</b> into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E
5|$|The first European American {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, {{and the first}} sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a means of transportation. Some settlers would harvest timber <b>and</b> <b>float</b> it downstream once a year to make money for items they could not produce themselves, but by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding spars for ships and timber for buildings. Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were cut for their wood and their bark, which contained tannins used in tanning leather.|$|E

5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft <b>and</b> <b>float</b> on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff <b>and</b> <b>float</b> back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry <b>and</b> <b>float</b> into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They {{knock on the}} door of a student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{brakes on}} the RS4 are of two-piece construction. The cast iron discs are cross-drilled and radially ventilated <b>and</b> <b>float</b> on aluminium alloy disc hubs.

25|$|In {{the period}} between the World Wars, the 32nd Division was largely a paper unit. During 1937 and 1938, the 107th Engineer Battalion trained at Camp Grayling in Michigan, with {{emphasis}} on boat drills <b>and</b> <b>float</b> bridging. The Regiment was short of men, had no vehicles, and what equipment it had was of World War I vintage.|$|E
25|$|The {{starboard}} wingtip was {{the first}} to make impact with the water, severing the right wing between the number 3 and 4 engines.

25|$|Information: One {{traditional}} custom to {{mark the}} end of the Bon Festival. Small paper lanterns containing a burning flame are either set afloat to a river, lake or sea or they are let go <b>and</b> <b>float</b> away into the night.

25|$|After that it {{came back}} for while to Rochester, where {{it was used to}} {{investigate}} cooling of the Kestrel engine. At this time it was flying with a tall pillar radiator between fuselage <b>and</b> <b>float.</b> In October the float was modified, and later that month six flights were made between Lympne airfield (land) and the Medway (water) in a total of 90 minutes. In December it returned to Felixstowe, where it served as an engine and cooling system test-bed.|$|E

25|$|The factory used {{a system}} of metal cans filled with water that were lowered into a tank filled with a calcium {{chloride}} brine solution. The brine solution was cooled by coils within the tanks, which were filled with a liquid ammonia refrigerant. After ice formed in the cans, they were placed in a thawing tank, after which the ice would separate from the cans <b>and</b> <b>float</b> to the top. The ice was then crushed and delivered to trawlers at Grimsby's seaport.|$|E

HeliJet <b>and</b> <b>float</b> plane companies operate scheduled air service from Vancouver harbour and YVR south terminal. The city is also served by two BC Ferry terminals.
