40|$|Background: Numerous {{individual}} characteristics {{have been found}} to be associated with rates of ob-taining flu shots. This study creates a predictive model that assesses the relative impact of each of these factors on increasing rates of flu shots in a population. Methods: The Medicare beneficiary survey from 1998 and 1999 was used. Sixteen factors present in 1998 were compared between subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots. Significant factors were then used in a logistic regression to predict the probability of receiving a flu shot in 1998 and 1999. Results: Seven demographic and 7 health status measures were significantly different between sub-jects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots in 1998. Logistic regression showed that twelve of these variables were associated with a subject receiving a flu shot in 1998 and explained 11. 4 % of the vari-ability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. For the following year, 1999, 7 measures were significantly associated with receiving a flu shot and explained 64 % of the variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. One variable, if the subject had received a flu shot in 1998, was highly predic-tive of a subject receiving a flu shot in 1999, explaining 63 % of the observed variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot in 1999...|$|R

500|$|The {{producers}} intended Cheers to be {{a comedy}} about the bar itself, but, as Burrows claimed, the [...] "Sam and Diane" [...] romance predominated {{the show for}} five years and, as he hypothesized, {{would have made the}} bar more of a minor role and more irrelevant if Shelley Long had not left the show as Diane Chambers in this episode. With Long leaving the series, the producers made plans to revamp the show with the bar as a central setting, as originally intended, and then they credited Long's departure for saving the series from cancellation. After years of writing Sam as a [...] "straight man", especially to Diane, the writers would transform Sam into becoming more [...] "carefree" [...] and a [...] "goof-off" [...] in season six. The creators, in February 1987, decided to find a female lead replacement whose hair is not blonde <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not resemble Shelley Long. Brunette-haired Kirstie Alley debuts as Rebecca Howe in the next episode, [...] "Home Is the Sailor" [...] (1987).|$|E

2500|$|According to aggadic {{passages}} in the Talmud, God judges who has followed His commandments <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not {{and to what}} extent.

2500|$|Critics of [...] "women's literature" [...] {{considered}} some {{of these}} strengths to be weaknesses.

2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist.

I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E
2500|$|The DSM-IV-TR {{criteria}} {{was criticized}} simultaneously for being over-inclusive, {{as well as}} under-inclusive. Though most researchers distinguish between child molesters and pedophiles, Studer and Aylwin argue that the DSM criteria are over-inclusive because all acts of child molestation warrant the diagnosis. A child molester satisfies criteria A because of the behavior involving sexual activity with prepubescent children and criteria B because the individual has acted on those urges. Furthermore, they argue that it also is under-inclusive {{in the case of}} individuals who do not act upon it and are not distressed by it. The latter point has also been made by several other researchers who have remarked that a so-called [...] "contented pedophile"—an individual who fantasizes about having sex with a child and masturbates to these fantasies, but does not commit child sexual abuse, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not feel subjectively distressed afterward—does not meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia, because this person does not meet Criterion B. A large-scale survey about usage of different classification systems showed that the DSM classification is only rarely used. As an explanation, it was suggested that the under-inclusiveness, as well as a lack of validity, reliability and clarity might have led to the rejection of the DSM classification.|$|E

But God knows the hearts and thoughts of each and every person, knows <b>who</b> sinned <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not, <b>and</b> knows <b>who</b> rebelled <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to identify the effect of doing sports on the aggressiveness levels of the high school students. The aggression levels of the students are compared in point of their genders, whether doing sports or not, being competitive, male students either doing sports or not, female students either doing sports or not. Data collection instrument used in this study is “Aggression Scale” developed by Tuzgöl (1998). The sample of the research has been formed with 723 students (327 female, 396 male) from the Anatolian High Schools and Science High Schools that are under management of the Aydın Provincial Directory of Education and in the boundaries of the provincial center. In the evaluation of the data and calculation of the values the SPSS 16. 0 Statistical Package Program has been used. According to normality testing the Mann-Whitney U test is used among the nonparametric tests. The result is that the aggression levels of the female students are significantly higher than the male students’ (P≤ 0, 05). Also statistically, there is not found any meaningful difference on the comparisons between the aggression levels of the students <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not do sports, sporting students <b>who</b> are competitive <b>and</b> <b>who</b> are not competitive, male students <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not do sports, female students <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not do sports...|$|R
