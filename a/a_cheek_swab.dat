50|$|The {{identification}} of the necessary genotype is carried out {{by means of a}} blood analysis or <b>a</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>swab.</b> Subsequently, the DNA is analyzed in different ways.A common way to study the genetic data is the so-called “candidate gene approach” when one possible risk gene is identified. After experiments on cell cultures, animals or humans scientists can establish a positive or negative correlation between the expression of this candidate gene and nutritional aspects.Another popular scientific method is a genome-wide association study which also leads to the {{identification of}} relevant gene variants.In particular, nutrigenetic analyses are based on the effect of nutritional components on the genome, proteome, metabolome and transcriptome.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of genetic fingerprinting {{in the late}} 20th century means that if cell samples from <b>a</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>swab</b> are collected from service personnel prior to deployment to a combat zone, identity can be established using even a small fragment of human remains. Although {{it is possible to}} take genetic samples from a close relative of the missing person, it is preferable to collect such samples directly from the subjects themselves. It is a fact of warfare that some combatants are likely to go missing in action and never be found. However, by wearing ID tags and using modern technology the numbers involved can be considerably reduced. In addition to the obvious military advantages, conclusively identifying the remains of missing service personnel is highly beneficial to the surviving relatives. Having positive identification makes it somewhat easier {{to come to terms with}} their loss and move on with their lives. Otherwise, some relatives may suspect that the missing person is still alive somewhere and may return someday. However, many of these identifying procedures are not typically used for combatants who are members of militias, mercenary armies, insurrections, and other irregular forces.|$|E

40|$|Background: Heterogeneous {{mosquito}} biting {{results in}} different individuals {{in a population}} receiving an uneven number of bites. This is a feature of many vector-borne disease systems that, if understood, could guide preventative control efforts toward individuals who are expected to contribute most to pathogen transmission. We aimed to characterize factors determining biting patterns of Aedes aegypti, the principal mosquito vector of dengue virus. Methodology/Principal Findings: Engorged female Ae. aegypti and human <b>cheek</b> <b>swabs</b> were collected from 19 houses in Iquitos, Peru.

40|$|The {{intertwined}} genealogies of racialization and medicalization are mutating once more, {{with the}} much heralded arrival of personal genomics. A proliferation of commercial organizations now offer web-based services that, {{on the basis}} of an analysis of a DNA sample from <b>a</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>swab</b> and at the cost of a few hundred dollars, promise to scan millions of variations in ‘my genome’ and to tell me where my ancestors came from, to compare my genome with others, and to enable me to calculate my risk for dozens of diseases and conditions from age-related macular degeneration, through Alzheimer’s disease and prostate cancer, to restless legs. These new forms of genetic information arise in part from a crisis in genomic medicine, combined with a radical reduction in the costs of gene sequencing. They are linked to a new form of thinking about the genomic bases of disease that link ancestry and medicine in new ways.

40|$|Objectives: Catechol-O-methyltransferase plays {{a central}} role in the {{metabolism}} of biogenic amines such as norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. Functional studies have demonstrated a dose relationship between Val 158 Met genotypes and catechol-O-methyltransferase activity. Compared with the Val 158 Val genotype, the Val 158 Met and Met 158 Met genotypes result in two- and four-fold reductions in catechol-O-methyltransferase activity, respectively. Two recent reports have observed the association between the Met 158 Met genotype and risk of anxiety in adult populations. We examined the association between the Val 158 Met genotypes and propensity to anxiety across adolescence. Methods: Participants were drawn from an eight-wave study of the mental and behavioural health of over 2000 young Australians followed from 14 to 24 years of age (Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study, 1992 to present). DNA was received from 962 participants using <b>a</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>swab</b> collection method. Results: The odds of reporting persistent episodic anxiety (phobic avoidance, panic attacks) were doubled among carriers of the Met 158 Met genotype (odds ratio 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 - 3. 4, P= 0. 014). A dose relationship between additional copies of the Met 158 allele and persistent episodic anxiety was also observed (1. 5, 1. 1 - 1. 94, P= 0. 007). Stratification by sex showed that the risk effect of the Met 158 allele was among females only. No association was observed for measures of neuroticism, persistent generalized anxiety, or a composite measure of psychiatric distress. Conclusion: These data replicate previous findings suggesting association between the Val 158 Met polymorphism and specific expressions of anxiety among females. <br /...|$|E
