The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> local residents came to its defense.

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> coins {{have been found to}} show that he was indeed a historical figure.

5|$|The {{next few}} months were spent on {{political}} maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. Jaruzelski barely won {{the vote in the}} National Assembly presidential election of 19 July 1989, even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong.

5|$|The railway {{never had}} a timetable, and {{operated}} according to demand. Whenever one station had <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> passengers the driver signalled to the other station {{that he was about}} to depart, and the trains from both stations would set off simultaneously, passing at the halfway crossing loop. The journey took approximately five minutes. Outside of times of peak demand the full-length trains were generally not used, and the trains used split into their two-car sections. There was no depot: trains were stabled in the lower section of the tunnel.|$|E

30|$|SLG [7] argued that, {{while there}} are <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> {{traceroute}} servers, the path between landmark and target IP connected through the nearest common routers can represent the direct path between them. While estimating the relative delay between the landmark and target, {{the link between the}} two connected by a nearest common router is seen as the real link between them. If the target and landmark are terminal nodes in the network, or very close to the terminal nodes, the corresponding network status and material of those links are similar. Therefore, for those links that are hard to find a fixed linear relationship between delay and distance, we can still think that the delay is proportional to distance.|$|R
5|$|Any Croatian citizen {{over age}} 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation {{on the number of}} endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{more than}} 340 of the village's 1,830 {{residents}} {{served in the}} United States Armed Forces. The Hook and Ladder Company waived fees and dues for those enlisted from 1941 onward. Such <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> firefighters was serving the armed forces that the village requested volunteers ages 16–18 to join the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department; at least nine served on active duty {{during the war and}} had the ability to excuse themselves from school (which was then located adjacent to Law Memorial Park) if the fire siren went off. Also during the war, in 1944, the department received a trailer-type pump unit with a 500-gallon pump, hose, nozzle, ladders, and other tools. It was loaned to the village by the Office of Civil Defense and was an auxiliary to the existing equipment. One year later, Briarcliff High School graduate and Briarcliff Fire Company lieutenant Sgt. Arthur J. Quinn, Jr. of the 45th Division was killed in action in Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Garran {{published}} The Coming Commonwealth, {{an influential}} {{book on the}} history of the Federation movement and the debate over the 1891 draft of the Constitution of Australia. The book was based on material he prepared for a course on federalism and federal systems of government, which he had planned to give at the University of Sydney, but which failed to attract <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> students. Nevertheless, the book was both unique and popular, as one of the few books on the topic at the time, with the first edition quickly selling out. Soon after its publication the Premier of New South Wales George Reid, who had been elected as a New South Wales delegate to the 1897–1898 Constitutional Convention, invited Garran to be his secretary. At the Convention, Reid appointed him secretary of the Drafting Committee, at Barton's request; he was also a member of the Press Committee.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper tackles {{the stroke}} {{recovery}} problem, {{which is a}} typical ill-posed reverse problem, by an instance-based method. The basic idea of the instance-based stroke re-covery is {{to refer to the}} drawing order of a similar instance. The instance-based method has a strong merit that it can deal with multi-stroke characters and other complex characters without any special consideration. However, it requires <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> instances to cover those various characters. As an initial trial of the instance-based stroke recovery method, this paper describes the principle of the method and then provides several experimental results. The experimental results indicate the potential of the proposed method on recovering the drawing order of complex characters, as expected.

5|$|In 2004, Bondevik's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm {{decided that}} all ferry {{services}} in Norway would become subject {{to public service}} obligation (PSO). Innherredsferja held a concession {{until the end of}} 2006, but would have to bid for the service from 1 January 2007. The company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to succeed in the bidding. By then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold their shares to Fosen. Following this, a meeting was held on Ytterøy, where Fosen succeeded in securing <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{interest in}} sensor nets is still growing because they simplify data acquisition in many applications. If hardware resources are very sparse, routing algorithms cannot use data gathering. However, if a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> channels can be used, then parallel transmission can compensate this drawback. If the senders and receivers {{are not known}} in advance, then a control channel poses a bottleneck for communication. We present an oblivious MAC protocol, called the Funnel protocol, where the channels are nearly optimally utilized in parallel. In this, senders and receivers choose for a polylogarithmic <b>number</b> <b>of</b> rounds (several sending attempts) a decreasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> channels which are selected equiprobably. Then, we show that a previously presented approach using only one round and therefore one type of probability distribution is optimal up to some constant factor, and considerably worse than the Funnel protocol. The protocol works with few resources if <b>an</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> channels is available. The Funnel protocol is simple, elegant, and {{does not need to}} know the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> senders and receivers, thus being oblivious. On the bottom line we prove that small messages can be efficiently transmitted by the MAC layer in parallel without a control channel if more than one channel for communication can be used. ...|$|R
