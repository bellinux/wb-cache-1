5|$|Clavaria zollingeri {{contains}} lectins, a {{class of}} proteins that bind specific carbohydrates {{on the surface of}} cells, causing them to clump together. A Korean study demonstrated that extracts of the fungus caused lymphoagglutination, a specific form of <b>agglutination</b> that involves white blood cells. In general, lectins are used in blood typing and serology, and they are widely used in affinity chromatography for purifying proteins.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a creole with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages. However, more recent {{research has shown that}} modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but {{it is also possible that}} it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards <b>agglutination,</b> for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an <b>agglutination</b> (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, <b>agglutination,</b> haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E
25|$|<b>Agglutination</b> is {{commonly}} used {{as a method of}} identifying specific bacterial antigens, and in turn, the identity of such bacteria. Because the clumping reaction occurs quickly and is easy to produce, <b>agglutination</b> is an important technique in diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Austrian {{physician}} Karl Landsteiner {{found another}} important practical {{application of the}} <b>agglutination</b> reaction in 1900. Landsteiner's <b>agglutination</b> tests and his discovery of ABO blood groups {{was the start of}} the science of blood transfusion and serology which has made transfusion possible and safer.|$|E
25|$|Verb {{morphology}} is synthetic and has {{elements of}} both fusion and <b>agglutination.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Agglutination</b> is {{the process}} that occurs if an antigen is mixed with its {{corresponding}} antibody called isoagglutinin. This term is commonly used in blood grouping.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a change in the noun root through the process of <b>agglutination,</b> it is written adjacently. These are mostly Arabic loan-words, which switch to their more {{original}} form.|$|E
25|$|Transmittance {{of light}} {{may be used}} to measure e.g. {{clearing}} of opacity of a liquid created by suspended particles due to decrease in number of clumps during a platelet <b>agglutination</b> reaction.|$|E
25|$|Measuring and {{charting}} CRP values {{can prove}} useful in determining disease progress or {{the effectiveness of}} treatments. ELISA, immunoturbidimetry, nephelometry, rapid immunodiffusion, and visual <b>agglutination</b> are all methods used to measure CRP.|$|E
25|$|Turkic {{languages}} are null-subject languages, have vowel harmony, extensive <b>agglutination</b> {{by means of}} suffixes and postpositions, and lack of grammatical articles, noun classes, and grammatical gender. Subject–object–verb word order is universal within the family. The root of a word is basically of one, two or three consonants.|$|E
25|$|There is an <b>agglutination</b> {{reaction}} between similar antigen and antibody (for example, antigen A agglutinates the antibody A and antigen B agglutinates the antibody B). Thus, transfusion can {{be considered}} safe {{as long as the}} serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor.|$|E
25|$|Molecular methods (PCR) of {{diagnosis}} are possible, but not routinely available for clinical diagnosis. Fluorescence {{in situ hybridisation}} has also been described, but has not been clinically validated, {{and it is not}} commercially available. In Thailand, a latex <b>agglutination</b> assay is widely used, while a rapid immunofluorescence technique is also available in a small number of centres.|$|E
25|$|The Uralic {{languages}} are agglutinative, following from the <b>agglutination</b> in Proto-Uralic. The largest {{languages are}} Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian—all European Union official languages. Uralic inflection is, or is developed from, affixing. Grammatical markers directly {{added to the}} word perform the same function as prepositions in English. Almost all words are inflected according to their roles in the sentence: verbs, nouns, pronouns, numerals, adjectives, and some particles.|$|E
25|$|Semi-quantitative assays, i.e. assays {{that give}} the {{read-out}} in an approximate fashion rather than an exact number for the quantity of the substance. Generally they {{have a few more}} gradations than just two outcomes, positive or negative, e.g. scoring on a scale of 1+ to 4+ as used for blood grouping tests based on RBC <b>agglutination</b> in response to grouping reagents (antibody against blood group antigens).|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} no {{antibody}} present, an immediate spin crossmatch or computer assisted crossmatch is performed where the recipient serum and donor rbc are incubated. In the immediate spin method, two drops of patient serum are tested against a drop of 3–5% suspension of donor cells in a test tube and spun in a serofuge. <b>Agglutination</b> or hemolysis (i.e., positive Coombs test) in the test tube is a positive reaction and the unit should not be transfused.|$|E
25|$|Uyghur {{belongs to}} the Karluk branch of the Turkic {{language}} family, which also includes languages such as Uzbek. Like many other Turkic languages, Uyghur displays vowel harmony and <b>agglutination,</b> lacks noun classes or grammatical gender, and is a left-branching language with subject–object–verb word order. More distinctly Uyghur processes include, especially in northern dialects, vowel reduction and umlauting. In addition to influence of other Turkic languages, Uyghur has historically been influenced strongly by Persian and Arabic, and more recently by Mandarin Chinese and Russian.|$|E
25|$|A {{serological}} test for melioidosis (indirect haemagglutination) is available, but not commercially in most countries. A high background titre {{may reduce the}} positive predictive value of {{serological test}}s in endemic countries. A specific direct immunofluorescent test and latex <b>agglutination,</b> based on monoclonal antibodies, are used widely in Thailand, but are not available elsewhere. Cross-reactivity with B.thailandensis is almost complete. A commercial ELISA kit for melioidosis appears to perform well. but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.|$|E
25|$|Characteristic {{features}} of Turkish, such as vowel harmony, <b>agglutination,</b> {{and lack of}} grammatical gender, are universal within the Turkic family. There is also {{a high degree of}} mutual intelligibility among the various Oghuz languages, which include Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, Balkan Gagauz Turkish, and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar. Although methods of classification vary, the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches: Oghur, the only surviving member of which is Chuvash, and Common Turkic, which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch.|$|E
25|$|Functional assays, i.e. an assay {{that tries}} to {{quantify}} functioning of an active substance rather than just its quantity. The functional counterpart of the VWF antigen assay is Ristocetin Cofactor assay, which measures the functional activity of the VWF present in a patients plasma by adding exogenous formalin-fixed platelets and gradually increasing quantities of drug named ristocetin while measuring <b>agglutination</b> of the fixed platelets. A similar assay but used for a different purpose is called Ristocetin Induced Platelet Aggregation or RIPA, which tests response of endogenous live platelets from a patient in response to Ristocetin (exogenous) & VWF (usually endogenous).|$|E
25|$|Serological {{testing is}} much more {{frequently}} used in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic. A 2014 Cochrane review evaluated different rapid diagnostic tests. One of them (the rK39 immunochromatographic test) gave correct, positive results in 92% of the people with visceral leishmaniasis and it gave correct, negative results in 92% {{of the people who}} did not have the disease. A second rapid test (called latex <b>agglutination</b> test) gave correct, positive results in 64% of the people with the disease and it gave correct, negative results in 93% of the people without the disease. Other types of tests have not been studied thoroughly enough to ascertain their efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Hemagglutination assay. In {{generating}} {{an immune}} {{response to an}} antigen, the B-cells go {{through a process of}} maturation, from surface IgM production, to serum IgM production, to maturation into a plasma cell producing IgG. Graft recipients who generate an immune response have both IgM and IgG. The IgM can be used directly in hemagglutination assays, depicted on the right. IgM has 10 antigen binding regions per molecule, allowing cross-linking of cells. An antiserum specific for HLA-A3 will then agglutinate HLA-A3 bearing red blood cells if the concentration of IgM in the antiserum is sufficiently high. Alternatively, a second antibody to the invariable (Fc) region of the IgG can be used to cross-link antibodies on different cells, causing <b>agglutination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{diagnosed}} in the hematology laboratory by direct visualization of the amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan bodies). Buffy-coat preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a slide {{to make a}} thin smear and stained with Leishman stain or Giemsa stain (pH 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen within blood and spleen monocytes or, less commonly, in circulating neutrophils and in aspirated tissue macrophages. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, rod-shaped kinetoplast. Occasionally, amastigotes may be seen lying free between cells. However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and identification of the infected cells can be difficult. So, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antigen-coated dipsticks, and direct <b>agglutination</b> test. Although these tests are readily available, {{they are not the}} standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity.|$|E
500|$|<b>Agglutination,</b> {{in which}} {{antibodies}} [...] "glue together" [...] foreign cells into clumps that are attractive targets for phagocytosis ...|$|E
500|$|Its {{common name}} {{is derived from}} Tupi , a complex <b>agglutination</b> of [...] (leaf) + [...] (slender) + [...] (eat) + [...] (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning [...] "one who eats slender leaves", or [...] "grass-eater".|$|E
500|$|Nahuan {{languages}} {{exhibit a}} complex morphology characterized by polysynthesis and <b>agglutination.</b> Through {{a very long}} period of coexistence with the other indigenous Mesoamerican languages, they have absorbed many influences, coming to form part of the Mesoamerican language area. Many words from Nahuatl have been borrowed into Spanish, and since diffused into hundreds of other languages. Most of these loanwords denote things indigenous to central Mexico which the Spanish heard mentioned {{for the first time}} by their Nahuatl names. English words of Nahuatl origin include [...] "avocado", [...] "chayote", [...] "chili", [...] "chocolate", [...] "atlatl", [...] "coyote", [...] "peyote", [...] "axolotl" [...] and [...] "tomato".|$|E
500|$|Tamil words {{consist of}} a lexical root to which one or more affixes are attached. Most Tamil affixes are suffixes. Tamil suffixes can be derivational suffixes, which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or inflectional suffixes, which mark {{categories}} such as person, number, mood, tense, etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of <b>agglutination,</b> {{which can lead to}} long words with a large number of suffixes, which would require several words or a sentence in English. [...] To give an example, the word pōkamuṭiyātavarkaḷukkāka (போகமுடியாதவர்களுக்காக) means [...] "for the sake of those who cannot go", and consists of the following morphemes: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{king vulture}} was {{originally}} described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae as Vultur papa, the type specimen originally collected in Suriname. It was reassigned to the genus Sarcoramphus in 1805 by French zoologist André Marie Constant Duméril. The generic name is a New Latin compound formed from the Greek words σάρξ (sarx, [...] "flesh", the combining form of which is σαρκο-) and ῥάμφος (rhamphos, [...] "crooked beak of bird of prey"). The genus name is often misspelled as Sarcorhamphus, improperly retaining the Greek rough breathing despite <b>agglutination</b> with the previous word-element. The bird was also assigned to the genus Gyparchus by Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger in 1841, but this classification is not used in modern literature since Sarcoramphus has priority as the earlier name. The species name is derived from Latin word papa [...] "bishop", alluding the bird's plumage resembling the clothing of one. The king vulture's closest living relative is the Andean condor, Vultur gryphus. Some authors have even put these species in a separate subfamily from the other New World vultures, though most authors consider this subdivision unnecessary.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Agglutination</b> is the {{clumping}} of particles. [...] The word <b>agglutination</b> {{comes from}} the Latin [...] (glueing to).|$|E
2500|$|Two bacteriologists, Herbert Edward Durham (-1945) and Max von Gruber (1853–1927), {{discovered}} specific <b>agglutination</b> in 1896. The clumping {{became known}} as Gruber-Durham reaction. Gruber introduced the term agglutinin (from the Latin) for any substance that caused <b>agglutination</b> of cells.|$|E
2500|$|Patients should ideally {{receive their}} own blood or type-specific blood {{products}} {{to minimize the}} chance of a transfusion reaction. [...] Risks can be further reduced by cross-matching blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture agglutinates, or forms clumps. If <b>agglutination</b> is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for <b>agglutination</b> with a microscope. If <b>agglutination</b> occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. [...] In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.|$|E
2500|$|In cross-matching, donor {{red blood}} cells and recipient's serum or plasma are {{incubated}} together. [...] If <b>agglutination</b> occurs, this indicates that the donor and recipient blood types are incompatible.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, {{blood type}} tests are {{performed}} through {{addition of a}} blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen. The presence of an antigen {{on the surface of}} the blood cells is indicated by <b>agglutination.</b> An alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at Imperial College London which makes use of paramagnetic molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens. [...] In these tests, rather than <b>agglutination,</b> a positive result is indicated by decolorization as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution.|$|E
2500|$|Interlingua draws {{its roots}} from certain [...] "control {{languages}}": French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German and Russian. It uses these languages {{as a means}} to select the words most used in these major European languages. Esperanto draws from largely the same languages, but uses <b>agglutination</b> more extensively. Rather than using an existing word commonly used among the major European languages, Esperanto forms its own words using its own roots. For example, the Esperanto word for [...] "hospital" [...] is mal·san·ul·ej·o, which breaks down into five roots: mal (opposite), san (health), ul (person), ej (place), o (noun). Interlingua tends to use words derived from natural languages instead of extensive <b>agglutination.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{morphological}} derivation in Catalan follows {{the same principles}} as the other Romance languages, where <b>agglutination</b> is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctric [...] ("electrical") vs. electricitat [...] Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, as in preveure ("foresee").|$|E
