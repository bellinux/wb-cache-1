5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency. When that failed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy,</b> the aerial effort was redirected {{to serve as an}} anti-infiltration campaign. After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B. Johnson on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves mimicry of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested that}} females of some species have evolved mimicry <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} is a diurnal antelope (active mainly {{during the}} day). Three kinds of groups, typically small, are the female, male and bachelor herds. Males often adopt lekking <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> to garner females for mating. While other males {{are not allowed}} into these territories, females often visit these places to forage. The male can thus attempt mating with her. Herbivores, blackbuck graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. Females become sexually mature at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place throughout the year. Gestation is typically six months long, after which a single calf is born. The lifespan is typically 10 to 15 years.|$|E

3000|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} {{the benefits of}} integrating MO <b>as</b> <b>an</b> economic <b>strategy</b> with CSR <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>strategy</b> (Mitchell et al. 2010; Mohr and Sarin 2009).

On the bases of the above argument, this study is set out to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework and propositions that guides the integration of MO and CSR for BP. In this regard, the key question that needs to be answered is whether there are sufficient frameworks that project the integration of MO <b>as</b> <b>an</b> economic <b>strategy</b> and CSR <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>strategy</b> leading to business performance in extant marketing and management literature?

5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, {{has been a}} cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting perception is that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

25|$|Carbonyl sulfide {{is used as}} an {{intermediate}} {{in the production of}} thiocarbamate herbicides. Carbonyl sulfide is a potential alternative fumigant to methyl bromide and phosphine. In some cases, however, residues on the grain result in flavours that are unacceptable to consumers, e.g. barley used for brewing. Carbonyl sulfide is readily converted to the gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide by carbonic anhydrase enzymes in plants and mammals. Because of this chemistry, the release of carbonyl sulfide from small organic molecules has been identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> for delivering hydrogen sulfide in different biological contexts.|$|E
