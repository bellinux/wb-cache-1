The convergence rate of the scheme is degraded slightly when additional <b>artificial</b> <b>block</b> boundaries are included for the purpose of parallelization.

40|$|Recently, bank {{protection}} works are undertaken construction in many rivers. People {{try to keep}} rivers in a natural environment as much as possible. Under such circumstances, <b>artificial</b> <b>block</b> for fish nest comes to be cQnsidered available. To put it at bank serves as not only {{bank protection}} but also ecosystem preservation. We studied having an interest in exchanging fluid between main stream of river and inside of the block, {{which is one of}} main functions of the block. When main stream of river flow by the block, turbul. ent shearing layer becomes at pass-through of the block. Many vortexes arise in the layer. From previous reports, those vortexes cause exchanging fluid. We analyzed this system by two experiments, one is visualization for stream, another is measurement of flow velocity. The vortexes arising from the leader of pass-through move to downstream with flow. Then the size of them increases with flow. When they get to near the end of passthrough, they brush against the sidewall of channel and they are broken. At the same instant, the width of turbulent shearing layer is increasing with flow, too. ln such hydraulic phenomenon, the size of vortexes, the width of turbulent shearing layer and other turbulent quantities depend on the value of Froude number. 本研究では人ロ魚巣開口部に形成される乱流剪断層の水理特性に関して，特に剥離渦の特性について，水理実験に基づき検討を行った．得られた結果をまとめると以下のようである．開口部始端で発生した剥離渦は，Fr数が大きくなるほどその渦径は大きくなり，発生周期は短くなる．また，その渦は流下とともにその渦径を増し発達する．しかし，発達した渦は開口部終端近傍で壁面への衝突により崩壊する．渦の平面形状は崩壊する直前まではほぼ円形をしている．水路側壁面近傍の流速分布については人工魚巣開口部乱流勇断層を流下する際に減衰するが，開口部終端から，次の人工魚巣の開口部始端に至るまでにほぼ回復する．また，魚巣開口部乱流剪断層ノルズ応力は流下とともに増加することがわかった...|$|E

A multiprocessor based, distributed simulation testbed PARADIS, has been designed and implemented on a hypercube iPSC/ 2.

In particular, the inhomogeneity {{is due to}} its biphasic composition and, consequently, to the different mechanical properties of its constituents, mortar and natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>blocks.</b> The anisotropy is, instead, due to the different masonry patterns since the mechanical response {{is affected by the}} geometrical arrangement of the constituents. The unquestionable importance of a lot of real masonry estate requires researcher’s particular attention for this kind of structures. Therefore, in order to design an efficient response for repairing existing masonry structures, a large number of theoretical studies, experimental laboratory activities and computational procedures have been proposed in scientific literature. The main object of the present work is, in a first moment, to furnish an overall description of the different homogenization approaches utilized in literature for modelling masonry structures in linear-elastic field. Then, it will be given a number of new possible proposals for theoretical models which yield global constitutive relationships.

50|$|When leptin binds {{with the}} leptin receptor, it {{activates}} {{a number of}} pathways. Leptin resistance {{may be caused by}} defects in one or more part of this process, particularly the JAK/STAT pathway. Mice with a mutation in the leptin receptor gene that prevents the activation of STAT3 are obese and exhibit hyperphagia. The PI3K pathway may also be involved in leptin resistance, as has been demonstrated in mice by <b>artificial</b> <b>blocking</b> of PI3K signalling. The PI3K pathway also is activated by the insulin receptor and is therefore an important area where leptin and insulin act together as part of energy homeostasis. The insulin-pI3K pathway can cause POMC neurons to become insensitive to leptin through hyperpolarization. The consumption of a high fructose diet from birth has been associated with a reduction in leptin levels and reduced expression of leptin receptor mRNA in rats. Long-term consumption of fructose in rats has been shown to increase levels of triglycerides and trigger leptin and insulin resistance, however, another study found that leptin resistance only developed in the presence of both high fructose and high fat levels in the diet. A third study found that high fructose levels reversed leptin resistance in rats given a high fat diet. The contradictory results mean that it is uncertain whether leptin resistance is caused by high levels of carbohydrates or fats, or if an increase of both, is needed.|$|R

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The material of the <b>artificial</b> defect <b>block</b> is carbon steel (S 45 C) with dimension of 180 mm (length) × 25 mm (width) × 60 mm (height).

While the block diagonalization (BD) method is of ideal performance but too complex. In this paper, we propose a new alternative approach based on maximizing the signal-to-leakage ratio (SLR).
