5|$|After a 3–1 home defeat by Belgium in December 1979, Wark was not {{selected}} {{again for}} his country until February 1981 for the 1982 World Cup qualifying match away <b>against</b> <b>Israel.</b> Following a successful qualification campaign, Wark {{was included in the}} Scotland squad that went to the World Cup in Spain under Stein's leadership.

5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack <b>against</b> <b>Israel</b> {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E
5|$|During that month, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad {{indicated}} {{his intentions}} {{of going to}} war <b>against</b> <b>Israel.</b> Egypt and Syria agreed to coordinate military action via negotiations, and the respective Ministers of War formulated a common military strategy. Egypt enlisted the political support of several more Arab countries, some producers of oil. Sadat discussed {{the possibility of using}} oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing Arab nations, primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token forces to the front lines.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia {{has never}} {{recognised}} Israel {{and has no}} diplomatic ties with it, and has called for the International Criminal Court to take action <b>against</b> <b>Israel</b> over their Gaza flotilla raid. Malaysia has stated it will only establish official relations with Israel once a peace agreement with the State of Palestine has been reached and called for both parties to find a quick resolution. Malaysian peacekeeping forces have contributed to many UN peacekeeping missions, such as in Congo, Iran–Iraq, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, East Timor and Lebanon.|$|E

5|$|PLO {{cross-border}} raids <b>against</b> <b>Israel</b> grew {{during the}} late 1970s. One of the most severe—known as the Coastal Road massacre—occurred on 11 March 1978. A force of nearly a dozen Fatah fighters landed their boats near a major coastal road connecting the city of Haifa with Tel Aviv-Yafo. There they hijacked a bus and sprayed gunfire inside and at passing vehicles, killing thirty-seven civilians. In response, the IDF launched Operation Litani three days later, {{with the goal of}} taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River. The IDF achieved this goal, and Arafat withdrew PLO forces north into Beirut.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah {{says that}} its {{continued}} hostilities <b>against</b> <b>Israel</b> are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against Lebanon and as retaliation {{for what they}} claim is Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of 19 March 1978, however Lebanon considers the Shebaa farms—a 26-km² (10-mi²) piece of land captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel—to be Lebanese territory. Additionally, Hezbollah claims that three Lebanese prisoners are being held in Israel. Finally, Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state. For these reasons, they justify their actions as acts of defensive jihad.|$|E
