40|$|Cellulosic ethanol {{provides}} a great alternative as a renewable and green low-carbon fuel. Inhibitors, especially <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{found in the}} biomass hydrolyzate present a major challenge converting the feedstock to ethanol. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibits microbial <b>fermentation</b> on both cell growth and ethanol production. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is particularly inhibitory to the fermentation of xylose, which accounts for about 30 % of the total sugars in the feedstock. Therefore, developing a microorganism with sufficient tolerance to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> during <b>fermentation</b> {{is key to the}} success of the industry. The focus of this study was on the mechanisms of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> resistance during xylose fermentation. Fermentation analysis and two systems biology approaches, metabolic and transcriptomic analysis, were used to compare two S. cerevisiae strains, 424 A (LNH-ST) and 424 A (LNH-ST) - AAR, during glucose/xylose co-fermentation in the presence of 10 g L- 1 <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> which represented the condition that could be expected in the industry. 424 A (LNH-ST) - AAR was an acetic acid-resistant strain developed from the parent strain 424 A (LNH-ST) through adaptation. Fermentation analysis showed that AAR strain could ferment twice as much xylose into ethanol with a specific xylose consumption rate that was 642 % faster compared to the original strain. It also showed that AAR strain was capable of producing half of the amount of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> per gram of sugar consumed and maintaining a higher medium pH during fermentation. Both metabolic and transcriptomic analysis indicated that maintaining and conserving cellular energy was paramount for xylose fermentation in the presence of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> which could be achieved from four aspects suggested by the expression profiles of the genes from transcriptomic analysis: (1) increasing the production of cellular energy by increasing the number of transporters with high affinity for xylose, (2) increasing the tolerance to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> and ethanol simultaneously by changing the fluidity of the plasma membrane such as elevating the amount of ergosterol, (3) shutting down the expression of some less important energy-consuming proteins, and (4) utilizing the more energy-efficient vacuolar proton pumps instead of those in the plasma membrane to recover the internal pH that was perturbed upon <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment. This dissertation presented the first study in the literature identifying the key factors for xylose fermentation by yeast in the presence of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> The findings from this study provide valuable information in order to better design microorganisms suitable for cellulosic ethanol production and can serve as a starting point for overcoming a major obstacle in the industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to enhance calcium solubility and bioavailability from calcium-fortified soymilk by fermentation with 7 strains of Lactobacillus, namely, L. acidophilus ATCC 4962, ATCC 33200, ATCC 4356, ATCC 4461, L. casei ASCC 290, L. plantarum ASCC 276, and L. fermentum VRI- 003. The parameters that were used are viability, pH, calcium solubility, organic acid, and biologically active isoflavone aglycone content. Calcium-fortified soymilk made from soy protein isolate was inoculated with these probiotic strains, incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, then stored for 14 d at 4 °C. Soluble calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA). Organic acids and bioactive isoflavone aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein, were measured using HPLC. Viability of the strains in the fermented calcium-fortified soymilk was > 8. 5 log 10 CFU/g after 24 h fermentation and this was maintained for 14 -d storage at 4 °C. After 24 h, there was a significant increase (P < 0. 05) in soluble calcium. L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 and L. casei ASCC 290 demonstrated the highest increase with 89. 3 % and 87. 0 % soluble calcium after 24 h, respectively. The increase in calcium solubility observed was related to lowered pH associated with production of lactic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids.</b> <b>Fermentation</b> significantly increased (P < 0. 05) the level of conversion of isoflavones into biologically active aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein. Our results show that fermenting calcium-fortified soymilk with the selected probiotics can potentially enhance the calcium bioavailability of calcium-fortified soymilk due to increased calcium solubility and bioactive isoflavone aglycone enrichment. © 2007 Institute of Food Technologists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChinese cereal vinega {{represented}} the east vinegar, {{is well known}} to the world. In {{order to understand the}} Chinese cereal vinegar further, its characteristic flavour should be researched. The purpose of the work is to find out the characteristic flavour compounds and analyze the dynamic variation trend in the process of Chinese cereal vinegar fermentation. HS- SPME fibered with polyacrylate (PA) was used in detecting aromatic compounds. It was found that in the ethanol fermentation, ethanol increased rapidly, and other aromatic compounds accumulated slowly; in the <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation,</b> acetic acid and esters increased fast with reduction of alcohol, while phenols, aldehyde, ketones, hydrocarbons and heterocyclic were still slowly accumulated. The characteristic aromatic compounds were ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate, β-phenylethyl alcohol and 4 -Vinylguaiacol. The contents of organic acids reached 6. 79 ± 0. 11 g/ 100 g sample finally, and acetic acid, succinic acid, malic acid and lactic acid were the main organic acids. The variation trend of the characteristic flavour compounds had been found out preliminarily, which could be the symbol of Chinese cereal vinegar and the basis of further study. Here, the foundation for improving flavour and quality of Chinese cereal vinegar was established...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process for continuous fermentation, in particular a process for the continuous fermentation of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Fermentation</b> is performed in two fermentation units, whereby the first fermenter is operated at optimum efficiency by controlling the substrate feed by a measurement and control system and the subtraction concentration and thus the product concentration is kept constant at stationary conditions and constant volumetric rate of flow. A residual fermentation is fed through the second fermenter by transferring {{the contents of the}} first fermenter to the second fermenter, whereby the biomass transfer from the first fermenter to the second fermenter is determined by the bleed rate and is adjusted by a measuring and control system {{in such a way that}} the biomass required for residual fermentation is available in the second fermenter. In both fermentation stages, a direct product discharge is performed via microfiltration and/or an ultrafiltration unit and the r esidue of the micro/ultrafiltration is returned to the fermenter, whereby, in the second fermentation stage, a partial flow is removed from the system as required. The product is concentrated and/or obtained from the permeate of the micro/ultrafiltration of the second fermenter using normal methods...|$|E
40|$|The membrane-bound alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (ADH) of Acetobacter pasteurianus NCI 1452 {{consists of three}} different subunits, a 78 -kDa dehydrogenase subunit, a 48 -kDa cytochrome c subunit, and a 20 -kDa subunit of unknown function. For elucidation of {{the function of the}} smallest subunit, this gene was cloned from this strain by the oligonucleotide-probing method, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence and the NH 2 -terminal sequence determined for the purified protein indicated that the smallest subunit contained a typical signal peptide of 28 amino acids, as did the larger two subunits. This gene complemented the ADH activity of a mutant strain which had lost the smallest subunit. Disruption of this gene on the chromosome resulted in loss of ADH activity in Acetobacter aceti, indicating that the smallest subunit was essential for ADH activity. Immunoblot analyses of cell lysates prepared from various ADH mutants suggested that the smallest subunit was concerned with the stability of the 78 -kDa subunit and functioned as a molecular coupler of the 78 -kDa subunit to the 48 -kDa subunit on the cytoplasmic membrane. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation,</b> in which ethanol is oxidized to acetic acid by acetic acid bacteria, is the most characteristic process in vinegar production (10). This ethanol oxidation is catalyzed by two membrane-bound enzymes, alcohol dehydro...|$|E

Four different hydrolysates obtained after steam pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass were selected and fermented to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> in batch <b>fermentations.</b> The bacterial strain (ATCC 39073) can effectively ferment xylose and glucose in steam exploded hydrolysates from wheat straw, forest residues, switchgrass, and sugarcane straw to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> This homoacetogen prefers xylose over glucose. The highest <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> yield obtained was in steam pretreated sugarcane straw hydrolysate {{and the lowest}} in forest residues hydrolysate (71 % and 39 % of theoretical respectively based on total sugars). This acetogen can partially consume arabinose, galactose and mannose within 72 h of <b>fermentation.</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> yield in forest residues was adversely affected by high concentration of arabinose, galactose and mannose. Glucose to xylose ratio has a direct effect on production yield. It was also observed that M. thermoacetica can tolerate process derived inhibitory compounds from steam explosion pretreatment (total phenolics up to 3 g/L and furans up to 0. 5 g/L) ...|$|R
40|$|Strictly aerobic <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{bacteria}} (AAB) have a {{long history}} of use in fermentation processes, and the conversion of ethanol to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> for the production of vinegar is the most well-known application. At the industrial scale, vinegar is mainly produced by submerged fermentation, which refers to an aerobic process in which the ethanol in beverages such as spirits, wine or cider is oxidized to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> by AAB. Submerged fermentation requires robust AAB strains that are able to oxidize ethanol under selective conditions to produce high-titer <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Currently submerged <b>fermentation</b> is conducted by unselected AAB cultures, which are derived from previous acetification stocks and maintained by repeated cultivation cycles. In this work, submerged fermentation for vinegar production is discussed with regard to advances in process optimization and parameters (oxygen availability, <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> content and temperature) that influence AAB activity. Furthermore, the potential impact arising from the use of selected AAB is described. Overcoming the acetification constraints is a main goal in order to facilitate innovation in submerged fermentation and to create new industry-challenging perspectives...|$|R
40|$|Four cultivars of olive, Kalamata, Marri, Zard and Fishmi were {{obtained}} from Roodbar town and treated with two methods, natural and controlled fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum as a starter culture at 25 °C for 100 days. HPLC analysis experiments were conducted during the whole study period. A higher level (1. 08 % w/w) of total acidity was produced in Fishmi cultivar especially in the natural fermentation (0. 8 - 1. 1 g lactic acid/ml) than in other cultivars. Individual organic acids were determined by HPLC. Quantitative changes of organic acids in olives showed (P&lt; 0. 0 l) an increasing pattern of lactic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> during <b>fermentation,</b> but decreasing levels of malic and citric acids were revealed. The highest level of lactic acid (1. 1 % w/v) was observed in Zard cultivar {{and the type of}} fermentation had no effect on acid production.
