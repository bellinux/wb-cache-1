50|$|In 1962, the CNES (France’s National Centre for Space Studies) {{decided to}} build a low density and {{high-speed}} wind tunnel essential for aerodynamic and <b>aerothermal</b> studies in rarefied gas flows.

The construction of the facility was delegated to the SESSIA (engineering consultants for aeronautical industrial works) and was achieved in 1963. The wind tunnel was then moved to the ICARE Laboratory in Orléans in 2000, {{as a result of}} the merging of the Aerothermodynamics Laboratory and the LCSR (Combustion and Reactive Systems Laboratory).

5000|$|Buscombe {{describes}} her childhood as going from [...] "wanting to be a princess, {{to being an}} astronaut to wanting to be in F1", having garnered {{an interest in the}} sport at the age of eleven. She was educated at Forest School, Walthamstow. Buscombe's teachers attempted to discourage her from working in engineering because they questioned her career choice. At age 18, she narrowly avoided being killed in a road accident. Buscombe went to the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering and studied Aerospace and <b>Aerothermal</b> Engineering. Her master's thesis was on the effect of the drag reduction system and was conducted in conjunction with motorsport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, and supervised by former Jaguar team principal Tony Purnell. Buscombe graduated with a first class honours degree in 2012.|$|E
50|$|According to CNES, Hermes {{would have}} been subject to more extreme {{re-entry}} conditions than the Space Shuttle due to its smaller size resulting in the vehicle being subject to higher <b>aerothermal</b> pressures. The baseline thermal protection, which was to be capable of withstanding temperatures of 1,400-1,600° C for a minimum of 20 minutes and studied by Dassault and SEP, would have consisted of carbon elements with an anti-oxidant coating applied to portions of the nose and leading edges of the wings, while thermal tiles were to have covered the underside of the wing and fuselage. These tiles, which were to be fastened into place, would have employed thin, reinforced ceramic-carbon honeycomb composite insulating layers separated by thin sheets of metal alloy to reflect the heat; an alternative concept for the tiles would have employed higher metallic portions in place of ceramics. The upper surfaces of the vehicle, which {{would have been}} subject to less heat than the lower surfaces, would have used flexible blanket-like low-density, glassfibre-ceramic layers.|$|E

40|$|The <b>aerothermal</b> {{analysis}} of a hypersonic vehicle is of fundamental interest for designing its configuration. The convection coefficients and wall temperatures due to aerodynamic heating to critical surfaces of a hypersonic vehicle are obtained computationally. Convective heat flux to the swept-back leading edge (SBLE) surface is obtained by splitting the velocity vector along and perpendicular to the surface, and thereby appropriately using the two-dimensional (2 D) stagnation region and flat plate heat fluxes together. The main purpose of this work is to propose <b>aerothermal</b> concepts for configuration design of a swept leading edge hypersonic vehicle. Results obtained from these computational analyses reveal the existence of temperature and drag-minimized sweepback, temperature and heat flux-variations-minimized sweepback, and most importantly, the thermally benign sharp SBLE effect.
