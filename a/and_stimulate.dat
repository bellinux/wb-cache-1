5|$|In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} announced the aviation deregulation policy, {{which makes it}} easier to acquire a permit to establish a new airline company. The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air-travel business in the country, as well as to serve <b>and</b> <b>stimulate</b> tourism industry in the region. As a result, many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia, among them Lion Air (est. 1999), Sriwijaya Air (est. 2003), Adam Air (operating from 2002 to 2008), and Batavia Air (operating from 2002 to 2013). The deregulation also spurred the low-cost carrier service in Indonesia. Previously, air travel service was dominated by well-established airlines such as Garuda Indonesia and Merpati.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age <b>and</b> <b>stimulate</b> gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{adaptation}} {{failed to}} have the same cultural impact as the 1995 serial and has since attracted sharply-divided opinions. However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young viewers who had not seen the 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited special issue of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the collaboration of nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster discussion <b>and</b> <b>stimulate</b> scholarly analysis. JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E
5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities <b>and</b> <b>stimulate</b> production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted hyena {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection <b>and</b> <b>stimulate</b> sexual desire in people.|$|E
5|$|During the British Raj, Darjeeling's {{temperate}} climate {{led to its}} development as a hill station for British residents seeking to escape the summer heat of the plains. The development of Darjeeling as a sanatorium and health resort proceeded briskly. Arthur Campbell, a surgeon with the Company, and Lieutenant Robert Napier were responsible for establishing a hill station there. Campbell's efforts to develop the station, attract immigrants to cultivate the slopes <b>and</b> <b>stimulate</b> trade resulted in a hundredfold increase in the population of Darjeeling between 1835 and 1849. The first road connecting the town with the plains was constructed between 1839 and 1842. In 1848, a military depot was set up for British soldiers, and the town became a municipality in 1850. Commercial cultivation of tea in the district began in 1856, and induced a number of British planters to settle there. Darjeeling became the formal summer capital of the Bengal Presidency after 1864. Scottish missionaries undertook the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British residents, laying the foundation for Darjeeling's notability as a centre of education. The opening of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in 1881 further hastened {{the development of the}} region. In 1899, Darjeeling was rocked by major landslides that caused severe damage to the town and the native population.|$|E
