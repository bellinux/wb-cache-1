5|$|The BDI was {{originally}} developed {{to provide a}} quantitative assessment of the intensity of depression. Because {{it is designed to}} reflect the depth of depression, it can monitor changes over time <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> objective measure for judging improvement and the effectiveness or otherwise of treatment methods. The instrument remains widely used in research; in 1998, it had been used in over 2000 empirical studies. It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Xhosa.|$|E
5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> incentive for the private sector to invest.|$|E

5|$|The city of Gifu is {{currently}} promoting the Slow Life City Initiative, {{which is similar}} to, but more comprehensive than, the slow food initiative. It is designed to encourage residents to lead a slower lifestyles <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> alternative to the fast-paced life of the modern world. Major elements of this campaign include more dependence on locally grown food; traditional culture and arts; and activities to increase citizens’ participation in their community. In addition to slow food, Gifu also hopes to include slow industry (traditional crafts), slow education (studying quality of life), and slow tourism (represented by cormorant fishing).|$|E
5|$|The kont, or storytelling, folk {{tradition}} of Dominica was focused around entertainment for night-time festivals, funeral wakes and feasts and festivals. Modern kont is mostly performed during major festival competitions. Most kont storytellers work with local traditions, such as legends and history, <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> ethical or moral message. A one line theme song, often based around a duet between two characters, recurs throughout most kont performances.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} side of the outer defences, facing the river, are the West and East Lines of gun positions. These were built in the 18th century and have been subject to {{considerable}} erosion and silting; 12 of the original 14 gun positions on the West Line remain but only one of the East Line has survived. In between the lines is a quay, designed to allow the delivery of supplies from the Thames, and the remains of the tracks from the narrow gauge railway built during the First World War. A sluice gate in the south-west corner managed the water in the moats, and allowed them to be drained completely should the surfaces begin to freeze over in winter <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> advantage to any attackers. To the west of the outer defences is the World's End pub, originally the local ferry house, dating from 1788.|$|E

5|$|Plato, in his Laws, {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with {{the daughter of a}} man who died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, and said that the inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire {{continued}} to play increasingly diverse roles throughout the Second World War and beyond, often in air forces other than the RAF. For example, the Spitfire became the first high-speed photo-reconnaissance aircraft to be operated by the RAF. Sometimes unarmed, they flew at high, medium and low altitudes, often ranging far into enemy territory to closely observe the Axis powers <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> almost continual flow of valuable intelligence information throughout the war. In 1941 and 1942, PRU Spitfires provided the first photographs of the Freya and Würzburg radar systems and, in 1943, helped confirm that the Germans were building the V1 and V2 Vergeltungswaffe ("vengeance weapons") by photographing Peenemünde, on the Baltic Sea coast of Germany.|$|E
5|$|The USPHS and {{cooperating}} groups {{created the}} plan for the recruitment of cadet nursing students. It was broad in scope to attract {{the maximum number of}} potential applicants in the shortest time. The primary target was the high school graduate but college girls were also recruited. The selling point of the program was that the cadets would obtain a free education in a proud profession <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> essential service to their country. Appeals to join the Corps reached more than 7,000,000 newspaper and magazine readers, millions of radio listeners, and movie patrons around the country. Pleas were made in a thousand speeches, through 2,800,000 car-boards and billboards, and in several million leaflets. U.S. corporations donated $13,000,000 worth of advertising space and technical services to the program in one year. Few media sources lacked advertising for the Corps.|$|E

5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E
5|$|Ursa Minor is {{bordered by}} Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. Ursa Minor is colloquially {{known in the}} US as the Little Dipper because its seven {{brightest}} stars seem to form {{the shape of a}} dipper (ladle or scoop). The star {{at the end of the}} dipper handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E
