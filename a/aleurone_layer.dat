The retention of [3 H]GA 1 was unaffected by saturating levels of carrier GA 8. GA 1 retained by barley <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> that were incubated at 0. 5 C for 72 hours was able to induce α-amylase synthesis when <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> were subsequently washed and transferred to a gibberellin-free medium at 25 C...|$|R
40|$|H 2 S is a {{signaling}} molecule {{in plants}} and animals. Here we investigated {{the effects of}} H 2 S on programmed cell death (PCD) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers.</b> The H 2 S donor NaHS significantly delayed PCD in <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> isolated from imbibed embryoless barley grain. NaHS at 0. 25 [*]mM effectively reduced the accumulation of superoxide anion (·O 2 -), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), and malondialdehyde (MDA), promoted the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and decreased those of lipoxygenase (LOX) in isolated <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers.</b> Quantitative-PCR showed that NaHS treatment of aleurone tissue led to enhanced transcript levels of the antioxidant genes HvSOD 1, HvAPX, HvCAT 1, and HvCAT 2 and repressed transcript levels of HvLOX (lipoxygenase gene) and of two cysteine protease genes HvEPA and HvCP 3 - 31. NaHS treatment in gibberellic acid- (GA-) treated <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> also delayed the PCD process, reduced the content of ·O 2 -, and increased POD activity while decreasing LOX activity. Furthermore, α-amylase secretion in barley <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> was enhanced by NaHS treatment regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of GA. These data imply that H 2 S acted as an antioxidant in delaying PCD and enhances α-amylase secretion regardless of the presence of GA in barley <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} {{our effort}} to study the mode of action of abscisic acid (ABA) and its {{metabolites}} during seed germination, we have investigated the regulation of ABA metabolism in barley (Hordeum vulgare) <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> and a few other plant tissues. The rate of conversion of [3 H]ABA to [3 H]phaseic acid (PA), the first stable metabolite of ABA, is enhanced by 2 - to 5 -fold in barley <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> when the tissue is pretreated with ABA. However, the conversion of [3 H]PA to [3 H] dihydrophaseic acid (DPA), the next metabolite after PA, is not enhanced by pretreatment with either ABA or PA. The ABA enhancement of its own metabolism in barley <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> is detectable with a pretreatment of ABA ranging from 10 − 3 to 10 − 4 molar. This apparent self-induction of ABA conversion to PA can be observed after the barley <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> have been treated with 10 − 5 molar ABA for as short as 2 hours, and is inhibited by the transcription inhibitor, cordycepin (3 ′-deoxyadenosine), or the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide. The self-induction of ABA conversion to PA also occurs in wheat <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers,</b> but not in other plant tissues that have been investigated, including corn root tips, barley embryos, barley, and soybean leaf discs. It is probably a phenomenon unique to the <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> of some cereal grains. In view of the recent observations that ABA is able to induce new proteins in barley <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers,</b> we suggest that some of these ABA-induced proteins are involved in the conversion from ABA to PA in this tissue...|$|R

In cereals, the <b>aleurone</b> <b>layer</b> releases organic and phosphoric acids {{in order to keep the}} pH of the endosperm between a pH of 3.5 and 4. In barley, the <b>aleurone</b> <b>layer</b> also releases nitrite into the starchy endosperm and apoplast under anaerobic conditions. In addition, although the function is unclear, a certain class of hemoglobins (Hb)is present in the outer layer of living cells including the aleurone tissue in barley and rice seeds.|$|E

Amylase from 5 -day-old <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> could be separated into four rapidly moving bands with α-amylase activity.

These seven bands of amylase were electrophoretically identical to those observed when mature <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> are treated with gibberellic acid. Immature <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> failed to respond to exogenous gibberellic acid. In the starchy endosperm the seven bands of medium mobility were also present.

40|$|The heat-shock {{responses}} of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Hi- malaya) <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> incubated {{with or without}} gibberellic acid (GA 3) were compared. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that heat shock blocked the synthesis and secretion of secretory proteins from GA 3 -treated layers but not untreated layers. This suppression of secretory protein synthesis has been correlated with changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (F. C. Belanger, M. R. Brodl, T. -h. D. Ho [1986] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 83 : 1354 - 1358; L. Sticher, A. K. Biswas, D. S. Bush, R. L. Jones [1990] Plant Physiol 92 : 506 - 513). Our secretion data suggested that the ER membranes of <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> incubated without GA 3 may be more heat shock tolerant. To investigate this, the lipid profiles of membrane extracts in <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> labeled with [14 C]glycerol were examined.

Heat shock modestly increased the degree of fatty acid saturation in untreated <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers.</b> This same trend was noted in fatty acids isolated from ER membranes purified by continuous sucrose density centrifugation. We propose that increased fatty acid saturation may help sustain ER membrane function in heat-shocked <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> incubated in the absence of GA 3...|$|R
50|$|Aleurone (from Greek aleuron, flour) is {{a protein}} found in protein {{granules}} of maturing seeds and tubers.

50|$|The <b>aleurone</b> <b>layer</b> is {{important}} for both the developing seed and the mature plant. The aleurone tissue accumulates large quantities of oils and lipids that are useful during seed development. It is also a site of mineral storage and in some species, functions in seed dormancy. The aleurone may also express several pathogen-protective proteins including PR-4. Aleurone also serves as the most dietarily beneficial fraction in many brans. In addition, the aleurone tissue contains many protein-storing vacuoles known as protein bodies. In cereals with starchy endosperm, the aleurone contains about 30% of the kernel's proteins. In multicolored corn, anthocyanin pigments in the <b>aleurone</b> <b>layer</b> give the kernels a dark, bluish-black color.|$|E

40|$|The {{subcellular}} {{site of the}} posttranslational {{modification of}} α-amylase was investigated in <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Himalaya). <b>Aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> of Himalaya barley synthesize and secrete two groups of α-amylase isoforms, referred to as low-isoelectric point (low-pl) or HAMY 1 and high-pl or HAMY 2, when incubated in gibberellic acid and CaCl 2. Whereas homogenates of <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> contain four isoforms of HAMY 1 with pls 4. 90, 4. 72, 4. 64, and 4. 56, incubation media contain predominantly isoforms 4. 72 and 4. 56. Microsomal membranes isolated from <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> contain all four isoforms of HAMY 1. Microsomal membranes can be resolved into two peaks by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation: a peak of heavy membranes with endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (GApp) marker enzyme activities and a peak of light membranes with characteristics of the GApp. The heavy membranes contain proportionally more HAMY 1 pl 4. 90 and 4. 64 isoforms, whereas light membranes contain {{a higher proportion of}} pl 4. 72 and 4. 56 isoforms. Experiments with the ionophore monensin show that membranes of the GApp as well as the endoplasmic reticulum are involved in the posttranslational modification of HAMY 1 isoforms. Monensin inhibits the secretion of α-amylase and causes the enzyme to accumulate within the cell. Precursor forms of HAMY 1 accumulate in light membranes isolated from monensin-treated <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> indicating that the GApp is involved in the conversion of the precursor to the secreted forms of the enzyme...|$|R
40|$|The {{secretion}} of α-amylase from single isolated (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Himalaya) <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> was {{studied in}} an automated flow-through apparatus. The apparatus, {{consisting of a}} modified sample analyzer linked to a chart recorder, automatically samples the flow-through medium at 1 minute intervals and assays {{for the presence of}} α-amylase. The release of α-amylase from <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> begins after 5 to 6 hours of exposure to gibberellic acid and reaches a maximum rate after 10 to 12 hours. The release of α-amylase shows a marked dependence on Ca 2 +, {{and in the absence of}} Ca 2 + it is only 20 % of that in the presence of 10 millimolar Ca 2 +. Withdrawal of Ca 2 + from the flow-through medium results in the immediate cessation of enzyme release and addition of Ca 2 + causes immediate resumption of the release process. The effect of Ca 2 + is concentration-dependent, being half-maximal at 1 millimolar Ca 2 + and saturated at 10 millimolar Ca 2 +. Ruthenium red, which blocks Ca 2 + but not Mg 2 + efflux from barley <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers,</b> renders α-amylase release insensitive to Ca 2 + withdrawal. Inhibitors of respiratory metabolism cause a burst of α-amylase release which lasts for 0. 5 to 5 hours. Following this phase of enhanced α-amylase release, the rate of release declines to zero. Pretreatment of <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> with HCl prior to incubation in HCN also causes a burst of α-amylase release, indicating that the inhibitor is affecting the secretion of α-amylase and not its movement through the cell wall. The rapid inhibition of α-amylase release upon incubation of <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> at low temperature (5 °C) or in 0. 5 molar mannitol also indicates that enzyme release is dependent on a metabolically linked process and is not diffusion-limited. This conclusion is supported by cytochemical observations which show that, although the cell wall matrix of <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> undergoes extensive digestion after gibberellin treatment, the innermost part of the cell wall is not degraded and could influence enzyme release...|$|R

No difference was observed in α-amylase mRNA levels between layers incubated for 12 hours in 2. 5 micromolar GA 3 with 5 millimolar CaCl 2 and layers incubated in GA 3 alone. RNA isolated from layers incubated for 12 hours in GA 3 with and without Ca 2 + was translated in vitro and was found to produce the same complement of translation products regardless of the presence of Ca 2 + in the incubation medium. Immunoprecipitation of translation products showed that the RNA for α-amylase synthesized in Ca 2 +-deprived <b>aleurone</b> <b>layers</b> was translatable. Ca 2 + is required for the synthesis of α-amylase isozymes 3 and 4 at a step after mRNA accumulation and processing...|$|R
