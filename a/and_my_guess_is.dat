Everything round you is changing in shape daily and hourly, as you will find out the longer you live; and therefore it is most reasonable to suppose that this glen has changed its shape, as everything else on earth has done. Besides, I told you not that Madam How had made the glen, but that she was making it, and as yet has only half finished.

50|$|The first France Test at Ballymore held special {{significance}} {{for me because}} I was playing alongside Loaney for the first time.

40|$|Opinions {{about the}} {{importance}} of social learning of information or inno- vations among animals in nature vary dramatically. Dugatkin (2000, p. 200) sees culture everywhere: “The vast array of animal behaviors that are touched by the long fingers of culture continues to grow, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that we have seen only the tip of the iceberg,” and “cultural transmission and gene/culture interactions are serious, underestimated forces in evolu- tionary biology” (ibid., p. 28). De Waal (2001, p. 363) agrees: “The world is chock-full of feathered and furry animals that learn their life’s lessons, habits, and songs from one another. ” Others are not convinced, arguing that social learning is invoked spuriously to explain patterns in nature, in particular among great apes and cetaceans, that are explained more parsi- moniously by using developmental models that assume individual acquisi- tion of behavior patterns often attributed to culture (Galef 1992, 2003 a Heyes 1993; Tomasello 1994; Laland and Hoppitt 2003; Laland and Janik 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|We are at one {{of those}} moments in the course of human events when a number of {{bounding}} technologies are coming together – computers and computing, including mobile computing, neuroscience, biometrics and sensors. When I say computers and computing, I mean the com-putational capabilities of the machines, the computations that make the machines useful as well as advances in networking such as increasing available bandwidth and decreasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, {{since the end of the}} Cold War, there have been heartening develop-ments in analysis of the concept of deterrence. Deterrence, I suspect, is at least a million years old. When, for the first time, a primitive human raised a club toward another but did not use it, he made a deterrent calcula-tion that was at once simple and complex: “I would not want my skull bashed in with this thing <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that you would not want that either. ” He could see in his opponent’s reaction whether deterrence was working. There was no effete analysis. He had the capability and demonstrated will and he was thoroughly prepared for deterrence to fail. If, for whatever reason, his opponent persisted, he would use the club to bash his brains out. And anyone within earshot would take heed. Modern ana-lysts take notice. It probably went something quite like that, although we have no evidence of it. However, we do begin to have written records of deterrence, successful and unsuccess-ful, with Thucydides, 2, 400 years ago. By the time of th...|$|E
5000|$|Robert X. Cringely, {{author of}} Accidental Empires and {{creator of the}} documentaries Triumph of the Nerds and Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, argues that [...] "the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher's {{portrayal}} of Jobs, while not spot-on, is pretty darned good. He certainly has the look down and the walk. But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There {{are a lot of}} historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with Walter Isaacson's book: something happened during Steve's NeXT years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that [...] "at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone suggests that [...] "Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance" [...] but also notes that [...] "Jobs is a one-man show that needed to go for broke <b>and</b> doesn't. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that Jobs would give it a swat." [...] Contributor for rogerebert.com, Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, [...] "Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to Apple Inc. guru Steve Jobs and - more importantly - what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's Behind the Music." [...] She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for The New York Times, writer Manohla Dargis writes that Jobs was [...] "inevitably unsatisfying" [...] and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves.|$|R
40|$|For {{several years}} I have edited a small, {{in-house}} journal for the School of Education’s Technology Advisory Committee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), a journal which is {{distributed to the}} faculty and posted on the School of Education’s website. Until last issue. The last issue I submitted—while dutifully {{made available to the}} faculty and staff—never made it onto the website. No one offered an explanation, and I never inquired about the matter—after all, I was still able to add the activity to <b>my</b> already portly <b>and</b> now largely useless post-retirement vita—but I remained mildly curious about it and wondered whether it was a simple oversight or something “unseemly” I’d written in the newsletter. After some months, I decided that it was the latter and that it was likely the article I’d written about a graduate student at MIT who had developed a computer program that generates random Mission Statements. (Sample: Our mission is to continue to efficiently supply innovative opportunities in order to professionally facilitate high-payoff technology for 100 % customer satisfaction. In addition, we strive to continually leverage existing error-free resources such that we may continue to synergistically maintain corporate data.) It was, I figured, simply a matter of poor timing on my part. The university, it turns out, {{was in the midst of}} a SACS accreditation visit and no doubt had dozens of vision and mission statement “specialists” poring over its school <b>and</b> departmental websites. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that the dean of education didn’t want to take the chance of offending one of the SACS folks—accreditation personnel are notoriously lacking in a sense of humor—and so requested that the Technology Committee not add my last issue to the school’s website.

2500|$|Among {{the songs}} {{recorded}} for the album were Parsons and Battin's [...] "Yesterday's Train", a gentle {{meditation on the}} theme of reincarnation; a cover of Lowell George and Bill Payne's [...] "Truck Stop Girl", sung by Clarence White; and a light-hearted reading of Lead Belly's [...] "Take a Whiff on Me". The album also included the Battin-penned [...] "Well Come Back Home", a heartfelt comment on the Vietnam War. Battin explained the song's genesis to author Johnny Rogan during a 1979 interview: [...] "I was personally touched by the Vietnam situation, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> feelings about it came out in that song. I had a high school friend who died out there <b>and</b> I <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> thoughts <b>were</b> on him at the time." [...] Battin also revealed in the same interview that he couldn't decide whether to name the song [...] "Well Come Back Home" [...] or [...] "Welcome Back Home" [...] but finally settled on the former. Curiously, although the song was listed on the original album and the original CD issue of (Untitled) as [...] "Well Come Back Home", it was listed as [...] "Welcome Back Home" [...] on the (Untitled)/(Unissued) re-release in 2000, possibly in error. With a running time of 7:40, the song is the longest studio recording in The Byrds' entire oeuvre. In addition, the song also continues the tradition of ending The Byrds' albums on an unusual note, with Battin chanting the Nichiren Buddhist mantra [...] "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song.|$|R
