5000|$|..... It was amazing. First of all shes {{probably}} the diva of all time, {{in terms of}} voices... I was under contract to Columbia at the time - her studio.

It was a little nerve wracking, as I recall. Shes a perfectionist... Shes impeccable about everything, impeccable about every note. I want to be that way; its just that I dont have the equipment that she has to do it. She is a wonderful, wonderful person. Shes one of the most intelligent persons Ive ever been around in my life, and shes very funny and has a humongous heart. Shes a really terrific person. Don Johnson ...|$|E

5000|$|Ladies and gentlemen, {{you have}} no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor.

[...] That's right, that's what he said. And I told that boy last night that nothing is impossible. Now they told Columbus to sail across the ocean was impossible. They told the settlers to live in a wild land was impossible. They told the Wright Brothers to fly was impossible. And they probably told Neil Armstrong a walk on the moon was impossible. They tell Evel Knievel to jump a motorcycle across the Grand Canyon is impossible, and they say that every day. A Roman General in the time of Caesar had the motto: [...] "If it is possible, it is done. If it is impossible, it will be done." [...] And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I live by.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{wrote it}} in my {{apartment}} in Kosovska Street. Slow tempo, my voice additionally low and only three chords, but I think it has a good atmosphere. The first song with atmosphere of which I was completely satisfied. The arrangements were done by Bata, we didnt interfere into his job. I {{think he did it}} great. Actually, Its a very simple song. In it I showed that sometimes the simplest is the best. Somewhere between a ballad and a lullaby. For the Hit meseca of the Month show everybody used to choose a song with which they would be represented. We chose [...] "Zažmuri". If someone asks you: What should a song for Hit meseca be like, the answer is: Fast and with a hit potential. Thats why the guys from PGP-RTB label went mad: <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>crazy,</b> why didnt you send one of the fast ones? But it happened that the guys from Hit meseca liked it. They gave us a great budget and two days to record a video, which was amazing. The videos were usually recorded for three hours... And we made the dummest possible video. Me, with a dog, on the snow... And then were hugging in some apartment. Totally crazy. All together, it was a piece of shit. Thats what the director of the video, Milutin Petrović said later, so I can say it now. It was that bad that they played it on one show, on the second, and for the third one they called us to perform live, they didnt want to play the video, it was that awful. Before that, someone from Bijelo Dugme, I cant remember if it was Ipe Ivandić or Zoran Redžić, said to us: It isnt easy to go with the ballad first. And we reached top of the Hit mesecas chart." ...|$|E
