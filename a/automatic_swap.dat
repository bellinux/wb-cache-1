25|$|In late 2007 a {{deal was}} {{proposed}} to swap land {{between the state}} and the JNF, thus rendering redundant the Ariel Bill, deemed by some to be racist, while allowing the JNF to continue leasing its lands only to Jews. After the initial land swap, urban JNF land sold in future to non-Jews would include an <b>automatic</b> <b>swap</b> mechanism: the fund would transfer the land to the ILA, and in exchange would receive the purchase price plus a similar-sized plot in the Negev.|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} for <b>automatic</b> <b>swapped</b> views detection is proposed. No analogues {{in literature}} {{were found for}} this problem solution. It is based on occlusion detection and motion vectors histogram. The algorithm was tested on 780 frames from 13 movies. The recall diagrams were constructed using two parameters. The complexity is estimated. The drawbacks are analyzed and further directions are proposed...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel method to solve image analogy {{problems}} : it allows {{to learn the}} relation between paired images present in training data, and then generalize and generate images that correspond to the relation, but were never seen in the training set. Therefore, we call the method Conditional Analogy Generative Adversarial Network (CAGAN), as {{it is based on}} adversarial training and employs deep convolutional neural networks. An especially interesting application of that technique is <b>automatic</b> <b>swapping</b> of clothing on fashion model photos. Our work has the following contributions. First, the definition of the end-to-end trainable CAGAN architecture, which implicitly learns segmentation masks without expensive supervised labeling data. Second, experimental results show plausible segmentation masks and often convincing swapped images, given the target article. Finally, we discuss the next steps for that technique: neural network architecture improvements and more advanced applications.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of an <b>automatic</b> battery <b>swap</b> system for the prolonged activities of home robots. A battery swap station is proposed to implement battery off-line recharging and on-line exchanging functions. It consists of a loading and unloading mechanism, a shifting mechanism, a locking device and a shell. The home robot is a palm-sized wheeled robot with an onboard camera and a removable battery case in the front. It communicates with the battery swap station wirelessly through ZigBee. The influences of battery case deflection and robot docking deflection on the battery swap operations have been investigated. The experimental results show that it takes an average time of 84. 2 s to complete the battery swap operations. The home robot {{does not have to}} wait several hours for the batteries to be fully charged. The proposed battery swap system is proved to be efficient in home robot applications that need the robots to work continuously over a long period...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare and}} {{correlate}} optic nerve head parameters obtained byHeidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) with short-wavelength <b>automatic</b> perimetry (<b>SWAP)</b> indices in eyes with ocular hypertension (OHT). METHODS: One hundred and forty-six patients with OHT {{included in the}} present study. All subjects had reliable SWAP and HRT measurements performed within a 2 wk period. The eyes were classified as normal/abnormal according to visual field criteria and Moorfields regression analysis (MRA). Correlations between visual field indices and HRT parameters were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient (r). RESULTS: Twenty-nine eyes (19. 9 %) had SWAP defects. Twenty-nine eyes (19. 9 %) were classified as abnormal according to global MRA. Six eyes (4. 1 %) had abnormal global MRA and SWAP defects. The k statistic is 0. 116 (P = 0. 12) indicating a very poor agreement between the methods. No statistical significant correlation between HRT and SWAP parameters was detected. CONCLUSION: SWAP defects may coexist with abnormalities of optic disc detected by HRT in eyes with OHT. In most eyes, however, the two methods detect different glaucoma properties...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare {{retinal nerve}} fiber layer (RNFL) {{measurements}} in normal and glaucoma subjects with short-wavelength <b>automatic</b> perimetry (<b>SWAP)</b> abnormalities and in chronic primary open-angle glaucoma (CPOAG) patients using {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). Methods: Forty-eight eyes of normal subjects, 34 eyes of glaucoma suspects with SWAP abnormalities, and 38 eyes of early CPOAG subjects were recruited. All normal and glaucoma suspects had normal conventional automated perimetry visual field results. All participants underwent full clinical ophthalmologic evaluation followed by OCT RNFL measurements. Results: Compared with normal controls, OCT RNFL thickness was significantly lower in glaucoma suspects with abnormal SWAP (inferotemporal and superotemporal thickness values) and CPOAG patients (average, superior, inferior, inferotemporal, and superotemporal thickness values) (P < 0. 01). Some parameters {{were found to be}} significantly lower in CPOAG patients than the glaucoma suspects with abnormal SWAP (average, inferior, inferotemporal, and superotemporal thickness values) (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: OCT RNFL measurements appear to correlate well with SWAP abnormalities in glaucoma, and may detect glaucomatous damage earlier than standard conventional automated perimetry. This study suggests that OCT may recognize the earliest evidence of structure alterations in CPOAG. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
