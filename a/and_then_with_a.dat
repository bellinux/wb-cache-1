5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Kouma {{remained}} in the Army. He served a second tour of duty as a recruiter, and then two tours as a tank commander, first at a unit in Fort Carson, Colorado, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> second unit in Germany. Though he {{remained in}} the Army for 31 years, Kouma did not see combat after his time in Korea. Kouma retired in 1971 at the age of 52, and lived a quiet life in McDaniels, Kentucky, after retirement. Kouma died on December 19, 1993, and was buried in the Fort Knox post cemetery. The Tank Platoon Gunnery Excellence competition at Fort Knox was subsequently named in Kouma's honor. There is a dining facility named in his honor at Fort Knox on Eisenhower Road.|$|E
5|$|In the {{diffused}} lighting camouflage project, the Royal Canadian Navy experimented with variable counter-illumination camouflage to match horizon light levels and minimize ships' silhouettes during prolonged arctic twilight. During the experiments, {{one side of}} the test ship was faintly illuminated by projectors mounted outboard. Results were improved with the use of blue-green filters, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> photocell to measure the brightness of the night sky. The ship's visibility was reduced, but the technology was inconvenient and never adopted in practice.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{football}} {{improved his}} confidence {{and with it}} his effectiveness. Under Lee Clark, he started regularly but was often substituted; under Gary Rowett, who replaced Clark in late October, he played every minute of Birmingham's league fixtures, usually partnering Stephen Gleeson in a 4–2–3–1 formation, until injuring a knee in mid-February. He missed the 4–3 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion, in which the local newspaper attributed Birmingham's defensive frailties to his absence. On his return, away at Ipswich Town, his presence achieved more in attack than defence, twice– with a header <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> volley– restoring Birmingham to only one goal behind before Ipswich secured a 4–2 win in stoppage time. Rowett signed Nottingham Forest midfielder Robert Tesche on loan on 2 March. Initially he played alongside Davis {{in place of the}} suspended Gleeson, and then as part of a three-man midfield, but when Rowett reverted to 4–2–3–1, it was Davis who missed out.|$|E

5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus sample is then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The sample is applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} of 2-vinylpyridine is {{for use in}} the production of a latex terpolymer of 2-vinylpyridine, styrene, and butadiene, for use as a tire-cord binder. The tire cord is treated first with a resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> terpolymer made from 15% 2-vinylpyridine, styrene, and butadiene. This treatment gives the close bonding of tire cord to rubber essential in the production of tires.|$|E

25|$|With carbon nucleophiles such as Grignard reagents, acyl {{chlorides}} generally react {{first to}} give the ketone <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> second equivalent to the tertiary alcohol. A notable exception is the reaction of acyl halides with certain organocadmium reagents which stops at the ketone stage. The nucleophilic reaction with Gilman reagents (lithium diorganocopper compounds) also afford ketones, due to their lesser reactivity. Acid chlorides of aromatic acids are generally less reactive those of alkyl acids and thus somewhat more rigorous conditions are required for reaction.|$|E

25|$|Qantas {{has also}} {{expanded}} into the New Zealand {{domestic air travel}} market, firstly with a shareholding in Air New Zealand <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> franchise takeover of Ansett New Zealand. In 2003, Qantas attempted and failed to obtain regulatory approval to purchase a larger (but still minority) stake in Air New Zealand. Subsequently Qantas stepped up competition on the trans-Tasman routes, introducing Jetstar to New Zealand. British Airways sold its 18.5% stake in Qantas in September 2004 for £425million, though keeping its close ties with Qantas intact.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} Nineties, {{two types of}} {{governmental}} coalitions characterised the politics of post-war Italy. The first were “centrist” coalitions led by the Christian Democracy party together with smaller parties: the PSDI, the PRT, and the PLI. The first democratic government (1947) excluded both the PCI and the PSI, which brought about the political period known as “centrist government,” which ruled over Italian politics from 1948 to 1963. The centre-left coalition (DC-PRI-PSDI-PSI) was {{the second type of}} coalition that characterised Italian politics, coming about in 1963 when the PSI (formerly the opposition party) went into government with the DC. This coalition lasted in parliament first for 12 years (from 1964 to 1976) <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> revival in the Eighties that lasted until the start of the Nineties.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 19th century Delaware {{politics}} {{was characterized by}} a conservative downstate, agrarian and small business majority, in opposition to a Wilmington based industrialist minority. This majority was led into the Whig Party by John M. Clayton, but when that party broke up {{over the issue of}} slavery, generally moved over to a conservative Democratic Party. As the sectional issues intensified with the coming of the Civil War, this majority became impossibly conflicted between its certain loyalty to the Union and its equally certain view that decisions about property, including slaves, belonged with the states. The result was first an effort by many to find a non-existent middle ground, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> much diminished majority, entry into constant and bitter conflict with the Republican minority centered in Wilmington and supported by the Federal government.|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{was born}} in Birmingham, {{the son of an}} amateur organist. He began playing the piano at age four, and by six had improvised a tune that he reused in one of his mature works forty years later. He took up the violin when he was eight and played in an {{orchestra}} at twelve. In the same year, he became the organist at his church and was composing music by age 19. His parents did not approve of his taking music up as a profession, and he was sent to work first with an analytical chemist <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> land surveyor. According to The Musical Times, he did not take up music as a profession until he was in his twenties. In 1864 he was awarded the first prize for anthems by the College of Organists.|$|E
25|$|The team, surmising {{that they}} would likely be compromised, retreated to a {{fallback}} position. Within an hour, the SEAL Reconnaissance and Surveillance team was attacked by Shah and his men who were armed with RPK light machine guns, AK-47s, RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenades, and 82mm mortars. The intensity of the incoming fire, combined {{with the type of}} attack, forced the SEAL team into the northeast gulch of Sawtalo Sar, on the Shuryek Valley side of Sawtalo Sar. The SEALs made a number of attempts to contact their combat operations center with a multi-band radio <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> satellite phone. The team could not establish consistent communication, other than for a period long enough to indicate that they were under attack. Three of the four team members were killed, and the only survivor, Marcus Luttrell, was left unconscious with a number of fractures and other serious wounds. He regained consciousness and was rescued by local Pashtun, who ultimately saved his life, as in his condition, without assistance, he would surely have been killed or captured by the Taliban.|$|E

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{arrangements}} on Silent Alarm are strongly percussive. The leading song, [...] "Like Eating Glass", {{was inspired by}} a remix of The Smiths' [...] "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" [...] Okereke heard in 2002. Its drum track was deliberately mixed louder than usual to add emphasis to the album's opening. [...] "Helicopter" [...] has a quick tempo of 171beats per minute, while [...] "Positive Tension" [...] begins with a solitary bassline and builds up pace, first with a rhythmic drumming pattern, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guitar solo towards its conclusion. [...] "Banquet" [...] involves lead guitar and rhythm guitar playing in syncopation, while [...] "Blue Light" [...] has a slower tempo and a crescendo towards the end. During the studio sessions, the Bloc Party EP version of [...] "She's Hearing Voices" [...] was reworked to include reverberation and stereo separation of the instrumental parts. [...] "This Modern Love" [...] begins minimally with panned vocals before the rhythm section enters the mix and the song intensifies.|$|E
500|$|On 12 August, the Football Association {{announced}} that Pogba would be suspended for Manchester United's opening Premier League fixture of the 2016–17 season against Bournemouth, due to two yellow cards he had accumulated {{in the previous}} season's edition of the Coppa Italia with Juventus. On 19 August, {{he made his first}} appearance since returning to the club in a 2–0 home victory over Southampton in the Premier League. After the 2–1 defeat at home in the first Manchester Derby of the season on 10 September, Pogba was criticized for his lack of discipline in positioning by pundit Jamie Carragher. Pogba, however, soon recovered to form and scored his first Premier League goal for United with a header against defending champions Leicester City in a 4–1 home win on 24 September. He then scored twice, once from the penalty spot <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strike from distance, in a Europa League tie against Fenerbahçe on 20 October. Manager José Mourinho defended Pogba after the game, criticizing football's [...] "Einsteins" [...] for being too quick to judge the player.|$|E
