All the <b>armatures</b> were {{manufactured}} in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing. A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for Creation and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the Venture, railway cars, and war planes were built.|$|E
2500|$|In this method, {{power is}} {{transmitted}} between two rotating <b>armatures,</b> {{one in the}} transmitter {{and one in the}} receiver, which rotate synchronously, coupled together by a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets on the <b>armatures.</b> [...] The transmitter armature is turned either by or as the rotor of an electric motor, and its magnetic field exerts torque on the receiver armature, turning it.

5000|$|Since an <b>armature</b> {{is wound}} with coils of wire, a {{magnetic}} field is {{set up in the}} <b>armature</b> whenever a current flows in the coils. This field is at right angles to the generator field, and is called cross magnetization of the <b>armature.</b> The effect of the <b>armature</b> field is to distort the generator field and shift the neutral plane. The neutral plane is the position where the <b>armature</b> windings are moving parallel to the magnetic flux lines, that is why an axis lying in this plane is called as magnetic neutral axis (MNA). This effect is known as <b>armature</b> reaction and is proportional to the current flowing in the <b>armature</b> coils.|$|R

50|$|After <b>armature</b> formation, the {{plasmoid}} is then accelerated {{down the}} length of the railgun by a current pulse driven through one electrode, through the <b>armature,</b> and out the other electrode, creating a large magnetic field behind the <b>armature.</b> Since the driver current through the <b>armature</b> is also moving through and normal to a self-generated magnetic field, the <b>armature</b> particles experience a Lorentz force, accelerating them {{down the length}} of the gun.

2500|$|As the {{locomotive}} accelerates, the now-rotating motor <b>armatures</b> {{will start to}} generate a counter-electromotive force (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose {{the output of the}} main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, {{the locomotive}} will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration.

2500|$|In the exhibition, “Dark Icons,” (New York, 1992) Unger was {{overcoming}} a bout {{of cancer}} that helped to broaden the metaphorical range of her work from a personal scream of victimization to a generalized but powerful meditation on mortality.

2500|$|These early {{headphones}} used moving iron drivers, {{with either}} single-ended or balanced <b>armatures.</b> [...] The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles {{of a permanent}} magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm. [...] The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves. [...] The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor sound quality. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their impedance varied; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75ohms. Those used with early wireless radio {{had to be more}} sensitive and were made with more turns of finer wire. Impedance of 1000 to 2000ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and triode receivers.

50|$|In the <b>armature,</b> an {{electromotive}} force {{is created by}} the relative motion of the <b>armature</b> and the field. When the machine acts in the motor mode, this EMF opposes the <b>armature</b> current, and the <b>armature</b> converts electrical power to mechanical power {{in the form of}} torque (unless the machine is stalled), and transfers it to the load via the shaft. When the machine acts in the generator mode, the <b>armature</b> EMF drives the <b>armature</b> current, and shaft mechanical power is converted to electrical power and transferred to the load. In an induction generator, these distinctions are blurred, since the generated power is drawn from the stator, which would normally be considered the field.|$|R
