50|$|Zener pinning is the {{influence}} of a dispersion of fine particles on the movement of low- and high <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries through a polycrystalline material. Small particles act to prevent the motion of such boundaries by exerting a pinning pressure which counteracts the driving force pushing the boundaries. Zener pinning is very important in materials processing as it has a strong influence on recovery, recrystallization and grain growth.|$|E
5000|$|A precise {{definition}} of recrystallization {{is difficult to}} state as the process is strongly related to several other processes, most notably recovery and grain growth. In some cases {{it is difficult to}} precisely define the point at which one process begins and another ends. Doherty et al. (1997) defined recrystallization as:"... the formation of a new grain structure in a deformed material by the formation and migration of high <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries driven by the stored energy of deformation.

50|$|Thus {{the process}} can be {{differentiated}} from recovery (where high <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries do not migrate) and grain growth (where the driving force is only due to the reduction in boundary area).Recrystallization may occur during or after deformation (during cooling or a subsequent heat treatment, for example). The former is termed dynamic while the latter is termed static. In addition, recrystallization may occur in a discontinuous manner, where distinct new grains form and grow, or a continuous manner, where the microstructure gradually evolves into a recrystallised microstructure. The different mechanisms by which recrystallization and recovery occur are complex {{and in many cases}} remain controversial. The following description is primarily applicable to static discontinuous recrystallization, which is the most classical variety and probably the most understood. Additional mechanisms include (geometric) dynamic recrystallization and strain induced boundary migration.|$|E
5000|$|When metals are {{subjected}} to [...] "cold working" [...] (deformation at temperatures which are relatively low {{as compared to the}} material's absolute melting temperature, Tm, i.e., typically less than 0.4 Tm) the dislocation density increases due to the formation of new geometrically necessary dislocations and dislocation multiplication. The consequent increasing overlap between the strain fields of adjacent dislocations gradually increases the resistance to further dislocation motion. This causes a hardening of the metal as deformation progresses. This effect is known as strain hardening (also “work hardening”). Tangles of dislocations are found at the early stage of deformation and appear as non well-defined boundaries; the process of dynamic recovery leads eventually to the formation of a cellular structure containing boundaries with misorientation lower than 15° (low <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries). In addition, adding pinning points that inhibit the motion of dislocations, such as alloying elements, can introduce stress fields that ultimately strengthen the material by requiring a higher applied stress to overcome the pinning stress and continue dislocation motion.|$|E
50|$|BSCCO was {{the first}} HTS {{material}} {{to be used for}} making practical superconducting wires. All HTS have an extremely short coherence length, of the order of 1.6 nm. This means that the grains in a polycrystalline wire must be extremely good contact - they must be atomically smooth. Further, because the superconductivity resides substantially only in the copper-oxygen planes the grains must be crystallographically aligned. BSCCO is therefore a good candidate because its grains can be aligned either by melt processing or by mechanical deformation. The double bismuth oxide layer is only weakly bonded by van der Waals forces. So like graphite or mica, deformation causes slip on these BiO planes and grains tend to deform into aligned plates. Further, because BSCCO has n=1, 2 and 3 members these naturally tend to accommodate low <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries so that indeed they remain atomically smooth. Thus first-generation HTS wires (referred to as 1G) have been manufactured for many years now by companies such as American Superconductor Corporation (AMSC) in the USA and Sumitomo in Japan - though AMSC has now abandoned BSCCO wire in favour of 2G wire based on YBCO.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> of face veneer on surface wave {{velocity}} and dynamic shear modulus of {{three types of}} wood-based composites were examined using a surface wave propagation method. It was found that grain-angle dependence of surface wave velocity and dynamic shear modulus indeed exists for wood-based composites. <b>Grain</b> <b>angles</b> of face veneer {{were found to have}} substantial effects on the surface wave velocities and dynamic shear moduli of wood–plastic composite (WP), wood–fiberboard composite (WF), and wood–metal composite (WM). The orthotropic properties of the three composites were defined as the ratio of surface wave velocities at 0 ° and 90 ° <b>grain</b> <b>angles</b> (V 0 /V 90), which were 3.7, 2.2, and 2.0 for WP, WF, and WM, respectively. For WP, WF, and WM, the dynamic shear moduli in the 90 ° <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> of face veneer were approximately 7 %, 19 %, and 25 % of that in the 0 ° <b>grain</b> <b>angle,</b> respectively. The relationships between <b>grain</b> <b>angles</b> of face veneer and the shear moduli of the three types of wood-based composites could be represented by Hankinson’s equation, and their optimal n values were 2.1, 1.2, and 1.3 for WP, WF, and WM, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Poor shape {{stability}} of sawn softwood timber, causes substantial economic losses for sawmills {{and the building}} industry. Sawn timber twist is regarded {{to be the most}} severe deformation and {{has been shown to be}} controlled by intrinsic wood properties like wood shrinkage and spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angle.</b> The aim of the studies this thesis is based upon was to investigate the possibility to improve sawn timber shape stability, by genetic selection of genotypes of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) with a favourable spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angle.</b> Genetic parameters were estimated for the spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> in the mature wood of trees in four progeny trials (age 27 – 36 years) and two clonal trials (age 19 years) of Norway spruce. In addition, in a 36 -year-old Scots pine progeny trial, the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was measured and shape stability traits of the boards sawn from sampled trees were assessed. The estimates of genetic standard deviation (0. 7 °– 0. 9 °) and heritability (0. 29 – 0. 42) in the mature wood of both species suggested that <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> could be altered by genetic selection. The <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> measured in single annual rings of Scots pine showed substantial phenotypic correlations (0. 54 – 0. 70) with the twist of small sawn timber dried to a 12 % moisture content. As an example, twist could potentially be reduced by 0. 3 °– 0. 7 ° by selecting 20 % of the parents displaying the lowest <b>grain</b> <b>angle,</b> thereby appreciably decreasing the percentage of excessively twisted boards. <b>Grain</b> <b>angle</b> under bark exhibited non-significant genetic correlations, close to zero, with growth traits, stem form, and branch traits in both species, and with pilodyn penetration in Norway spruce, suggesting that genetic selection for this trait would not generate any appreciable response in the other traits. The results of the studies imply that the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> measured under bark is utilisable in terms of genetic parameter estimation and for predicting the twist propensity of small sawn timber. This suggests that there is potential to improve sawn timber shape stability by genetic selection for a lower <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> under bark and thus reducing the twist of sawn timber...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{is a major}} {{construction}} material that is used in many contexts, and for different purposes. Serious problems may arise, however, when moisture related deformations as twist occur in wood used in different types of building structures, joinery and furniture. Twist can be explained to a great degree by the helical deviation of the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> {{in relation to the}} longitudinal direction of the log or the sawn board. Wood fibres form a spiral within the tree, and this is a natural occurrence that is named spiral grain. The wood fibres close to the pith in Norway spruce form a left-handed spiral. In most trees the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> turns over to be right-handed with time. Sawn timber that exhibits large <b>grain</b> <b>angles</b> lead to problems of shape stability and stiffness in finished constructions. In this thesis the spiral grain in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was stated as well as the effect on sawn timber. The material was based on sample trees from Sweden and Finland. Samples were taken in twenty-two stands at different heights in tree. From six stands studs were sawn and dried for measuring twist and other deformations. The spiral grain was measured with the method scribe test on 390 log discs taken at the top-end of the logs. Account was given concerning changes in <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> from pith to bark, regarding both increasing annual ring numbers and distance from pith. The development of <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> over tree age was utilized to study whether annual growth, size of tree, height in tree as well as silvicultural treatments affected spiral grain. Moreover, the relation between <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> and distance to pith (in mm) was used to forecast twist in sawn timber. The left-handed <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was at its greatest between the fourth and eighth annual rings. Thereafter for most trees the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> turned from left-handed to right-handed in a linear fashion, in a manner that was unique for each individual tree. The pattern of spiral grain differed significantly between different stands, regarding change of inclination with increasing age or distance from pith. The culmination of the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> close to the pith occurred at somewhat higher age higher up in the trunk. The <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> decreased faster in top logs than it did in the butt logs. The largest trees within a stand had a <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> that turned to right in a slower way than smaller ones. The thinning strength and type of thinning regime also affected the character of spiral grain in the remaining trees in a stand. There was an indication that strong thinnings, where fast growing trees are retained, may lead to more individuals in a stand that exhibit high <b>grain</b> <b>angles</b> under bark. With knowledge of the size and direction of the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> under bark, and the diameter of the log, calculations can be made that show how twisted the sawn timber will be after drying. This can be used for deciding whether an individual log can profitably be sawn and processed further or not. The <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> under bark can be used to remove trees showing the greatest degree of spiral grain already in the first thinning. Silvicultural methods aiming at even and dense Norway spruce stands, which normally is practised in Scandinavia, will probably result in timber with relatively low risk concerning large <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> and subsequent risk for twist in sawn wood...|$|R

Age-age genetic and phenotypic correlations and the optimum selection age for spiral grain were also calculated. Wood {{samples were collected}} from 95 29 -year-old trees belonging to 19 full-sib families in a progeny test plantation in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> data were obtained by the splitting method. Mean <b>grain</b> <b>angles</b> at growth rings used for the analyses were calculated as the arithmetic mean of angles up to respective rings. Generally, the additive genetic variance for mean <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> decreased with increasing ring number. Although dominance variance was comparatively high near the pith, it decreased to zero in subsequent growth rings. Highest heritability estimates of mean <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> occurred at ring 4 and then declined with age, ranging from 0.45 down to 0.20. Age-age phenotypic correlations were higher than genetic correlations, especially those involving early growth rings. Optimum selection ages for spiral grain based on genetic and phenotypic correlations were estimated as 3 and 4 years (cambial age), respectively, in which maximum gain efficiency per year were obtained.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{continuum}} model to compute the energy of low <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries for any given degrees of freedom (arbitrary rotation axis, rotation angle and boundary plane orientation) based on a continuum dislocation structure. In our continuum model, we minimize the grain boundary energy associated with the dislocation structure subject to the constraint of Frank's formula for dislocations with all possible Burgers vectors. This constrained minimization problem is solved by the penalty method by which it is turned into an unconstrained minimization problem. The grain boundary dislocation structure is approximated by a network of straight dislocations that predicts the energy and dislocation densities of the grain boundaries. The grain boundary energy based on the calculated dislocation structure is able to incorporate its anisotropic nature. We use our continuum model to systematically study the energy of $ $ low <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries in fcc Al with any boundary plane orientation and all six possible Burgers vectors.

The dependence of the Poisson’s ratio and trend of the viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio on <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> were investigated. The Poisson’s ratios were found to reach their extrema when the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was around 30 °. Moreover, the Poisson’s ratio in the LT plane was observed to be negative when the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was {{in the range of}} 15 °– 45 °. Comparing the experimental results with theoretical values obtained from the theory of orthotropic elasticity, it was revealed that, although the Poisson’s ratio reached an extremum in both cases, the specific values did not match, especially when the angle was between 15 ° and 45 °. Furthermore, the temporal variation of the viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio was found to depend on the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> and the measurement plane. It also appeared to be affected by the Poisson’s ratio, showing an increasing tendency above a specific Poisson’s ratio (Japanese cypress: 0.196, Kalopanax: 0.102) and a decreasing tendency below it, regardless of the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> and measurement plane.

In our continuum framework, we define a dislocation density potential function on the dislocation array surface or grain boundary to describe the orientation dependent continuous distribution of dislocations in a very simple and accurate way.

The continuum framework recovers the classical Read-Shockley energy formula when the long-range elastic fields of the low <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries are canceled out. Applications of our continuum framework in this paper are focused on dislocation structures on static planar and nonplanar low <b>angle</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries and misfitting interfaces.
