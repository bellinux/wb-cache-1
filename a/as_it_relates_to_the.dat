In such settings aggression can involve bodily contact such as biting, hitting or pushing, but most conflicts are settled by threat displays and intimidating thrusts that cause no physical harm. This form of aggression may include the display of body size, antlers, claws or teeth; stereotyped signals including facial expressions; vocalizations such as bird song; the release of chemicals; and changes in coloration. The term agonistic behaviour is sometimes {{used to refer to}} these forms of behavior.|$|E

25|$|The emblem for the 2006 annual {{meetings}} of the IMF and the World Bank Group is gold in colour, with lines and a bud in the emblem. Gold is selected for the emblem <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial sector and the country's contributions to the world economy. It exemplifies excellence and strength, which characterise Singapore as a regional business and financial centre. The tones point towards {{the increase in the}} wealth of the nations, with expanding richness and scope for the people. The bud may appear to represent the plurality of ideas and cultures at the event. It also symbolises the life in the city-state, that brings forth its potential for growth in the global market. With its curve, the spine depicts the horizon of the world. The stylised lines are the longitudes, to represent the connection of countries and world leaders at the {{annual meetings}}. Petals are to signify the unity of leaders to have a common goal at the meetings. The lines also depict the congruent roles countries have to achieve international cooperation for growth in the world.|$|E

University of Delaware philosophy professor Richard Hanley analyzed the mythology of Scientology, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> episode [...] "Trapped in the Closet", in his 2007 book [...] Hanley called the Xenu story as presented in the episode, [...] "utterly ridiculous".

500|$|... "Missing link" [...] {{is still}} a popular term, well {{recognized}} by the public and often used in the popular media. It is, however, avoided in the scientific press, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concept of the great chain of being and {{to the notion of}} simple organisms being primitive versions of complex ones, both of which have been discarded in biology. In any case, the term itself is misleading, as any known transitional fossil, like Java Man, is no longer missing. While each find will give rise to new gaps in the evolutionary story on each side, the discovery of more and more transitional fossils continues to add to our knowledge of evolutionary transitions.|$|E

500|$|Similar {{confusion}} {{is involved in}} objections that evolution is [...] "unproven," [...] since no theory in science {{is known to be}} absolutely true, only verified by empirical evidence. This distinction is an important one in philosophy of science, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of absolute certainty in all empirical claims, not just evolution. Strict proof is possible only in formal sciences such as logic and mathematics, not natural sciences (where terms such as [...] "validated" [...] or [...] "corroborated" [...] are more appropriate). Thus, to say that evolution is not proven is trivially true, but no more an indictment of evolution than calling it a [...] "theory." [...] The confusion arises in that the colloquial meaning of proof is simply [...] "compelling evidence," [...] in which case scientists would indeed consider evolution [...] "proven." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{large amount}} of {{critical}} debate also surrounds the poem <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak {{is an example of}} the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the Welsh‚ÄìEnglish border. They therefore view the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that plays strong cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically much Welsh blood was shed well into the 14th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To support this argument further, it is suggested that the poem creates an [...] "us versus them" [...] scenario contrasting the knowledgeable civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands that are home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.|$|E
500|$|Both {{practicing}} archaeoastronomers {{and observers}} of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy {{as part of an}} archaeology informed by cultural anthropology and aimed at understanding a [...] "group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology. [...] Todd Bostwick argued that [...] "archaeoastronomy is anthropology ‚Äì the study of human behavior in the past and present." [...] Paul Bahn has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology. Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations or <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques. [...] Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing [...] "the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism" [...] Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable precursors of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.|$|E
