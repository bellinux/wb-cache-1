5|$|The {{production}} of ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, provided as <b>a</b> <b>nutritional</b> supplement for livestock, consumes {{a large portion}} of available iodine. Another significant use is a catalyst for the {{production of}} acetic acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for acetic acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>nutritional</b> {{analysis}} of P.indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) {{determined that the}} egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100g of fungus, dry weight) 33.6g of crude protein, 1.66g of fat, and 3.98g of carbohydrates. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{econometric model}} of the nutritional and health status of pre-school children in developing countries. The model is addressed to three central issues: (1) What are {{the characteristics of the}} interaction between <b>a</b> child's <b>nutritional</b> status and its degree of risk to morbidity, particularly diarrhea? (2) What is the effect of alternative kinds of nutrient inputs on <b>a</b> child's <b>nutritional</b> status (e. g. nursing vs food expenditure) ? (3) Is <b>a</b> child's <b>nutritional</b> and health status influenced by economic constraints on the family and its intra-family resource allocation decisions? The model is estimated on observations on the health and nutritional status of approximately 1200 children who participated over a 7 year period in the Promotora maternal-child program in Candelaria, Colombia. The results suggest that: (1) severe diarrhea substantially weakens <b>a</b> child's <b>nutritional</b> status, (2) acutely malnourished and stunted children are more susceptible to diarrhea (3) nursing in the first year is pivotal to <b>a</b> child's <b>nutritional</b> status, (4) one may view malnutrition and poor health as the consequence of family processes. The results support the hypothesis that both child competition and parental discrimination adversely influence nutritional status...|$|R
