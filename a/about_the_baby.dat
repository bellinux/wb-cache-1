40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the impact of {{amniocentesis}} on women at risk for having a baby with Down's syndrome because of raised maternal age. Fifty-four of the study participants had amniocentesis and nine did not. At the time of the procedure, those having amniocentesis were significantly more anxious, less certain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> health, and held more negative attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> than women who did not undergo amniocentesis. For women undergoing amniocentesis there was a positive association between perceived risk of having an abnormal baby and anxiety. After <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> birth, women who had undergone amniocentesis held less positive attitudes to <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and were significantly more worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> health. These results suggest that the anxiety surrounding amniocentesis is related both to the procedure and to the perceived likelihood of an abnormal result. The differences between the groups after the birth seem more likely to reflect pre-existing attitudinal differences between the two groups, than the effects of amniocentesis...|$|R

500|$|Eastwood married Margaret Neville [...] "Maggie" [...] Johnson (born 1931; {{then working}} for an auto parts {{suppliers}} company) on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. They had met {{six months earlier}} {{on a blind date}} in Los Angeles, although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship in Seattle that summer with a young woman who became pregnant with his child—an alleged daughter who was given up for adoption, per biographer Patrick McGilligan—before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. The marriage would not prove altogether smooth. [...] "He thought they were too young, not well enough established," [...] remarked biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about Eastwood. A decade later, an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in (said to have lasted 14 years) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis (who was also married yet separated) produced his earliest verified child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964), whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the National Enquirer revealed her identity. Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson, [...] "It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood." [...] The source for the 1989 Enquirer article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of Breezy in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, a onetime Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said of Eastwood's relationship with Johnson: [...] "They conducted a somewhat open marriage." ...|$|E

40|$|The general aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore women's {{reactions}} to and experiences of fetal screening for Down's syndrome PS) {{by means of an}} ultrasound examination, including measurement of fetal nuchal translucency (NT). The effect of this screening on maternal worry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> health was investigated, as well as reactions to a false positive test and interpretation of information about riskAlso, an instrument measuring worry during pregnancy, the Cambridge Worry Scale, was translated into Swedish and tested on a sample of pregnant women. A sub-sample of 2026 women was drawn from a larger randomised controlled trial including 39, 572 women, which investigated medical outcomes of the new fetal screening policy. Of these women, 1030 were randomly allocated to the intervention group, and 996 to routine care. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the two groups regarding major worry about something being wrong with <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> general anxiety and depressive symptoms m midpregnancy and two months postpartum. Twenty-four women who had received information about an increased risk according to NT were interviewed during pregnancy and after birth. Twenty of these women had false positive tests, and for 16 the risk was higher than expected considering their age. These women expressed major worry, and many said they chose to reject their pregnancy, to take "time out", while waiting for the results of fetal karyotyping. Two months after the birth, most of these women seemed to have overcome the stressful situation. In the intervention group of the above trial 796 women had a risk score for DS recorded in a clinical database. Of these women 620 said they had received information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> risk score, and 64 percent stated the figure almost correctly. The actual risk was associated with women's perception of <b>the</b> risk. Worry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> health and depressive symptoms did not differ statistically between women who were at high risk (1 : 250 or higher) and at low risk. However, women who perceived that the risk was high were more worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> health and also seemed to have more depressive symptoms in mid-pregnancy compared with those who perceived the risk to be low. No differences were observed at two months after birth. The translated version of the Cambridge Worry Scale was tested on 200 Swedish pregnant women in Stockholm. The three main sources of worry were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> health, giving birth and miscarriage. The internal- consistency reliability was 0. 81 (Cronbach's alpha). Three items were added to the original scale to capture women's worry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> maternity services. In conclusion, the intervention with an early ultrasound examination including risk assessment for DS by measuring the NT did not affect maternal worry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> health, general anxiety or depressive symptoms 'm mid-pregnancy or two months after birth. However, a false positive test could cause strong reactions of anxiety and rejection of the pregnancy for some weeks. Many had problems to recall and interpret a given risk score. An actual high risk score was not associated with major worry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> health or depressive symptoms, whereas a woman's perception of being at high risk had such an association. The Swedish version of the Cambridge Worry Scale was considered to be useful and well suited for its purpose...|$|R
