5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E

25|$|Engineering at Brown is {{especially}} interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools, and follows {{a model of}} connectivity between disciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences.

25|$|Pathophysiology is <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> {{pathology}} with physiology. Pathology is {{the medical}} discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state; whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Referring to MS, the physiology {{refers to the}} different processes {{that lead to the}} development of the lesions and the pathology refers to the condition associated with the lesions.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to observe (but we will not develop this here) that these notions of Ricci bounds (either Riemannian or not) are stable via measured Gromov–Hausdorff <b>convergence</b> (<b>a</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> similar to the Gromov–Hausdorff <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> metric spaces, but considering the minimal Wasserstein distance between the images of two spaces via isometric embeddings into the same space). This can be surprising at a first sight (curvature bounds are second-order objects, and we are claiming that they are stable via <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> which essentially sounds like <b>a</b> uniform <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> the spaces, with <b>a</b> weak <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> the measures), but not after a simple observation: also the class of convex, or λ-convex, functions is stable under uniform (or even weak) <b>convergence!</b> but, <b>of</b> course, proving this stability is not a trivial fact.|$|R

Foer, then an undergraduate, solicits all of his favorite authors to contribute to the collection by sending each of them a print of one of Cornell's bird boxes, and an explanation of the project. He is surprised when well-known authors such as Joyce Carol Oates, Rick Moody and Barry Lopez respond to his prompts with Cornell-inspired works.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{ethics is}} the moral {{philosophy}} particular to {{one or both of}} the Jewish religion and peoples. Serving as <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> Judaism and the Western philosophical tradition of ethics, the diverse literature of Jewish ethics's broad range of moral concern classifies it as a type of normative ethics. For two millennia, Jewish thought has focussed on the interplay of ethics with the rule of law. The tradition of rabbinic religious law - Halakhah - addresses several problems associated with ethics, including its semi-permeable relation with duties that are usually not punished under law.|$|E
25|$|While {{up until}} the end of the Parthian period in the 3rd century CE, the idea of “Irān“ had an ethnic, linguistic, and {{religious}} value, it did not yet have a political import. The idea of an “Iranian“ empire or kingdom in a political sense is a purely Sasanian one. It was the result of <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> interests between the new dynasty and the Zoroastrian clergy, as we can deduce from the available evidence. This convergence gave rise to the idea of an Ērān-šahr “Kingdom of the Iranians,” which was “ēr“ (Middle Persian equivalent of Old Persian “ariya“ and Avestan “airya“).|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> anti-colonial, and anti-Tutsi {{sentiment}} {{resulted in}} Belgium granting national independence in 1961. The current government of Rwanda {{was founded in}} 1994. Direct elections resulted in a representative government dominated by the majority Hutu under President Grégoire Kayibanda. Unsettled ethnic and political tensions were worsened when Juvénal Habyarimana, who was also Hutu, seized power in 1973. In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group composed of 10,000 Tutsi refugees from previous decades of unrest, invaded the country, starting the Rwandan Civil War. The war ground on, worsening ethnic tensions, as the Hutu feared losing their gains.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergence}} of the human security discourse {{was the product of}} <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> factors {{at the end of the}} Cold War. These challenged the dominance of the neorealist paradigm’s focus on states, “mutually assured destruction” and military security and briefly enabled a broader concept of security to emerge. The increasingly rapid pace of globalisation; the failure of liberal state building through the instruments of the Washington Consensus; the reduced threat of nuclear war between the superpowers, the exponential rise in the spread and consolidation of democratisation and international human rights norms opened a space in which both ‘development’ and concepts of ‘security’ could be reconsidered.|$|E

25|$|The NAALC {{supplement}} to NAFTA aimed {{to create a}} foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems, {{as well as to}} promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries, in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions. Though most economists agree {{that it is difficult to}} assess the direct impact of the NAALC, it is agreed that there has been <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> labor standards in North America.

25|$|It is {{not known}} when the Golden Gate No.10 mine on the {{northern}} edge of the Golden Gate reef commenced operations, but it is marked on Rands' 1896 map. At the northern end of the line of reef, at varying distances from Golden Gate Creek, a number of prospecting shafts were sunk to try and find a continuation of the reef, which had proved so productive further south. No.10 North was at the northern end of the field and here the reef became well defined, although there was <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> faults. Mining operations were conducted on a large scale in exploring the reef up to 1906.|$|E
25|$|Several {{distinct}} sub-regions within Mesoamerica {{are defined}} by <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of their limits is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, {{can be divided into}} two general groups: the lowlands and highlands. The lowlands are further divided into the southern and northern Maya lowlands. The southern Maya lowlands are generally regarded as encompassing northern Guatemala, southern Campeche and Quintana Roo in Mexico, and Belize. The northern lowlands cover the remainder of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast Lowlands, Oaxaca, the Southern Pacific Lowlands, and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern Honduras).|$|E
