I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

25|$|Flashbulb memory {{occurs when}} a very vivid memory of a traumatic, emotional, or {{significant}} event is recalled. Researchers typically use public {{events such as the}} John F. Kennedy assassination and 9/11 as cues when studying flashbulb memories. Participants are asked to recall very specific information such as where they were, how they felt, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing when the event was taking place. Memories of these events are easily recalled and the individual believes their account of the event to be perfectly accurate.|$|E

Concerned about Ford <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing with the Shelby Cobra, GM planned to manufacture 100 Grand Sport Corvettes, but only five were actually built. They were driven by historic drivers such as Roger Penske, A. J. Foyt, Jim Hall, and Dick Guldstrand among others. Today the five cars (001-005) are all held by private owners, and are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built. 002 is exhibited in the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum and is in running condition.|$|E
25|$|Within Attorney General Palmer's Justice Department, the General Intelligence Division (GID) {{headed by}} J.

It had infiltrated many organizations and, following the raids of November 1919 and January 1920, it had interrogated thousands of those arrested and read through boxes of publications and records seized. Though agents in the GID {{knew there was a}} gap between what the radicals promised in their rhetoric <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> capable of accomplishing, they nevertheless told Palmer they had evidence of plans for an attempted overthrow of the U.S. government on May Day 1920.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 Corvette chief {{engineer}} Zora Arkus-Duntov initiated {{a program to}} produce a lightweight version based on a prototype that mirrored the new 1963 Corvette. Concerned about Ford <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing with the Shelby Cobra, Duntov's program included plans to build 125 examples of the Corvette Grand Sport to allow the model to be homologated for international Grand Touring races. After the GM executives learned of the secret project, the program was stopped, and only five cars were built. All five cars have survived and are in private collections. They {{are among the most}} coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built, not because of what they accomplished, but because of what might have been.|$|E

25|$|The ancient {{library of}} the White Monastery {{is rich in}} many {{categories}} such biblical, hagiographical, liturgical, etc. This provides the researcher with good knowledge about what the monks were reading <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> allowed to read {{at different stages of}} the monastery development. However, the early times are not too well represented in the surviving fragments, This can be either attributed to their frequent use or simply they were victims of time and of decline of the monastery in later times. The dialect of these manuscripts were predominantly in Sahidic Coptic, which was perfected in its literary form by Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite. There were also some bilingual manuscripts. The early ones were in Sahidic Coptic and Greek, while the latter ones had Sahidic Coptic and Arabic. The writing material employed were mostly parchment, because of its prevalence, but some of the later ones were found on paper.|$|E

McQuarrie was introduced to the project while directing Cruise in Jack Reacher. [...] While reading the earlier script McQuarrie [...] "understood very clearly what the premise of the story was <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking for in terms of characters". Even if the previous scripts were darker, Cruise stressed the importance of the story's humor to McQuarrie. The actor compared Cage's violent demises to Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, declaring, [...] "It's fun coming up with new ways to kill yourself." ...|$|E

He felt that the political connotations associated with his name did not match his democratic and Enlightenment philosophies, thus he requested that the Paris Commune allow his name to be changed, which was granted. Shortly after the September Massacres in 1792, he changed his surname to Égalité, ("equality" [...] in English).

2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth {{was brought in to}} touch up the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but had never seen the original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the first thing they needed to do was to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include. They were never sure how much of the Krug family needed to be seen, what elements from the original film should be included, or even if Mari should live or die.|$|E
