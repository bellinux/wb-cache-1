25|$|The Sneinton Festival {{has three}} elements: initial workshops, a week-long festival, {{and the final}} carnival. Workshops {{organised}} by The Festival Group {{take place in the}} run-up to the festival, and bring young people together to be creative around the year's theme, building the artwork, decorations and costumes, as well as holding dance and performance workshops. The Festival Week begins on a Saturday, and involves seven days of arts-based free and open events held in and around Sneinton. Festival Week culminates in a parade held on Carnival Day, on the next Saturday. The Carnival Parade includes floats, fancy dress, costumes, samba bands, jazz bands, youth bands, dancers, and a variety of other event performers. The festival then continues in the Hermitage Square when the parade arrives, and features <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> free and diverse entertainment.|$|E
25|$|Many {{students}} {{are involved in}} community service {{in one form or}} another. Annual events include Dance Marathon, a thirty-hour event that raised {{more than a million dollars}} for charity in 2011; and Project Pumpkin, a Halloween celebration hosted by the Northwestern Community Development Corps (NCDC) to which more than 800 local children are invited for <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> games and sweets. NCDC's work is to connect hundreds of student volunteers to some twenty volunteer sites in Evanston and Chicago throughout the year. Many students have assisted with the Special Olympics and have taken alternative spring break trips to hundreds of service sites across the United States. Northwestern students also participate in the Freshman Urban Program, a program for students interested in community service. A large and growing number of students participate in the university's Global Engagement Studies Institute (GESI), a group service-learning expedition in Asia, Africa, or Latin America, in conjunction with the Foundation for Sustainable Development. Several internationally recognized non-profit organizations have originated at Northwestern including the World Health Imaging, Informatics and Telemedicine Alliance, a spin-off from an engineering student's honors thesis.|$|E

25|$|In {{the night}} of 22 June, Reijersen sent ashore a {{scouting}} party of three men and a Chinese guide {{to see if the}} 10,000 Chinese residents of the city would remain neutral. They soon returned after finding the Chinese had fled the city ahead of the invasion. In the following morning Reijersen himself boarded a launch with some senior officers to scout for a suitable landing site, and it was decided that the invading army would make their landing on the eastern Cacilhas Beach the next day. To distract the defenders from the intended landing site, three ships – Groeningen, Gallias, and Engelsche Beer – started to bombard the São Franciso battery in the south on 23 June. After <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> cannon volleys and insults (where Dutch seamen threatened to rape Macau's women after killing all men above twenty), the ships withdrew for the night without inflicting any casualties on the Portuguese side. Nonetheless, the Dutch celebrated their expected victory in advance by blowing their trumpets and beating their drums all night. Not to be outdone, the Portuguese retaliated with similar martial festivities in the city's bulwarks.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} he was {{nineteen}} years old in 1871 he was living with his parents in Havelock Road and articled to an attorney. He became a partner in the firm sometime after 1873. By 1881 at age twenty-nine he was describing himself as a timber merchant like his father, and living with his parents at Priory Mount in Cambridge Gardens, Hastings. He continued under the same company name after his father retired in 1882 and the original firm was dissolved. He married Mrs Lilla Harford (b. Barnstaple ca.1856; d. Wandsworth 1930) of Cambridge Gardens, Hastings on 7 June 1882, when his employees received a half-day holiday, <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> entertainment at Field's Farm, Ore and an evening dinner at the Grand Hotel in Queens Road, Hastings. Around a hundred of the men took advantage of this. By 1991 the family was living at Rothesay, Clive Road, Hastings, with five of their children: Cecil, Gladys, Reginald, Mabel and Herbert. They had seven servants living in: a housekeeper, parlourmaid, cook, housemaid, under-nurse, coachman and gardener. The 1901 Census finds John Howell Junior as a solicitor still living with his wife, his stepson Hugh Cardinal Harford (b. Middlesex ca.1877) and five of their children at Rothesay. His eldest son Cecil was at that time a commercial clerk living at a boarding house in Rochester, Kent. John Howell Junior died aged 52 years on 13 December 1903 in his home at 20 Holmesdale Gardens which he had built with his father soon after joining the firm. He left £53,352 in his will.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and whispered the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mixed to negative reviews from critics. Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "The {{moral of the}} story is, if you’re going to build an entire video around a stripper pole, then you better work said pole like a nine-to-five. Drop it like it’s hot. [...] Alas, in the case of [...] "Gimme More," [...] I’ve seen sexier pole work during <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> fly-fishing". Andrei Harmsworth of Metro commented [...] "To her credit, the video is slightly less disappointing than her mimed performance of the track at the Video Music Awards last month but it is still smeared with the same smutty hallmarks". Dose said the video [...] "sucks less than you think" [...] and added [...] "Spears appears lucid, sometimes happy, and awards-worthy editing makes her appear to be standing upright competently throughout". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said the lightning effects and digital body enhancement of the video [...] "indicate a predilection toward maintaining an image that no longer reflects reality. It doesn't point to an artist who refuses to evolve, but rather one who doesn't know how—or isn't being allowed to." [...] IGN writer Sketch Longwood called it one of Spears' hottest videos, adding that she [...] "proves to be quite skilled in the art of teasingly slinking around." [...] While reviewing the alternate version of the video in July 2011, Becky Bain of Idolator stated that [...] "Spears's last few videos — particularly the joyfully silly clip for 'I Wanna Go' — more than make up for the travesty that was the pop star's video for 'Gimme More' [...] The stripper concept was a poor choice, the barely-there outfits were ill-fitting, the 'choreography' was a joke, the editing was sloppy." ...|$|E

Roads around the Tintagel, Camelford and Davidstow area were closed off to stop people visiting the village. River levels were alarmingly high, but the banks contained the water.
