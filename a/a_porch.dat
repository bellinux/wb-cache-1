5|$|A 1937 {{survey of}} Kennedy's rebuilt church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{said that it}} was formed from a {{continuous}} nave and chancel, measuring in total 43 by 15feet (13.3 by 4.7m). The church, which was at that time in good condition, was entered through <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> on the south side, and there was a vestry on the north side. As well as the font, the church contained some 18th-century memorials. The font is now in the south chapel of St Cybi's Church, Holyhead.|$|E

5|$|The Charles Payne House is an {{historic}} site at 25 Brown Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The {{house was built}} in 1855–56 by Charles Payne and later expanded {{with the addition of}} two ells and <b>a</b> <b>porch.</b> The -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage is architecturally significant as a 19th-century vernacular cottage in a picturesque setting. Though the round-head picket fence and entry gates were later removed, the property retains a large shaded garden on with ample street frontage. The Charles Payne House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} small and rectangular, has no {{internal}} division between the nave and the chancel. It measures 47feet 6inches by 14feet 9inches (14.5 by 4.5m). It is built of rubble masonry, and the roof is made of slate; there is a gabled bellcote at {{the west end of}} the roof. The roof timbers {{can be seen from the}} inside. Entrance to the church is through <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> with a rounded arch at the west end of the south wall, and there is a vestry, with one window, at the west end of the north wall.|$|E
5|$|The present Budolfi Church, {{which has}} {{the status of a}} cathedral, dates {{from the end of the}} 14th century, {{although}} at least two earlier churches stood on the same spot. Built in the Gothic style, it consists of a nave flanked by two aisles, a tower, and <b>a</b> <b>porch.</b> After the original tower was destroyed by fire in 1663, the striking new Baroque tower, based on that of an earlier Copenhagen city hall, was completed in 1779. The church has 16th-century frescoes and an intricately carved early Baroque altarpiece from 1689 created by Lauridtz Jensen.|$|E
50|$|The house {{originally}} had <b>a</b> full-width <b>porch</b> {{across the front}} façade. A lean-to {{was added to the}} rear sometime before 1940, replacing <b>a</b> small back <b>porch.</b>|$|R

5|$|The smokehouse is {{a square}} two-story {{building}} with a hipped roof, and is believed to date to the early 19th century. East of the smokehouse, a 1-story {{building with a}} three bay facade and a gabled roof {{was used as a}} post office in the late 19th century, and may have served as a schoolhouse originally. The manager's farmhouse stands 2 stories high and is L-shaped with <b>a</b> <b>porch.</b> The springhouse is also 2 stories.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, {{the station}} {{building}} was expanded with <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> and additional waiting room. From 1938 to 2000, train services {{were provided by}} the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Netherlands Railways), when the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen merged with the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (Hollandic Iron Railroad Company). In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, approximately 500 Jews from Winschoten were transported by train to the Westerbork transit camp {{and from there to}} Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Poland, where 446 of them were killed. As a result of the war, the German border at the railway was closed for passenger transport from 1944 to 1954. In 1967, the roofed bus station was built next to the station building. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, the station building's porch was replaced.|$|E

5|$|St Edwen's {{is built}} from local red gritstone, formed into square blocks and dressed with sandstone. The roof {{is made from}} slate with stone edging. The church, {{which is in the}} Late Decorated style, has a tower topped with a broach spire at the north-west corner of the nave, {{supported}} by buttresses. The church is entered through <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> with an arched doorway in the lowest of the three stages of the tower. Inside, the woodwork of the roof is exposed; some of the nave timbers might be medieval beams reused in the 1856 rebuilding. The nave and chancel are divided by an arch and by three steps leading up from the nave. The chancel and sanctuary are separated by an altar rail set on top of some wooden panels.|$|E
5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay aisles on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. The aisles and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various mouldings and designs typical of that period, including chamfered arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are some larger square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} {{built in the}} Decorated style, has a nave at the west end and a chancel at the east end. It is built from rubble masonry dressed with freestone; the roof is made of slate and edged with stone. There is <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> at {{the west end of}} the south wall of the nave and a vestry at the west end of the north wall of the chancel, {{abutting}} the nave. The nave measures approximately 39feet 8inches by 20feet 8inches (12.10m by 6.30m) and the chancel is shorter and narrower at approximately 18feet by 14feet 1inch (5.50 by 4.30m). The total floor space of the church is approximately 1,076square feet (100m2). There is a large bellcote at the west end of the nave, containing one bell.|$|E
50|$|The Jameh Mosque of Saveh {{comprises}} <b>a</b> courtyard, <b>porch,</b> <b>a</b> minaret, a few nocturnal areas, {{dome and}} two archaic altars with inscription in Kufic script.

50|$|Thomas Sipple House, {{also known}} as the Chipman House and Boxwood Manor, is a {{historic}} home located at Georgetown, Sussex County, Delaware. It was built in 1861, and is a two-story, five bay, single pile frame dwelling with a two-story rear ell. It sits on a brick foundation and has a low-pitched gable roof. The house was modified in 1912, to enclose <b>a</b> rear <b>porch,</b> add <b>a</b> sleeping <b>porch,</b> and add <b>a</b> two-story <b>porch</b> connecting the house to two outbuildings. It features Greek Revival and Italianate style design elements.|$|R
5|$|The nave of {{the church}} (where the {{congregation}} sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site of the altar) is at {{the east end of}} the nave. There is <b>a</b> <b>porch,</b> which contains an 18th-century memorial, {{on the south side of}} the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by mullions), save for one to the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} two gate lodges; both are listed at grade II. The {{northern}} lodge at Slaughter Hill is by Blore and dates from 1847. In red brick with darker-brick diapering, stone dressings and a slate roof, {{it has a}} T-shaped plan with a single storey, and is Jacobean in style. It features two shaped gables, each decorated with a panel carved with Crewe Estate emblems, and a hexagonal central bay with a pyramidal roof which forms <b>a</b> <b>porch.</b> The Elizabethan-style Weston or Golden Gates Lodge {{to the south of}} the house dates from before 1865 and is attributed to William Eden Nesfield, although it is not typical of his style. In red brick with blue-brick zig–zag diapering, ashlar dressings and a slate roof, the lodge has two storeys, with a projecting canted bay to the road face. The driveway face has an ashlar panel with a shield bearing the Crewe family coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{stimulating}} {{the development of}} urban areas, temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features. The Temple of the Saintly Mother (圣母殿) and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple (晋祠), located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi province, are extant examples of early Song architecture. The Temple of the Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple, first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102. It has a double-eaved roof with nine ridges, and two dragon-heads with wide-open jaws biting {{the ends of the}} main ridge. The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi. The eaves of the Temple of the Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end, a characteristic of Song architecture. The columns of the façade, decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts, become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair. The building has <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> around it, the sole example of such a structure; another unique feature of the site is a cross-shaped bridge that leads to the Goddess Temple.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a large}} -story {{house with}} Queen Anne elements. It has a stair turret and <b>a</b> {{wrap-around}} <b>porch.</b> <b>A</b> tower top was never rebuilt after it was destroyed by a storm in the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} built of {{sandstone}} and puddingstone rubble. It comprises <b>a</b> nave with <b>porch,</b> <b>a</b> North transept, a chancel and Wyatt's tower.|$|R

5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall at {{the centre}} of the north range is entered through <b>a</b> <b>porch</b> and screens passage, a feature common in houses of the period, {{designed}} to protect the occupants from draughts. As the screens are now missing, they may have been free-standing like those at Rufford Old Hall. The porch is decorated with elaborate carvings. The Great Hall's roof is supported by arch-braced trusses, which are decorated with carved motifs including dragons. The floor, now flagged, would probably originally have been rush-covered earth, with a central hearth. The gabled bay window overlooking the courtyard was added in 1559. The original service wing {{to the west of the}} Great Hall, behind the screens passage, was rebuilt in 1546, and housed a kitchen, buttery and pantry. A hidden shaft was discovered during a 19th-century investigation of two secret rooms above the kitchen, connecting them to a tunnel leading to the moat, the entrance to which has since been filled in. The west range now houses the gift shop and restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The final {{project for}} his great patron Eusebi Güell was {{the church for}} the Colònia Güell, an {{industrial}} village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (1890–1918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What {{would have been the}} colony's church was designed by Gaudí in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only the crypt (known today as Crypt of the Colònia Güell) was built, as Güell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaudí designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. <b>A</b> <b>porch</b> of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults precedes the crypt, the first time that Gaudí used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture. In the crypt the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} built in {{sandstone}} with steeply pitched slate roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave of six bays, a chancel of two bays, a north aisle and <b>a</b> west <b>porch.</b> <b>A</b> west bellcote has one bell.|$|R
50|$|The Dr. William Claudius Irby House {{was built}} about 1890, {{and is a}} two-story, frame {{residence}} sheathed in weatherboarding with a cross-gable roof with Eastlake style elements. It features include <b>a</b> two-tiered <b>porch</b> on the façade and <b>a</b> single-story <b>porches</b> on the side elevations. Also on the property is a fieldstone outbuilding.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{sleeping}} <b>porch</b> is <b>a</b> deck or balcony that is screened and furnished {{for sleeping}} in the warmer months. Sleeping porches can be on ground level or on a higher storey and in either the front or back of a home. The idea of <b>a</b> sleeping <b>porch</b> dates back nearly a hundred years when people would sleep on <b>a</b> screened-in <b>porch</b> to get the coolness of the night air during summer without being bothered by bugs. Before the advent of air conditioning, families often created sleeping areas on outdoor porches, where children would sleep during the warmer months.|$|R
