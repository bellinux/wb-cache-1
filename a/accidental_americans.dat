25|$|FY 2016: Renunciations rose by 26% {{from the}} {{previous}} record set in 2015, bringing the total to a new record of 5,411 for 2016. Many newspapers mentioned that this total included <b>accidental</b> <b>American</b> Boris Johnson, British Foreign Secretary and former Mayor of London, who was taxed by the IRS {{on the sale of}} his home in London despite only living in the US briefly as a toddler.|$|R
5000|$|This {{makes it}} {{possible}} in some cases for [...] "accidental American" [...] status to be passed down over multiple generations, for example if an <b>accidental</b> <b>American</b> spends sufficient time in the U.S. to meet the physical presence requirements to pass down their U.S. citizenship to their own children born outside of the United States. This {{is most likely to}} occur in the case of unmarried parents. Under , only one year of continuous physical presence in the United States is required for an unmarried mother to pass down citizenship to children born abroad. The Second Circuit and Ninth Circuit have split {{on the question of whether}} 1409(c)'s gender restriction violates the Equal Protection Clause; the Second Circuit, in holding that it does in 2015, ruled that the son of an unmarried U.S. citizen father who failed to meet stricter physical presence requirements of 1401 is also a U.S. citizen at birth.|$|R
40|$|While Central Asia {{has become}} an {{important}} military operation theater in the U. S. campaign against terrorism, the somewhat <b>accidental</b> <b>American</b> {{military presence in the}} region has aroused suspicion and anxiety about American intention and long-term goals toward Central Asia. As in the past years the Bush Administration has been widely criticized for being unilateral and militaristic in its foreign policy practices, this study will analyze American policies toward Central Asia, focusing on its tendency to allow security concerns and military thinking have precedence over other considerations. This unbalanced strategy has led to a narrow-minded militaristic approach which does not support the stated democratization goals of American foreign policies toward the region; instead it only appears designed to meet military expediency needs. A brief overview of the evolution of American policies toward the region is laid out first, and then the dilemmas encountered by the U. S. in seeking its best interests in the region are discussed. In recognizing the importance of Central Asia in U. S. national security strategy, this research indicates that the military component should play only a comparatively a small role in the overall American effort in dealing with the states in the region. If the military expediency, coupled with geopolitical considerations, is continuously favored, such practice will hurt U. S. long-term interests and the prospect of a stable regional development...|$|R
5000|$|The Internal Revenue Code imposes an {{expatriation}} tax {{on people}} giving up U.S. citizenship. Payment {{of the tax}} is not a prerequisite to giving up citizenship; rather, the tax and its associated reporting forms are paid and filed during the following year, on the normal tax return due date. People who had both U.S. and another citizenship at birth, reside in their country of other citizenship, and have not been U.S. residents in more than 10 of the past 15 tax years, may be exempt from this tax (...) this provides a potential exception for some <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans.</b> However, this exception only applies to those who can state, under penalty of perjury, that they have fulfilled all of their U.S. tax filing and payment requirements for the preceding five years, and {{people who were not}} aware of their status as U.S. citizens are unlikely to have made the required filings and payments. Furthermore, <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> who do not reside in their country of other citizenship but rather a third country, for example due to work or family ties there, cannot qualify for this expatriation tax exemption either.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, in the {{aftermath}} of the 2009 UBS tax evasion controversy, the U.S. government began concerted efforts to identify U.S. citizens who held non-U.S. financial accounts. A major limb of this effort was the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), passed in 2010, which imposed additional taxes on the U.S. income of non-U.S. banks which did not sign an agreement with the IRS to collect information about their customers' citizenships and to provide the IRS with any information on customers identified as having [...] "U.S. indicia", including a U.S. place of birth. Following FATCA's passage, many banks began inquiring into the birthplaces and parentage of their customers, raising awareness among <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> that the U.S. government might consider them to be citizens. FATCA also resulted in closures of bank accounts belonging to people identified as U.S. citizens; a 2014 survey of U.S. citizens in other countries by Democrats Abroad found that 12.7% of respondents had been denied financial services by their banks. Allison Christians of McGill University noted that whether or not the IRS is interested in pursuing non-wealthy <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans,</b> banks had been known to [...] "overreact" [...] to customers' potential ties to the United States, due to the banks' own fears of IRS penalties for errors.|$|E
5000|$|President Barack Obama's {{proposed}} United States {{federal budget}} for 2016 included provisions to exempt certain <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> {{from both the}} payment of U.S. tax on non-U.S. source income, and the expatriation tax, if they gave up U.S. citizenship within two years {{from the time they}} became aware of it. The proposal was limited to those who had been dual citizens at birth, had maintained citizenship of a foreign country since birth, had not lived in the United States since age 18Â½, and had only held a United States passport in order to depart from the United States in compliance with [...] The Congressional Budget Office estimated that this proposal would cost the United States roughly $403 million in tax revenue over the following ten years, with the majority ($208 million) of the revenue loss occurring in the first three years. Temple University law professor Peter Spiro described this as possible evidence that the U.S. government was beginning to conclude [...] "that the imposition of U.S. taxes on <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> is unsustainable." [...] Roy A. Berg of tax law firm Moodys Gartner believed that the proposal had little chance of being passed by Congress, but that the executive branch might be able to implement similar relief solely through regulatory amendments.|$|E
50|$|An <b>accidental</b> <b>American</b> is {{a citizen}} of a country other than the United States who may also be {{considered}} a U.S. citizen under U.S. nationality law but is not aware of having U.S. status, or has only become aware of it recently during adulthood. Accidental Americans' U.S. citizenship arises due to their parents' ties to the United States rather than their own choices: they may be born {{in their own country}} but to one U.S. citizen parent who emigrated from the United States, or they may be born in the U.S. to parents residing in the country temporarily for work or study and then return to their own country in their early childhood, with few if any memories of the United States. The term may also sometimes be applied to people who definitely are not U.S. citizens but have some other sort of connection with the country, for example green card holders who moved back to their country of origin and let their green cards expire without formally cancelling their U.S. immigration status, or non-U.S. citizens married to Americans abroad. Such tenuous connections to the United States began to become a more salient issue in the late 2000s due to Internal Revenue Service crackdowns which were ostensibly aimed at tax evaders hiding assets in secrecy jurisdictions but ended up having much broader effects on people with U.S. citizenship who resided in other countries, as well as their families.|$|R

5000|$|Effect on [...] "accidental Americans". The {{reporting}} requirements and penalties {{apply to all}} US citizens, including <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans,</b> those who are unaware that they have US citizenship.

50|$|As a {{practical}} matter, renunciation of U.S. citizenship became markedly more difficult in 2014, meaning that even <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> who {{were aware of}} their U.S. citizenship status and wanted to rid themselves of it faced obstacles: {{in addition to the}} cost of making the required tax filings with the IRS, the State Department raised the fee for renunciation to US$2,350, roughly twenty times the fee charged by other high-income countries, and wait times for renunciation appointments at some U.S consulates grew to ten months or longer. These circumstances resulted in legal proceedings by U.S.-born Canadians against the U.S. State Department.|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> {{who become}} aware of their U.S. {{citizenship}} status begin looking into ways of renouncing or relinquishing it. Although {{it is possible for}} children to acquire U.S. citizenship [...] "accidentally" [...] without any voluntary action on their part, under current law they cannot lose that citizenship status accidentally or automatically as adults; instead, they must take voluntary action to give it up. United States nationality law (...) formerly provided for automatic loss of U.S. citizenship by dual citizens resident abroad, but this was repealed by the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1978 ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E

5000|$|The next day, July 25, Operation Cobra {{was finally}} {{launched}} as planned with a [...] "maximum effort" [...] {{by the air}} forces that included 559 sorties by fighter-bombers and 480 by medium and light bombers of the Ninth Air Force. Fighter-bomber attacks of the immediate front lines by eight groups of IX TAC, {{to a depth of}} 250 yd, were generally excellent, but as air planners had predicted, created smoke and dust that obscured aiming points for the bombers at higher altitudes. The second day of heavy bomber attacks also resulted in further <b>accidental</b> bombings of <b>American</b> troops, particularly the 47th Infantry of the 9th Infantry Division and the 120th Infantry of the 30th Infantry Division. The latter was also attacked by B-26 bombers of the Ninth that dropped their bombs short of the German lines. In both days of bombing, approximately 3% of bombs fell within American lines, resulting in 111 killed and 490 wounded. Although not apparent at first, the air attacks succeeded in their objective of disrupting German formations and destroying their communications, facilitating the break-through.|$|R
5000|$|In many cases, it {{has also}} proven {{difficult}} for <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> born abroad to obtain Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are required for them to file U.S. taxes. In response to this issue, the State Bar of California's Taxation Section issued a proposal in 2015 for the IRS to allow Americans citizens without SSNs residing in other countries to obtain Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) instead. Current regulations (...) require all U.S. citizens to use SSNs as their Taxpayer Identification Number, while ITINs are only available to non-citizens; however, the underlying statute (...) does not require this, and so the California Bar suggested that their proposal could be accomplished by issuing new Treasury regulations without needing to wait for Congress to pass any new legislation.|$|E
50|$|The Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate, which lists {{names of}} certain people {{with respect to}} whom the IRS {{received}} information on loss of citizenship during the quarter in question, in 2011 began showing a sharp {{rise in the number}} of names included. Lawyers disagree whether the Quarterly Publication is a complete list of all people giving up U.S. citizenship, or whether it only includes covered expatriates (people with certain levels of assets, tax liabilities, or tax filing or payment deficiencies). Regardless, various U.S. lawyers have commented, based on their experiences with clients, that the majority of the early 2010s increase in renunciations of U.S. citizenship is probably attributable to <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans,</b> rather than the popular stereotype of wealthy people who move to a tax haven after becoming rich in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|The Internal Revenue Code {{provides}} for a foreign earned income exclusion allowing non-resident U.S. tax filers to exclude wage income {{up to a certain}} threshold ($99,400 for the 2013 tax filing season) from U.S. taxation, as well as credits for taxes paid to other countries. The result is that <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> often do not owe U.S. income tax, but must spend thousands of dollars in accounting fees to prove that fact, and face potential fines {{of tens of thousands of}} dollars for paperwork errors. The reason is that the foreign earned income exclusion does not affect filing obligations nor the treatment of non-U.S bank accounts and investment plans. Tax lawyers state that compliance with the foreign trust and passive foreign investment company rules can be particularly onerous, because their definitions are so broad as to include mutual funds, retirement accounts, and similar such structures owned by <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> in their country of residence; people with savings in these kinds of plans will face higher taxes and compliance burdens than U.S. residents who keep money in similar U.S. investment plans. Those who have spent their lives planning for their retirement without considering the U.S. tax consequences of the non-U.S. financial instruments they hold may find that U.S. taxation, in particular PFIC taxation, wipes out most of their returns on investments; as Allison Christians states, [...] "the PFIC regime is designed to be so harsh that no one would ever knowingly own one unless they were treating it like a partnership, and marking it to market annually with the assistance of sophisticated tax counsel". Even Canada's Registered Disability Savings Plan falls under such reporting requirements. Under the 2011 Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, people residing outside of the U.S. who stated that they did not file U.S. tax and asset-reporting forms because they were unaware of their U.S. citizenship faced fines of 5% of their assets.|$|E

The softcover {{is a mere}} 4. 5 x 7. 25 inches, and less than 0. 75 inches thick, but the wealth of information concerning the field identification of diurnal raptors is enormous. William S. Clark, from Arlington, VA, (not William H. Clark as stated {{on the inside of}} the front cover) is the former director of the Raptor Information Center of the National Wildlife Federation. Brian K. Wheeler, from Longmont, Colorado, is an accomplished painter of birds and other wildlife and his work has appeared in Birding and American Birds. 2 Ì 2 The purpose of this field guide is to present the latest in tried and proven field marks and behavioral characteristics by which 33 regular and six <b>accidental</b> N. <b>American</b> diurnal raptors may accurately be identified. These field marks and characteristics should enable anyone, with a little practice, to accurately identify most flying and perched diurnal raptors when they are seen clearly. 2 Ì 2 This paragraph is from page one of the book and I believe that the goal has been accomplished. This hawk guide has an exquisite cover painting of an American Kestrel and Peregrine Falcon that led me inside with hopes of illustration of the 70 + species of falconiforms in North America. I was quick to discover that âNorth Americaâ once again means âNorth America north of Mexico 2 Ì 2 and that 39 species are discussed. No matter, getting all the details for these species crammed into such a small book would be work enough. Wheeler did a superb job in that the plates do well to illustrate the description in the text...|$|R
5000|$|Jones' {{best known}} piece of writing, [...] "An End to the Neglect of the Problems of the Negro Woman!", {{appeared}} in 1949 {{in the magazine}} Political Affairs. It exhibits her development of what later came to be termed [...] "intersectional" [...] analysis within a Marxist framework. In it, she wrote: The bourgeoisie is fearful of the militancy of the Negro woman, and for good reason. The capitalists know, far better than many progressives seem to know, that once Negro women begin to take action, the militancy of the whole Negro people, and thus of the anti-imperialist coalition, is greatly enhanced.Historically, the Negro woman has been the guardian, the protector, of the Negro family.... As mother, as Negro, and as worker, the Negro woman fights against the wiping out of the Negro family, against the Jim Crow ghetto existence which destroys the health, morale, and very life of millions of her sisters, brothers, and children. Viewed in this light, it is not <b>accidental</b> that the <b>American</b> bourgeoisie has intensified its oppression, {{not only of the}} Negro people in general, but of Negro women in particular. Nothing so exposes the drive to fascization in the nation as the callous attitude which the bourgeoisie displays and cultivates toward Negro women.|$|R
5000|$|First, <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> {{born in the}} United States may {{encounter}} difficulties when attempting to enter the U.S. on a non-U.S. passport, as U.S. law (...) requires all U.S. citizens to use U.S. passports when entering the country. An airline employee or U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who notes the U.S. place of birth in the passport might refuse to allow the person to board a flight, or demand that the person pay a fee {{to apply for a}} waiver of the passport requirement. Famously, London mayor Boris Johnson was denied boarding on a flight which transited the U.S. in 2006, after which he first claimed that he wanted to renounce his U.S. citizenship, but instead applied for a U.S. passport some years later. In the past, Canadians were unlikely to encounter such difficulties, because passports were not required to cross the Canada-United States border, but {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative tightened documentary requirements for entering the United States by land or by sea, and so Canadians crossing the into the United States had to show proof of Canadian citizenship; if they used a Canadian passport as such proof, it would indicate their place of birth.|$|E
5000|$|Like the United States, {{many other}} {{countries}} have laws for transmission of citizenship by descent, but those countries impose tax filing obligations only on people who reside or earn income in those countries; the United States and Eritrea are the only countries which impose taxation and reporting requirements on the income which citizens living abroad permanently earn in their countries of residence. Despite their lack of personal or business ties to the United States, <b>accidental</b> <b>Americans</b> have the same U.S. tax filing and payment obligations as do self-identifying [...] "Americans abroad" [...] who are aware of their U.S. citizenship status, and {{are subject to the}} same fines for failure to file. Tax treaties generally do not serve to mitigate the double taxation and filing burdens such people face, as all U.S. tax treaties give the U.S. the power to tax U.S. citizens residing in other countries as if the treaty did not exist; such treaties generally only benefit business entities and dual-resident non-U.S. citizens. The result, as tax attorney Gavin Leckie put it, is that [...] "people who have no sense of being American find themselves caught up in a maze of rules really aimed at the U.S. resident citizen seeking to defer or evade U.S. taxes by holding assets offshore".|$|E
