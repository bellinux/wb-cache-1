25|$|An elderly cultivator, {{with several}} wives and likely several young male children, {{benefits}} {{from having a}} much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation {{and is likely to}} have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second wife will usually do the most tiresome work, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were a servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status. A 1930s study of the Mende in the west African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset, since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers. Polygyny is considered an economic advantage in many rural areas. In some cases, the economic role of the additional wife enables the husband to enjoy more leisure.|$|E
500|$|While {{a review}} from The Sacramento Bee praised the action scenes {{and the battle}} in the Capitol, the {{reviewer}} also criticized Collins for not giving enough time to finish all the loose ends, writing that [...] "the disappointment with Mockingjay hits primarily as Collins starts her home stretch. It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> didn't allocate enough time or chapters to handle all her threads".|$|E
500|$|In chapter 12 of Gylfaginning, Gangleri tells High {{that the}} sun moves quickly, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were moving so quickly that she fears something, {{that she could not}} go faster even if she were afraid of her own death. High {{responds}} that [...] "It is not surprising that she moves with such speed. The one chasing her comes close, and there is no escape for her except to run." [...] Gangleri asks who chases her, to which High responds that two wolves give chase to Sól and Máni. The first wolf, Sköll, chases Sól, and despite her fear, Sköll will eventually catch her. Hati Hróðvitnisson, the second wolf, runs ahead of Sól to chase after Máni, whom Hati Hróðvitnisson will also catch. In chapter 35, Sól's status as a goddess is stated by High, along with Bil.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{she does}} see me,' whispered Oliver, folding his hands together; 'perhaps she has sat by me. I <b>almost</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She smiled faintly, <b>almost</b> awkwardly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{were totally}} unused to smiling, at my cheap jocularity. Then {{she said with}} that forced precision, a sort of {{conscious}} primness: ...|$|R
500|$|Beyoncé first {{performed}} [...] "Listen" [...] on the Oprah Winfrey {{show and}} received a standing ovation from her cast members, the audience, and left Oprah speechless. Upon the song's completion, Oprah simply exclaimed, [...] "Wow." [...] The second performance was at the 49th Grammy Awards held at the Staples Center, in Los Angeles, California, on February 11, 2007. MTV News' staff members coined it as the Best Oscar Performance, writing: [...] "Beyoncé killed it with a passionate performance of 'Listen'." [...] Beyoncé later performed [...] "Listen" [...] with Alexandra Burke on December 16, 2008, at the final of The X Factor, with Burke having performed the song alone two weeks previously. Burke battled to control her emotions when Beyoncé joined her on stage and dissolved into tears when their duet was over. Burke {{went on to win}} the competition later that night. Barbara Ellen of The Observer praised Beyoncé's performance of the song saying that [...] "there seemed something a little overpowering, invulnerable, dare I say, ungenerous, about Beyoncé - <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were a giant slithering diva/snake hell bent on swallowing poor quivering Burke whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As {{the blessed}} Virgin Mary {{does not seem}} to {{participate}} in the public life of Jesus Christ, and then, suddenly appears at the stations of his cross, she is not there without divine intention. She suffers with her suffering and dying son, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would have died herself. For the salvation of mankind, she gave up her rights as the mother of her son and sacrificed him for the reconciliation of divine justice, as far as she was permitted to do. Therefore, one can say, she redeemed with Christ the human race." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Claire’s open {{disdain for}} her sister, {{she has never}} told Agnes about Tobias’s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has a hidden weapon that she protects in case she may {{have to use it}} one day. When Agnes comes right out and asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire’s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes {{describes}} Claire in this way: “Claire could tell us so much if she cared to [...] [...] [...] Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly [...] [...] [...] You were not named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee’s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{not one of}} the mailboats, anyway. They'd be lighted, saloon {{deck and}} poop," [...] he said. [...] "It <b>almost</b> looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would get away from us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Honor leant {{back with}} folded hands and closed eyes, so that Phoebe <b>almost</b> felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had killed her. 'I suppose Robert {{was right to}} fetch him,' she said; 'but their telling you!' ...|$|R
60|$|With a wild shout, they sprang after her--down the slope, {{crashing}} through the underwood, scattering right and left, and, {{in more than one}} instance, tumbling head over heels. They were quickly joined by their now furious leader; but they crashed, and tumbled, and searched in vain. Nunaga had vanished <b>as</b> completely and <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> mysteriously <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been a spirit.|$|R
2500|$|Uglow's biographies {{have been}} {{particularly}} praised for their vivid, detailed recreation {{of the time and}} place in which their subjects lived. [...] "No one gives us the feel of past life as she does" [...] writes A. S. Byatt of Nature's Engraver: A Life of Thomas Bewick, and a review of The Lunar Men in The Observer claims [...] "never has the eighteenth century come so much to life." [...] Reviewing Hogarth: A Life and a World, Peter Ackroyd wrote, [...] "She depicts the city at first hand, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> herself had been wandering through Hogarth's engravings." [...] Frances Spalding considers Nature's Engraver to be [...] "immeasurably enriched by Uglow's canny grasp of period detail." [...] David Chandler, however, complains that [...] "Uglow tends to amass detail on quotable detail, when sometimes one would like a little more taut synthesis, more interrogation of those details." ...|$|E
60|$|The remark {{staggered}} him, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had {{uttered a}} hideous oath.|$|E
60|$|She {{continued}} to muse {{at me in}} her queer, sightless fashion, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were looking for help.|$|E
6000|$|At once he saw that, in {{some way}} he could not understand, he had hurt her. She {{snatched}} her pencil and wrote, with such swiftness of motion and energy of expression that it <b>almost</b> seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had passionately exclaimed the words aloud, ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Smiles {{listened and}} beamed and twinkled until Miss Cordelia felt <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> dazzled <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{were looking at}} the sun.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie resented this <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> at dinner, <b>she</b> {{were already}} bandying jokes with an {{agreeable}} neighbour. [...] "It {{may have been}} a sovereign." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Lady Casterley looked <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> might strike her granddaughter; {{then a little}} sardonic smile broke out on her face.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} {{suddenly}} upon the divan; it was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> collapsed bereft of strength; and as suddenly she fell to weeping softly.|$|E
60|$|She ate {{her food}} in the deliberate, {{constrained}} way, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> recoiled a little from doing anything so publicly, that he knew so well.|$|E
60|$|Alison was {{conscious}} of a shock of dismay. Sitting in the wagon {{on the crest of}} the rise she could look down across the birches upon a vast sweep of prairie, and {{there was no sign of}} a house anywhere on it. It <b>almost</b> seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> must spend the night in the bluff.|$|R
60|$|For it {{had seemed}} to me that the draperies on her bosom had {{slightly}} moved, a gentle, <b>almost</b> imperceptible heave <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> breathed. I looked, and there it came again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I obey very well," [...] cried Pansy {{with soft}} eagerness, <b>almost</b> with boastfulness, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been {{speaking}} of her piano-playing. And then {{she gave a}} faint, just audible sigh.|$|R
60|$|Again James {{looked at}} her; {{he could not}} make out the {{expression}} on her face. She looked <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were going to cry, and yet....|$|E
6000|$|... 'How do you do, Miss Brangwen,' sang Hermione, in her low, odd, singing fashion, {{that sounded}} <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were poking fun. 'Do you mind my coming in?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, aunt, for pity's sake," [...] {{broke in}} Crystal hurriedly, {{and she put}} up her hands <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wished to stop {{the words in the}} old lady's mouth.|$|E
60|$|Solitary as she was--for Maria and her eternal grumblings {{were poor}} company--she fell to {{thinking}} again over the future, {{as she had}} done not only last night but through the past few interminable days; it <b>almost</b> seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had never, never thought of anything else, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> those same few days stretched out far away behind her into dim and nebulous infinity.|$|R
60|$|Few even of {{the wisest}} women are fit for {{authority}} and liberty so little restrained, and happily it seldom falls to the lot of such as have not previously been chastened by a life-long affliction. But Mrs. Kendal, at twenty-four, with the consequence conferred by marriage, and by her superiority of manners and birth, was left <b>as</b> unchecked and <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> irresponsible <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been single or a widow, and was solely guided by the impulses of her own character, noble and highly principled, but like most zealous dispositions, without balance and without repose.|$|R
60|$|There {{needed no}} more to {{convince}} her that Caroline was excessively ill, and quick and prompt as ever, her first measure was to send Clara for her father, and hold a consultation with him outside the door; a message was despatched to hasten Mr. Wells, {{and the result was}} that a physician was sent for. Marian, who had all this time been watching the severe suffering, unable to do the least thing to alleviate it, was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> glad <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been told of Caroline's certain recovery. She had again to tell herself not to put her trust in physicians.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked for}} a moment as if she were really failing him. [...] "Then you won't meet them?" [...] It was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had {{developed}} an unexpected personal prudence.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a rider. She is a rider. This will be {{the ride}} of your lives," [...] added Jane, in that same soft undertone, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were musing to herself.|$|E
60|$|But now the church-going was possible, {{a fit of}} {{exceeding}} dread {{came upon}} her. Albinia found her with the tears silently rolling down her cheeks, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were unconscious of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I'm {{talking about}} her like this it all comes back to me, just what she was like and how she looked and spoke and acted, and little ways she had of moving her hands and head. I declare it <b>almost</b> seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was {{right here in this}} room instead of being over there in the churchyard. I wish you'd light the lamp, Master. I feel kind of nervous." ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} intensely moved. He {{was filled with}} the warmth of her. In the glow he could <b>almost</b> feel her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were present--her arms, her shoulders, her bosom, see them, feel them, almost contain them.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Guppy retreats {{behind a}} chair. [...] "Small {{told me of}} her. She went leaping and {{bounding}} and tearing about that night like a dragon, and got out on the house-top, and roamed about up there for a fortnight, and then came tumbling down the chimney very thin. Did you ever see such a brute? Looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knew all about it, don't <b>she?</b> <b>Almost</b> looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was Krook. Shoohoo! Get out, you goblin!" ...|$|R
