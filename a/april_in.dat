5|$|In the wild, the {{breeding}} season for Campbell's dwarf hamster varies by location. For example, {{the breeding}} season begins towards {{the middle of}} <b>April</b> <b>in</b> Tuva and {{towards the end of}} <b>April</b> <b>in</b> Mongolia.

Campbell's dwarf hamster is crepuscular, along with all species of Phodopus and is active throughout the year. Campbell's dwarf hamsters are omnivores, and so feed on both plant and insect material. Campbell's dwarf hamster inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in the steppes and semi deserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva and the Hebei province in northeastern China.|$|E
