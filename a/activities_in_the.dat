30|$|Lyatskaya et al.

Using the data of four years (1990 – 91, 1997 – 98) they found that while, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern winter, the correlation between AL and the northern PC/PM indices is very good, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern summer, AL correlates much better with the southern PC/PM indices. In other words, substorm <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer correlates much better with <b>the</b> geomagnetic <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite polar cap. They suggested that this effect may be caused by interhemispheric field-aligned currents flowing from the summer high-latitude ionosphere and closing through <b>the</b> ionosphere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite auroral zone.|$|R
