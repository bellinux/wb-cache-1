5|$|Once <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{enrolled}} in hospice, the hospice becomes the insurance payor for that patient for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, the hospice {{is responsible for}} all care related to the heart failure. However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E

5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E
5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E

5|$|The BDI {{suffers from}} the same {{problems}} as other self-report inventories, in that scores can be easily exaggerated or minimized by the person completing them. Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can {{have an effect on}} the final score. If <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E

25|$|Writer's cramp and musician’s cramp is a task-specific dystonia, {{meaning that}} it only occurs when {{performing}} certain tasks.

It does not occur in other situations, such as when <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> typing or eating. Musician’s cramp occurs only when a musician plays an instrument, {{and the type of}} cramp experienced is specific to the instrument.
