5|$|Kesselring's memoirs were {{published}} in 1953, as Soldat bis zum letzten Tag (A Soldier to the Last Day). They were reprinted in English as A Soldier's Record a year later. Although written {{while he was in}} prison, without access to his papers, the memoirs formed <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource,</b> informing military historians on topics such as the background to the invasion of the Soviet Union. When the English edition was published, Kesselring's contentions that the Luftwaffe was not defeated in the air in the Battle of Britain and that Operation Sea Lion—the invasion of Britain—was thought about but never seriously planned were controversial. In 1955, he published a second book, Gedanken zum Zweiten Weltkrieg (Thoughts on the Second World War).|$|E
25|$|H. littorale is <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> {{extensively}} {{fished in}} the deltas of the Amazon and Orinoco. In Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname, and Trinidad, this species {{is an extremely}} popular food fish.|$|E
25|$|Shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) {{also show}} motivational trade-offs; they will discard <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> (a {{preferred}} shelter) to avoid future encounters with painful stimuli, thereby indicating avoidance learning – a key criterion {{of the ability}} to experience pain.|$|E
50|$|Plastics are too <b>valuable</b> <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> {{to send to}} {{landfill}} at their end of life. Industry wants these materials back to recycle whenever possible. When plastics cannot be sustainably recycled such non-recyclable plastics provides <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> energy <b>resource</b> for advanced thermal process; contributing to energy security and displacing virgin fossils fuels.|$|R

25|$|Natural gas, once flared-off as an unneeded {{byproduct}} of petroleum production, {{is now considered}} <b>a</b> very <b>valuable</b> <b>resource.</b> Natural gas deposits are also {{the main source of}} the element helium.|$|R
25|$|Copper is a {{sustainable}} material. Its durability offers long service with little maintenance. Its high electrical and thermal energy efficiencies reduce {{the waste of}} electrical energy. Its antimicrobial properties destroy pathogenic microorganisms that cause disease. And its high scrap value and ability to be continuously recycled without any loss in performance ensure its responsible management as <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{the ability}} to {{visualize}} important structures in great detail, 3D visualization methods are <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for the diagnosis and surgical treatment of many pathologies. It was a key resource for the famous, but ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Singaporean surgeons to separate Iranian twins Ladan and Laleh Bijani in 2003. The 3D equipment was used previously for similar operations with great success.|$|E
25|$|Orienteering {{maps are}} {{produced}} by local orienteering clubs and are <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for the club. Orienteering maps are expensive to produce and the principal costs are: the fieldwork, drawing (cartography), and printing. Each of these can use up valuable resources of a club, be it in manpower or financial costs. Established clubs with good resources e.g. maps and manpower are usually able to host more events.|$|E
25|$|The Greater Astoria Historical Society in the {{historic}} Quinn Memorial Building {{on the corner of}} Broadway and 36th Street serves as <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> historical <b>resource</b> and provides tourist information.|$|R
50|$|Forgan Road {{which runs}} along {{the eastern shore of}} Lake Samsonvale, gives access to popular fishing and picnic spots making the area <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> {{recreational}} <b>resource</b> for locals and visitors.|$|R

25|$|Covering {{the period}} from 1911 to 1950, this {{collection}} includes photographs, documents, publications, and personal items of Ponce’s first female physician, Ana Dolores Pérez Marchand. Dr. Pérez Marchand {{was also one of}} the first three female physician in Puerto Rico. This collection provides <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for studying the role of women during the early 20th century, and the development of health and medicine in Puerto Rico in general.|$|E
25|$|Technologies {{have been}} {{designed}} for resource poor settings that have been effective in reducing maternal deaths as well. The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is a low-technology pressure device that decreases blood loss, restores vital signs and helps buy time in delay of women receiving adequate emergency care during obstetric hemorrhage. It {{has proven to be}} <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource.</b> Condoms used as uterine tamponades have also been effective in stopping post-partum hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|On both trips Kane sketched {{and painted}} Aboriginal peoples and {{documented}} their lives. Upon {{his return to}} Toronto, he produced {{more than one hundred}} oil paintings from these sketches. Kane's work, particularly his field sketches, are still <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for ethnologists. The oil paintings he completed in his studio are considered a part of the Canadian heritage, although he often embellished them considerably, departing from the accuracy of his field sketches in favour of more dramatic scenes.|$|E

5000|$|Western Carolina's Forensic Research Facility (commonly {{referred}} to as the [...] "Body Farm") is just the second facility of its kind nationally. The decomposition research station is <b>an</b> extremely <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for researchers and forensic anthropology students to study natural decomposition.|$|R
25|$|Today the DoDSR {{is among}} the largest serum {{repositories}} in the world, in terms of numbers of individuals represented, number of longitudinal specimens stored per individual, and total quantity of serum. The majority of specimens are linked to detailed medical and personnel data, creating <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for retrospective research and public health surveillance. The DoDSR's longitudinal serum, collected systematically from a large population, has enabled major contributions to understanding the etiology of many health conditions not otherwise amenable to prospective study, including multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, autoimmune diseases and cancer.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{dissolution}} of monasteries, official state records and important papers were poorly kept, and often retained privately, neglected or destroyed by public officers. Sir Robert collected and bound over a hundred volumes of official papers. By 1622, his house and library stood immediately north of the Houses of Parliament and was <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> and meeting-place not only for antiquarians and scholars but also for politicians and jurists of various persuasions, including Sir Edward Coke, John Pym, John Selden, Sir John Eliot, Thomas Wentworth.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch East Indies {{had long}} been <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> to the Netherlands, so the Dutch feared its independence. The Indonesian National Revolution {{followed}} as Indonesia attempted to secure its independence {{in the face of}} Dutch diplomatic and military opposition (sometimes brutal in nature). Increasing international pressure eventually led the Netherlands to withdraw and it formally recognised Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The western part of New Guinea, remained under Dutch control as Netherlands New Guinea until 1961, when the Netherlands transferred sovereignty of this area to Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|Steel was <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> wartime <b>resource</b> so {{concrete}} was favoured for armouring these pillboxes. Any available lorry chassis was used, {{although the}} weight of the concrete meant that only the heaviest of chassis were suitable.|$|R
30|$|The {{importance}} of buffer capacity as a geochemical factor of their {{resistance to pollution}} and <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> environment <b>resource</b> must be recognized, and its preservation must be {{a major component of}} long-term aquatic system protection policies.|$|R

25|$|Once ashore, {{the whale}} was quickly flensed and divided into its {{separate}} parts for various warehouses and further processing. Although the primary use for whales was meat, the entire whale {{was used in}} a variety of products including lamp oil, soaps, fertilizer, folding fans (baleen), and more. This method of whaling required a significant financial investment from rich individuals to compensate for the sizable labor force. However, whaling remained entwined with ritual and unlike their contemporary European counterparts the early Japanese coastal whalers considered whales <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> and did not over-exploit local stocks.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale urban UV {{wastewater}} treatment is performed in {{cities such as}} Edmonton, Alberta. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal {{wastewater treatment}} processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource,</b> not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.|$|E
25|$|Wetlands {{in general}} are <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> both {{economically}} and environmentally. For instance, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined wetlands covered only 5% of the land surface of the contiguous 48 United States, but they support 31% of the nation's plant species. These very biodiverse systems provide resources, shelter, nesting sites, and resting sites (particularly Louisiana’s coastal wetlands such as Grand Isle for migratory birds) to {{a wide array of}} wildlife. Human users also receive many benefits from wetlands, such as cleaner water, storm surge protection, oil and gas resources (especially on the Gulf Coast), reduced flooding, and chemical and biological waste reduction, to name a few. In Louisiana, rapid wetland loss occurs due to a variety of reasons; this state loses an estimated area {{about the size of a}} football field every hour.|$|E
40|$|The {{internet}} technology represents <b>a</b> new <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> {{for continuing}} education in neurology. The Committee of Medical Education of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology prepared a guideline of selected sites in neurology, making {{the use of}} Internet more productive, combining learning with entertainment...|$|R
50|$|Both {{of these}} {{bodies of water}} have shrunk {{significantly}} in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is <b>an</b> extremely <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> in arid Central Asia {{and can lead to}} rather significant international disputes.|$|R
50|$|Not {{only is it}} {{predicted}} that the boreal ecozones boundaries will shift northward with global warming, its range is expected to shrink as well. These changes will likely result in both a loss of biodiversity, {{and a loss of}} <b>an</b> economically <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for forestry.|$|R
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the World-Wide Web, birders have been using the Internet to convey information; this can be via mailing lists, forums, bulletin-boards, web-based {{databases}} and other media. While most birding lists are geographic in scope, there are special-interest lists that cater to bird-identification, 'twitchers', seabirds and raptor enthusiasts to name but a few. Messages can range from the serious to trivial, notifying others of rarities, questioning the taxonomy or identification of a species, discussing field guides and other resources, asking for advice and guidance, or organizing groups to help save habitats. Occasional postings are mentioned in academic journals and therefore can be <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for professional and amateur birders alike. One of the oldest, Birdchat (based in the US) probably has the most subscribers, followed by the English-language fork of Eurobirdnet, Birding-Aus from Australia, SABirdnet from South Africa and Orientalbirding.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Pilbara Craton is {{the eastern}} {{portion of the}} Pilbara Craton located in Western Australia. This region {{contains}} variably metamorphosed mafic and ultramafic greenstone belt rocks, intrusive granitic dome structures, and volcanic sedimentary rocks. These greenstone belts worldwide {{are thought to be}} the remnants of ancient volcanic belts, and are subject to much debate in today's scientific community. Areas such as Isua and Barberton which have similar lithologies and ages as Pilbara have been argued to be subduction accretion arcs, while others suggest that they are the result of vertical tectonics. This debate is crucial to investigating when/how plate tectonics began on Earth. The Pilbara Craton along with the Kaapvaal Craton are the only remaining areas of the Earth with pristine 3.6–2.5 Ga crust. The extremely old and rare nature of this crustal region makes it <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> in the understanding of the evolution of the Archean Earth.|$|E
25|$|The western {{lowland gorilla}} {{population}} in the wild is faced {{by a number of}} factors that threaten its extinction. Such factors include deforestation, farming, grazing and the expanding human settlements that cause forest loss. There is a correlation between human intervention in the wild with the destruction of habitats and increase in bushmeat hunting. Another of these factors is infertility. Generally, female gorillas mature at 10–12 years of age (or earlier at 7–8 years) and their male counterparts mature more slowly, rarely strong and dominant enough to reproduce before 15–20 years of age. The fecundity of females, or capacity of producing young in great numbers, appears to decline by the age of 18. Of one half of captive females of viable reproductive age, approximately only 30% of those had only a single birth. However, these non-reproductive gorillas may prove to be <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> since the use of assisted reproductive techniques aid in the maintaining of genetic diversity in the limited populations in zoos.|$|E
50|$|Volta Lake, {{the largest}} {{artificial}} {{lake in the}} world, extends from the Akosombo Dam in southeastern Ghana {{to the town of}} Yapei, 520 km to the north. The lake generates electricity, provides inland transportation, and is <b>a</b> potentially <b>valuable</b> <b>resource</b> for irrigation and fish farming.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to holding its collections, it is a working museum that manufactures matrices for letterpress printing. The Museum has become <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> educational <b>resource</b> for many colleges, {{and helps to}} meet the demand for an educational and experimental type workshop.|$|R
5|$|There {{is a great}} {{tradition}} of public access and outdoor recreation in the area. The Peak District formed a natural hinterland and rural escape for the populations of industrial Manchester and Sheffield, and remains <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> leisure <b>resource</b> in <b>a</b> largely post-industrial economy.|$|R
