40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} and Climate change is rarely {{a subject of}} labour studies. Likewise, environmental studies limit themselves mostly to CSR and to changing consumption, without taking the work process and workers’ rights into account. Our research project conducts {{an investigation of the}} relationship between labour and the environment and environmental policies in a north-south perspective. The proposed paper presents first results from an investigation {{of the ways in which}} trade unions in the Global North and South are developing policies towards environmental {{degradation and}} Climate Change. The paper will focus on what we see as the two main contradictions facing trade union policies globally: 1. The way in which workers of the South and the North are set against each other as competitors for jobs through the relocation processes of Transnational Corporations, 2. The apparent contradiction between protecting jobs and protecting the environment with which trade unions are confronted when environmental measures are not <b>accompanied</b> by <b>social</b> <b>measures.</b> We will discuss the barriers unions face in overcoming these contradictions and analyse the policies they are developing to combine social and environmental sustainability: ‘Green Jobs’ and ‘Just Transition’. The empirical bases are 32 semi-structured interviews with unionists in international, regional, national and local trade unions from Sweden, the UK, Brazil, South Africa, and Malaysia, participant observation in several Trade Union conferences and policy documents of unions internationally and nationally...|$|R

Participants were regular (N = 287) and special education (N = 175) students in three midwestern cities. The students completed the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Perception Profile for Learning Disabled Students (SPPLDS) and <b>accompanying</b> <b>social</b> comparison <b>measure</b> (Renick 2 ̆ 6 Harter, 1988), as well as a measure of locus of control consisting of the cognitive section from Connell 2 ̆ 7 s (1985) Multidimensional Measure of Children 2 ̆ 7 s Perceptions of Control. Students also were asked to choose from whom and where they would prefer to receive extra academic assistance. Data on each student 2 ̆ 7 s educational handicapping condition, level of special education programming, curriculum modification, and extent of team teaching utilized were provided by classroom teachers;Initial analyses by district indicated differences in self-perceptions; for all academic self-perception areas regular education students in District A scored the same as the special education students (combined for all three districts) and lower than those in Districts B and C. Special education students rated Powerful Other (F (2, 436) = 14. 67, p 3 ̆c. 001) and Unknown control (F (2, 436) = 13. 22, p 3 ̆c. 001) as more important in obtaining grades than did the regular education students. Significant differences between regular education and special education students 2 ̆ 7 choices were identified on all nine social comparison items.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} six main questions. I. Can <b>social</b> {{desirability}} <b>measures</b> reliably identify fakers? There {{is no evidence}} that any <b>social</b> desirability <b>measure</b> can identify individual fakers. II. Should personality measures used for personnel selection include <b>social</b> desirability <b>measures?</b> The only reason to include a <b>social</b> desirability <b>measure</b> is if it predicts job performance. In fact, <b>social</b> desirability <b>measures</b> can be used to predict training performance. Ones, Viswesvaran and Reiss (1996), in their meta-analysis found that responding to <b>social</b> desirability <b>measures</b> is correlated with training performance. Another point {{to keep in mind is}} that there are legal considerations for not including <b>social</b> desirability <b>measures</b> in operational selection systems. III. What conclusions can be safely drawn from the faking literature? First, many job applicants fake their responses (Lueke, Snell, Illingworth, & Paidas, 2001) and faked responses can result in large shifts in scores on self-repor...|$|R
40|$|Politically, {{the eight}} Southeast European {{countries}} have been less stable than those countries in Central Europe and the Baltics which are on track for EU Accession in 2004. The former countries have achieved generally poorer economic performance since 1990, and their economic reforms have also progressed more slowly. With this background, this paper notes that economic development is fundamentally about raising living standards, and that this most often occurs through job creation, <b>accompanied</b> by <b>social</b> policy <b>measures</b> to alleviate the most extreme poverty. In the longer term, of course, investment - both in basic infrastructure and in directly productive assets (buildings, equipment and the like) - is vital for sustained growth. Since investment is often supported by a sound financial system, we also discuss the region’s nascent banking systems and financial markets. All countries belonging to the SEE region {{have to be considered}} small, open economies. Their future prosperity will be found through integration with the wider world economy, including especially their immediate neighbours and the EU. Hence the trading environment in which the SEE countries operate is a critical feature of their economic progress - with both political and economic dimensions. We also refer to other international flows such as aid and FDI, sketching the factors likely to influence these. Why have reforms in the SEE region not proceeded faster than they have, and what constraints does the reform process face? These are very difficult questions, but I shall attempt to pinpoint the most important constraints, before concluding the paper by outlining possible ways forward. The last part also highlights a few issues of a more general nature that currently impede the region’s economic progress, focusing on: investment and growth, trade, micro-level institutional reforms, and financial market development. Southeast Europe, transition, financial markets, economic growth, institutional reforms. ...|$|R
