5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an action {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and game controls are unified across the PC and home console versions. Players {{have the option}} of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and game controller to play; the former two are achieved on PlayStation 4 via wireless or USB keyboard and mouse. By default, the system is navigated through drag and drop windows on PC. Navigation on the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy XIV is accomplished with a XrossMediaBar-like interface due to platform users' familiarity with the set-up. This bar is used to access all menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. The head-up display for both versions includes a message log, party status menu, mini-map, and <b>action</b> <b>bar.</b> The player may customize the location of all of these elements.|$|E
500|$|The <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> {{and battle}} command input method differs {{slightly}} between the PC and PlayStation versions. The PC version supports both point and click and keyboard selection of commands or macros from the <b>action</b> <b>bar.</b> Macro commands are customizable sequences of actions that allow players to execute desired abilities {{at a specific}} time. The PlayStation version instead maps the <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> and macros to the [...] "Cross Hotbar"—sets of four icons arranged in a cross shape. These are the grouped and accessed {{through a combination of}} the L2 and the R2 buttons and the directional pad or the face buttons. Using each shoulder button to cycle through the cross sets, players have quick access to commands. This interface is also available to PC players who use controllers.|$|E

50|$|Dual <b>action</b> <b>bars</b> {{connect the}} {{fore-end}} to the bolt, and generous clearances between the steel <b>action</b> <b>bars</b> and their receiver channels reduce wear on the aluminium receiver while allowing the shotgun to function {{with the presence}} of dirt or debris. The Model 500's bolt locks into a recess located {{on the top of the}} steel barrel instead of the receiver itself, thus allowing the use of lightweight aluminum instead of steel. The trigger housing and safety button are made of plastic to reduce cost.|$|R

2500|$|Weezer (also {{referred}} to as The Blue Album) was released in May 1994. Geffen originally {{did not wish to}} release a single, to see what sales could be generated by word-of-mouth alone. DJ Marco Collins of the Seattle radio station The End started playing [...] "Undone – The Sweater Song", leading Geffen to release it as the first single. The music video was directed by Spike Jonze. Filmed in an unbroken take, it featured Weezer performing on a sound stage with little <b>action,</b> <b>bar</b> a pack of dogs swarming the set. The video became an instant hit on MTV.|$|E

5000|$|Introduced in 1960, all model 500s {{are based}} on the same basic concept {{designed}} by Carl Benson. Originally using a single <b>action</b> <b>bar,</b> that was known to bind and even break, this was changed to dual action bars in 1970, following the expiration of Remington's patent on the double <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> design. A single large locking lug is used to secure the breech. The magazine tube is located below the barrel, and is screwed into the receiver. The slide release is located to the left rear of the trigger guard, and the safety is located on the upper rear of the receiver (often called a [...] "tang safety").|$|E

5000|$|The 760 {{featured}} a detachable box magazine, dual <b>action</b> <b>bars,</b> and a removable aluminum trigger group. The bolt featured 14 locking lugs {{laid out in}} an interrupted-thread pattern. These lugs locked into corresponding lugs in a barrel extension {{by means of a}} cam-rotated bolt. [...] This bolt arrangement was problematic and the interrupted thread lugs were replaced with more conventional lugs on the Model 7600 that replaced it.|$|R

The law also created the office of Solicitor General to supervise and conduct government litigation in the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Ar tonelico {{features}} a turn-based battle system akin {{to those of}} the Atelier Iris series. The active party consists of up to three fighters in the front and one Reyvateil in the back. An action can be chosen for each fighter as their turn arrives. An <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> {{at the top of the}} screen indicates the turn order for every character and opponent involved in the battle. Fighters may choose to strike the enemy, defend themselves, use a skill, use an item, or to protect the Reyvateil.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} reasons for its failure. Foremost was the Reising's complex design of many small pins, plungers, springs and levers. Dis{{assembly}} and assembly was difficult even under normal conditions. Simple maintenance was problematic as there was no bolt hold-open device. Chambering a cartridge was awkward as the <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> was hard to grasp in the forearm and could be obstructed by the sling. Worse, the safety/selector switch couldn't be sensed by feel at night if {{it was in the}} safe, semi, or automatic position.|$|E
50|$|Being Remington's first gas-operated shotgun, the Model 58 {{suffered}} from many design shortcomings {{compared to the}} contemporary Model 11-48 with which it shared many design features and parts. The gas system was built into {{the front of the}} magazine and therefore limited capacity to two-shots. Gas was tapped from a hole in the barrel into a large chamber. A piston in this chamber drove an <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> rearward which, in turn, operated the bolt to cycle the action. The action spring was also located inside the forward end of the magazine tube.|$|E

The time period for this study is 1982 to 1992. Qualitative methods are used to analyze data and arrive at conclusions. Secondary data provide additional depth and background. This study reveals seven different positions institutions have taken in response to ROTC policy, these include: supporting ROTC policy, neutrality, collective <b>action,</b> <b>barring</b> military recruiters from campus, distancing the institution from ROTC, and changing the campus climate. This includes examples taken from AAU institutions and rationales behind making policy decisions...|$|R

50|$|The {{combat system}} was redone as well. Instead of the {{previous}} skill selection system used in Diablo II there is an <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> {{at the bottom of}} the screen. This change replaces the area where the potion-belt used to be in Diablo II. For the first time in the series, players are able to choose the gender of their characters upon creation. The gender of the characters affects only visuals and voices. Diablo III's release date was officially announced on March 15, 2012 and the game was released worldwide on May 15, 2012.|$|E
50|$|Gabriel Knight 3 {{is played}} from a third-person perspective, {{and uses a}} basic point-and-click {{interface}} for most actions in the game, while players have full control over the camera in regards to positioning and angle, although it cannot go beyond the location it is in and is fixed during dialogue between characters and in pre-scripted sequences; in these moments, the viewpoint moves independently of the player character. When the character is not {{in view of the}} camera and is some distance from it when they are moved, they will teleport to a spot directly close to the camera before appearing on screen. When the player interacts with something in the main character's location, such as a person or an object, an <b>action</b> <b>bar</b> appears with various verbal commands that the character can do with the object, such as picking something up, reading a book, thinking about it, or talking to a person; when in conversation with a person that the character wishes to question, the subjects that they can ask or talk about appear within a similar style of <b>action</b> <b>bar.</b> At certain points in the game, the player may venture out onto the regional map of the area and explore different locations, with more added upon them being uncovered {{during the course of the}} game.|$|E

50|$|The 870 {{features}} a bottom-loading, side ejecting receiver, tubular magazine under the barrel, dual <b>action</b> <b>bars,</b> internal hammer, and a bolt which locks into an extension in the barrel. The action, receiver, fire control group, safety catch and slide release catch of the Remington Model 870 shotgun {{are similar to}} those used on the Remington Model 7600 series pump-action centerfire rifles and carbines. The basic fire control group design was first used in the automatic 11-48. Twelve gauge stocks will also interchange on the older 12-gauge-sized 20-gauge receivers, although modification is needed to fit the smaller sized 20-gauge receivers employed since the late 1970s. Several parts of the 870 will interchange with the semi-automatic Remington 1100 and 11-87.|$|R
5000|$|On June 26, Hungary’s primary right-wing extremist website, Kuruc.info, {{published}} {{a list of}} gay bars, cafés, saunas, guest houses and hotels in Budapest. This was an ominous development, since beginning in December 2007 {{a group called the}} Arrows of the Hungarians National Liberation Army (Magyarok Nyilai Nemzeti Felszabadító Hadsereg) had firebombed several residences and other locations implicitly identified as targets on the website. Early the following morning, a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the entry of the gay-frequented <b>Action</b> <b>Bar</b> in Budapest, while on the morning of July 2, four Molotov cocktails were tossed into one of the city's sauna Gay bathhouse in Budapest, slightly injuring one of the establishment’s employees. On July 3, Kuruc.info reported on the latter firebombing under the title Cleansing Fire Licks Another Mini Sodom in which the website noted that [...] "Incidentally, we drew the attention of our readers to the sauna, just in case they wanted a little hot air." [...] Though the Arrows of the Hungarians did not claim responsibility for the firebombings as the organization had done in previous cases, usually publishing video recordings of the attacks, Kuruc.info asked the largely rhetorical question following the assault on the <b>Action</b> <b>Bar</b> [...] "has the Arrows of the Hungarians National Liberation Army struck again?" [...] Kuruc.info further prepared its readers for the gay parade with the publication of detailed instructions, including pictures, two days before the event, on how to fill eggs with dye for throwing at the marchers in the procession.|$|E

5000|$|The Reising {{cost and}} weighed {{less than the}} Thompson because its metal {{components}} were mostly stampings instead of machined parts. Its low weight was due to its delayed blowback design, whereas most WW II submachine guns utilized the simple blowback principle. Simple blowback relies largely on the mass (weight) of the bolt to secure the cartridge when firing and therefore requires this component to be particularly heavy. ( [...] The 1928A1 Thomson had a more involved Blish lock system but this was similarly dependent on high bolt mass.) It was more balanced because the barrel-and-receiver-group rested concentrically within the stock. It had smoother lines because the stock was of conventional shape and the cocking handle (<b>action</b> <b>bar)</b> was placed inside the forearm. And it was more accurate because the closed-bolt only shifted the hammer and firing pin on firing, whereas the Thompson slammed home a heavy bolt and actuator.|$|E
50|$|The {{detachable}} barrel {{is locked}} in place with a dowel at the receiver and a nut at the magazine tube. The barrel and chamber are chrome-coated for increased durability and corrosion protection. The chamber is sealed by rotating the sealing wedge, which locks into the port in the shank of the barrel. Its trigger mechanism is located on a detachable mounting plate. Cartridges are fed from a tubular magazine under the barrel, and shells are ejected {{from the side of}} the receiver. The forearm is located on the magazine, and is connected to the slide frame by two <b>action</b> <b>bars.</b> A blocking lever blocks the forearm when the hammer is cocked. A cross-bolt trigger safety prevents an accidental pull of the trigger from firing the gun.|$|R
