5|$|Other natural {{patterns}} {{occur in}} foams; these are packed according to Plateau's laws, which require minimal surfaces. Such foams present {{a problem in}} how to pack cells <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> as possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E

5|$|The {{noble gas}} atoms, like atoms in most groups, {{increase}} steadily in atomic radius from one period {{to the next}} due to {{the increasing number of}} electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential {{similar to that of the}} oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.|$|E
5|$|The storm drifted southward {{and later}} eastward due to northerly flow behind a mid- to upper-level trough in the Gulf of Mexico. With {{well-defined}} outflow and warm sea surface temperatures, Barbara became better organized <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> curved bands of convection developed near the center. However, by May 31, increased wind shear and less inflow deteriorated {{the definition of}} the circulation, causing the storm to weaken. By later that day, the system contained a very small circulation within a large-scale trough, and early on June 1 it was downgraded to tropical depression status. Later in the day, convective banding features re-developed, and after a QuikSCAT overpass indicated a well-defined circulation in the system, Barbara was again upgraded to tropical storm status. The storm reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) and turned to the northeast as it tracked through a break in a ridge extending from the southwest Gulf of Mexico. Banding features continued to organize, and shortly before moving ashore a low-level eye feature developed. At about 1300UTC on June 2, Barbara made landfall just west of the border between Mexico and Guatemala. The center quickly deteriorated to tropical depression status over the mountainous terrain of extreme southeastern Chiapas, and Barbara dissipated within twelve hours of moving ashore.|$|E

There is, however, little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing STIs, and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy, which {{may be due to the}} female condom not fitting <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> as the male condom or because it can slip into the vagina and spill semen.|$|E

The album {{is set in}} Detroit, Michigan and {{is divided into three}} acts: [...] "Heroes and Cons", [...] "Charlatans and Saints", and [...] "Horseshoes and Handgrenades". Its loose narrative follows a young couple named Christian and Gloria through the challenges present in the U.S. following the presidency of George W. Bush. Bassist Mike Dirnt has compared the relationships between the songs to those in Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run, saying that the themes are not <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> interwoven as in a concept album, but that they are still connected. Many of the record's themes and lyrics are drawn from Armstrong's personal life and he sings in the first-person narrative style about abandonment and vengeance in [...] "Before the Lobotomy", [...] "Christian's Inferno", and [...] "Peacemaker". Rolling Stone noted that the album is [...] "the most personal, emotionally convulsive record Armstrong has ever written".|$|E
500|$|... "Kill Switch" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Francis Dass of New Straits Times was positive toward the episode, calling it [...] "excellent". John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode puts Gibson’s genre credibility {{to good use}} by taking standard concepts of cyberpunk and applying them to the series." [...] He did note that there are [...] "a few minor characterization issues", and that [...] "not all of the concepts are pulled together <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> as they could be", but other than those points, he concluded that it was [...] "solid and [...] enjoyable". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. [...] The two wrote that its themes were [...] "fresh and new" [...] and that the plot had [...] "real heart to it"." [...] Shearman and Pearson wrote positively of Mulder's virtual experiencing, praising [...] "kickboxing Scully" [...] and calling her [...] "supercool". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote that, while [...] "William Gibson’s cyberpunk milieu wouldn’t necessarily {{seem to be the}} best fit for The X-Files", the episode [...] "weirdly benefits from the lack of staff oversight." [...] He noted that it featured many elements to its plot, but was [...] "a rare example of an X-Files episode that works, even though it tries to do too much." [...] VanDerWerff was complimentary towards the story and called it [...] "propulsive"; he was particularly praise-worthy of the fact that Scully was featured heavily in the episode. He cited the scene wherein a virtual Scully roundhouse kicks a group of nurses {{as one of the best}} shots in the episode, and called it a [...] "hysterical moment". Brett Love of TV Squad stated that it is his favorite episode of The X-Files, considering it a [...] "great story" [...] and describing it as a [...] "tough one to beat". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's directing and noted that the entry was [...] "a great improvement over The X-Files earlier A.I. episode, first season's [...] "Ghost in the Machine". Vitaris cited [...] "Mulder's virtual experience" [...] as the [...] "highlight of the episode".|$|E

2500|$|Formations were {{comparatively}} {{loose in}} the Congo region, and various groups were tasked with movements determined on the spot by their leaders. Firearms did not change this basic pattern. While movement was not <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> controlled or executed as among the Zulu, war-leaders were quite aware of the basic stratagems of maneuver, including extension of a battle-line to attempt encirclement. In the Guinea/Gambia Zone however fighting formations were tighter, an expedient also adopted by European infantry who faced mounted knights. According to English sailors of the defeated Hawkins expedition in the 16th century, armies deployed with shield-bearers in front, each with a two-headed javelin for fighting. [...] Behind each shield-bearer, stood 3 archers, ready to provide firepower support. The battle usually opened with a discharge of arrows. A war cry was then given, and general hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Such formations required planned drill in advance. A commander named Xerebogo for example in the 16th century kept his soldiers in step by using bells attached to pace horses. The advent of guns loosened this tight organization, and more maneuver and open formations were employed.|$|E
2500|$|Metaphase: The {{metaphase}} {{structure of}} chromatin differs vastly {{to that of}} interphase. It is optimised for physical strength and manageability, forming the classic chromosome structure seen in karyotypes. The structure of the condensed chromatin {{is thought to be}} loops of 30nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well-characterised.The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 analogues.It should also be noted that, during mitosis, while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into chromatosis. The lack of compaction of these regions is called bookmarking, which is an epigenetic mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the [...] "memory" [...] of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis. This bookmarking mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during mitosis.|$|E
