5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Slug (Marshall Lancaster), who {{had been}} seen {{on-screen}} dating Becky in her early appearances, returned. The two characters share a backstory, which was partially created by Lancaster and Kelly themselves. During an interview with Digital Spy Kelly spoke the impact Slug has had on Becky stating: [...] "Marshall and I have invented a whole back story between us. It's nice to remember where Becky came from and what a journey she's had. Slug was {{an important part of}} Becky's life– they’ve got <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>history.</b> They grew up together and looked out for each other." [...] The storyline progresses into Slug confessing his love for Becky. Kelly points out that Becky has been on a journey, subsequently changing, stating that [...] "Becky and Slug didn't know what love was" [...] and that she proves she has changed by rejecting his advances.|$|E

He {{added that the}} characters' {{relationship}} would be tense and complex; their background and the reasoning behind Ziva's animosity towards the new Mossad director would be explained in the final scenes. Sirtis described her character's relationship with Ziva as electric, explaining that she saw Orli as a counterfoil to Ziva's intensity and drive for vengeance. Their history, she believed, is [...] "kind of mind-blowing"; it provides an explanation for subplots introduced earlier in the episode. She clarified that Director Elbaz {{would not be a}} [...] "shrinking flower": [...] "She's kickass. She's strong. She's manipulative. She uses every weapon in her female arsenal. These parts for middle-aged women in Hollywood do not come along very often. I'm thrilled that the producers of the show were brave enough to cast a woman in this role. They're prepared to take risks. It's a big gamble." ...|$|E

500|$|Mark and Kate {{broke up}} after Kate confessed to lying in her police {{statement}} during Paul's investigation. McGregor told Inside Soap that Mark {{did not stop}} loving Kate and that since {{he had time to}} think about it, the issue was not as [...] "black and white" [...] as he first thought. Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) had taken an interest in Kate and he did not like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle. McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate, it forced Mark {{to come up with a}} plan to get closer to his ex-girlfriend. McGregor said, [...] "He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through!" [...] Mark later asked Lucas for his advice, but Lucas was not much help. Both Kate and Mark wanted to get back together and Brewer said, [...] "They both have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which really hurts Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward." [...] The actress believed Mark was [...] "the one" [...] for Kate as they were both academic and focused.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Port Authority {{obtained}} Blount Island, {{the island}} was named Goat Island. The Bartchlett family lived on the island for over 35 years. They were there during World War II. They observed ships coming through the channel still burning from action in the war. The Dames Point Cut that straightened the river was signed off by George Bartchlett allowing the dredging to begin. He raised seven children and four grandchildren on this island. At that time {{the only way to}} {{the island was}} by boat. The house once set on the Dames Point side of the island. The children going to school caught the bus at the end of Dames point road. There is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> to this island that once was a family's home.|$|E

Elizabeth Hurley of USA Today commented [...] "The beauty of this program is that it's not just a history lesson, but a lesson in thinking...Each case requires the player {{to solve a problem}} before getting clues to where the villain is hiding...The software has taken the boredom out of learning." [...] KindsWorld Magazine noted [...] "you don't have to know <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> to enjoy this game, and there's an electronic reference book for help". The journal article Feminist Interventions in Electronic Environments praised the game for providing educational content [...] "in a gender-neutral way" [...] while having [...] "strong, intelligent women characters".|$|E

2500|$|Despite lasting in {{the serial}} for eight years, {{during his tenure}} in EastEnders, {{producers}} appeared to differ in their opinions of Pete's importance in the programme; some referenced the character's value, while others deemed him disposable and there were several attempts to cull the character. It was revealed in 1987 that Pete was originally only {{intended to be a}} short-term character. Show creator and series producer Julia Smith had considered killing him off in 1986, but she vetoed this idea, ultimately deciding that Pete was too much of an asset to lose. When producer Mike Gibbon took the helm as head of the serial in 1989, he employed writer David Yallop to pen storylines that controversially killed-off various characters in the show. According to Yallop, the decision to axe the characters was dependent of the talent of the actors portraying them. Yallop stated that Pete Beale was among the characters to be killed. The storyline never came to fruition because Gibbon's controversial plots were not sanctioned by the BBC and Yallop's storylines were not used; Yallop sued the BBC for termination of contract, at which time the finer details of the proposed plots were disclosed to the media. Despite this, in 1991, EastEnders storyline editor Andrew Holden described Pete as [...] "almost synonymous" [...] with the programme because he had been there since day one. He added, [...] " [...] carry <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>history.</b> Original characters are very precious things. [...] has always seen himself as a family man and in the future we see him making a determined effort to put his family back together. Whatever happens he'll always carry a torch for Kathy". According to Holden at that time, Pete was [...] "an untouchable", not in danger of being killed-off.|$|E

6000|$|Those, however, {{were later}} things--extensions of view {{hampered}} for the present, as I have noted, by our mere London street-scenery, which {{had much to}} build out for us. I see again that we but endlessly walked and endlessly daubed, and that our walks, with an obsession of their own, constantly abetted our daubing. We knew no other boys at all, and we even saw no others, I seem to remember, save the essentially rude ones, rude {{with a kind of}} mediæval rudeness for which our clear New York experience had given us no precedent, and of which the great and constant sign was the artless, invidious wonder produced in them, on our public appearances, by the alien stamp in us that, for our comfort, we vainly sought to dissimulate. We conformed in each particular, so far as we could, to the prevailing fashion and standard, of a narrow range in those days, but in our very plumage--putting our ramage aside--our wood-note wild must have seemed to sound, so sharply we challenged, when abroad, the attention of our native contemporaries, and even sometimes of their elders, pulled up at sight of us in the from-head-to-foot stare, a curiosity void of sympathy and that attached itself for some reason especially to our feet, which were not abnormally large. The London people had for themselves, at the same time, an exuberance of type; we found it in particular a world of costume, often of very odd costume--the most intimate notes of which were the postmen in their frock-coats of military red and their black beaver hats; the milkwomen, in hats that often emulated these, in little shawls and strange short, full frocks, revealing enormous boots, with their pails swung from their shoulders on wooden yokes; the inveterate footmen hooked behind the coaches of the rich, frequently in pairs and carrying staves, together with the mounted and belted grooms without the attendance of whom riders, of whichever sex--and riders then were much more numerous--almost never went forth. The range of character, on the other hand, reached rather dreadfully down; there were embodied and exemplified [...] "horrors" [...] in the streets beside which any present exhibition is pale, and I well remember the almost terrified sense of their salience produced in me a couple of years later, on the occasion of a flying return from the Continent with my father, by a long, an interminable drive westward from the London Bridge railway-station. It was a soft June evening, with a lingering light and swarming crowds, as they then seemed to me, of figures reminding me of George Cruikshank's Artful Dodger and his Bill Sikes and his Nancy, only with the bigger brutality of life, which pressed upon the cab, the early-Victorian fourwheeler, as we jogged over the Bridge, and cropped up in more and more gas-lit patches for all our course, culminating, somewhere far to the west, in the vivid picture, framed by the cab-window, of a woman reeling backward as a man felled her to the ground with a blow in the face. The London view at large had in fact more than a Cruikshank, there still survived in it quite a Hogarth, side--which I had of course then no name for, but which I was so sharply to recognise on coming back years later that it fixed for me the veracity of the great pictorial chronicler. Hogarth's mark is even yet not wholly overlaid; though time has per contra dealt with that stale servility of address which most expressed to our young minds the rich burden of a Past, the consequence of too much history. I liked for my own part <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> but felt in face of certain queer old obsequiosities and appeals, whinings and sidlings and hand-rubbings and curtsey-droppings, the general play of apology and humility, behind which the great dim social complexity seemed to mass itself, that one didn't quite want so inordinate a quantity. Of that particular light and shade, however, the big broom of change has swept the scene bare; more history still has been after all what it wanted. Quite another order, in the whole connection, strikes me as reigning to-day--though not without the reminder from it that the relations in which manner, as a generalised thing, in which [...] "tone," [...] is positively pleasant, is really assured and sound, clear and interesting, are numerous and definite only when it has had in its past some strange phases and much misadventure.|$|E
