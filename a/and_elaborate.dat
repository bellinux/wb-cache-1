5|$|Elsewhere, the kabuki theater {{tradition}} in Japan employs ritualized representations of {{violence on the}} stage. While kabuki is technically theater and not dance, the movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, <b>and</b> <b>elaborate</b> fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance.|$|E

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} several {{significant}} works of modern literature. Her romantic attachment with Pericles has inspired {{some of the}} most famous novelists and poets of the last centuries. In particular the romanticists of the 19th century and the historical novelists of the 20th century found in their story an inexhaustible source of inspiration. In 1835 Lydia Maria Child, an American abolitionist, novelist, and journalist, published Philothea, a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia. This book is regarded as the most successful <b>and</b> <b>elaborate</b> of the author's productions, because the female characters, especially Aspasia, are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy.|$|E

5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly <b>and</b> <b>elaborate</b> rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E
5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, <b>and</b> <b>elaborate</b> cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India.

Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common <b>and</b> <b>elaborate</b> for boys than for girls.|$|E

The album features guest contributions from Adam Levine, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Common, Jay-Z, Brandy, and Nas, among others. Its production was notably more lush <b>and</b> <b>elaborate</b> than West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate sampling methods and string orchestration with Brion. West's lyrics explore both personal and political themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.|$|E
