5|$|Portrayals of lesbians in {{the media}} suggest that society at large has been {{simultaneously}} intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles, and fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families, friends, and others {{as a result of}} homophobia. As women, they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, prejudice, and minority stress. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships <b>and</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> open.|$|E
5|$|Despite never moving onto land, Nina's {{proximity}} to Hawaii and the forecasts for an imminent landfall resulted in massive evacuations. An estimated 300people living in Hanapepe and Hanalei {{were forced to}} evacuate when the Hanalei River overflowed its banks. An estimated 1,500people on Kauai were evacuated to higher ground, where the Red Cross had established seven evacuation centers for these people to evacuate to. In addition, thirteen members of the United States Coast Guard were evacuated from low-lying islands and harbors when they were threatened by rising tides triggered by the hurricane {{and the threat of}} flooding forced 420military personnel <b>and</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> Waikiki's Ft. Derussy and Ft. Armstrong as well as those living in Ft. Kamehameha, near Pearl Harbor to leave for higher ground. 270 were housed in Tripler Army Hospital and a temporary shelter was opened in Ft. Shafter, both of which were on high ground. In anticipation of Nina, 85 planes were flown away from Barber's Point Naval Air Base to Midway and several commercial flights were cancelled until the storm had passed. There was also concern for the residents of the privately owned Niihau, the closest landmass to the center of Nina and 20miles closer than Kauai. The island's only communications was by boat and most attempts at reaching the island failed due to high surf.|$|E

The Malayan Railway (now Keretapi Tanah Melayu) used the Off Jalan Bangsar area because the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and depot is less than three kilometres away in Brickfields. The National Electricity Board (now Tenaga Nasional Berhad) housed their staff in Bukit Bangsar since its headquarters is in Pantai Hills. Staff quarters are still found and used in Bangsar today.|$|E

Begun in 2006, XTech was primarily funded by a National Science Foundation grant and provided afterschool activities in science, engineering, and technology in partnership with two community-based organizations in the Bay Area. XTech serves over 100 students a year in addition to 10-15 youth facilitators.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1880s, {{birth rates}} began to drop {{steadily}} {{in the industrialized}} countries, as women married later <b>and</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> urban living conditions increasingly favoured having fewer children. This trend was particularly acute in the United Kingdom, where birth rates declined from almost 35.5 births per 1,000 in the 1870s to about 29 per 1,000 by 1900. While the cause is uncertain, the 29% decline within a generation shows that the birth control methods Victorian women used were effective. Many women were educated about contraception and how to avoid pregnancy. While the rhythm method was not yet understood, condoms and diaphragms made of vulcanized rubber were reliable and inexpensive.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to founding Sarah Lawrence College, William Lawrence {{played a critical}} role in the development of the neighboring community of Bronxville, New York. His name can be found on the affluent Lawrence Park and Lawrence Park West neighborhoods, the Houlihan Lawrence Real Estate Corporation, and on Lawrence Hospital in downtown Bronxville, an institution that was created when Lawrence’s son, Dudley, nearly died en route to a hospital in neighboring New York City. Lawrence embodied ideas from the Progressivist movement of the 1890s, especially his view that the arts were a crucial element in the social evolution of individuals <b>and</b> <b>families,</b> <b>in</b> developing both private and public sensibilities, and in creating equal relations between men and women.|$|E

25|$|To work in {{the nursing}} profession, all nurses hold one or more {{credentials}} depending on their scope of practice and education. A licensed practical nurse (LPN) (also {{referred to as a}} licensed vocational nurse, registered practical nurse, enrolled nurse, and state enrolled nurse) works independently or with a registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A registered nurse provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients <b>and</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> many health care settings. Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} an airport at Svea arose during the mid 1990s. Store Norske, which had until then been mining coal in Longyearbyen, {{was in the process}} of moving the bulk of its mining {{operations}} to Svea. A road between the two towns was out of the question of environmental reasons. The company proposed that Svea would be built as a dorm town, were workers would commute for the week. They would have their permanent homes <b>and</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> Longyearbyen. On 10 April 1994, Store Norske's board stated that they could not support the two main alternatives, construction of an all-new permanent dwelling town in Svea, and commuting from the mainland. Store Norske cited their commitment to keep Longyearbyen a vibrant community.|$|E
25|$|Primitive Methodism {{was also}} shaped by Bourne's joint {{concern for the}} spiritual {{salvation}} and social welfare of ordinary working people. For example, just like Keir Hardie {{in the early twentieth}} century, Bourne understood that drunkenness was a major factor which kept working-class people down in base conditions. Also, In the face of establishment opposition, Bourne promoted working class education, including instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic, in addition to religious teaching, at the Primitive Methodist Sunday Schools. Many early trade union pioneers were drawn from the ranks of Primitive Methodist Preachers, and a basic 'welfare state' used to operate among chapel-goers, their neighbours <b>and</b> <b>families.</b> <b>In</b> common with some other non-conformists, Bourne accepted women as of equal status with men by (amongst other things) appointing women Preachers.|$|E

25|$|Recreational {{activities}} included {{music and}} sports. Prisoners formed musical clubs and theatrical groups and attended band concerts at the camp. Books and periodicals {{were available in}} the camp, and a photographer was allowed to make daguerrotypes of the prisoners' likenesses to send to their friends <b>and</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> the South. Other pastimes included ballgames and whittling. No visitors or communication between the prisoners and the camp guards or local citizens were allowed, but mail correspondence and small packages were delivered to prisoners after they had been inspected. Contraband was removed before delivery, and outgoing letters were censored and inspected before they were mailed. Attempts to escape were rare while Owen was commandant. Only thirteen of its forty-two hundred prisoners escaped during his command of the camp.|$|E
25|$|Estimating in January 2007 {{that he was}} {{continuing}} to earn approximately US$1.5million a year from his Cat Stevens music, {{he said he would}} use his accumulated wealth and ongoing earnings from his music career on philanthropic and educational causes in the Muslim community of London and elsewhere. In 1983, he founded the Islamia Primary School in Brondesbury Park, later moved to Salusbury Road, in the north London area of Queen's Park and, soon after, founded several Muslim secondary schools; in 1992, he set up The Association of Muslim Schools (AMS-UK), a charity that brought together all the Muslim schools in the UK. He is also the founder and chairman of the Small Kindness charity, which initially assisted famine victims in Africa and now supports thousands of orphans <b>and</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> the Balkans, Indonesia, and Iraq.

25|$|Carrfour Supportive Housing, {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} established in 1993 by the Homeless Committee of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce – develops, operates and manages innovative housing communities for individuals <b>and</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> need through a unique approach combining affordable housing with comprehensive, on-site supportive services. As the leading not-for-profit provider of supportive housing in Florida, Carrfour has supplied homes for more than 10,000 formerly homeless men, women and children since its founding. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2007, a non-profit organization named Back on My Feet was created by runner Anne Mahlum as a running club for homeless {{men and women in}} the area, to help overcome homelessness through a multi-step self-help program centered on running three days a week, plus sponsored running events. Participants, drawn from local homeless shelters partnered with the organization, are assigned to different teams within each chapter and monitored by a nonresident member, and are required to commit to punctuality, endurance, self-optimism, team spirit, and sobriety. The members earn incentives through continued participation and progress, culminating in educational scholarships and assistance in finding permanent housing and employment. Back on My Feet counted a total of 400 homeless runners in nine cities after five years, and by the beginning of 2013 counted 10 different city chapters in the United States, with four more chapters planned by the end of the year.|$|E
