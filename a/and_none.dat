5|$|According to Shia scholar Mohammad Jafar Tabasi, {{the graves}} of Shia Imams buried in al-Baqi had been revered and since {{hundreds}} of years ago <b>and</b> <b>none</b> of the Sunni scholars ulamas regarded the shrines as innovation.

5|$|Despite this, the Army Air Corps {{found the}} {{performance}} of the XB-21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre-production aircraft, to be designated YB-21.
