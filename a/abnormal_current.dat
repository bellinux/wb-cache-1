The first mutation discovered in GABRG2 was K289M, in the extracellular region linking membrane-spanning domains M2 and M3. Oocytes injected with α1, β2, and γ2 subunits produce large GABA inducible currents whereas those injected with K289M mutant instead of wild-type subunits produce currents much smaller (about 10% of wild-type).

METHOD: The IIM test measures bipolar impedances between all electrode pairs and employs a normalization procedure based on common ground impedances {{in order to identify}} <b>abnormal</b> <b>current</b> paths among electrodes. Six European clinics collected IIM data from a total of 192 devices. RESULTS: Reproducibility was high between initial and repeat measurements. The normative analysis demonstrated narrow ranges among devices after normalization of impedance data. The IIM is able to identify <b>abnormal</b> <b>current</b> paths that are not evident from standard impedance telemetry and may otherwise only be found utilising average electrode voltage measurements (AEV). CONCLUSIONS: The IIM test was found to be straightforward to perform clinically and demonstrated reproducible data with narrow ranges in normally-functioning devices. Because this test uses a very low stimulation level the IIM test is well suited for children or multiply handicapped CI users who cannot reliably report on their auditory percepts.

We use three measures that proxy for actual audit quality: abnormal accruals, restatements, and the propensity to issue a going concern opinion.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{as a whole}} {{provides a}} comprehensive exploration of opportunistic earnings management in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) from an international perspective during an intriguing time frame; and of earnings management in recent formal reorganization procedures in Belgium. The subject has linkages to a diverse set of research areas such as corporate finance, accountancy, corporate governance and law and finance. Yet, its common thread {{is the notion that}} managers have incentives to temporarily distort reality when confronted with events where a lot is at stake, more specifically in M&As and reorganization procedures. Indeed, firms pursuing M&As may face strong incentives to artificially inflate their reported earnings prior to a planned transaction, particularly when stock is part of the M&A payment consideration. The idea is that this earnings management will positively affect investors’ valuation, which will then boost the acquirer stock price, thereby amplifying its purchasing power as a takeover currency. Likewise, firms that face financial distress have incentives to present a rosier picture of reality prior to entering a reorganization procedure in order to convince the court and important creditors of their viability. To achieve those objectives, firms can rely on accruals-based earnings management techniques as well as on real activities manipulation. In the former case, management exploits the leeway accepted accounting procedures entail, with no direct effect on corporate cash flows. In contrast, real actions to influence earnings are realized by managers’ opportunistic timing and structuring of operating, investment and financing decisions; this will affect not only earnings, but also cash flows. In the first chapter of this dissertation, we empirically explore current, i. e., working capital accruals management in the European takeover market during a time in which there was an enormous boom in M&A activity, namely the period 1997 - 2011. In contrast to prior studies, who mainly focus on the U. S. market for corporate control and rely on earlier transactions, we do not find strong evidence for upwards accruals management in stock-paid takeovers ahead of the deal. Yet, for the subsample of civil-law acquirers, we show that the average acquirer in stock-for-stock deals overstates its earnings, particularly in the fiscal year of the M&A. For common-law acquirers, we further demonstrate that there indeed exists an inverse U-shaped relation between the voting rights position of the acquirer’s major shareholder and ACA. In line with the entrenchment theory of corporate ownership, this outcome thus indicates that large shareholders encourage the use of earnings management practices to curb the dilution in their voting power. Chapter 1 concludes with an analysis of shareholder wealth gains upon takeover announcement and its relation with ACA. For common-law acquirers we show that <b>abnormal</b> <b>current</b> accruals do not negatively impact acquirer shareholder value, unless the takeover is fully paid in acquirer stock. This might emphasize the signaling effect that the takeover currency entails, as it appears that stock market investors had neither fully anticipated nor understood earnings-enhancing incentives and practices ahead of the takeover. Chapter 2 investigates a comprehensive sample of U. S. M&As after the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002. Besides accruals management, this chapter also explores the use of opportunistic real activities management by acquirers ahead of a takeover. In contrast to prior studies on the U. S. takeover market, our univariate tests reveal that the average acquirer in our sample did not engage in earnings-enhancing strategies, irrespective of the deal’s payment method. Next, as in Chapter 1, we explore the determinants of the cross-sectional variation in the earnings management proxies in the pre-takeover year. A third perspective that Chapter 2 offers is that of the relation between pre-M&A earnings management and the method of payment. Finally, Chapter 2 concludes with an analysis of the acquirer shareholder wealth gains upon takeover announcement and its association with pre-event earnings management. Our results indicate that stock market investors are not overly concerned about earnings-enhancing strategies in the USA. Chapter 3 of this dissertation focuses on the use of earnings management techniques by distressed firms that entered a court-guided reorganization procedure. The Belgian court-guided reorganization procedure underwent a major reform in 2009 with the enactment of the Act on the Continuity of Enterprises (ACE). The reform aims at facilitating the preservation of ailing enterprises. Given the focus on continuation in the renewed reorganization procedure, firms who face severe financial distress might have especially strong incentives to provide a rosier picture of reality in order to convince the court and important creditors of their viability. Overall, we find no indication of upwards accruals management in the three fiscal years preceding the reorganization process. In fact, <b>abnormal</b> <b>current</b> accruals gradually decline and become especially negative and significant in the year ahead of the reorganization. This may underscore the idea that reorganizing firms have already exhausted the opportunities to inflate their earnings through accruals management, which is generally considered to be less costly and more difficult to disentangle for financial statement users than real activities management. Cash flow generation through price discounts (which can also boost earnings) might thus be more concerning to managers.

With the merits of high density, slow loss of charge when spare and no memory effect, lithium-ion battery is widely used in portable electronics and hybrid vehicles. Apart from its advantages, safety {{is a major concern}} for Lithium-ion batteries due to devastating incidents with laptop and cell phone batteries. Overcharge and over-discharge are two of the most common electrical abuses a lithium-ion battery suffers. In this thesis, a fuzzy-rule-based system is proposed to detect the over-charge and over-discharge failure in early time. The preliminary results for the failure signatures of overcharged and over-discharged lithium-ion are listed based on the experimental results under both room temperature and high temperature. A fuzzy-rule-based model utilizing these failure signatures is developed and validated. For over-charge case, the abnormal increase of the surface temperature and decrease of the voltage are captured. While for over discharge case, unusual temperature increase during overcharge phases and <b>abnormal</b> <b>current</b> decrease during overcharge phases are obtained. The inference engine for fuzzy-rule-based system is designed based on these failure signatures. An early warning signal will be given by this algorithm before the failure occurs.

In the validation test, the proposed methods are successfully implemented in a real-time system for failure detection and early warning.

The diagnostic accuracy of MCG parameters, at rest and after exercise, are summarized in table 1. Exercise-MCG evidenced VR alterations in 11 IHD pts, with aspecific exercise-ECG. Conclusions. Unshielded MCG mapping is feasible in ambulatory pts, simultaneously with ECG, with standard ergometers protocols. As compared with ECG, MCG increases predictive accuracy for IHD, both at rest and after exercise test. Automatic analysis of ST MFG orientation, T-wave dynamics and EMD parameters evidenced VR abnormalities, not apreciable at ECG in some pts...|$|E
40|$|The Brugada {{syndrome}} (BS) is {{a genetically}} transmitted arrhythmogenic disease, which requires risk stratification, especially in asymptomatic subjects. Recent {{studies have shown}} that magnetocardiographic mapping (MCG) at rest can detect <b>abnormal</b> <b>current</b> distribution located in the RVOT. Here we describe an asymptomatic 28  years old BS patient, studied with 12 -lead ECG and 36 -channel MCG for three times at rest, under effort and during flecainide (Flec) tests, along a four years follow-up. He had a type 2 BS ECG at rest, but normal physical examination, echocardiogram and MRI. Molecular screening of the SCNC 5 A open reading frame revealed a de novo missense mutation in the DII-DIII linker, confirming the diagnosis of BS. For MCG assessment of ventricular repolarization (VR), magnetic field (MF) dynamics and MF gradient orientation, were computed during the ST interval and at the T wave peak. Current density reconstruction (CDR) and the strength of the equivalent current dipole (ECD) were calculated during the JT interval, to evidence potentially arrhythmogenic current flowing. In spite of Flec-induced ECG abnormality (typical type- 1 ST elevation in V 1 -V 3), MCG didn't show clear-cut variation of VR parameters, which didn't differ from those of healthy controls, at rest and under effort. After Flec, CDR, calculated every 10 ms from the J point, evidenced a change {{in the direction of the}} strongest current toward the right ventricular outflow tract, without a significant increase of the JT ECD strength. During the follow-up the patient was asymptomatic and no arrhythmia occurred. Further work is deserved to establish the predictive value of MCG for non-invasive risk stratification in asymptomatic BS patients with abnormal Flec test. © 2007...|$|E
40|$|Consistent with {{previous}} research, the authors fail {{to find a}} significant correlation between the abnormal returns of their sample firms with international activities {{and changes in the}} dollar. They investigate the possibility that this failure is due to mispricing. Lagged changes in the dollar are a significant variable in explaining <b>current</b> <b>abnormal</b> returns of the authors' sample firms, suggesting that misprizing does occur. A simple trading strategy based upon these results generates significant abnormal returns. Corroborating evidence from returns around earnings announcements as well as errors in analysts' forecasts of earnings is also provided. Copyright 1994 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|Bufferbloat is an <b>abnormal</b> {{phenomenon}} in <b>current</b> Internet experience where large buffers cause high end-to-end latency and jitter, {{as well as}} throughput degradation. The universally applied thumb rule is used to allocate buffers at the nodes, {{based on the assumption}} that large size buffers reduce packet loss. Window scaling mechanism of TCP tends to fill up these buffers causing latency in the network. CoDel has been designed to overcome bufferbloat. The drawback in CoDel is that, the uniform target values does not support real-time video streaming. Adaptive CoDel proposed in this paper tends to mitigate bufferbloat and improve the QoS parameters of real-time video stream. General Terms...|$|R
