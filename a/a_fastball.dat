5|$|Ramón A. Ramírez (born September 16, 1982) is a Venezuelan {{pitcher who}} is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds. He throws three pitches: <b>a</b> <b>fastball,</b> a slider, and a changeup.|$|E
5|$|Lieber threw three pitches: <b>a</b> <b>fastball,</b> a slider, and a changeup. The slider was {{the pitch}} Lieber {{often used to}} get outs and was most {{successful}} against right-handed batters. The changeup darted away from batters. Lieber was not a hard thrower (his fastball was in the low 90mph range); he relied on controlling his pitches to have success.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: <b>a</b> <b>fastball,</b> a slider, and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for him, though, and his fastball is easy to hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
5000|$|Nolasco throws five pitches: <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> sinker, <b>a</b> split-finger <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> slider, and a knuckle curve [...]|$|R
50|$|Koehler throws <b>a</b> four seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> two seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> slider, changeup, and a curveball.|$|R
50|$|Saito throws <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball</b> {{in the low}} 90s, <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> slider, and a curveball.|$|R
5|$|After graduating high school, Diekman {{enrolled}} at Doane College, where he pitched for one season. He {{then transferred to}} Cloud County Community College in Kansas. Following his sophomore season, he attended a junior college baseball showcase at which, with <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> well over , he drew much interest. He received an offer for a full scholarship to be a Nebraska Cornhusker, which he would have accepted had the Phillies not drafted him in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft's 30th round.|$|E
5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: <b>a</b> <b>fastball,</b> a curveball, and a changeup. His fastball {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can break down sharply, and he learned the changeup from Pedro Martínez. Wildness had {{been a problem for}} Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling his fastball and walks a great deal of hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|E
5|$|Clippard {{primarily}} throws <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> and a changeup. His hard, straight four-seam fastball averages about , topping out at , {{and sets}} up a deceptive changeup in the high 70s to low 80s. Periodically, he throws a cutter early in the count to right-handed hitters and a curveball in the mid 70s. Nardi Contreras, who worked with Clippard as the Yankees' minor league pitching coordinator, indicated that Clippard's greatest success comes from his curveball and changeup.|$|E
5000|$|Martínez {{throws a}} 96 mph four-seam <b>fastball</b> along with <b>a</b> split-finger <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball,</b> and <b>a</b> slider. https://web.archive.org/web/20060321045659/http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060319&content_id=1355575&vkey=spt2006news&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla ...|$|R
50|$|Wendell was {{a relief}} pitcher who threw <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> slider, and a change-up. Wendell was {{commonly}} seen as having above-average control, average movement, below-average power, and a good pick-off move.|$|R
50|$|Ariel Peña Mora (born May 20, 1989) is a Dominican {{professional}} baseball pitcher for the Rieleros de Aguascalientes of the Mexican Baseball League. He throws <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> slider and a changeup.|$|R
5|$|De Fratus has a two-pitch {{repertoire}} {{that consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> and a slider, the latter of which is his out pitch. He embraces a propensity to work quickly on the mound, and use a lower arm slot. Off the field, De Fratus {{is a member of}} the Roman Catholic church, and uses baseball to strengthen his faith. He sees evangelism as a duty of Christians, and would like to go to seminary when he finishes his baseball career.|$|E
5|$|Umbricht threw four pitches, <b>a</b> <b>fastball,</b> curveball, slider and the changeup. He {{was used}} {{primarily}} as a setup pitcher during his brief tenure with the Colts. According to former teammate and roommate Ken Johnson, Umbricht {{was used by the}} Colts mainly to control damage caused by starting pitchers after they were removed from games. In his five-year Major League Baseball career, Umbricht compiled a 9–5 win–loss record, with 133 strikeouts, three saves and a 3.06 earned run average in 88 games.|$|E
5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: <b>a</b> <b>fastball,</b> a slider, a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; {{he threw}} it over 60% {{of the time}} in the majors. He did not throw it very hard, {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% of the time. Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, displaying a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E
50|$|He throws <b>a</b> mid-90s four-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> curveball, and a changeup. He {{has also}} begun to develop <b>a</b> cut <b>fastball.</b>|$|R
5|$|Feldman is a three-quarters pitcher with a sinker, <b>a</b> low-to-mid-90s <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> hard {{dropping}} slider, a curve, a changeup, and <b>a</b> 90mph cut <b>fastball.</b>|$|R
50|$|Séptimo throws four pitches — <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball</b> {{in the low}} 90s, <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> slider {{averaging}} {{at about}} 80 mph, and an occasional changeup. The slider is his main 2-strike pitch.|$|R
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez throws <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> that travels about ninety-one mph for {{his main}} pitch, though it {{sometimes}} {{can go up}} to ninety-five mph. His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for Sánchez; he has walked 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes out a lot of batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all qualifying MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, {{a system in}} which {{decisions}} were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E
500|$|Latos throws five pitches. He throws <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball</b> (...) , <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball</b> (...) , <b>a</b> slider (...) , a curveball (...) , and a changeup (...) [...] He mostly {{relies on}} his four-seamer and slider against {{right-handed}} hitters while adding considerable variety against lefties. The 42% whiff rate on his slider {{is one of}} the best among major league starters.|$|R
5|$|Barry William Zito (born May 13, 1978) is an American former {{professional}} baseball pitcher and musician. He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants. His pitching repertoire {{consisted of a}} curveball (his strikeout pitch), <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> circle changeup, and a cutterslider.|$|R
50|$|Moscoso throws {{three main}} pitches: <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball</b> (90-92), <b>a</b> curveball (77-79), and a changeup to left-handed hitters (80-81). He has experimented with <b>a</b> cut <b>fastball</b> and slider to right-handers, {{but he does}} not use them frequently.After he went to Japan, he learned <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball.</b>|$|R
25|$|Fujinami {{has a large}} {{frame for}} a pitcher, listed at 6ft 6 in and 196lb. With a three-quarters delivery, he throws <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> at 92-95mph (tops out at 99mph), a splitter, and a solid mid-80's slider. He mostly uses his fastball-slider {{combination}} in games.|$|E
25|$|As an object's {{speed or}} {{momentum}} increases, arcs tend to flatten out in moving ahead and broaden in turns. In baseball, <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> {{would tend to}} move in a straighter line than other pitches; while a figure skater moving at top speed {{would be unable to}} turn as sharply as a slower skater, and would need to cover more ground to complete the turn.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield {{was born}} in Tampa, Florida, {{and grew up in}} Belmont Heights, near the Ponce de Leon projects. He and his family lived with his uncle, Dwight Gooden, who would go on to become the ace pitcher for the New York Mets. They played {{baseball}} frequently and Sheffield learned how to hit <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> from Gooden, who is only four years older than he is. Sheffield has publicly said that his grandfather had a significant positive impact on his life, influencing him as a person and as an athlete.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> two-seam <b>fastball,</b> {{sometimes}} called <b>a</b> two-seamer, tailing <b>fastball,</b> running fastball, or sinker is another {{variant of the}} straight fastball. It is designed to have more movement than <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball,</b> so the batter cannot hit it hard, {{but it can be}} more difficult to master and control. Because of the deviation from the straight trajectory, the two-seam fastball is {{sometimes called}} <b>a</b> moving <b>fastball.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> four-seam <b>fastball,</b> {{also called}} <b>a</b> rising <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> four-seamer, or <b>a</b> cross-seam <b>fastball,</b> is <b>a</b> pitch in baseball. It {{is a member}} of the fastball family of pitches and is usually the hardest (i.e., fastest) ball thrown by a pitcher. A few {{pitchers}} at the major league level can sometimes reach a pitch speed of up to 100 mph.Compare with the two-seam fastball.|$|R
2500|$|Jason Michael Hirsh (born February 20, 1982) is {{a former}} {{starting}} pitcher in Major League Baseball. In his career, he pitched for the Houston Astros and the Colorado Rockies. He stands at 6' 8" [...] and weighs [...] He batted and threw right-handed. He threw <b>a</b> two-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> four-seam <b>fastball,</b> <b>a</b> slider, and a changeup.|$|R
25|$|I have {{a sinking}} fastball {{to either side}} of the plate, a cutter (which changes the {{direction}} of my fastball so it breaks instead of sinking), {{to either side of}} the plate, a curveball I throw at three speeds and three angles, a straight change—using the same arm speed and position as <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> but with a grip and a release that slows it dramatically, and changeups to different locations that I throw off my sinker which look like batting practice fastballs. Different locations, different speeds, and slightly different arm angles on all those pitches give me a wide palette of choices.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2008, Crystal {{signed a}} one-day minor league {{contract}} {{to play with}} the New York Yankees, and was invited to the team's major league spring training. He wore uniform number 60 in honor of his upcoming 60th birthday. On March 13, in a spring training game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Crystal led off as the designated hitter. He managed to make contact, fouling <b>a</b> <b>fastball</b> up the first base line, but was eventually struck out by Pirates pitcher Paul Maholm on six pitches and was later replaced in the batting order by Johnny Damon. He was released on March 14, his 60th birthday.|$|E
25|$|Anderson throws four pitches for strikes: <b>a</b> <b>fastball,</b> a curve, a changeup and a slider. His fastball {{sits in the}} 89-92mph {{range and}} he offers a two-seam variety in {{addition}} to the traditional four-seam version. His best pitch is the slider, a two-plane breaking ball he can paint on the corner versus right-handed batters and sweep away from lefties in the 79-81mph range. His low-to-mid 70s curveball is a weapon in any count and his 82-84mph changeup has shown the most improvement as Anderson has fought his way through injuries. Over the course of his career, Anderson's arm slot has lowered slightly, dropping from high three-quarters to true three-quarters. He's athletic and repeats his mechanics, aiding in his ability to command his entire arsenal.|$|E
