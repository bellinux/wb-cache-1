It is shown that none of the proposed molecular models to date, including the well-known fold surface premelting model, can satisfactorily account for all the experimental data. However, a new molecular interpretation, based primarily on electron microscopy and SAXS studies of changes such as lateral `melting' from edges of microparacrystallites (mPC) within the lamellae seen at the annealing temperatures can account for the data. With our new molecular interpretation, the effect of temperature increase is established to result in a slight breakup of the laterally aligned mPC within the lamellae at low <b>annealing</b> temperatures in <b>range</b> I, and selective lateral `melting' of the exposed mPC and recrystallization at higher <b>annealing</b> temperatures in <b>ranges</b> II and III, with the recrystallization being very limited in <b>range</b> III. <b>Annealing</b> effects seen in cold- or hot-drawn polymers with a fibrillar morphology can also be readily accounted for by this very general molecular mechanism occurring in the same <b>annealing</b> temperature <b>ranges...</b>|$|R

40|$|A 10 nm thick epitaxially grown AIN cap {{has been}} used to protect the surface of a GaN {{epilayer}} both during Eu ion implantation and the subsequent high-temperature annealing. The 15 K photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the intra- 4 f Eu transition increases by two orders of magnitude when the annealing temperature is increased from 1000 to 1300 degrees C. High-resolution PL spectra reveal that the emission lines due to the D- 5 (0) -F- 7 (2) transition exhibit different dependencies on the annealing temperature in the studied <b>annealing</b> <b>range.</b> PL excitation measurements demonstrate band edge absorption by the GaN host at 356 nm, together with a broad excitation band centred at similar to 385 nm. The PL spectra of the D- 5 (0) -F- 7 (2) transition selectively excited by above band-gap absorption and by this broad excitation band are noticeably different. The first peak at 620. 8 nm is suppressed when exciting below the GaN band gap. This demonstrates differing energy transfer processes for the different Eu luminescent peaks and is direct evidence for at least two kinds of different Eu sites in the host with distinct optical activation. Temperature dependent PL and PLE demonstrate that one of the two Eu-centres does not contribute to the room temperature luminescence. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|GaN epilayers {{grown by}} MOCVD were {{implanted}} with Tm and Eu under different implantation conditions, {{in order to}} optimize the implantation parameters of fluence, implantation temperature and energy. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in the channelling mode (RBS/C), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) and room temperature cathodoluminescence (CL) were used to study structural and optical properties of the samples. Different annealing methods are compared. According to RBS/C measurements, Tm at low fluences is found to incorporate entirely on substitutional Ga-sites while for higher fluences the substitutional fraction decreases. Increasing the fluence leads to increasing damage levels and finally {{to the formation of}} a partially amorphous, nanocrystalline surface layer. The luminescence intensity increases with fluence at first. However, for fluences in excess of 2 × 1015 Tm/cm 2 it decreases again, showing a strong correlation between structural and optical properties. Implanting at higher temperature inhibits the formation of the nanocrystalline layer and increases both the substitutional fraction and the luminescence intensity. We also found that the presence of a thin AlN cap protects the sample during post-implant high temperature annealing and prevents the formation of a nanocrystalline surface layer during the implantation even for high fluences.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{fabricating}} improved transformer cores from composites of thermoplastic matrices and iron-particles has been invented. Relative to commercially available laminated-iron-alloy transformer cores, the cores fabricated by this method weigh less {{and are less}} expensive. Relative to prior polymer-matrix/ iron-particle composite-material transformer cores, the cores fabricated by this method can be made mechanically stronger and more magnetically permeable. In addition, whereas some prior cores have exhibited significant eddy-current losses, the cores fabricated by this method exhibit very small eddy-current losses. The cores made by this method {{can be expected to}} be attractive for use in diverse applications, including high-signal-to-noise transformers, stepping motors, and high-frequency ignition coils. The present method is a product of an experimental study of the relationships among fabrication conditions, final densities of iron particles, and mechanical and electromagnetic properties of fabricated cores. Among the fabrication conditions investigated were molding pressures (83, 104, and 131 MPa), and molding temperatures (250, 300, and 350 C). Each block of core material was made by uniaxial-compression molding, at the applicable pressure/temperature combination, of a mixture of 2 weight percent of LaRC (or equivalent high-temperature soluble thermoplastic adhesive) with 98 weight percent of approximately spherical iron particles having diameters in the micron range. Each molded block was cut into square cross-section rods that were used as core specimens in mechanical and electromagnetic tests. Some of the core specimens were annealed at 900 C and cooled slowly before testing. For comparison, a low-carbon-steel core was also tested. The results of the tests showed that density, hardness, and rupture strength generally increased with molding pressure and temperature, though the correlation was rather weak. The weakness of the correlation was attributed to the pores in the specimens. The maximum relative permeabilities of cores made without <b>annealing</b> <b>ranged</b> from 30 to 110, while those of cores made with <b>annealing</b> <b>ranged</b> from 900 to 1, 400.
