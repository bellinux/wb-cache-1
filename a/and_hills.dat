5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions {{of the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.

5|$|In 1965 LeMessurier <b>and</b> <b>Hills</b> {{published}} A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggests that decompression by conventional models forms bubbles that are then eliminated by re-dissolving at the decompression stops—which is slower than elimination while still in solution.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands.

The species {{is more likely to be}} found inland than in the coastal regions.|$|E

5|$|Cotters Pond {{is a small}} {{landmark}} located {{beyond a}} few mountains <b>and</b> <b>hills</b> on the southern side of NY74 {{near the end of}} Paradox Lake. Cotters Pond, by state law, is a water body that cannot be used for baitfishing. This was designated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Shortly afterward, NY74 passes Bumbo Pond and enters the hamlet of Paradox. After leaving Paradox, NY74 turns to the southeast along the base of Skiff Mountain. The highway then approaches a creek that flows into Eagle Lake. NY74 crosses over Eagle Lake and runs along the base of Eagle Cliff and the shores of the lake. After leaving Eagle Lake, the highway intersects with County Route2 (CR2), the first numbered highway that NY74 encounters after US9.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro is a {{widespread}} hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and {{is thought to be}} composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges <b>and</b> <b>hills,</b> between which exist undulating valleys. Much of the ejecta blanket from the Imbrium impact is covered with debris from younger impacts and material churned up by possible moonquakes. Debris found in the formation may have originated from deep beneath the original crust, and samples collected there could give insight into the geologic history of the Moon. The petrology of the formation, based on data obtained on Apollo 14, indicates a history of impact and ejection possibly spanning over approximately 500 million years.|$|E
5|$|Patch {{initiated}} a new offensive {{just as the}} 38th Division began {{to withdraw from the}} inland ridges <b>and</b> <b>hills</b> that it had occupied. On 20 January, the 25th Infantry Division, under Major General J. Lawton Collins, attacked several hills, designated Hills 87, 88, and 89 by the Americans, that formed a ridge that dominated Kokumbona. Encountering much lighter resistance than anticipated, the Americans seized the three hills by the morning of 22 January. Shifting forces to exploit the unexpected breakthrough, Collins quickly continued the advance and captured the next two hills, 90 and 91, by nightfall, placing the Americans in position to isolate and capture Kokumbona and trap the Japanese 2nd Division.|$|E
