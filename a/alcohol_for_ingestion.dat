30|$|Given the {{side-effects}} of ingesting 40 % alcohol as multiple ‘shots’ immediately, {{the authors}} {{feel that a}} clinical study design should provide a reasonable time-frame <b>for</b> <b>ingestion</b> of <b>alcohol.</b> <b>For</b> instance, in their study with hydromorphone, subjects were advised to consume the orange juice-alcohol solutions slowly, but within 30  min, to avoid vomiting (Sathyan et al. 2008).

40|$|Abstract Background Patients ingesting {{ethylene}} glycol, isopropanol, methanol, and {{propylene glycol}} ('toxic alcohols') often present with non-specific signs and symptoms. Definitive diagnosis of toxic alcohols {{has traditionally been}} by gas chromatography (GC), a technique not commonly performed on-site in hospital clinical laboratories. The objectives of this retrospective study were: 1) to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the osmolal gap in screening <b>for</b> toxic <b>alcohol</b> <b>ingestion</b> and 2) to determine the common reasons other than toxic <b>alcohol</b> <b>ingestion</b> <b>for</b> elevated osmolal gaps. Methods Electronic medical records from an academic tertiary care medical center were searched to identify all patients in the time period from January 1, 1996 to September 1, 2010 who had serum/plasma ethanol, glucose, sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and osmolality measured simultaneously, and also all patients who had GC analysis <b>for</b> toxic <b>alcohols.</b> Detailed chart review was performed on all patients with osmolal gap of 9 or greater. Results In the study period, 20, 669 patients had determination of serum/plasma ethanol and osmolal gap upon presentation to the hospitals. There were 341 patients with an osmolal gap greater than 14 (including correction for estimated contribution of ethanol) on initial presentation to the medical center. Seventy-seven patients tested positive by GC for one or more toxic alcohols; all had elevated anion gap or osmolal gap or both. Other than toxic alcohols, the most common causes for an elevated osmolal gap were recent heavy ethanol consumption with suspected alcoholic ketoacidosis, renal failure, shock, and recent administration of mannitol. Only 9 patients with osmolal gap greater than 50 and no patients with osmolal gap greater than 100 {{were found to be}} negative <b>for</b> toxic <b>alcohols.</b> Conclusions Our study concurs with other investigations that show that osmolal gap can be a useful diagnostic test in conjunction with clinical history and physical examination. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of moderate alcohol intake on intermediate metabolites, five normal subjects and five euglycemic insulin-dependent diabetics (IDDM) were administered two different isocaloric diets; in one diet 35 % of the caloric intake consisted of red wine. The insulin-dependent diabetics were connected to an artificial endocrine pancreas (AEP), and glucose levels were continuously monitored. Blood lactate, pyruvate, acetoacetate (AcAc), 3 -hydroxybutyrate (3 -OHB), glycerol, free fatty acids (FFA), and alanine levels were measured over a 15 -hour period from 9 AM to 12 PM. The results showed that alcohol intake did not significantly influence the glucose profiles in either group (111 +/- 4 mg/ 100 ml versus 110 +/- 4 mg/ 100 ml for IDDM; 72 +/- 2 mg/ 100 ml versus 82 +/- 3 mg/ 100 ml for controls, 15 -hour mean +/- SEM), but in both groups it induced a marked increased in the levels of lactate (1. 115 +/- 0. 067 mM/liter with alcohol versus 0. 706 +/- 0. 031 mM/liter without <b>alcohol</b> <b>for</b> IDDM; 0. 847 +/- 0. 052 mM/liter with alcohol versus 0. 666 +/- 0. 035 mM/liter without <b>alcohol</b> <b>for</b> controls), in the lactate/pyruvate ratio (24. 04 +/- 2. 12 with alcohol versus 11. 42 +/- 0. 20 without <b>alcohol</b> <b>for</b> IDDM; 20. 84 +/- 2. 16 with alcohol versus 11. 62 +/- 0. 27 without <b>alcohol</b> <b>for</b> controls), in the levels of 3 -OHB (0. 081 +/- 0. 007 mM/liter with alcohol versus 0. 046 +/- 0. 003 mM/liter without <b>alcohol</b> <b>for</b> IDDM; 0. 067 +/- 0. 007 mM/liter with alcohol versus 0. 025 +/- 0. 002 mM/liter without <b>alcohol</b> <b>for</b> controls) and in the 3 -OHB/AcAc ratio (1. 452 +/- 0. 153 with alcohol versus 0. 599 +/- 0. 036 without <b>alcohol</b> <b>for</b> IDDM; 1. 723 +/- 0. 198 with alcohol versus 0. 439 +/- 0. 040 without <b>alcohol</b> <b>for</b> controls) because of a more reduced redox state. Alcohol intake during meals depressed alanine concentration, while glycerol levels showed a transient increase. Reduced blood FFA concentrations after alcohol intake were observed only in controls. This study demonstrates that moderate alcohol intake with meals also affects intermediate metabolites despite euglycemia. These effects were similar both in normal subjects and in IDDM, even if {{the harmful effects of}} alcohol may be enhanced by poor metabolic control in the latter...|$|R
