5000|$|At {{the end of}} the movie, Allyson helps {{build the}} fourth wall again, as she does {{repeatedly}} as part of the narration, to say that Max must have had Paul remove the ring after the show because the tapes of the show soon disappeared. She continues to say they then reappeared in her room. She says Danny has gone into hiding to learn more about his powers and prepare for a future showdown with Max, and says even she does not know where he is. Then a popcorn bowl levitates from behind her and comes to her arms. She laughs and says that she does.

60|$|He shuddered, {{but with}} averted face hid his grimaces and {{swallowed}} his gorge {{as he put}} his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> dirt-crusted <b>shoulders</b> and felt the contact of her rancidoily and kinky hair with his neck and chin.

Not that his vanity was at all wounded by these irresponsible epithets, which only excited an amused wonder, but he was conscious of an embarrassed pleasure in the child's caressing familiarity, and her perfect trustfulness in him touched his extravagant chivalry. He ought to protect her, and yet correct her. In the consciousness of these duties he laid his white hand upon her head. Alas! she lifted her arm and instantly transferred his hand and part of his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck and <b>shoulders,</b> and comfortably snuggled against him. The colonel gasped.

5000|$|Dr. Martinez convinces {{the flock}} (mainly Max) {{that they should}} visit the Gen-77 kids. They all take a plane to see the kids, but Max decides to fly herself. On the way the plane runs into a trap. Transparent {{floating}} balloons connected {{to the ground with}} razor wire, hit the plane and rip its wings off. As the plane spirals out of control the flock takes action. Max's mom, Jeb, and Dr. Hans can't fly so they try to carry them. Iggy and Nudge get caught in the wire and begin to free fall, Max catches her mother, but Jeb is falling. Gazzy tries to catch him, but is too weak to support the weight, Jeb tells Gazzy [...] "the human race will have to die, to save the planet...just as I will have to die to save you." [...] Jeb lets go. Before he plummets to his death Dylan catches him. Angel, and Gazzy then help stabilize Iggy and Nudge. Everyone lands relatively safe. In the confusion Dr. Hans disappears. Dylan and Max go to look for his body, but do not find him. They stop by a school on the way and snipers shoot at them. Max thinks that they are [...] "whitecoats" [...] but Dylan saw (with his super vision) that they were kids without eyes. They then camp out in a part of a cave where Dylan tells Max about the constellations. Max begins to get more comfortable with Dylan and eventually falls asleep beside him, with his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> She notices how well her body fits in with his and calls it a [...] "perfect fit" [...] Angel finds Max and Dylan and they go back to the Gen 77 headquarters where the three of them encounter the [...] "kids without eyes" [...] again. After a brief fight, Max, Dylan, and Angel get {{a closer look at the}} children. In reality, they have eyes all around the middle of their head, giving them 360 degree vision, hence the aim. The Gen-77 kids then tell Max and the others that they are more advanced and that they need to [...] "kill the humans" [...] to make the world better. They then proceed to attack the group again. Max, Dylan, and Angel are able to get away but while they are flying, they notice a familiar face. They land and find Mike, the computer guy, under the hypnotic spell of the Doomsday group. When they get home, Ella and Iggy are under the spell also. Dylan, Max, Angel, Iggy, and Ella go to a rally at Ella's school, where Iggy begins a chant of [...] "kill the humans!" [...] The gang takes Iggy back home, leaving Ella behind. They are able to revert him to normal with a cold shower and some mind control by Angel. They find out from Nudge, Gazzy, and Total that Jeb and Dr. Martinez have disappeared without a trace. They all reluctantly come to the conclusion that they are involved with the Doomsday Group. They make a pact with each other to never again trust a grown-up. The group finds Ella at a campfire, singing a song about saving the earth. They are able to capture her and change her back to normal, but they quickly lose her again. She leaves a note saying that she was meant to have wings.|$|R
