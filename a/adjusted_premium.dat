40|$|In {{this paper}} we focused our {{attention}} to the study of an excess of loss reinsurance with reinstatements, a problem previously studied by Sundt [5] and, more recently, by Mata [4] and HÄurlimann [3]. As it is well-known, the evaluation of pure premiums requires the knowledge of the claim size distribution of the insurance risk: in order to face this question, different approaches have been followed in the actuarial literature. In a situation of incomplete information in which only some characteristics of the involved elements are known, it appears to be particularly interesting to set this problem in the framework of risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>premiums.</b> It is shown that if risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>premiums</b> satisfy a generalized expected value equation, then the initial premium exhibits some regularity properties {{as a function of the}} percentages of reinstatement.

The increase in equity risk is surprisingly small after a recapitalization, ranging from 28 % to 52 % depending on the estimation method. Under the assumption that total company risk is unchanged, the implied systematic risk of the post-recapitalization debt in twelve transactions averages 0. 67.

We prove that the stop loss reinsurance premium when calculated using the PH premium principle gives a higher premium than any of the other transforms, provided that the priority is big enough. We observe a similar behaviour with respect o excess of loss reinsurance in all the examples given. We also study the behaviour of the adjustment coefficient, both from the insurer's and the reinsurer's point of view as functions of the priority, when the PH principle is used as opposed to the expected value principle...|$|E
40|$|The paper summarises the {{conclusions}} for health policy {{from the experience}} of three countries who have introduced risk equalisation subsidies, in their voluntary health insurance (VHI) markets. The countries chosen are Australia, Ireland and South Africa. All of these countries have developed VHI markets and have progressed towards introducing risk equalisation. The objective of such subsidies is primarily to make VHI affordable while encouraging efficiency in health care production. The paper presents a conceptual framework to understand and compare risk equalisation subsidies in VHI markets. The paper outlines how such subsidies are organised in each of the countries and identifies problems that arise in their implementation. We conclude that the objectives of risk equalisation, in VHI markets are no different to those in countries with mandatory insurance systems. We find that the introduction of risk equalisation subsidies is complex and that countries seeking to introduce risk equalisation in VHI markets must carefully consider how such subsidies advance their overall health policy goals. Furthermore, we conclude that such subsidies must be structured correctly as otherwise incentives exist for risk selection which may threaten affordability and efficiency. Our overall conclusion is that also in voluntary health insurance markets risk equalisation has a role in meeting the related public policy objectives of risk solidarity and affordability, and without it these objectives are severely undermined.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the Japanese deposit insurance scheme by contrasting the flat insurance rate with a market-determined risk-adjusted rate. The model used to calculate the risk-adjusted rate is that of Ronn and Verrna (1986). It utilizes the notion of Merton(1977) that the deposit insurance can be based on a one-to-one relation between it and the put option; this permits the application of Black and Scholes(1973) model for the calculation of the insurance rate. The risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>premiums</b> are calculated for the thirteen city banks and twenty-two regional banks. The inter-bank spread in risk-adjusted rates in Japan is found to be as wide as in the United States. But the insurance system is only one component of the safety network for a county's banking system. The difference in the American and Japanese networks is described and its implications for the evaluation of the insurance system is discussed. ...|$|R

I examine whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) fulfills its predicted benefits for United States’ lower and middle class residents, through analysis of both quantitative and qualitative information. The intent of the Affordable Care Act was to make health care more affordable, accessible and of higher quality than previously available (Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA), 2014). The ACA set a single person insurance health plan premium limit of 9. 66 percent of household income for that individual to meet essential coverage. The insurance companies could <b>adjust</b> <b>premiums</b> for any non-single person insurance plan without a limit. I suggest that there were significant cost increases to lower and middle class residents[1] that had health insurance coverage when the ACA went into effect. I used a survey of 100 people to evaluate the financial impacts of the ACA for the different income classes in the period from 2010 through 2014.

40|$|As of 2006, the Dutch {{healthcare}} {{system will be}} run by regulated competition. An important part of regulated competition is a system of risk adjustment. This paper presents an empirical analysis {{of the effects of}} risk adjustment in the Dutch social health insurance system covering the years 1991 - 2001. By comparing insurers' health care expenditures with their risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>premiums,</b> our analysis estimates the impact of risk adjustment over a number of years. Results indicate that the risk-adjustment system has improved substantially. Whereas {{in the beginning of the}} nineties prospective risk adjustment could explain about 20 % of the variation in health care expenditure differentials between insurers, this figure rose to 55 % in 2001. The explanation of the same variation after retrospective payments did not show a clear upward or downward trend, and has varied since 1995 around 85 %. The remaining variation in insurers' health care expenditure differentials are determined more by structural than random factors. One such factor may be related to the low ex-ante projections of the government's total health care expenditures, which favour insurers with a population of relatively good health risks. Results show that new entrants in the Dutch health insurance market had significantly lower health care expenditures. Furthermore, economies of scale do not seem to have played a role during the sample period: the expenditures of large insurers were not significantly lower than those of the smaller insurers. ...|$|R

That has the advantage to insurers to decrease their liability without violating the terms of the policy or being accused of (individual) re-underwriting. It also allows the insurer to claim that the policy offers protection against rises in premiums because of the policyholder acquiring health conditions even though that protection is limited.|$|R
