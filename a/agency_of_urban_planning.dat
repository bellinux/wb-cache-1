Delphi method {{has been used}} to survey major factors and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has been utilized to define their significance, in a case study for Tehran. This study outlines the core factors that affected <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> implementation failure. Obtained results provide proper insights to increase success <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> to achieve their goals.

40|$|Several countries, {{including}} Malaysia, {{have set}} a long term target of establishing a more educated workforce. This thrust on the massification of higher education {{has resulted in a}} new problem-graduate unemployment. The growing problem of graduate unemployment in Malaysia is widely debated in the media and blogs. The Higher Education Ministry, in its Graduate Tracer Study Report 2011, reported that 24 per cent of them have not found a job after six months of graduating. The employment scenario <b>of</b> the <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> graduates has changed over the years from catering the needs of the public sector, to catering the needs of the private sector and to fulfilling the need of the One Stop Centre or the OSC. The advent of the liberalization <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> services challenges <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> schools in Malaysia to produce planners not only to cater for local needs but also with the capability of exporting their skills and services internationally. Given the diverse scope <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> it is a paradox that graduates <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> should converge on the conventional <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> organizations for employment. The paper will highlight some preliminary findings on the employment prospect <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> graduates in the immediate future and the possibility of diversifying employment opportunities <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> graduates...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{the role}} <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> has changed. In the past, the role <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> was {{meeting the demand}} such as land use and {{location}} for effective industrial activities, quantitative requirement of residential spaces, and so on, however recently it has improved with Quality Of Life such as amenity, preservation of nature and environment, safety, town-scape, and so on. Therefore, the process <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> requires the information disclosure from planners to stakeholders and the public involvement from stakeholders to planners. The planners requires the changes in citizen’s daily life and the improvement of Quality of Life accompanied with implementation <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning,</b> on the other hand, stakeholders requires specific change of daily life accompanied with implementation <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning.</b> It’s difficult for stakeholders, such as residents, to image specific change of daily life with numerical representations. Therefore clear presentation is necessary for citizens to clearly image specific change of daily life and to easily realize changes in daily life. Thus animation is better than numerical information. This study develops “DRAMATIZING METHOD ” as a new method for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> alternatives, that make it possible the followings; 1) Exclusion of “DRAMA ” maker’s individual way of thinking, 2) Considering individual viewpoint, 3) Clearly expressing tool by animations other than presentation wit...|$|R
