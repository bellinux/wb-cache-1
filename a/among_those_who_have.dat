5|$|Animal House {{was a great}} {{box office}} success despite its limited {{production}} costs and started an industry trend, inspiring other comedies such as Porky's, the Police Academy films, the American Pie films, Up the Academy (made by their rival magazine company: MAD), and Old School among others. Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis' use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy believable became the traditional approach for film comedies.|$|E
5|$|In the {{historical}} 1931 census preceding World War II, 78.1% of Cracovians declared Polish {{as their primary}} language, with Yiddish or Hebrew at 20.9%, Ukrainian 0.4%, German 0.3%, and Russian 0.1%. The ravages of history have greatly reduced the percentage of ethnic minorities living in Kraków. The official and unofficial numbers differ, {{as in the case}} of Romani people. Hence, according to the 2002 census, <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> declared their national identity (irrespective of language and religion) in Kraków Voivodeship, 1,572 were Slovaks, followed by Ukrainians (472), Jews (50) and Armenians (22). Romani people, officially numbered at 1,678, are estimated at over 5,000. Statistics collected by the Ministry of Education reveal that, even though only 1% of adults (as per above) officially claim minority status, as many as 3% of students participate in programmes designed for ethnic minorities.|$|E
40|$|People injecting {{image and}} {{performance}} enhancing drugs (IPEDs) have traditionally not been {{perceived as being}} {{at high risk of}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, recent studies indicate the HCV antibody (anti-HCV) prevalence in this group is 10 -times that in the general population. HCV testing uptake and undiagnosed infections are examined using data from a voluntary unlinked-anonymous survey. Method People injecting IPEDs across England and Wales completed a short bio-behavioural survey (2012 – 15). Anti-HCV status and self-reports of HCV testing were used in the analysis. Results The participants median age was 31 years, 98 % were men, 14 % had also injected psychoactive drugs and the anti-HCV prevalence was 4. 8 % (N = 564). <b>Among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never injected psychoactive drugs the anti-HCV prevalence was 1. 4 %; <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> recently injected psychoactive drugs (preceding 12 months) prevalence was 39 % and <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> done this previously 14 % (p < 0. 001). Overall, 37 % had been tested for HCV: <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> recently injected psychoactive drugs 78 % had been tested, as had 56 % of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> injected psychoactive drugs previously; 33 % of those never injecting psychoactive drugs were tested (p < 0. 001). Overall, 44 % of those with anti-HCV were aware of this; however, only 14 % of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never injected psychoactive drugs were aware. Conclusions One-in-twenty people <b>who</b> inject IPEDs <b>have</b> anti-HCV. HCV infections <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never injected psychoactive drugs were mostly undiagnosed, though this group had a lower prevalence. Targeted HCV testing interventions are also needed for those injecting IPEDs...|$|R

5|$|On March 8, 2016, Johnson {{announced}} his retirement from the NFL after nine seasons. His 11,619 receiving yards rank third in a player's first nine seasons, trailing only Torry Holt (11,864) and Jerry Rice (11,776). Since Johnson was drafted by the Lions with the second overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, no player has more receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and 100-yard games (46) than Johnson through the 2015 season. <b>Among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> played in 100 career games in NFL history, no player has averaged more receiving yards per game than Johnson. Johnson's average of 86.1 receiving yards per game is 8.7 yards better than the next-closest player on that list, Torry Holt. His 5,137 receiving yards from 2011 to 2013 are the most by any player over a three-year stretch in NFL history.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. One study found that <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Parkinson's disease is {{generally}} unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Those {{with a family}} member affected {{are more likely to}} get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} and use of the term Wicca within contemporary Paganism has been a recurring topic of discussion in the field of Pagan studies. The majority of academics and independent scholars use the first, more inclusive definition. Given its historical status and prevalent usage within Paganism, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White thought it the logical and easier choice for academia, although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines Wicca. <b>Among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> used the former definition are American sociologist Margot Adler, literary scholar Chas S. Clifton, and religious studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly, while others such as the Britons Graham Harvey and Ronald Hutton failed to make their usage clear. To deal with this problem in future, Doyle White urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work.|$|E
