5|$|Oleg's {{death has}} been {{interpreted}} as a distorted variant of the threefold death theme in Indo-European myth and legend, with prophecy, the snake <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> representing the three functions: the prophecy is associated with sovereignty, the horse with warriors, and the serpent with reproduction.|$|E
5|$|In {{a popular}} oleograph {{representation}} of Khandoba, Mhalsa is seated {{in front of}} Khandoba on his white horse. Mhalsa is piercing a demon's chest with a spear, while a dog is biting his thigh <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is hitting his head. The other demon is grabbing the reins of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E
5|$|Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took {{rooms at}} The Shannon Hotel, {{near the river}} and set about trying to {{capture the essence of}} the town which had {{inspired}} Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced {{by the fact that he}} was asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> fair. Pope Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work. They sold the hotel in 1977.|$|E
50|$|Men {{and women}} competed together, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were also {{declared}} medal winners.|$|R
60|$|The boys plied their sticks, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> sprang on at full gallop.|$|R
60|$|They rode {{in silence}} till the village lay behind them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> calmed down.|$|R
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, the rider <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E
25|$|The name is presumably a pun off of {{the legendary}} city of Camelot, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> gait speed, a canter.|$|E
25|$|The twelve pounder batteries, Nos. 4 and 8, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> batteries, Nos. 5 and 18, {{remained}} in reserve, near Sombreffe.|$|E
50|$|Robert {{is finally}} {{caught in a}} barn with <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> <b>The</b> {{soldiers}} surrounding Robert set the barn on fire {{in an attempt to}} smoke him out. However, the doors of the barn are locked. Before Robert can open them, the roof collapses on him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> Robert is saved but badly burned, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> possibly <b>the</b> dog are killed.|$|R

5000|$|It {{is as if}} Russell-as-rancher were {{to round}} up all his critters (sheep, cows and horses) into three fictitious corrals (one for the sheep, one for <b>the</b> cows, <b>and</b> one for <b>the</b> <b>horses)</b> that are located in his fictitious ranch. What {{actually}} exists are the sheep, <b>the</b> cows <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> (<b>the</b> extensions), but not the fictitious [...] "concepts" [...] corrals and ranch.|$|R
25|$|Until 1913, {{there was}} no {{requirement}} for British racehorses to have official names, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> who later became known as Soothsayer competed in 1811 as Mr. Gascoigne's ch. c. by Sorcerer.|$|E
25|$|Other scenes {{he painted}} include the Siege of Derry (1689), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and battle portion of Godfrey Kneller's famous {{portrait}} of the Duke of Schomberg, {{who had been killed}} at the Battle of the Boyne.|$|E
25|$|In this gait, {{the horse}} moves its legs in unison in {{diagonal}} pairs. From {{the standpoint of}} the balance of the horse, this is a very stable gait, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> need not make major balancing motions with its head and neck.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> big mule <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> steamed <b>and</b> puffed a little, but Polly {{stood as}} calm as a rocking-horse.|$|R
60|$|But I have {{something}} particular {{to say about}} <b>the</b> postilions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> <b>and</b> I will say it in the next chapter.|$|R

25|$|Other {{structures}} {{which were}} {{built on the}} ranch in the 1890s were the Foreman's House, the blacksmith shop <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> barn. The Fruit Packing House, the largest packing house in the Salt River Valley, was built in 1891.|$|E
25|$|Gastroscopy, or {{endoscopic}} {{evaluation of}} the stomach, is useful in chronic cases of colic suspected {{to be caused by}} gastric ulcers, gastric impactions, and gastric masses. A 3-meter scope is required to visualize the stomach of most horses, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> must be fasted prior to scoping.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{houses in}} the village can still be seen along these two roads, {{together}} with St John's Church <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> and Groom, a 17th-century coaching inn next door. The old Dorking road squeezes between {{the church and the}} inn, creating a significant bottleneck for modern motor traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Extended trot: An engaged trot {{with long}} strides where <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{stretches}} its frame and lengthens its strides {{to the greatest}} degree possible. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> has {{a great amount of}} suspension. The back is round <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> head just in front and vertical.|$|R

25|$|In 1947, however, it was {{reformed}} {{as part of}} {{the extension}} of the Territorial Army Yeomanry into Northern Ireland. In 1956, the TA lost its tanks, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> became an armoured reconnaissance regiment, again in armoured cars. It avoided disbandment at this point and did so again in 1961.|$|E
25|$|In London, Man ran {{simultaneously}} to another of Bolt's plays, The Tiger <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse.</b> Both plays were major hits, although Horse {{was the more}} successful of the two. British critical reaction was largely positive, albeit reservedly so; few reviews at the time regarded the play as a classic. The show ran for 320 performances.|$|E
25|$|In the {{district}} of Groß-Buchholz the 282-metre-high Telemax is located, which is the tallest building in Lower Saxony and the highest television tower in Northern Germany. Some other notable towers are the VW-Tower in the city centre and the old towers of the former middle-age defence belt: Döhrener Tower, Lister Tower <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> Tower.|$|E

25|$|However, {{a series}} reconnaissances and work by field {{engineers}} in the apparently waterless desert, based on intelligence produced sufficient water, {{to the west}} of Beersheba for <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> circling to <b>the</b> south in a wide arch.|$|R
60|$|Dave was {{desirous of}} going ahead at once, {{but it was}} too late, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were so worn out, it was decided to remain at Bojowak over night. There was {{something}} of a road-house, used principally during <b>the</b> summer, <b>and</b> at this they asked for accommodations for <b>the</b> whole party <b>and</b> also for <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Work {{in small}} circles is {{stressful}} on a horse's legs, {{so it is}} best to limit a longeing session to about 20 minutes. Gaits should be changed frequently, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> should be worked for equal time in both directions so that both sides of the horse are worked evenly and to keep the work interesting for the horse.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1601, {{the couple}} ruled the Spanish Netherlands together, and after Albert's death Isabella was {{appointed}} Governor of the Netherlands {{on behalf of}} the King of Spain. A false anecdote links Isabella, the siege of Ostend, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> coat colour isabelline. The reign of Albert and Isabella is considered the Golden Age of the Spanish Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Oral steroids such as {{prednisolone}} {{are commonly}} used; however, side effects are common, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> may be predisposed to laminitis. Therefore, {{the use of}} aerosolised steroids via an equine inhaler are becoming more common. This route of administration reduces the dose required, {{and the risk of}} side effects. Originally, beclomethasone was used, but newer compounds are available now, such as fluticasone propionate.|$|E

50|$|The film shows {{a mother}} riding her horse and her {{daughter}} riding her pony on an open countryside road. Both <b>the</b> riders <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> are wearing adequate safety clothing. A driver in a Ford car drives down the same stretch of road <b>and</b> comes across <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> <b>The</b> driver refuses to leave enough space between their car <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> uses their car horn <b>and</b> revving of <b>the</b> engine to attract attention and finally attempts to pass in a narrow space without warning. Whereas the young girl is {{able to continue to}} ride her pony calmly without getting distracted, the driver's actions frighten <b>the</b> mother's <b>horse,</b> causing him to misbehave and refuse to respond to his rider's instructions. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> gets extremely distressed and rears {{up in front of the}} car. The film ends with a still image of <b>the</b> scared <b>horse</b> reflected on a broken windshield, suggesting that the car hit <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> left him and his rider seriously injured.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come on, mother,' the man whispered. The {{old woman}} climbed into <b>the</b> van, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> drew {{it out of}} the deep-rutted shaw on to the hard road.|$|R
