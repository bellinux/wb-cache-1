50|$|<b>Allylprodine</b> {{produces}} similar {{effects to}} other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression {{which may be}} harmful or fatal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allylprodine</b> is {{regulated}} {{in most countries}} as is morphine, including being in Schedule I of the US Controlled Substances Act 1970 as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9602 and a 2014 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 2 grammes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allylprodine</b> is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} analog of prodine. It was discovered in by Hoffman-La Roche in 1957 during research into the related drug pethidine. Derivatives were tested to prove the theory that phenolic & non-phenolic opioids bind at different sites of the opiate receptor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allylprodine</b> is {{considered}} a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2017). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.|$|E
5000|$|... 14-Cinnamoyloxycodeinone is {{the most}} potent example {{in a series of}} opiate {{analgesic}} drugs discovered in the 1960s, with > ×100 times the potency of morphine. It is a derivative of , being the 14-cinnamate ester. In another paper, Buckett assigns the potency as 177 with a range (depending on animal and test) of ×101 - ×310. It may be of interest to researchers that the allyl group in this compound and in <b>allylprodine</b> overlay very closely.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Allylprodine</b> is {{more potent}} as an {{analgesic}} than similar {{drugs such as}} α-prodine, and the 3R,4S-isomer is 23 times more potent than morphine, due to the allyl group binding to an additional amino acid target in the binding site on the μ-opioid receptor. It is also stereoselective, with one isomer being much more active. [...] When modeled in three dimensions, the alkene overlays the alkenes found in 14-cinnamoyloxycodeinone and in 14-allyloxycodeinone, re-enforcing {{the presence of an}} interaction of the alkene.|$|E
