Their first appearance in The Simpsons was [...] "There's No Disgrace Like Home." [...] Itchy, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, is a blue mouse, and usually the aggressor and the victor over the hapless Scratchy in their battles. An exception is in [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] (season five, 1993). Bart and Lisa watch a cartoon called [...] "Burning Down the Mouse", as Lisa puts it, [...] "This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy". However, due to the Simpsons' television being accidentally unplugged, the viewer does not {{see the end of}} the cartoon and Krusty proclaims that the network will never let it be shown again, to Bart and Lisa's fury. Scratchy, voiced by Harry Shearer, is a threadbare, dim-witted black cat and the victim of relentless abuse from the sadistic mouse, Itchy. The writers often forget which character is which; a trick they use is that Scratchy contains the letters c, <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>t.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{compilation}} of data from several cruises between 1998 and 2013 was used to derive polynomial fits that estimate total alkalinity (<b>A</b> <b>T)</b> <b>and</b> total dissolved inorganic carbon (C T) from measurements of salinity and temperature in the Mediterranean Sea surface waters. The optimal equations were chosen based on the 10 -fold cross-validation results and revealed that second- and third-order polynomials fit the <b>A</b> <b>T</b> <b>and</b> C <b>T</b> data respectively. The A T surface fit yielded a {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) of ± 10. 6 μmol kg − 1, and salinity and temperature contribute to 96 % of the variability. Furthermore, we present the first annual mean C T parameterization for the Mediterranean Sea surface waters with a RMSE of ± 14. 3 μmol kg − 1. Excluding the marginal seas of the Adriatic and the Aegean, these equations can be used to estimate <b>A</b> <b>T</b> <b>and</b> C <b>T</b> in case of the lack of measurements. The identified empirical equations were applied on the 0. 25 ° climatologies of temperature and salinity, available from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. The 7 -year averages (2005 – 2012) showed that <b>A</b> <b>T</b> <b>and</b> C <b>T</b> have similar patterns with an increasing eastward gradient. The variability is influenced by the inflow of cold Atlantic waters through the Strait of Gibraltar and by the oligotrophic and thermohaline gradient that characterize the Mediterranean Sea. The summer–winter seasonality was also mapped and showed different patterns for <b>A</b> <b>T</b> <b>and</b> C <b>T.</b> During the winter, the <b>A</b> <b>T</b> <b>and</b> C <b>T</b> concentrations were higher in the western than in the eastern basin. The opposite was observed in the summer where the eastern basin was marked by higher <b>A</b> <b>T</b> <b>and</b> C <b>T</b> concentrations than in winter. The strong evaporation that takes place in this season along with the ultra-oligotrophy of the eastern basin determines the increase of both <b>A</b> <b>T</b> <b>and</b> C <b>T</b> concentrations...|$|R

2500|$|The nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as {{required}} by their function in general DNA packaging. [...] There are, however, large DNA sequence preferences that govern nucleosome positioning. [...] This is due primarily to the varying physical properties of different DNA sequences: For instance, adenine and thymine are more favorably compressed into the inner minor grooves. This means nucleosomes can bind preferentially at one position approximately every 10 base pairs (the helical repeat of DNA)- where the DNA is rotated to maximise the number of <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> bases that will lie in the inner minor groove.

40|$|The lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is {{the most}} {{important}} respiratory parasite of domestic cats. Pulmonary aelurostrongylosis has been reported in wild felids, though unequivocally evidence of wildlife infection by A. abstrusus is scant. Recently, Troglostrongylus brevior, a lungworm usually infecting wild felids, has been described in domestic cats from Mediterranean areas. The present work evaluates the sequence variation of an informative region within the gene encoding the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 of <b>A.</b> abstrusus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> brevior, in order to provide novel information on the genetic make-up of these lungworms. Parasitic stages of <b>A.</b> abstrusus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> brevior were collected from domestic and wild hosts (i. e., domestic cat, European wildcat, caracal, serval, and lion) from Italy, Greece, and South Africa. Five (HI-HV) and four (HI-HIV) haplotypes were recorded for <b>A.</b> abstrusus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> brevior, respectively, mostly shared between domestic and wild felids in different geographical areas. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all haplotypes of <b>A.</b> abstrusus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> brevior clustered as monophyletic groups with a strong nodal support, indicating that all haplotypes identified were distinct from each other. All sequence types represent two distinct species, <b>A.</b> abstrusus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> brevior, <b>and</b> these genetic convergences are also detected within and among populations of these nematodes, irrespective of their hosts and geographical origin. The occurrence of <b>A.</b> abstrusus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> brevior haplotypes in different hosts from the same regions and between different countries indicates that the same lungworm populations circulate in domestic and wild hosts under the same routes of transmission...|$|R
