60|$|I meditated pretty freely <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> down to Brinkley {{in the old}} {{two-seater}} that afternoon. The news of this rift or rupture of Angela's and Tuppy's had disturbed me greatly.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{the full}} {{sense of it}} was with me all that night <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove,</b> lonely above the rush and murmur of my engines, out upon the weltering circle of the sea.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} the date. The letter was a week old. Some unfortunate chance had {{prevented}} my going to the club for several days, or I might have got it in time to save him. Perhaps it was not too late. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> off to my rooms, packed up my things, and started by the night-mail from Charing Cross. The journey was intolerable. I thought I would never arrive. As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> to the Hotel l'Angleterre. They told me that Erskine had been buried two days before in the English cemetery. There was something horribly grotesque about the whole tragedy. I said all kinds of wild things, {{and the people in}} the hall looked curiously at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} him, sir! The fattest gentleman <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> see, and {{the heaviest}} customer <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>drove.</b> Yes, yes--I call him to mind, sir! We DID {{go to the}} station, and it WAS from Forest Road. There was a parrot, or summat like it, screeching in the window. The gentleman was in a mortal hurry about the lady's luggage, {{and he gave me}} a handsome present for looking sharp and getting the boxes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! aye! I'll do that, milor, {{within the}} hour. Though M. le duc {{was never a}} very kind master {{to me in the}} past, I cannot forget that I served him and his family for over thirty years <b>as</b> coachman. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> Mlle. Yvonne in the first pony-cart she ever possessed. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> her--ah! that was a bitter day!--her and M. le duc when they left Kernogan never to return. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> Mlle. Yvonne on that memorable night when a crowd of miserable peasants {{attacked}} her coach, and that brute Pierre Adet started to lead a rabble against the château. That was the beginning of things, milor. God alone knows what has happened to Pierre Adet. His father Jean was hanged by order of M. le duc. Now M. le duc is destined to lie in a forgotten grave. I serve this abominable Republic by digging graves for her victims. I would be happier, I think, if I knew what had become of Mlle. Yvonne." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> to {{the house}} I told him of what had passed, and of how my own diary {{had come to be}} of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion, at which the Professor {{interrupted}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "How the dickens did {{you know}} I was down there?" [...] Francis demanded, with some surprise. [...] "I was just {{thinking}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> up that I hadn't left my address either here or at Clarges Street." ...|$|E
60|$|The Court sat {{late that}} day as an {{important}} case was ending; it was striking six <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> in at {{the gate of the}} Kensington Palace Road. I found myself installed in a large room close to the sick chamber.|$|E
60|$|When {{the time}} came to say good-bye, she broke down utterly and I went away with a painful {{constriction}} in my own throat, a lump which lasted for hours. Not till on the second day <b>as</b> <b>I</b> saw <b>droves</b> of Canadian antelope racing with the train, whilst flights of geese overhead gave certain sign of the wilderness, did I regain my desire to explore the valleys of the North. That lonely old woman on the porch of the Homestead was never absent from my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems so}} little--such a selfish way of {{discharging}} one's obligations, just {{to write out}} a cheque, when {{there is so much}} trouble in the world that demands human kindness as well <b>as</b> material help. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> up Dalton Street yesterday, from downtown. You know how hot it was! And I couldn't help thinking how terrible it is that we who have everything are so heedless of all that misery. The thought of it took away all my pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sequel to}} this {{communication}} was that as {{early on the}} morrow <b>as</b> <b>I</b> dared <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> straight to Mr. Vereker's door. He occupied in those years one of the honest old houses in Kensington Square. He received me immediately, and <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> came in I saw I hadn't lost my power to minister to his mirth. He laughed out at sight of my face, which doubtless expressed my perturbation. I had been indiscreet--my compunction was great. [...] "I HAVE told somebody," [...] I panted, [...] "and I'm sure that person will by this time have told somebody else! It's a woman, into the bargain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{they was}} saying, sir, when I come away. And the men was at it,--that is, {{standing}} all about. And {{there is to}} be no more preaching, sir. And missus was out in the front looking at 'em <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> out of the yard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How that cheery talk {{came to mind}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> {{down the}} same road last year just after fine weather had come! It was the same season, and the hedges {{on each side of}} the narrow lane were {{fragrant}} as then with may and sweet briar.' ...|$|E
60|$|A really irresistible man--courteous, considerate, delightfully {{free from}} pride--a gentleman, {{every inch of}} him. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> away to the station I felt as if I could cheerfully do {{anything}} to promote the interests of Sir Percival Glyde--anything in the world, except drawing the marriage settlement of his wife.|$|E
6000|$|This {{same man}} asked me one day, soon after I came home, what Sir John Wilson was. This {{is a friend}} of mine, who took our house and servants, and {{everything}} as it stood, during our absence in America. I told him an officer. [...] "A wot, sir?" [...] "An officer." [...] And then, for fear he should think I meant a police-officer, I added, [...] "An officer in the army." [...] "I beg your pardon, sir," [...] he said, touching his hat, [...] "but the club <b>as</b> <b>I</b> always <b>drove</b> him to wos the United Servants." ...|$|R
60|$|The place I was in was {{no doubt}} that wild country, {{inhabited}} only by a few, that lies between the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes. It is filled with wild beasts and the Moors use it for hunting chiefly.--From this place I thought I saw {{the top of the}} mountain Teneriff in the Canaries: which made me try twice to attain it: but <b>as</b> often was <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> back, and so forced to pursue my fortune along shore.|$|R
6000|$|I hate a motive, like a {{lingering}} bottle [...] Which with the landlord makes too long a stand, [...] Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle, [...] Especially with politics on hand; [...] <b>I</b> hate it, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> hate a <b>drove</b> of cattle, [...] Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand; [...] <b>I</b> hate it, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> hate an argument, [...] A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you note yesterday, Olaf, {{if you had}} any mind {{left for}} the things of earth, that <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> in state through the streets many met me with sullen silence, while others cursed me openly and shouted, 'Where is the Augustus?' 'Give us Constantine. We will have no woman's rule.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|And I laughed <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> {{from the}} station, but the mirth died {{out on my}} lips As I thought of the fools like Pagett who write of their [...] "Eastern trips," [...] And the sneers of the {{traveled}} idiots who duly misgovern the land, And I prayed to the Lord to deliver another one into my hand.|$|E
6000|$|It {{wanted an}} hour or so to noon next day <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> across the Pont Neuf in a closed carriage, and was borne down the Rue St. Dominique to the portals of that splendid palace, facing the Jacobins, which bears the title of the [...] "Hôtel de Luynes," [...] and over the portals of which is carved the {{escutcheon}} of our house.|$|E
60|$|The morning {{broke in}} sunshine, and after early breakfast the {{launches}} began to ply again between {{the ship and}} the shore and continued till nearly all {{the first and second}} cabin people had been carried off. The people of the steerage satisfied what longing they had for strange sights and scenes by thronging to the sides of the steamer until they gave her a strong list landward, as they easily might, for there were twenty-five hundred of them. At Madeira there is a local Thomas Cook & Son of quite another name, but we were not finally sure that the alert youth on the pier who sold us transportation and provision was really their agent. However, his tickets served perfectly well at all points, and he was of such an engaging civility and personal comeliness that I should not have much minded their failing us here and there. He gave the first charming-touch of the Latin south whose renewed contact is such a pleasure to any one knowing it from the past. All Portuguese as Funchal was, it looked so like a hundred little Italian towns that it seemed to me <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> must always have driven about them in calico-tented bullock-carts set on runners, <b>as</b> later <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> about Eunchal.|$|R
6000|$|At half-past four I had the cab; [...] <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>as</b> hard <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could go. [...] The London sky was dirty drab, [...] And dirty brown the London snow. [...] And <b>as</b> <b>I</b> rattled in a cant- [...] er down by {{dear old}} Bolton Row, [...] A {{something}} made {{my heart to}} pant, [...] And caused my cheek to flush and glow.|$|R
5000|$|.....<b>I</b> <b>drove</b> {{around the}} Milford service plaza {{in the dark}} looking for the Supercharger, which is not {{prominently}} marked. I {{was not trying to}} drain the battery. (It was already on reserve power.) As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> found the Supercharger, I plugged the car in. John Broder ...|$|R
60|$|One day, in the {{following}} spring, I was riding home from the station with Euphemia,--we seldom took pleasure-drives now, we were so busy on the place,--and as we reached the house I heard the dog barking savagely. He was loose in the little orchard {{by the side of}} the house. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> in, Pomona came running to the carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so, dear Vicar, I {{propose to}} give him an {{opportunity}} of showing us what he can do. I have been thinking it all over <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> here. On Tuesday next, I will invite just a few people of taste, and he shall bring his violin. Eigh? And if that goes well, I will see if I can get some introductions and really push him." ...|$|E
6000|$|The haggard youth {{burst into}} my chambers, in the Temple, {{on the very}} next morning, and confided to me the story which has been just here narrated. When he had {{concluded}} it, with many ejaculations regarding the heroine of the tale, [...] "I saw her, sir," [...] he added, [...] "walking with the children and Miss Cann <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> round in the fly to the station--and didn't even bow to her." ...|$|E
60|$|Quick <b>as</b> thought, <b>I</b> {{rolled up}} Pat in his shawl and stuffed {{him under the}} seat. Then rearranging the lap-robe over my knees, <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> on, {{trembling}} a little, it is true.|$|R
60|$|TARLETON. Let {{him stay}} to dinner. Let him stay to breakfast. Let him spend his life here. Dont you say <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him out. Dont you say <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> you out.|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>drove</b> from Tokyo to Nagoya. My car {{was driven}} {{at the speed}} of 100 km per hour on a highway and the journey took 4  h. Find the {{distance}} <b>I</b> <b>drove.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is {{something}} of a recognition," [...] I replied. [...] "Is there anything I can get for you in New York? I don't know how long I shall have to stay--I'll telegraph you when I'm getting back." [...] I kissed her and hurried out to the automobile. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> off I saw her still standing in the doorway looking after me.... In the station I had a few minutes to telephone Nancy.|$|E
60|$|And {{they were}} sincere, these two women. They were drunk with {{conviction}} of {{the superiority of}} their class and of themselves. They had a sanction, in their own class-ethic, for every act they performed. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> away from Mrs. Pertonwaithe's great house, I looked back at it, and I remembered Ernest's expression that they were bound to the machine, but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "In the meantime," [...] Seaman continued, [...] "the Princess {{understands the}} {{situation}} and is, I think, impressed. She will at any rate do nothing rash. You and she will meet within {{the course of the}} next few hours, but on reasonable terms. To proceed! <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> back here after my interview with the Princess, I decided that it was time you made the acquaintance of the person who is chiefly responsible for your presence here." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{sat down}} with a faint feeling in my heart. It was not that I cared for the money for its own sake; but I thought of Lady Desborough, and I {{felt a rush of}} coming trouble sweep round me. However, after a moment, <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> back the feeling, and asked, in as cheerful a voice <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could,-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{could fight}} well, but against {{me he was}} lost. All the rage and agony of the last day {{gathered}} themselves together. I was lifted up and cried aloud in the joy of having someone on whom to wreak my vengeance. <b>I</b> felt <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> had against me the whole world and were pouring out my hate {{at the end of}} my sword. My fury lent me the strength of a devil. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him back, <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him back, and <b>I</b> fought <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had never fought before. In a minute I had beaten the sword from his hand, and it fell to the floor as if his wrist were broken, clattering down among the cups. He staggered back against the wall, and stood there with his head thrown back and his arms helplessly outspread.|$|R
6000|$|So <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> {{up first}} {{in search of}} lodgings. At the station even several people had bowed or shaken hands with me respectfully <b>as</b> <b>I</b> descended from the train. They came up as if they thought I must {{recognise}} them at once: there was recognition in their eyes; but when they met my blank stare, they seemed to remember all about it, and merely murmured in strange tones: ...|$|R
