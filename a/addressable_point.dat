50|$|One of {{the more}} notable {{features}} of AFP printers is that output data can be placed at any <b>addressable</b> <b>point</b> on a page. This capability is called all points addressability (APA). APA gives AFP applications the freedom to create output anywhere on a page, {{as opposed to being}} limited to just line and character positions.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the spin of optically <b>addressable</b> <b>point</b> defects can be coherently driven with AC electric fields. Based on magnetic-dipole forbidden spin transitions, this scheme enables spatially confined spin control, the imaging of high-frequency electric fields, and the characterization of defect spin multiplicity. While we control defects in SiC, these methods apply to spin systems in many semiconductors, including the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Electrically driven spin resonance offers a viable route towards scalable quantum control of electron spins in a dense array. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|MR imaging data is {{sometimes}} {{presented in a}} "patchwork quilt" format with individual pixels visible as squares of uniform intensity. This phenomenon often arises by default from an image space convolution (performed implicitly by the graphics system) used to convert the sparse point sampling of the spatial domain offered by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) into a sufficiently dense sampling to allow assignment of an intensity value to each <b>addressable</b> <b>point</b> on the display device. Typical examples are fMRI maps, spectroscopic images and zoomed-in views. These square patches are image structure not present in the object, i. e., artifacts. This form of image display is studied by both an image analysis method and by Fourier analysis. Image formation by display of the 2 D DFT of an acquired k-space matrix as a 2 D pixel array is a poor reconstruction {{because it does not}} ensure a faithful representation of the spatial frequency content actually present in the data. By analysis of the visual appearance of 2 D pixel arrays we show that there are two principal effects: (a) attenuation of higher spatial frequencies (i. e., low-pass filtering); (b) introduction of artifactual high frequency image structure. These effects can lead to very poor performance with an artifact/signal ratio of over 200...|$|E

40|$|Electron vortex beams (EVBs) are an {{appealing}} topic, both in fundamental science and for practical applications in electron microscopy [1, 2]. Some {{of the most}} promising applications require beams that have large orbital angular momentum (OAM) [2, 3, 4]. Here, we demonstrate the largest (L= 1000 ħ) high quality EVB by using electron beam lithography (EBL) to fabricate a phase hologram. EBL provides superior fabrication quality and a larger number of <b>addressable</b> <b>points</b> when compared with focused ion beam (FIB) milling. We measure the OAM of the generated EVB through propagation after a hard aperture cut [5]. Comparisons with simulations confirm an average OAM of (960 ± 120) ħ, which is consistent with the intended value. A clear improvement when compared with a FIB-nanofabricated hologram is demonstrated in terms of 1) the maximum OAM that can be reached; 2) the minimum feature size (33 nm in the present study); 3) the improved uniformity of the frequency response; 4) the better suppression of higher order diffraction due to a nearly perfect rectangular groove profile. We believe that EBL will be the fabrication technique of choice for most new diffractive optics with electrons in the future, permitting more complex holograms and new applications in material science...|$|R
40|$|The cost {{of doing}} {{business}} in space is very high. If errors occur while in orbit the costs grow and desired scientific data may be corrupted or even lost. The Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS) Star Simulator is a unique test bed that allows star trackers to interface with simulated stars in a laboratory before going into orbit. This hardware-in-the loop testing of equipment on earth increases the probability of success while in space. The IPS Star Simulator provides three fields of view 2. 55 x 2. 55 degrees each for input into star trackers. The fields of view are produced on three separate monitors. Each monitor has 4096 x 4096 <b>addressable</b> <b>points</b> and can display 50 stars (pixels) maximum at a given time. The pixel refresh rate is 1000 Hz. The spectral output is approximately 550 nm. The available relative visual magnitude range is 2 to 8 visual magnitudes. The star size is less than 100 arc seconds. The minimum star movement is less than 5 arc seconds and the relative position accuracy is approximately 40 arc seconds. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the LPS Star Simulator design and to provide an operational scenario so others may gain from the approach and possible use of the system...|$|R
50|$|All <b>points</b> <b>addressable</b> (APA), or pixel addressable, in {{the context}} of a dot matrix on a {{computer}} monitor or any display device consisting of a pixel array, refers to an arrangement whereby bits or cells can be individually manipulated, as opposed to rewriting the whole array, or regions such as characters, every time a change is needed.|$|R

50|$|Text mode is a {{computer}} display mode in which content is internally represented on {{a computer}} screen in terms of characters rather than individual pixels. Typically, the screen consists of a uniform rectangular grid of character cells, each of which contains one of the characters of a character set.

5000|$|In digital imaging, a pixel, pel, dots, or {{picture element}} is a {{physical}} point in a raster image, or the smallest addressable element in an all <b>points</b> <b>addressable</b> display device; so it is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen.

50|$|The seminal {{use of this}} {{technology}} was in the TRS-80 where {{the only way to}} get discrete pixels on the screen that could be turned on and off individually, (all <b>points</b> <b>addressable)</b> was by the use of a 2×3 pixel matrix of block graphics. In the case of the TRS-80 these block graphics were not incorporated into a font ROM, as later became the norm, but were generated directly from the logic pattern of six bits from the video RAM using a dedicated circuit made from logic gates.|$|R
5000|$|Each ALU, {{called a}} PE slice, {{contains}} sixty four 32 bit registers {{that are used}} for both integer and floating point. The registers are, interestingly, bit and byte <b>addressable.</b> The floating <b>point</b> unit handles single precision and double precision arithmetic on IEEE format numbers. Each PE slice contains two registers for data memory address, and the data. Each PE also has two one-bit serial ports, one for inbound and one for outbound communication to its nearest neighbor. The direction of communication is controlled globally. The PEs also have inbound and outbound paths to a global router for I/O. A broadcast port allows a single instance of data to be [...] "promoted" [...] to parallel data. Alternately, global data can be 'or-ed' to a scalar result.|$|R
40|$|Background: Non-adherence to {{prescribed}} medications is {{a serious}} health problem in the United States, costing an estimated $ 100 billion per year. While poor adherence should be <b>addressable</b> with <b>point</b> of care health information technology, integrating new solutions with existing electronic health records (EHR) systems require customization within each organization, which is difficult because of the monolithic software design of most EHR products. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to create a published algorithm for predicting medication adherence problems easily accessible at the point of care through a Web application that runs on the Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusuable Technologies (SMART) platform. The SMART platform is an emerging framework that enables EHR systems to behave as “iPhone like platforms ” by exhibiting an application programming interface for easy addition and deletion of third party apps. The app is presented as a point of care solution to monitoring medication adherence as well as a sufficiently general, modular application that may serve as an example and template for other SMART apps. Methods: The widely used, open source Django framework was used together with the SMART platform to create the interoperable components of this app. Django uses Python as its core programming language. This allows statistical and mathematical module...|$|R
5000|$|Such {{operation}} {{is described in}} the paper [...] "All <b>points</b> <b>addressable</b> raster display memory" [...] by R. Matick, D. Ling, S. Gupta, and F. Dill, IBM Journal of R&D, Vol 28, No. 4, July 1984, pp. 379-393. To use the video port, the controller first uses the DRAM port to select the row of the memory array {{that is to be}} displayed. The VRAM then copies that entire row to an internal row-buffer which is a shift register. The controller can then continue to use the DRAM port for drawing objects on the display. Meanwhile, the controller feeds a clock called the shift clock (SCLK) to the VRAM's video port. Each SCLK pulse causes the VRAM to deliver the next data bit, in strict address order, from the shift register to the video port. For simplicity, the graphics adapter is usually designed so that the contents of a row, and therefore the contents of the shift-register, corresponds to a complete horizontal line on the display.|$|R
