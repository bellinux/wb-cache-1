50|$|Internal <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> {{to develop}} {{and most of these}} are derived from two systems of {{embryonic}} ducts. Male accessory organs are derived from mesonephric (wolfian) ducts. The developing tubules within the testes secretes a polypeptide Müllerian inhibition factor (MIF). MIF causes the regression of the paramesonephretic ducts 60 days after fertilization. Testosterone secretion by the interstitial cells of the testes then causes the growth and development of the mesonephric ducts into male secondary sex organs. The Müllerian ducts atrophy, but traces of their anterior ends are represented by the appendices testis (hydatids of Morgagni of the male), while their terminal fused portions form the utriculus {{on the floor of the}} prostatic urethra. This is due to the production of Anti-Müllerian hormone by the Sertoli cells of the testes.|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} Hox gene Hoxd- 13 in {{postnatal}} morphogenesis of {{the male}} <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> was examined by correlating the distribution and temporal regulation of expression in the <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> of postnatal mice with morphologic abnormalities of Hoxd- 13 -deficient transgenic mice. Previous studies of Hoxd- 13 expression in the perinatal period have shown a broad domain of expression in the lower genitourinary tract, with expression in both mesenchyme and epithelium; focal expression was also noted in the epithelium of the nascent ducts of the developing prostate. Quantitative RT-PCR studies of Hoxd- 13 expression in the 5 day mouse confirm widespread expression in the <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> developing from both the Wolffian duct and the urogenital sinus. Expression is down-regulated with age, and a detailed time course of expression in the developing prostate shows {{that the level of}} Hoxd- 13 expression correlates with morphogenetic activity {{in the development of the}} prostate ductal system. Transgenic Hoxd- 13 -deficient mice display multiple abnormalities in the male <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs.</b> The most severe abnormalities were observed in organs exhibiting ductal branching during postnatal development and included diminished mesenchymal folding in the seminal vesicles, decreased size and diminished ductal branching in the ventral and dorsal prostate, and agenesis of the bulbourethral gland. We conclude that Hoxd- 13 expression in the postnatal period correlates with a period of intense morphogenetic activity in accessory sex organ development and that the function of Hoxd- 13 is evidenced by morphologic abnormalities in <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> of the Hoxd- 13 -deficient mutant...|$|E

LuRKO males and females were born phenotypically normal, with testes, ovaries, and genital structures indistinguishable from their wild-type (WT) littermates. Postnatally, testicular growth and descent, and external genital and <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organ</b> maturation, were blocked in LuRKO males, and their spermatogenesis was arrested at the round spermatid stage. The number and size of Leydig cells were dramatically reduced. LuRKO females also displayed underdeveloped external genitalia and uteri postnatally, and their age of vaginal opening was delayed by 5 – 7 days. The (�/�) ovaries were smaller, and histological analysis revealed follicles up to the early antral stage, but no preovulatory follicles or corpora lutea. Reduced gonadal sex hormone production was found in each sex, as was also reflected by the suppressed <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organ</b> weights and elevated gonadotropin levels. Completion of meiosis of testicular germ cells in the LuRKO males differs from other hypogonadotropic/cryptorchid mouse models, suggesting a role for FSH in this process. In females, FSH appears to stimulate developing follicles from the preantral to early antral stage, and LH is the stimulus beyond this stage. Hence, in each sex, the intrauterine sex differentiation is independent of LH action, {{but it has a}} crucial role postnatally for attaining sexual maturity.

Objectives: In case of ULC, {{it is possible to}} compare the testicular functions between normal condition and cryptorchidism in the same animal, whereas BLC shows the necessity of testicular androgens for proper maintenance of reproductive structures and functions. Materials and Methods: In the present study, experimental ULC and BLC was done on same-aged adult mature male mice and kept for 15 days and 30 days, respectively, to observe the changes due to the induced cryptorchidism on the different reproductive organs, viz., the testis and <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> along with epididymal sperm count.

In addition, oestrogens appear to block the stimulatory effects of exogenous LH on the male <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> (Sivelle, McNeilly & Collins, 1977), an effect which could be due to oestrogen inhibiting the stimulatory effects of LH on androgen production by the Leydig cells (Moger, 1976).

It has long been speculation that reproductive cycles under natural conditions are strikingly related to the environment, with such features as temperature, moisture, length of day and available food all implicated. These cues, however, appear to be filtered through varied genetic potential and physiological patterns, since not all species respond similarly, even though residing together in a homogeneous environment.

40|$|Male sex steroids (androgens) are {{important}} for maintaining sperm production and growth of the <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organ,</b> the prostate gland. This article examines {{the role of the}} androgen receptor (AR) in the control of spermatogenesis and focusses on the N-terminal transactivation domain of the receptor, a poorly studied region that is essential for receptor function. This domain is of great interest because of its causative relationship to a fatal neuromuscular disease, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy’s syndrome). Genetic screening of the transactivation domain of the AR gene of 153 patients presenting solely with defective spermatogenesis and male infertility, and of over 72 healthy fertile controls was performed. Up to 20 % of infertile males have reduced androgenicity caused by an increase in length of a polymorphic trinucleotide (CAG) repeat segment, encoding a polyglutamine tract, of the androgen receptor. The increased risk of male infertility associated with long CAG lengths is associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer. Conversely, short polyglutamine tracts are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer but a reduced risk of male infertility. Thus depressed spermatogenesis and prostate cancer represent opposite ends of the spectrum of androgen receptor transactivation function.

There was extensive duplication of the basal lamina, lamina densa in both apparently normal spermatogenic tubules and se-verely damaged tubules. Apoptotic peritubular myoid cells were also found. TUNEL labeling confirmed extensive apoptotic cell death in peritubular cells, but revealed apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle. Given that 1) peritubular myoid cell apoptosis occurs in apparently normal tubules, that 2) basal lamina dis-orders are found, and that 3) peritubular cells are lost from the testis, {{it is suggested that}} the primary event in cimetidine-related damage is targeted to testicular smooth muscle cells. This is the first in vivo-administered toxicant to be described that targets myoid cells, resulting in abnormal spermatogenesis. apoptosis, gametogenesis, spermatogenesis, teste...|$|R
40|$|The {{seminal vesicle}} is a male <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organ</b> that {{develops}} from {{segments of the}} Wolffian duct adjacent to the urogenital sinus. It produces most of the seminal plasma in both humans and rodents. To date, very few transcription factors {{have been linked to}} the development and differentiation of seminal vesicles. In this study, we have examined the role of basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) B 8 transcription factor expressed at high levels in the adult seminal vesicle and during seminal gland differentiation. Immunofluorescent studies indicate that BHLHB 8 is expressed within the epithelial layer of the seminal layer of the seminal vesicle following branching morphogenesis but prior to full maturation of cell morphology and function. Analysis of mice that do not express BHLHB 8 (Bhlhb 8 /) indicates no deficiency in the initial development of the seminal vesicle. However, morphological and ultrastructural analysis indicates disruption of the epithelial cellular architecture. The seminal vesicle epithelial layer of 2 -mo-old Bhlhb 8 / mice shows extensive cellular degeneration based on the appearance of reduced microvilli, altered granule size, and dilated endo-plasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The seminal vesicle epithelial cells also degenerate prematurely, as evidenced by disruption of nuclear architecture and significant accumulations of autophagic bodies. These results identify BHLHB 8 as a regulator in establishing and stabilizing the secreting epithelial cells of the seminal vesicle. autophagy, developmental biology, gene regulation, knock-out, male reproductive tract, Mist 1, mouse, seminal vesicles, transcriptio...|$|R
40|$|Testosterone (T) is {{essential}} for spermatogenesis, fertility, and maintenance of the male phenotype. We analyzed in hy-pogonadalLHreceptorknockout (LuRKO) malemicewhether T treatment can restore their phenotype, spermatogenesis, and fertility. In LuRKO mice, spermatogenesis is arrested at round spermatids, adult-type Leydig cells are absent, T pro-duction is dramatically decreased, the animals are cryp-torchid, and their <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> are atrophic. T re-placement therapy from 21 d of life for 60 or 120 d in LuRKO mice induced a male phenotype macroscopically indistin-guishable from that of wild-type littermates as well as full spermatogenesis and testicular descent. Thus, the absence of LH-dependent prepubertal androgen priming is not neces-sary for subsequent maturation of the male phenotype. Con-spicuously, some abnormalities remained in epididymal his...|$|E
40|$|Methods for perfusing rat testis and <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> in situ by {{recirculating}} {{artificial medium}} to the hemicorpus preparation are described. The advantages {{and limitations of}} this system for studying the male reproductive tract were examined. The preparation was then used to study the uptake of androgens into the nuclei of caput epididymis, ventral prostate, seminal vesicle and testis. The accumulation of dihydrotestosterone and accessory sex organ nuclei was saturable and inhibited by perfusion of excess testosterone or cyproterone acetate. By contrast, testosterone was the major nuclear androgen in the testis of mature hypophysectomized preparations perfused with testosterone. In {{all parts of the}} reproductive tract, 3 H-nuclear androgens were associated with 3 S, salt-extractable macromolecules within the properties of androgen receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{specimen}} described {{presents a}} typical intersexual condition, in {{which not only}} the primary sex characters, but also the <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organs</b> and the secondary sex characters are of a mixed type. Both gonads are ovotestes, in which the ovarian {{as well as the}} testicular tissues are morphologically normal, but functionally underdeveloped. Stromal hyperplasia is distinct, especially so in the left gonad; it is probably a functional factor in the generative process of the spermatic tissue. Sex transformation in the intersexual frogs may probably be initiated by an abnormality in sex differentiation or in the genetical constitution of sex, and is only subsequently influenced and modified by environmental action. Absolute dominancy of male sex in the process of sex transformation is questionable. There are indications that in frogs sex transformation may possibly occur in a female direction...|$|E
40|$|The Arrhenuri {{comprise}} the largest genus of the Hydrachnidre, {{and one of}} the most highly differentiated and widely distributed. The genus is easily recognized by the following characters. The thick chitinous covering of the body is pierced by large pores. A circular furrow on the dorsal side marks off an area which is entirely enclosed in the female, in the male usually open onto the posterior extension of the body. The females are oval in form and much alike; the males are smaller and vary greatly from each other and from the females. They are characterized by a posterior prolongation of the body of varying length and complexity called the appendix, at the end of which there is often developed an <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>organ,</b> the petiole. The epimera are in three groups. The capitulum has the form of a shield with a wedge-shaped notch closed by a membrane. The genital cleft in the female is flanked by two large semicircular discs, from each of which extends a Wing-shaped area covered with small acetabula. The male genitat area, at the base of the appendix, has narrow plates forming an elliptical plate for the cleft, from which extend narrow wing-shaped areas. The palpi are short and stout, ending in a pincer formed by the fifth segment and a prolongation from the distal end of the fourth. The legs are relatively short and much alike throughout the genus; the last three pairs have swimming-hairs, and the fourth segment of the fourth leg in the male usually has a spur bearing a bunch of hairs...|$|R
40|$|The atrophy of {{testes and}} <b>sex</b> <b>accessories</b> in adult male rats, {{associated}} with a decrease in pituitary gonadotrophin levels after oestrogen administration, is well established (Greep, 1961; Price & Williams-Ashman, 1961). Since gonadotrophins stimulate androgen production and secretion by the testes, atrophy of the <b>sex</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>organs</b> in oestrogen-treated animals is attributed to diminished testosterone production, secondary to low levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the blood (Moore & Price, 1932). However, {{recent studies have shown}} that oestrogen administration for relatively short periods of time causes a decrease in the <b>sex</b> <b>accessory</b> weights but the serum LH levels remain unchanged (Mallampati & Johnson, 1973; Chowdhury, Tcholakian & Steinberger, 1974). In addition, the oestrogen treatment produce...|$|R
50|$|The genetic sex is {{determined}} by whether a Y bearing or next bearing sperm fertilizes the open; {{the presence or absence}} of a Y chromosome in turn determines whether the gonads of the embryo will be testes or ovaries; and {{the presence or absence of}} testes, finally, determines whether the <b>sex</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>organs</b> and external genitalia will be male or female. This sequence is understandable in light of the fact that both male and female embryos develop within the maternal environment - high in estrogen secreted by the mother’s ovaries and the placenta. If estrogen determined the gender, all embryos would become feminized.|$|R
