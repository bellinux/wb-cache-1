5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{research}} on work-family conflict has examined people working in the paid labor force while simultaneously juggling the roles of paid worker, partner, parent, and homemaker. There is limited research on female graduate students and their experiences of work-family conflict. The goals of the present study were {{to examine the relationship between}} work-family conflict (work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict) <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction,</b> the relationship between work-family conflict <b>and</b> domain-specific <b>satisfactions</b> (family <b>satisfaction</b> <b>and</b> work <b>satisfaction),</b> <b>and</b> the mediators and moderators of these relationships among a sample of female graduate students. Participants included 187 female graduate students. Both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict were hypothesized to be negatively related to domain-specific <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfactions.</b> Work/family conflict self-efficacy and perceived social support were hypothesized to be positively related to domain-specific <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfactions.</b> Neuroticism was hypothesized to be negatively related to domain-specific <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfactions,</b> whereas extraversion was hypothesized to be positively related to domain-specific <b>and</b> global <b>satisfactions.</b> These hypothesized relationships were significant except the positive relationships of extraversion to family, work, <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfactions.</b> It was also predicted that domain-specific satisfactions would mediate the relationships between work-to-family conflict <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>and</b> between family-to-work conflict <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction.</b> Work/family conflict self-efficacy and perceived social support were hypothesized to moderate the relationships between work-to-family conflict <b>and</b> domain-specific <b>satisfactions,</b> <b>and</b> between family-to-work conflict <b>and</b> domain-specific <b>satisfactions.</b> Results suggested family <b>satisfaction</b> <b>and</b> work <b>satisfaction</b> partially mediated the relationships between work-to-family conflict <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>and</b> between family-to-work conflict <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction.</b> Work/family conflict self-efficacy moderated both the relationship between work-to-family conflict <b>and</b> work <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>and</b> between family-to-work conflict <b>and</b> work <b>satisfaction.</b> No other significant moderators were found.

5|$|The general {{atmosphere}} of enrichment <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> {{during the period}} of economic growth in Côte d'Ivoire made it possible for Houphouët-Boigny to maintain and control internal political tensions. His easygoing authoritarian regime, where political prisoners were almost nonexistent, was well accepted by the population. However, the economic crisis that began in the 1980s caused a sharp decline in living conditions for the middle class and underprivileged urban populations. According to the World Bank, the population living below the poverty threshold went from 11% in 1985 to 31% by 1993. Despite the implementation of certain measures, such as the reduction of the number of young French workers (who worked abroad while serving in the military) from 3,000 to 2,000 in 1986, allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates, the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in many companies.|$|E

Goals are identiﬁed through an interview between the therapist and the patient based on past experience. Published reports are provided about the expected outcomes of elbow extension transfers on strength and function of patients with a spinal cord injury. For each goal, the subject rated performance <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> using a 10-point Likert scale, in which 1 was negative (“cannot perform,” “not satisfied”) and 10 was positive (“performs very well,” “very satisfied”).

The subjects of this study were 359 manager and nonmanager employees in Saudi Airline organization. The sampling was selected by means of simple random sampling.

LISREL- 7 procedures (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1983) were used to test the hypotheses and the proposed model. There was substantial lack of fit in the proposed model.

Body comparison partially mediated the relation between mindfulness <b>and</b> body <b>satisfaction.</b> However, a stronger indirect effect was noted in the alternative model, where mindfulness partially mediated the link between body comparison <b>and</b> body <b>satisfaction.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
