5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx.

However, in 1998, a DNA <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America, are not true cheetahs; in fact, they are close relatives of the cougar.|$|E
5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> an {{enlarged}} Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera, including the Delichon house martins, a practice which few authorities follow. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the research showed that if Delichon, Cecropis and Petrochelidon are split from Hirundo, Ptyonoprogne should be also considered as a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in a population of Albertosaurus. Their <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. While this {{could be due to}} preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E
5|$|Impala browse {{as well as}} graze; either may predominate, {{depending}} upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.|$|E
5|$|Post-storm <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that,</b> while less deadly, Dean's {{first and}} more {{powerful}} landfall caused significantly more infrastructural damage than its second. Where the landfall occurred at the town of Majahual specifically, {{and the state of}} Quintana Roo generally, communities took longer to recover than {{in the rest of the}} country. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities and secured Mex$755million (US$74.8million) of aid. Combined with the state's contribution of $270million (US$26.7million), a housing-repair fund of over $1,025million (US$101.5million) was established. In the three months immediately following the storm, over 37,000houses were rebuilt or repaired using monies from this fund.|$|E

5|$|The Arima {{study is}} based on 761 {{municipalities}} located in the Legal Amazon of Brazil, and found that between 2003 and 2008, soybean areas expanded by 39,100km² in the basin's agricultural areas, mainly in Mato Grosso. The model showed that a 10% (3,910km²) reduction of soy in old pasture areas would {{have led to a}} reduction in deforestation of up to 40% (26,039km²) in heavily forested municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon. The <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the displacement of cattle production due to agricultural expansion drives land use change in municipalities located hundreds of kilometers away, and that the Amazonian ILUC is not only measurable but its impact is significant.|$|E
5|$|The age of {{the bones}} at death matched that of Richard when he was killed; they were dated to about the period of his death and were mostly {{consistent}} with physical descriptions of the king. Preliminary DNA <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones matched that of two matrilineal descendants, one 17th-generation and the other 19th-generation, of Richard's sister Anne of York. Taking these findings into account along with other historical, scientific and archaeological evidence, the University of Leicester announced on 4 February 2013 that it had concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the skeleton was that of Richard III.|$|E
5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo, and is {{sometimes}} included within it since the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resemble those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow. However, a DNA <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> if Hirundo is enlarged to contain the crag martins, it should include all the mud-builder genera. Conversely, if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off. The pale crag martin's nearest relatives are {{the other members of the}} genus, the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia, the rock martin P. fuligula of Southern Africa, and the Eurasian crag martin P. rupestris.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{displacement}} along the Imperial Fault {{was very similar}} to that observed for {{the northern part of the}} rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico. This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979. The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings. This <b>analysis</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity, making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys is a genus of rodents in {{the tribe}} Oryzomyini of family Cricetidae.

They may be most closely related to genera like Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys, which contain very similar species. Both species of Transandinomys have had eventful taxonomic histories.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before its release, North American pre-release {{tracking}} estimated that the film would gross between $30$38million, making it the number-one film during its opening weekend. Other tracking showed that up to 17% of North American audiences were reluctant to visit cinemas following the mass shootings in a Colorado cinema in late July 2012, which might affect ticket sales. The Expendables 2 earned $10.5million on its opening day; during its opening weekend, the film earned $28.59million in 3,316 theaters (an average of $8,622 per theater) finishing as the weekend's number-one film. The gross was 18% lower than The Expendables $34.8million opening in 2010. The largest demographic for its opening weekend was male (63%) over age 25 (65%). During its second weekend, the movie held the number-one spot with $13.4million.
