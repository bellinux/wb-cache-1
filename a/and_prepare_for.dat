5|$|Parizeau's {{immediate}} plans {{after the}} referendum relied upon {{what he felt}} would be general pressure from economic markets and the business community in English Canada to stabilize the situation as quickly as possible, which he believed would mitigate any catastrophic initial events (such as blockades) <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus later {{explained}} that it usually took over an hour and half to transition from Miley to Hannah and vice versa on the television series set, while on tour it took approximately two minutes.

5|$|After a busy week {{servicing}} Hubble, {{the crew}} of Atlantis had {{the majority of the}} day off, giving them time to rest <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> landing. They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and {{the crew of}} Atlantis expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the work they do during their long duration stays on the station.|$|E
5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} casualties. Of these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 {{were killed or}} went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces in the area <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties {{are more difficult to}} come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00 on 8 February, {{four days}} after leaving the Îles des Saintes, Junon was spotted passing close to the Virgin Islands by the small British brigs HMS Superieure and , who signalled the {{approaching}} ship to halt <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> boarding. Ignoring the orders from the smaller ships, Rousseau continued northwards, passing through the Virgin Islands closely followed by Superieure, although Asp was unable to keep up and fell far behind during the night. At 08:00 {{on the morning of}} 9 February, with Virgin Gorda northwest, Superieure was close enough to open fire, a few long range shots failing to damage the large frigate, which responded with an ineffective broadside. The gunfire attracted other ships, and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona, under Captain Hugh Pigot.|$|E

In his message he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific. No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the DISCOM was {{deployed}} to Turkey {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom I. The DISCOM simultaneously supported peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and deployed a logistics task force to support Operation Iraqi Freedom I throughout Iraq. In 2004, the DISCOM re{{deployed to}} Southwest Asia in Support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II.

5|$|Little {{progress}} was made the next day as Byng directed that the focus for the day was to simply consolidate the gains made <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> a further movement forward on 23 August. The relative inactivity of 22 August encouraged von Below in {{a belief that the}} attacks of the previous day were a failure. Seeking to take advantage, he arranged for counterattacks to be mounted by the 17th Army, and these resulted in the loss of Dovecot, which overlooked the New Zealand positions. The machine gun battalion of 42nd Division provided key support in driving off the counterattacks which, according to prisoners of war captured during the action, was launched by 52nd Infantry Division, largely made up of men from the Grand Duchy of Baden, which had newly arrived in the sector from Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{lived in}} Durham {{until the age}} of 16, at which point she moved to New York to finish high school <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> college. There she lived with the family of her cousin Maude. The family was passing for white in their white neighborhood. Murray's {{presence}} discomfited Maude's neighbors, however, as Murray was more visibly of partial African descent. She nonetheless was graduated with her second high school diploma and honors in 1927, and was able to enroll at Hunter College for two years.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1914, Shackleton's {{expedition}} ship Endurance left South Georgia for the Weddell Sea, on {{the first}} stage of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. It was making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the Weddell Sea at 77° 49' S, where a shore party was to land <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica. Before it could reach its destination the ship was trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her. During the following eight months she drifted northward until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack's pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 January, a 60-person Marine and Navy SEAL {{security}} detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters to secure the embassy <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> the main evacuation. The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 evacuees. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy. Four waves of five CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January. The evacuees were transported to Muscat, Oman, where they disembarked on 11 January. In total, 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated, including 12 heads of missions (eight ambassadors and four chargés d'affaires).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 July, Vatutin ordered Soviet forces to prevent any further German advance on Prokhorovka, destroy German forces that had {{advanced}} along the northern bank of the Psel River, and stop the III Panzer Corps from making further progress. Orders issued by the German command for 13 July instructed Totenkopf to consolidate its gains of the previous day and then attack into the flank and rear of the Soviet forces around Prokhorovka. Leibstandarte was to strengthen its front line and co-ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with Totenkopfs attack from the northwest. Das Reich was to consolidate and strengthen its front line <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> an offensive operation to link up with the III Panzer Corps.|$|E
5|$|One {{week before}} the eruption, the Palace of Justice siege took place. The assailants (M-19 a Marxist, Terrorist Insurgency group) planned to hold a trial {{involving}} Colombian President Belisario Betancur. He refused to participate and sent the national army into the building. The attackers were holding several hundred hostages, including the 24 Supreme Court justices and 20 other judges. In the ensuing battle between the two forces, more than 75 hostages died (including 11 judges). This disaster, coupled with the Armero tragedy, spurred the Colombian government to predict <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> {{a broad range of}} threats.|$|E

5|$|The Filipino guerrillas were {{successful}} in their resistance against the Japanese occupation. Of the 48 provinces in the Philippines, only 12 were in firm control of the Japanese. Many provinces in Mindanao were already liberated by the Moros way before the Americans came, as well as major islands in the Visayas such as Cebu, Panay and Negros. During the occupation, many Filipino soldiers and guerrillas never lost hope of the United States. Their objective was to both continue {{the fight against the}} Japanese <b>and</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> the return of the Americans. They were instrumental in helping the United States liberate the rest of the islands from the Japanese.|$|E
