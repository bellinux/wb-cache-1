5|$|Spain's loss of Gibraltar {{and other}} Spanish territories in the Mediterranean was resented by the Spanish public and monarchy alike. In 1717 Spanish forces retook Sardinia and in 1718 Sicily, {{both of which}} had been ceded to Austria under the Treaty of Utrecht. The {{effective}} Spanish repudiation of the treaty prompted the British initially to propose handing back Gibraltar in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> and, when that failed, to declare war on Spain. The Spanish gains were quickly reversed, a Spanish expedition to Scotland in 1719 supporting the Jacobites was defeated and peace was eventually restored by the Treaty of The Hague.|$|E

5|$|After being {{occupied}} with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas {{throughout the year}} 970, Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus', moving his troops from Asia to Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment. The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops to effect a landing in the enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E

In July 2003, conditions had become so bad in Honiara that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), consisting of multiple Pacific nations under Australian leadership, was invited into the country by the Solomons Government to restore order. In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying a part of Chinatown and making more than 1,000 Chinese residents homeless.

5|$|Several {{years prior}} to his death, former Prime Minister Rainiharo had led {{military}} campaigns to bring {{the peoples of the}} south under Merina control. Strong military campaigns {{on both sides of the}} conflict had concluded in <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> between the Merina armies and those of the Bara people of the central southern highlands, who were accorded semi-autonomous status in exchange for serving as a buffer between the Sakalava to the west and the Tanala, Antemoro, Antefasy and other ethnic groups to the southeast. Upon learning of Rainiharo's death, disgruntled southeastern factions rose up against the Merina military stationed at posts within their territory. Queen Ranavalona responded by sending Rainivoninahitriniony and Rainilaiarivony on their first military expedition to liberate the besieged Merina colonists and quell the uprising.|$|E
5|$|Since the 11th century, present-day Zimbabwe {{has been}} the site of several {{organised}} states and kingdoms {{as well as a}} major route for migration and trade. The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes first demarcated the present territory during the 1890s; it became the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923. In 1965, the conservative white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia. The state endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces; this culminated in <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> that established universal enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty in April 1980. Zimbabwe then joined the Commonwealth of Nations, which it withdrew from in December 2003.

In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded {{with a series of}} attacks, which killed 18 people.

5|$|The {{catalyst}} for this Norwegian intervention {{may have been}} the extension of Muirchertach's influence into the Irish Sea region following the death of Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095). The region itself appears to have degenerated into chaos following Gofraid's demise, and Magnús seems to have taken it upon himself to reassert Norwegian authority. Magnús made two expeditions into the Irish Sea region. One arrived in 1098; the other in 1102. The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself. Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin, Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement,</b> sealed through the marriage of Magnús' son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Bjaðmunjo herself.|$|E
5|$|The first Byzantine {{encounter}} with Sayf al-Dawla {{took place in}} 936, {{when he tried to}} relieve Samosata, but a revolt at home forced him to turn back. In another invasion in 938, however, he captured the fort of Charpete and defeated Kourkouas's advance guard, seizing a great amount of booty and forcing Kourkouas to withdraw. In the same year, <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed between Constantinople and the Caliphate. The negotiations were facilitated by the rising power of the Hamdanids, which caused anxiety to both sides. Despite the official peace with the Caliphate, ad hoc warfare continued between the Byzantines and the local Muslim rulers, now aided by the Hamdanids. The Byzantines attempted to besiege Theodosiopolis in 939, but the siege was abandoned at the news of the approach of Sayf al-Dawla's relief army.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the {{campaign}} went well, with John outmanoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince Louis and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June. John besieged the castle of Roche-au-Moine, a key stronghold, forcing Louis to give battle against John's larger army. The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with the king; left at something of a disadvantage, John retreated back to La Rochelle. Shortly afterwards, Philip won the hard-fought battle of Bouvines in the north against Otto and John's other allies, bringing an end to John's hopes of retaking Normandy. <b>A</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid the French king compensation; the truce was intended to last for six years.

The last resistance in the Entlebuch valley was broken {{by the end of}} June. After their victory, the city authorities took drastic punitive measures. The Huttwil League and the peace of the Murifeld were declared null and void by the city council of Bern. Many exponents of the insurrection were captured, tortured, and finally received heavy sentences. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered in Bern on September 6, 1653.|$|E
5|$|This town {{fell into}} the hands of the British in 1781 after the two naval battles between British and French fleets were fought off the coast of Negapatam, as it was then known: the first in 1758 as part of the Seven Years' War and the second in 1782 as part of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The town was taken by the British from the Dutch in 1781 (who had been {{formally}} brought into the war in 1780). When the Dutch and British reached <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> in 1784, Nagapattinam was formally ceded to the British. 277 villages, with Nagore as the headquarters, were handed over to the East India Company.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{communist}} groups existed in Sarawak, {{the first of}} which, the Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League, formed in 1951. Another group, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) (also known as Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) by government sources) was formally set up in 1970. Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok {{were two of the}} more notable communist leaders involved in the insurgency. As the political scene changed, it grew progressively more difficult for the communists to operate. This led to Bong opening talks with chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub in 1973 and eventually signing an agreement with the government. Weng, who had moved to China in the mid-1960s but nonetheless retained control of the CCO, pushed for a continued armed insurrection against the government in spite of this agreement. The conflict continued mostly in the Rajang Delta region but eventually ended when, on 17 October 1990, the NKCP signed <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Sarawak government.|$|E

5|$|In January 2001, Kabila {{was shot}} dead inside his palace. The Congolese {{government}} claimed Kabila {{had been killed by}} a rogue bodyguard, who was himself killed at the scene. According to a report published in French newspaper Le Monde, Kabila was killed by the kadogo, an army of child soldiers he was known to have assembled during the First Congo War. The kadogo had suffered badly during the battles in Kasai and Katanga, were poorly paid, and had become alienated by Kabila. Kabila's son Joseph was appointed president and immediately began asserting his authority by dismissing his father's cabinet and senior army commanders, assembling a new government, and engaging with the international community.

5|$|The {{defeated}} Scots {{appealed to}} Pope Boniface VIII to assert {{a claim of}} overlordship to Scotland in place of the English.

In 1303, <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> was reached between England and France, effectively breaking up the Franco-Scottish alliance. Robert the Bruce, the grandson of the claimant to the crown in 1291, had sided with the English in the winter of 1301–02. By 1304, most of the other nobles of the country had also pledged their allegiance to Edward, and this year the English also managed to re-take Stirling Castle. A great propaganda victory was achieved in 1305 when Wallace was betrayed by Sir John de Menteith and turned over to the English, who had him taken to London where he was publicly executed. With Scotland largely under English control, Edwardinstalled Englishmen and collaborating Scots to govern the country.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{continued}} periodically {{for almost}} three decades, until in 1749 when Spanish settlers and the Lipan Apache peoples made peace. But the treaty angered the enemies of the Apache, and resulted in raids on Spanish settlements by the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes. Fear of Indian attacks and the remoteness of the area {{from the rest of}} the Viceroyalty discouraged settlers from moving to Texas. It remained one of the least-populated by immigrants provinces. The threat of attacks did not decrease until 1785, when Spain and the Comanche peoples made <b>a</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement.</b> The Comanche tribe later assisted in defeating the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes, who had continued to cause difficulties for settlers. An increase in the number of missions in the province allowed for a peaceful Indian reductions of other tribes, and by the end of the 18th century, only a few of the nomadic hunting and gathering tribes in the area had not been converted.|$|E
