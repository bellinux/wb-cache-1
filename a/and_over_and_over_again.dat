500|$|In 1945, Tracy {{returned}} to {{the stage for the}} first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a stay in hospital—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, [...] "I'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act." [...] The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: [...] "In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: [...] "I couldn't say those goddamn lines over <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> every night... At least every day is a new day for me in films... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again." ...|$|E

Anselmo commented on the YouTube video, writing: In an interview with Eddie Trunk on Sirius XM on December 15, 2016, Anselmo claimed he was being taunted throughout the show by [...] "two or three little hecklers" [...] who were standing near the stage. He stated that the hecklers called him all sorts of names throughout the show, {{and by the end}} he said he'd lost his patience.

The data show that these patterns follow typical paths of change, such as a movement towards more abstract meanings (metaphorization; <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> increasingly referring to repetition rather than to physical motion), lexicaliza- tion (e. g. up and up being used as a noun with idiosyncratic meaning in on the up and up), subjectification (e. g. on and on expressing negative connotations), iconic variation (again and again and again referring to multiple repetitions), simplification (loss of again after <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over),</b> <b>and</b> the development of dis- course functions (and on and on meaning “and so on”...|$|R

2500|$|In {{a heated}} Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling [...] "a {{flat-out}} lie" [...] over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. [...] "What {{we just saw}} today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> was a simple lie", Cruz said of Senate Republican Leader McConnell. Cruz's [...] "incendiary outburst" [...] was [...] "unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the [...] "Republican majority {{in both houses of}} Congresses" [...] for what Cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record. Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with John McCain saying that the speech was [...] "outside the realm of Senate behavior" [...] and [...] "a very wrong thing to do". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: [...] "I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie." [...] Cruz had alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill, whereas McConnell denied there was any [...] "deal", and that denial is what Cruz termed a [...] "lie"; Hatch says McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.|$|E

2500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} of Keck's {{involvement in the}} campaign, Brownback spokesman Paul Milburn commented that it was legal to use taxpayer-paid staff to campaign, responding directly [...] to the controversy, saying, [...] "Paul Davis must have {{spent too much time}} in VIP rooms at strip clubs back in law school...", because he [...] "... should know full well that the law allows personal staff of the governor’s office to work on campaign issues." [...] In Kansas, however, getting records about crimes that law enforcement has investigated is typically difficult. The Legislature closed those records to the public over three decades earlier: If members of the public desire incident reports and investigative files, they normally have to sue to obtain them, cases sometimes costing $25,000 or more. Media law experts were amazed after learning Montgomery County's sheriff released non-public investigative files from 1998 with just a records request. “That is unusual,” said Mike Merriam, media lawyer for the Kansas Press Association. “They have denied releasing records routinely <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again.” Brownback's campaign capitalized on the 16-year-old incident.|$|R

According to Hanneman: [...] "We still enjoy playing these songs live. We play these songs <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> but they're good songs, intense songs! If it were melodic songs or some kind of boring 'clap your hands' song, you'd be going crazy playing those every night. But our songs are just bam-bam-bam-bam, they're intense." [...] The band was on stage for 70 minutes, which only allowed seven or eight {{additional}} songs to be played following the album's play. King stated this arrangement [...] "alienates too many people". In the Unholy Alliance Tour of 2004, however, the album was played in its entirety during Slayer's set as the last ten songs to end the show. The album was performed live at the I'll Be Your Mirror London festival in May 2012. In May 2014, it was announced that Slayer would perform the album in its entirety at Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver.|$|R
