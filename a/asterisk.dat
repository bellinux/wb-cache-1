5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an <b>asterisk.</b> The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions.

5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{opponent of}} the Theses was Johann Eck, Luther's friend and a theologian at the University of Ingolstadt.

Luther responded privately with the Asterisks, titled after the <b>asterisk</b> marks then used to highlight important texts.

Ichiro finished the season with 262hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at Safeco Field.
