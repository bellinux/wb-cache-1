5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as <b>a</b> <b>cloak,</b> the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with a mustache and short beard, wearing <b>a</b> <b>cloak</b> and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{actually}} made her debut in 1909 in Potter's The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies where she rescued the six children of Benjamin and Flopsy Bunny from Mr. McGregor's grasp and was rewarded for her heroism with {{a quantity of}} rabbit wool at Christmas. In the last illustration, she is wearing <b>a</b> <b>cloak</b> and hood, and a muff and mittens fashioned from the wool. Mrs. Tittlemouse is a key (not a central) character in the tale, but a character incompletely personified, and one whose story Potter chose to develop in 1910.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>cloaking</b> {{device is}} <b>a</b> {{theoretical}} or fictional stealth technology {{that can cause}} objects, such as spaceships or individuals, to be partially or wholly invisible to parts of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.

25|$|A 12th century {{depiction}} of <b>a</b> <b>cloaked</b> but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears {{on a wall}} in the Schleswig Cathedral in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Beside her is similarly <b>a</b> <b>cloaked</b> yet otherwise nude woman riding a distaff. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.|$|R
5|$|On special occasions, such as Uposatha day, {{an orange}} stole is placed around its {{shoulders}} by the presiding monk and is fanned. A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals; some men {{sit in the}} front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer. Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed. During the winter season, the image is covered by <b>a</b> <b>cloak</b> of the monastic order.|$|E
5|$|The {{final scene}} {{is the story}} of Noah's drunkenness. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines. He is shown doing so, in the {{background}} of the picture. He becomes drunk and inadvertently exposes himself. His youngest son, Ham, brings his two brothers Shem and Japheth to see the sight but they discreetly cover their father with <b>a</b> <b>cloak.</b> Ham is later cursed by Noah and told that the descendants of Ham's son Canaan will serve Shem and Japheth's descendants forever. Taken together, these three pictures serve to show that Humankind had moved a long way from God's perfect creation. However, it is through Shem and his descendants, the Israelites, that Salvation will come to the world.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating <b>a</b> <b>cloak</b> and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E

5|$|Mr. McGregor {{does not}} notice the substitution, and carries the sack home, {{continually}} counting the six rabbits. His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} sack and feels the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, very, angry. Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself <b>a</b> <b>cloak</b> and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can only}} carry {{a limited number}} of weapons since the {{inventory}} features a 4-slot system in which single hand held pistols usually take a weapon slot whereas heavy weapons like sniper rifles or rocket launchers can take up to three weapon slots. The player's movement speed is also altered by the weight of the weapon the player is currently holding. Besides the primary function, all of the weapons in Perfect Dark Zero have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities. For example, the Shockwave Rifle features an X-ray function which allows the player to see enemies through walls, while the Plasma Rifle has <b>a</b> <b>cloak</b> function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at cost of its batteries. Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions. For instance, the Laptop Gun can be deployed as a sentry gun, while the SuperDragon assault rifle can launch bouncing grenades.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes <b>a</b> <b>cloak</b> for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the invisibility cloaking in acoustic wave scattering from a new perspective. We are especially interested in achieving the invisibility cloaking by completely regular and isotropic mediums. It is shown that an interior transmission eigenvalue problem arises in our study, which is the one considered theoretically in CCH. Based on such an observation, we propose <b>a</b> <b>cloaking</b> scheme that takes a three-layer structure including <b>a</b> <b>cloaked</b> region, <b>a</b> lossy layer and <b>a</b> <b>cloaking</b> shell. The target medium in the cloaked region can be arbitrary but regular, whereas the mediums in the lossy layer and the cloaking shell are both regular and isotropic. We establish that if a certain non-transparency condition is satisfied, then there exists an infinite set of incident waves such that the cloaking device is nearly-invisible under the corresponding wave interrogation. The set of waves is generated from the Herglotz-approximation of the associated interior transmission eigenfunctions. We provide both theoretical and numerical justifications.
