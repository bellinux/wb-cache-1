50|$|In 1958, Walter Hengst {{founded the}} company Ing. Walter Hengst KG in Münster. In 1977, Günter Röttgering, the {{son-in-law}} of Walter Hengst, joined the company, later becoming his successor, {{as a result}} of which the company was rebranded as Ing. Walter Hengst GmbH & Co. KG.Following the introduction of the first service-friendly cup oil filters with <b>automatic</b> <b>drain</b> system and plastic screw cap in 1988, the filter plant Hengst Filterwerke Berlin GmbH & Co. KG was founded in Berlin in 1990. In 1992, Walter Hengst’s daughter, Wera Röttgering, founded the national registered association Herzenswünsche e. V. (Heart’s Desires).In 1993, Hengst launched the environmentally-friendly ENGERGETIC® filter system, which was the first metal-free filter insert. In 1995, the first cup oil filter with an integrated centrifuge was introduced, followed by the first fluid management module in 1996. In 1997, a highly efficient oil mist separator system (cyclones for Otto and diesel engines) was introduced.|$|E
5000|$|Weir skimmers {{function}} {{by allowing}} the oil floating {{on the surface of}} the water to flow over a weir. There are two main types of weir skimmer, those that require the weir height to be manually adjusted and those where the weir height is automatic or self-adjusting. Whilst manually adjusted weir skimmer types can have a lower initial cost, the requirement for regular manual adjustment makes self-adjusting weir types more popular in most applications. Weir skimmers will collect water if operating when oil is no longer present. To overcome this limitation most weir type skimmers contain an <b>automatic</b> water <b>drain</b> on the oil collection tank[...]|$|R

5000|$|Unfiltered {{compressed}} air frequently contains dust, oil, rust, moisture and other harmful substances, and therefore requires filtration. In {{the first stage}} of filtration, the {{compressed air}} passes through a tube-shaped mesh filter, which creates a [...] coalescence effect. Here bigger particles are adsorbed on the filter and the water will condense into larger droplets, which can then pass into the separation chamber. The compressed air is slowed down, which makes the particles condense on a honeycomb-like pad, allowing the water droplets to travel {{to the bottom of the}} drainage system and through an <b>automatic</b> or electric <b>drain</b> valve to the discharge. In the first filtration stage more than 95% of the water droplets, oil and large particles are removed. This practice is most common for removing water, but is also used for removing oil.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the work is {{radiation}} protection at a nuclear medicine workplace with a bed section in connection with the therapy of thyroid gland diseases using radioisotope 131 I. In the theoretical part, the work briefly deals with the anatomy and pathology of the thyroid gland and ways of therapy, and outlines the basic characteristics of radioisotope 131 I and history of nuclear medicine and radiation protection. In the practical part, there is a verification of the efficiency of radiation protection when handling liquid waste and a verification of the correlation of the activity of liquid waste with the activity of radiopharmaceutical administered. The malignant tumours of the thyroid gland constitute 0, 5 ? 1 % of all tumoral diseases. Some types of this tumour, which are histologically differentiated, retain the capability of extracting iodine from blood and are thus suitable for being treated using iodine radioisitope. That's why these types of tumour are treated most frequently at nuclear medicine departments. The basis of therapy is the surgical removal of tumoral tissue, usually of the whole thyroid gland, and administration of radioisotope 131 I. When treating the thyroid gland, the patient is always hospitalized at a nuclear medicine department with a bed section. Radioisotope 131 I is mixed ? and ? emitter and after being administred to a patient, it is the source of radiation danger for hospital personnel, possibly for others individuals. At the same time it is excreted from the organism by urine, stool and sweat. On that score due attention must be paid to safety measures. In view of the magnitude of this problem and the emphasis that is currently laid to protection against ionizing radiation, I chose this issue as a subject of my bachelor's work. The goal of the practical part of the work was to verify whether the limits set by Decree No. 307 / 2002 Coll., as amended by Decree No. 499 / 2005 Coll. on radiation protection were observed under the current system of handling liquid waste in the bed section of the Nuclear Medicine Department of the České Budějovice Hospital. Two hypotheses were set: Operation regulations and current programme equipment of the technical installations for the <b>automatic</b> <b>draining</b> of waste water from the bed section of the Nuclear Medicine Department are sufficient for the limits set by Decree not being exceeded; the other hypothesis assumes that the values of the volume activity of waste water in the drainage tank of the hospital's sewage plant conform to the activity of a radiopharmaceutical administered to patients treated at the Nuclear Medicine Department of the České Budějovice Hospital. For the purposes of this work, the activity of waste in the drainage tank of the hospital's sewage plant was measured with a well detector once a week for a period of two month to verify that the activity does not exceed a release level of 455 Bql- 1 set in an addendum to Decree No. 307 / 2002 Coll. It was ascertained by measuring that the average activity of waste in the watched period was 279, 8 Bql- 1, the highest activity measured on March 18, 2013 being 373 Bql- 1. In the watched period, the release activity set by the law was not exceeded in any week. At the same time, the correlation of the values of radioactivity administered with the radioactivity of waste water was proved. Consequently, both hypotheses of the work were proved. The work proved that the limits set by Decree No. 307 / 2002 Coll., as amended by Decree No. 499 / 2005 Coll. on radiation protection, were observed under the current system of handling liquid waste in the bed section of the Nuclear Medicine Department of the České Budějovice Hospital...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{water and}} {{groundwater}} (SW-GW) interaction {{plays a key}} role in replenishing alluvial aquifers and sustaining the ecology, quality, and quantity of streams and rivers. The interaction, mainly through the hyporheic zone (HZ), also plays a role in the nutrient exchange between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Hyporheic water exchange in many sandy coastal plain drains presents an intermittent hydrological regime, as often shifts occur in their hydraulic functioning from a losing to a gaining stream condition upon the position of the surrounding water table. This work documented the existence and the complex hydrodynamics of HZ water exchange in an artificial drain typical of a coastal plain area (Mayfield drain, Harvey River) in Western Australia (WA), which resulted from a combination of highly responsive water level regime in the drain and a seasonal-transient shallow water table developed in a duplex soil (sand over clay) setting. A novel hydrometric approach using a rugged field camera (water levels on the <b>drain),</b> <b>automatic</b> water level sensors (bores), and a set of temperature sensors (drain?s bed and bank) provided a robust data set to explore vertical water exchange (fluxes) under baseflow and storm event conditions for different hydraulic scenarios (water stages for drain and water table) across the wet season. Water fluxes and direction in the HZ were computed using the one dimensional (1 D) heat transport model for pore water (VFLUX) from temperature data, and further verified by a standard hydraulic approach using Darcy?s law and hydrometric data. The results indicated that under baseflow conditions, vertical water flux estimates were directed downwards, of drain water into a shallow sandy layer (< 0. 4 m), but with an upward flux from the underneath clay layer (0. 4 - 0. 7 m). The magnitude and temporal variability of the fluxes corresponded with the drain water stage as increasing downward fluxes due to higher drain stage resulted in decreasing upward fluxes from the clay layer. During storm event conditions, a similar water exchange direction was observed but a substantial increase in the downward flux (by an order of magnitude) of drain water occurred without any change on the upward flux. This dynamics showed a dependency on both mean drain storm water stage and the duration of high flow conditions. These results and the observations of high water table level at the bank indicated that the excess of water into the HZ was mainly mobilized to downstream locations along the drain bed. Further analysis of the gaining and losing water condition over a 620 m drain reach, using flow measurements and water quality surveys, supported VFLUX results. This work identified the presence of a shallow HZ confined vertically by a clay layer (typical feature of duplex soils in the area) and laterally by a high water table in the bank, under both baseflow and stormflow conditions present in the drain. The findings also highlighted the importance of flux estimation using thermal records to complement traditional hydraulic approaches due to lack of conclusive results provided by the latter...|$|R
