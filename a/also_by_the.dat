5|$|Yttrium in the Solar System {{was created}} through stellar nucleosynthesis, mostly by the s-process (≈72%), but <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> r-process (≈28%). The r-process {{consists}} of rapid neutron capture of lighter elements during supernova explosions. The s-process {{is a slow}} neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars.|$|E
5|$|A {{visually}} striking {{effect is}} seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade {{of the northern}} stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season. The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> central axis of Castillo at Tulum.. The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, {{and it has been}} shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E

5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Doom was {{announced}} as Doom 4 in 2008, but underwent an extensive development cycle with different builds and designs before being restarted in 2011, and revealed as simply Doom in 2014.

5|$|During in-game cutscenes, the polygon {{count is}} {{increased}} to nearly 2,500 polygons, especially on character faces. Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch. Claire {{was given a}} tougher appearance in Code: Veronica than in Resident Evil 2, the reason being her experiences in Resident Evil 2 built her toughness and confidence to handle any situation. This characterization is emphasized by her ability to dual wield sub-machine guns, and <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described Code: Veronica as 50-60% of his perfect vision for Resident Evil in February 2001, and he cited that future Resident Evil projects may make up the other half.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{nutritional}} {{significance of these}} components is defined not only by their structure or macronutrient category, but <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> physiological role that each nutrient serves. As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, {{and elsewhere in the}} body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated.|$|E

Preckwinkle {{was endorsed by}} then state Rep.

5|$|Initially, the {{military}} potential of pigeon photography for aerial reconnaissance appeared attractive. Battlefield tests in World War I provided encouraging results, but the ancillary technology of mobile dovecotes for messenger pigeons {{had the greatest}} impact. Owing to the rapid perfection of aviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography faded and Neubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss clockmaker, and reportedly <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German and French militaries. Although war pigeons were deployed extensively during World War II, it is unclear to what extent, if any, birds were involved in aerial reconnaissance. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later developed a battery-powered camera designed for espionage pigeon photography; details of its use remain classified.|$|E

5|$|Native ponies {{existed in}} Wales before 1600 BC, and a Welsh-type cob {{was known as}} early as the Middle Ages. They were {{influenced}} by the Arabian horse, and possibly <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Thoroughbred and the Hackney horse. In 1901, the first stud book for the Welsh breeds was established in the United Kingdom, and in 1907 another registry was established in the United States. Interest in the breed declined during the Great Depression, but revived in the 1950s. Throughout their history, the Welsh breeds have had many uses, including as a cavalry horse, a pit pony, and as a working animal on farms.|$|E
5|$|Next in the line, to the north, was Quinn's Post, {{defended by}} the 15th Battalion and the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. For {{some time after}} the start of the Turkish attack, the Turks {{opposite}} Quinn's just threw hand grenades at the post. Around 03:30 the Turks' machine-guns and rifles opened fire at the Australians. This lasted for about an hour when the Turks went over the top and assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped by the weight of the Australian fire, not only from the trench they were attacking, but <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E
5|$|Osorkon IV is attested by Assyrian {{documents}} (as Shilkanni {{and other}} epithets) and probably <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Books of Kings (as King So), while Manetho's epitomes {{seem to have}} ignored him. He is undoubtedly attested by the well-known Victory Stela of Piye on which he is depicted while prostrating {{in front of the}} owner of the stela along with other submitted rulers. Another finding almost certainly referring to him is the aforementioned aegis of Sekhmet, found at Bubastis and mentioning a King Osorkon son of queen Tadibast whoas the name does not coincide with those of any of the other Osorkon kings' motherscan only be Osorkon IV's mother.|$|E
