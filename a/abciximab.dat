Platelet activation by ADP (blocked by clopidogrel) leads to the aforementioned conformational change in platelet gpIIb/IIIa receptors that induces binding to fibrinogen.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{ability of}} <b>abciximab</b> to prevent {{fibrinogen}} binding to activated platelets indicates {{it may also}} promote dissolution of platelet-rich thrombi. The present study examined the capacity of <b>abciximab</b> to reverse platelet aggregation in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were performed on blood from healthy non-medicated donors. Platelet aggregate formation and disaggregation were monitored turbidimetrically. Platelet-bound fibrinogen was measured by flow cytometry. For disaggregation studies, platelets were first stimulated with either ADP or the 11 -mer thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP), then varying amounts of <b>abciximab</b> were added at periodic intervals after agonist addition. Platelet disaggregation was detected by comparing the extent of light transmittance at 4 min after addition of either <b>abciximab</b> or saline to PRP. ATP release was simultaneously monitored by chemi-luminescence. When added 1 min after low concentrations of ADP, <b>abciximab</b> rapidly (andlt; 1 min) dispersed platelet aggregates in a dose-dependent manner, with complete disaggregation observed with 6. 25 microg/mL of the beta 3 antagonist. In contrast, equivalent concentrations of <b>abciximab</b> did not induce appreciable disaggregation to platelets stimulated with TRAP (10 microM). Platelet counts of samples that had undergone complete disaggregation, as assessed by aggregometry, were equivalent to baseline, indicating dispersal of aggregates to single cells. Concentrations of <b>abciximab</b> that produced complete disaggregation induced partial displacement of platelet-bound fibrinogen (52 +/- 8 % inhibition of fibrinogen binding at 12. 5 microg/ml <b>abciximab).</b> The disaggregation effectiveness of <b>abciximab</b> decreased as the time between ADP and subsequent <b>abciximab</b> addition widened, and {{as the amount of}} both dense granule release and agonist stimulation increased. However, pre-treatment of platelets with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) did not potentiate platelet disaggregation induced by <b>abciximab.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that <b>abciximab</b> facilitates the dispersal of newly formed platelet aggregates in vitro, by partially displacing fibrinogen from activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors. In vivo, <b>abciximab</b> may destabilize coronary thrombi by preventing aggregate formation and dispersing mural thrombi...|$|E

Intracoronary (IC) <b>abciximab</b> bolus administration results in high local drug concentrations and hence it should have higher antiplatelet effect. In this study, we assess the short-term efficacy and safety of IC compared to IV bolus of <b>abciximab</b> in ACS patients during pPCI.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether <b>abciximab</b> use among patients undergoing PCI is {{associated with an increased}} risk of stroke. DESIGN: Combined analysis of data from 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials (EPIC, CAPTURE, EPILOG, and EPISTENT) conducted between November 1991 and October 1997 at a total of 257 academic and community hospitals in the United States and Europe. PATIENTS: A total of 8555 patients undergoing PCI with or without stent deployment for a variety of indications were randomly assigned to receive a bolus and infusion of <b>abciximab</b> (n = 5476) or matching placebo (n = 3079). One treatment group in EPIC received a bolus of <b>abciximab</b> only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke within 30 days of treatment among <b>abciximab</b> and placebo groups. RESULTS: No significant difference in stroke rate was observed between patients assigned <b>abciximab</b> (n = 22 [0. 40 %]) and those assigned placebo (n = 9 [0. 29 %]; P =. 46). Excluding the EPIC <b>abciximab</b> bolus-only group, there were 9 strokes (0. 30 %) among 3023 patients who received placebo and 15 (0. 32 %) in 4680 patients treated with <b>abciximab</b> bolus plus infusion, a difference of 0. 02 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], - 0. 23 % to 0. 28 %).

We also intended {{to assess the impact}} of <b>abciximab</b> on clinical outcome in this setting. BACKGROUNDIt is unclear whether <b>abciximab</b> reduces neointima formation after stenting. Such an effect may be particularly prominent in thrombus-containing lesions. METHODSPatients undergoing stenting within 48 h after onset of AMI were randomly assigned to receive either standard-dose heparin or <b>abciximab</b> plus reduced-dose heparin. Of 401 patients randomized, 366 without 30 -day adverse events were eligible for six-month angiographic follow-up. Scheduled angiography was performed in 80 % of these patients. RESULTSBy 30 days, the composite clinical end point of death, reinfarction, and target lesion revascularization (TLR) was reached in 5. 0 % of the <b>abciximab</b> group and in 10. 5 % of the control group (p = 0. 038). At one year, absolute reduction in the composite clinical end point by <b>abciximab</b> was still 5. 7 % but had lost its statistical significance.

ResultsAt 1 year, the rate of MACCE was lower in the SES arm (16. 5 % vs. 25. 8 %, p = 0. 001), mainly driven by less repeat revascularization (9. 8 % vs. 16. 8 %; p = 0. 003) and without influencing the cumulative incidence of death and MI (5. 2 % vs. 5. 8 %; p = 0. 68). At 30 days, the rate of the composite of death, target vessel MI, TVR, and bleeding was lower in the <b>abciximab</b> arm (8. 2 % vs. 12. 4 %, p = 0. 04), mainly driven by less TVR due to less stent thrombosis (1. 2 % vs. 7. 4 %, p < 0. 001). However, bleeding complications occurred more frequently in the <b>abciximab</b> group (5. 7 % vs. 2. 8 %, p = 0. 03). ConclusionsPrimary PCI with SES reduces adverse events at 1 year, mainly by reduction of repeat revascularization, whereas <b>abciximab</b> reduces early stent thrombosis, at the expense of more bleeding complications.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the efficacy and safety of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (GP IIb/IIIa) blockade with <b>abciximab</b> in women undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. BACKGROUNDAlthough gender differences in response to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockade have been described, {{there have been no}} large clinical studies to assess these differences. METHODSOutcomes were determined using meta-analysis technique. RESULTSIn the pooled analysis, the primary end point of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or urgent revascularization within 30 days was reduced from 11. 3 % to 5. 8 % (p < 0. 001) in men and from 12. 7 % to 6. 5 % (p < 0. 001) in women treated with <b>abciximab.</b> At six months, death, MI or urgent revascularization was reduced from 14. 1 % to 8. 3 % (p < 0. 001) in men and 16. 0 % to 9. 9 % (p < 0. 001) in women receiving <b>abciximab.</b> At one year, mortality was reduced from 2. 7 % to 1. 9 % (p = 0. 06) in men and 4. 0 % to 2. 5 % (p = 0. 03) in women treated with <b>abciximab.</b> Major bleeding events occurred in 2. 9 % versus 3. 0 % (p = 0. 96) of women and 2. 7 % versus 1. 3 % (p = 0. 003) of men treated with placebo versus <b>abciximab,</b> respectively. Minor bleeding events occurred in 4. 7 % versus 6. 7 % (p = 0. 01) of women and 2. 3 % versus 2. 2 % (p = 0. 94) of men treated with placebo versus <b>abciximab,</b> respectively. CONCLUSIONSThis pooled analysis demonstrated no gender difference in protection from major adverse outcomes with GP IIb/IIIa inhibition with <b>abciximab.</b> Although women had higher rates of both major and minor bleeding events with <b>abciximab</b> compared with men, major bleeding in women was similar with and without <b>abciximab.</b> There was a small increased risk of minor bleeding with <b>abciximab</b> in women...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Percutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is {{a highly}} effective therapy for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Adjunctive therapy with platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor can result in increased vessel patency and improved outcomes in ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing PCI. The investigation of novel dosing and delivery strategies of this therapy may help to further improve outcomes. METHODS: IC-Clearly is a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial, {{with the purpose of}} evaluating the effectiveness of an intracoronary bolus dose of <b>abciximab</b> delivered using the ClearWay RX catheter vs. an intravenous bolus of <b>abciximab</b> for ST-elevation myocardial infarction with angiographically visible thrombus (thrombus grade >or= 2). A total of 150 patients will be randomized 1 : 1 to treatment of the culprit artery with intracoronary <b>abciximab</b> (75 patients) or intravenous <b>abciximab</b> (75 patients) in addition to a maintenance infusion regimen of <b>abciximab</b> administered intravenously for 12 h after PCI. The number of patients included in this study is based on the estimation of sample size needed to identify a statistically significant difference in the primary endpoints between the two groups. The primary endpoint chosen to evaluate this hypothesis is infarct size assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance. Clinical outcomes will be assessed for each patient through hospital discharge and at 30 -day follow-up. CONCLUSION: The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate whether an intracoronary bolus of <b>abciximab</b> delivered with the ClearWay RX catheter prior to the 12 h post-PCI intravenous infusion regimen of <b>abciximab</b> will result in significant additional clot resolution in vivo and improved myocardial perfusion when compared with an intravenous bolus of <b>abciximab</b> on top of the 12 h post-PCI intravenous infusion regimen of <b>abciximab</b> as per standard practice. The primary endpoint chosen to evaluate this hypothesis is infarct size as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate long-term effects of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor <b>abciximab</b> in patients with acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation who were not scheduled for coronary intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 7800 patients were included with an acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation, documented by either elevated cardiac troponin or transient or persistent ST-segment depression. They were randomized to <b>abciximab</b> bolus and 24 -hour infusion, <b>abciximab</b> bolus and 48 -hour infusion, or matching placebo. The overall 1 -year mortality rate was 8. 3 % (649 patients). One-year mortality was 7. 8 % in the placebo group and 8. 2 % in the 24 -hour and 9. 0 % in the 48 -hour <b>abciximab</b> infusion group. Compared with placebo, the hazard ratio for the 24 -hour infusion of <b>abciximab</b> was 1. 1 (95 % CI 0. 86 to 1. 29), and for the 48 -hour infusion, it was 1. 2 (95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 41). The lack of benefit of <b>abciximab</b> was observed in every subgroup studied. Patients with negative troponin or elevated C-reactive protein had a higher mortality rate after treatment with <b>abciximab</b> for 48 hours than with placebo: 8. 5 % versus 5. 8 % in those with negative troponin (P= 0. 02), 16. 3 % versus 12. 1 % in those with elevated C-reactive protein (P= 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, <b>abciximab</b> did not provide any survival benefit at 1 year in patients admitted with an acute coronary syndrome with ST depression and/or elevated troponin who were not scheduled to undergo early coronary revascularization. In subgroups of patients, in particular those with low cardiac troponin or elevated C-reactive protein, <b>abciximab</b> was associated with excess mortality...|$|E
