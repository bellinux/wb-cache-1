6000|$|... [94] As by far {{the larger}} portion of the denuded matter of the globe passes to the sea through {{comparatively}} few great rivers, the deposits must often be confined to very limited areas. Thus the denudation of the vast Mississippi basin must be almost all deposited in a limited portion of the Gulf of Mexico, that of the Nile within a small area of the Eastern Mediterranean, {{and that of the}} great rivers of China--the Hoang Ho and Yang-tse-kiang, in {{a small portion of the}} Eastern Sea. Enormous lengths of coast, like those of Western America and Eastern Africa, receive very scanty deposits; so that thirty miles in width along the whole of the coasts of the globe will probably give an area greater than that of the area of <b>average</b> <b>deposit,</b> and certainly greater than that of maximum deposit, which is the basis on which I have here made my estimates. In the case of the Mississippi, it is stated by Count Pourtales that along the plateau between the mouth of the river and the southern extremity of Florida for two hundred and fifty miles in width the bottom consists of clay with some sand and but few Rhizopods; but beyond this distance the soundings brought up either Rhizopod shells alone, or these mixed with coral sand, Nullipores, and other calcareous organisms (Dana's Manual of Geology, 2nd Ed. p. 671). It is probable, therefore, that a large proportion of the entire mass of sediment brought down by the Mississippi is deposited on the limited area above indicated.|$|E

Nevertheless, the average size of these deposits is far greater than the average volcanic type.|$|E

It is important to notice that the implicit interest rates have been widely employed in the literature on market discipline due to data limitations; it is complicated to find data directly describing the interest rate on deposits. To evaluate the performance of IIRDE, I compare it with the 28  days CETES (Mexican Federal Treasury Certificates).|$|R

50|$|The most {{straightforward}} way {{to quantify}} fairly uniform fouling is by stating the <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> surface loading, i.e., kg of deposit per m² of surface area. The fouling rate {{will then be}} expressed in kg/m²s, and it is obtained by dividing the deposit surface loading by the effective operating time. The normalized fouling rate (also in kg/m²s) will additionally account for the concentration of the foulant in the process fluid (kg/kg) during preceding operations, and is useful for comparison of fouling rates between different systems. It is obtained by dividing the fouling rate by the foulant concentration. The fouling rate constant (m/s) {{can be obtained by}} dividing the normalized fouling rate by the mass density of the process fluid (kg/m³).|$|E
50|$|Three years later, {{volcanic}} activity started on May 29, 1995, which {{marked the beginning}} of the first phase of this eruption. Small, phreatic eruptions occurred frequently during this phase, averaging 100-160 explosions per day. These Strombolian eruptions generated convective ash columns that reached heights of 200-1000 meters, and these explosions lasted for a period of 79 days. A low-energy pyroclastic flow was observed on the northwestern flank on June 2. After June 6, the number of eruptions decreased gradually at a rate of 30-40 eruptions per day. By July 19, all {{volcanic activity}} ceased for a period of 95 days. By mid-November, the hiatus ended and the second phase commenced. Eruptions continued for a period of thirteen days and lasted until December 3, 1995. During this time, the eruptions were larger, and volcanic bombs and blocks up to two meters in diameter were ejected from Cerro Negro. Ash columns achieve heights of 2 to 2.5 meters While the VEI was only measured as a 2, central vent explosions, pyroclastic flows, phreatic explosions, and lava dome extrusion were all characteristic of this eruption period. New lava filled about 2/3 of the 1992 crater, and additional lava flows caused damage to land, extending 1.5 km north of the north base cone. Ash falls caused damage to property and farmland, with an <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> of two millimeters per day in León (~20 km from volcano), but there were no fatalities during the safe evacuation of 6000 people in the surrounding villages. Overall, the lava flow volume reached 8.0 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume peaked at 5.8 x 106 m3 during this eruption period, resulting in the addition of about 50 meters of height to the cinder cone.|$|E

Due to the {{disorder}} development of Beihai Silver Beach {{and the effects}} of the climate,there has been a serious phenomenon of beach erosion at Beihai Silver Beach,so to put forward effective and feasible maintenance methods of Silver Beach has the great significance. Through the sediment numerical simulation of the waters near the Silver Beach and analysis of the results and to conclude the law of sediment transport both in typhoon and normal wind and the sediment recovery mechanism of the Silver Beach. After a typhoon,the nearshore is scoured and the far offshore is <b>deposited.</b> The <b>average</b> scour depth is around 4 cm and the <b>average</b> <b>deposited</b> height is around 2 cm. The normal wind period is the sediment recovery period. After a year of normal wind,the nearshore and the far offshore is deposited,between them is a scouring area. The average scour depth is around 3 cm and the <b>average</b> <b>deposited</b> height at the nearshore is around 4 cm. The sediment recovery mechanism is that,due to the dynamic action of the water in the normal wind period,it transports the deposition of sediment at the far offshore to the nearshore so as to make it recovered and gradually deposited. Based on the above regularity and mechanism,measures can be taken like that,to fill a sediment barrier parallel to the shoreline,which can make the water carry more sediment to the nearshore so as to speed up the recovery at Silver Beach. The sediment can be got from Baihutou and Yingpan Town...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{deposited}} from X-rays {{generated by}} 1 m long laboratory sparks in air created by 950 kV negative lightning impulses on scintillated detectors was measured. Assuming the X-ray energy detected in such sparks {{results from the}} accumulation of multiple photons at the detector having a certain energy distribution, an experiment was designed {{in such a way}} to characterize their distribution parameters. The detector was screened by a copper shield, and eight series of fifteen impulses were applied by stepwise increasing the copper shield thickness. The <b>average</b> <b>deposited</b> energy was calculated in each series and compared with the results from a model consisting of the attenuation of photons along their path and probable photon distributions.

Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and neutron depth profiling show that the density goes through a maximum as the <b>average</b> <b>deposited</b> energy per unit depth increases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that nitrogen is mostly combined with carbon in triple (C≡N) and double (C=N) bonds. Positron annihilation spectroscopy shows that the void concentration in the films goes through a minimum with deposited energy.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a DSGE model where banks use short-term deposits to provide firms with long-term credit. The demand for long-term credit arises because firms borrow {{in order to}} finance their capital stock which they only adjust at infrequent intervals. Within an RBC framework, we show that maturity transformation in the banking sector dampens the consumption and investment response to a technology shock. Our model also implies that the <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> rate is less persistent than the average long-term loan rate, which we show {{is in line with}} corporate interest rate data in the US...|$|E
30|$|We {{test for}} unit root and cointegration. 14 The {{results of the}} ADF test on the levels suggest that the null {{hypothesis}} of unit root presence cannot be rejected at five percent significance level for all series, {{with the exception of}} the weighted <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> rate. However, as the evidence of stationarity is not compelling, we proceed to test stationarity for first differences. After first-differencing, the null hypothesis of unit root presence is safely rejected for all series. The Engle–Granger test’s null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected for all series combinations except the government bond rates, suggesting that the monetary policy rate shares a long-run relationship only with the retail rates.|$|E
30|$|We {{employ the}} TAR and M-TAR tests to explore {{asymmetric}} cointegration between the monetary policy rate and all retail rates. 17 As a first step, we set the threshold to zero. In {{the case of}} the TAR test, the null hypothesis of symmetric cointegration cannot be rejected. The results are similar in {{the case of the}} M-TAR test, as we cannot find evidence of asymmetric cointegration. As a second step, we let the TAR and M-TAR threshold to be endogenously determined. When employing the TAR test, we find evidence of asymmetric cointegration for the weighted <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> rate, 3 -month, 6 -month, and 1 -year lending rates, and the mortgage lending rate. The M-TAR test finds even stronger evidence of asymmetric cointegration, as it rejects the null hypothesis of symmetric cointegration for all series, except the 6 -month lending rate.|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} Zinc Oxide (ZnO) having {{different}} concentrations were deposited using the Aqueous Chemical Growth (ACG) method. The films were characterized using Rutherford Back Scattering (RBS) spectroscopy for chemical composition and thickness, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) for crystallographic structure, a UV-VIS spectrophotometer {{for the analysis}} of the optical and solid state properties which include spectral absorbance, transmittance, reflectance, refractive index, direct band gap, real and imaginary dielectric constants, absorption and extinction coefficients and a photomicroscope for photomicrographs. The <b>average</b> <b>deposited</b> film thickness was 100 nm. The results indicate that the values of all the optical and solid state properties investigated vary directly with concentration except transmittance which is the reverse. Thus, the optical and solid state properties of ZnO thin film deposited by the Acqueous Chemical Growth method can be tuned by deliberately controlling the concentration of the precursors for various optoelectronic applications including its application as absorber layer in solar cells...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} managing two assets, cash and an earning asset, when net cash flows are stochastic and when there are transfer costs for transferring assets from one form to the other. Previous work on the stochastic cash-balance problem has assumed holding costs for holding excess cash and penalty costs for holding insufficient cash, with these costs assessed per period (the same period {{in which there is}} a single decision or transfer opportunity and a single random cash flow). This formulation is appropriate when a firm faces minimum (or zero) compensating-balance requirements, but not when the compensating-balance requirement involves an <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> balance over a number of decision periods. A dynamic programming model is presented which appropriately represents the relevant cost function for a firm facing an average compensating-balance requirement. The dynamic programming solution to a numerical example is compared to that of a static two-sided (s, S) policy; the optimal dynamic programming solution represents an 18 % reduction in relevant costs in the example. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an integrated}} model of pricing and dividend policies in open credit cooperatives (those that {{do business with}} members and non-members on a non-discriminatory basis). We show that both the distribution of member preferences {{and the amount of}} non-member business the cooperative does influence its optimal pricing and dividend policies. For a fixed distribution of member preferences, the larger the fraction of business done by members, the smaller the optimal dividend and the larger the optimal pricing subsidy (hence, increasing demand). On the other hand, for a fixed fraction of member business, the greater the skewness of member preferences toward loan (deposit) business with the credit cooperative, the larger the optimal dividend and the higher (lower) the optimal loan (deposit) interest rate. Aggregate empirical evidence from the German cooperative banking sector supports a version of the latter prediction, namely, that in an increasingly depositor-dominated open credit cooperative, <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> rates tend to fall as dividend payouts rise.

40|$|Interconnection pricing in network {{industries}} that discriminates between affiliated and un-affiliated consumers {{is a form}} of partial incompatibility. This paper measures the magnitude of the effects this incompatibility has on competition, welfare, and investment in the retail banking industry, where banks ’ ATM networks are connected to one another and unaffiliated consumers face interconnection fees called surcharges. I present a structural model of consumer and firm behavior that allows firms to choose ATM networks and set deposit rates and allows consumers to choose banks. The estimates confirm that network effects are very important in this indus-try and show that surcharge-induced incompatibility has a significant impact on demand for deposit services. The results also indicate that there is overinvestment in ATMs relative to the social optimum. Counterfactual experiments conditional on network size predict that a move to compatibility through the elimination of surcharges would substantially decrease market concen-tration, raise <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> interest rates, raise consumer surplus, lower industry profits, and reallocate profits from large-network banks to small-network banks. Banks are also predicted to respond by reducing the number of their ATMs...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of monetary policy upon real output and {{the inflation rate}} is well established. The influence is exercised through the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. This study has examined the pass-through of Treasury Bill rate to money market rate (Call Money rate), Banks’ Deposit rate and Banks’ Lending rate. The broader conclusion is that pass-through from Treasury Bill rate to Call money rate is completed during the first month. However pass-through from Treasury Bill rate to Deposit rates and the Lending rate takes much longer, that is, these rates exhibit rigidity. The results are in conformity with the empirical evidence in the relevant literature for other countries. In practice, the pass-through to the deposit and the lending rates {{is expected to be}} quicker than evidenced in this study. The reason is that the study uses weighted <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> and lending rate. Given that the weighted average rate takes into account outstanding deposit/loans contracted at previous rates as well, (besides the fresh deposit/loans contracted at new rates) this tends to tone down the pass-through. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} for the commercial use of EPD as a manufacturing technique has been established. Rigs and equipment have been designed and constructed for the EPD of ceramic components {{to a range of}} geometries including tubes and plates. Components have been produced with uniform thickness up to 3 mm, or with varying thickness. Systems have also been operated to produce ceramic coatings on metal substrates including flat foils, tubes, rods and complex shapes. Coatings of ZrO 2, cerium gadolinium oxide (CGO), cermet mixtures, (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2) 0. 98 Mn oxide (LSM), TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 have all been successfully produced and such layers can be achieved with a deposition time of < 2 minutes. Multiplying the number of EPD cells which can be operated simultaneously enables the <b>average</b> <b>deposit</b> time to be reduced to a level where commercial production becomes feasible. Thicker crack-free layers of the above materials up to 150 micron have been produced for applications where a robust porous structure is required.
