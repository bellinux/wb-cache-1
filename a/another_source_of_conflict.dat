The two will usually end up clashing with McWolf, a villainous wolf that, envious of their success, will use any dirty trick against them to win, but inevitably fails. The beautiful Miss Vavoom (Red in Avery shorts) is <b>another</b> possible <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> between the two, as both {{of them have a}} crush on her and she, or a kiss from her, is often the prize of some sort of competition.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 139 - 144) Although {{negotiations between}} organized labor and television networks follow the general pattern of collective bargaining throughout American industry, factors {{unique to the}} broadcasting field make union-network relationships increasingly subject to dissatisfaction, arbitration, and strikes. These factors include inter- and intraunion fragmentation; use of both collective and individual contracts in talent guilds; the job security threat to craft unions posed by technological innovations; separate seniority rosters for videotape and film, and the featherbedding incentive provided by sizeable profits. Their presence further complicates an already intricate and frustrating procedure, involving hundreds of contracts {{for each of the}} three major networks. The research undertaken for this thesis was designed to fulfill three objectives: (1) isolate and describe the forces external to the industry; forces with which television negotiators must contend, (2) to analyze the bargaining process within the television industry as <b>another</b> possible <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict,</b> and (3) to consider the merits of possible changes in the structure of bargaining procedures.

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> and rivalry was Santo Domingo (the Dominican Republic), an {{independent}} republic that Spain annexed {{at the request}} of Pedro Santana in 1861. The U.S. and Spain had competed with one another for influence in Hispaniola in the 1850s and 1860s; the U.S. was worried about a possible military expansion by Spain in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico (which would make it harder to acquire Cuba).|$|E
500|$|Ely had until 1109 been an {{independent}} monastery, but its last abbot, Richard, had proposed {{to the king}} a plan by which the abbey would become a bishopric, presumably with the abbot himself as bishop. Richard died before the proposal could be put into operation, but in 1109, the custodian of the vacant abbey secured permission to make the change, {{and became the first}} Bishop of Ely. However, the administrative changes needed to make the abbey into a bishopric took longer, and were still unresolved at the time of Nigel's appointment. Regardless, Nigel was constantly at court, as shown by his appearance 31times as a witness to charters during the last 10years of Henry I's reign. This left little time for administration of his diocese, and Nigel appointed a married clergyman, Ranulf of Salisbury, to administer the diocese. Ranulf seems to have tyrannized the monks of the cathedral chapter, and Nigel appears to have done little to protect his monks from abuse. Later, {{during the early years of}} Stephen's reign, Nigel claimed to have uncovered a plot led by Ranulf to assassinate Normans. The exact nature of the conspiracy is obscure, and it is unclear what prompted it. The medieval chronicler Orderic Vitalis claimed that Ranulf planned to kill all the Normans in the government and hand the country over to the Scots. After the discovery of the plot, Ranulf fled the country and Nigel made peace with the monks of his cathedral chapter. <b>Another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> with his monks was the desire of the cathedral chapter to enjoy the same [...] "liberty" [...] as a corporate body that the bishops did in the diocese. This liberty was a group of rights that the abbey had originally held, and had transferred to the bishop when the abbey became a bishopric. The rights included sake and soke, or the right to command dues from the land, and the right to levy tolls. They also included the right to hold courts dealing with theft. Around 1135, Nigel conceded this point to the monks. Although he restored some of the lands that had been taken from the monks by Ranulf, the Liber Eliensis (the house chronicle of the monks of Ely) continued to decry his administration of the diocese and the lands of the cathedral chapter, alleging that [...] "he kept back for himself some properties of the church which he wanted, and very good ones they were". The chronicle contains a number of complaints that Nigel oppressed the monks or despoiled them.|$|E
2500|$|Although Athens {{had never}} {{involved}} itself deeply in Sicilian affairs, it had ties {{there before the}} onset of the Peloponnesian War, dating back to at least the mid-5th century BC. To small Sicilian cities, Athens was a potential counter to the powerful city of Syracuse, which was strong enough to potentially dominate the island. (Syracuse, like Sparta and its Peloponnesian allies, was a Dorian city, while most of Athens's allies on the island were Ionian.) [...] <b>Another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> was the close relationship of Syracuse and other Dorian cities of the west to Athens's great commercial rival, Corinth. [...] To the Athenians, Sicily was a threat—an unencumbered Syracuse might send grain or other aid to the Peloponnesians—as well as a venue for possible conquests.|$|E

50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> in {{this area}} has been the border {{crossing}} at Plovanija, due to a checkpoint unilaterally established by Croatia on territory that has been claimed by both sides.

5000|$|Yet <b>another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> {{were the}} {{different}} factions within the POW/MIA community. [...] The older National League of Families was more established, less radical, and more {{connected to the}} government. [...] The newer National Alliance of Families had been created in a schism with the National League during the 1980s, created by members who were dissatisfied with the League's leadership and ties to the government. [...] Compared to the older group, the National Alliance took a more activist, radical stance, especially towards belief {{in the existence of}} live prisoners in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{nationalism}} {{was based on}} the idea of a [...] "people" [...] who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each [...] "people" [...] had a right to its own nation. Much of European history {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of [...] "one people, one nation". Such scenes also happened in Japan and Korea, as the two countries stated themselves as a single-nation country, ethnic minorities had to hide their national identity for centuries, and many resulted in assimilation, such as Ainu and Ryukyuan people in Japan, migrants of Goguryeo, Balhae and Tungusic peoples in Korea. Much conflict would arise when one nation asserted territorial rights to land outside its borders on the basis of a common bond with the people living on that land. (Example: organized territorial rights by Russia for Georgia's breakaway province of South Ossetia to North Ossetia) <b>Another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> arose when a group of people who constituted a minority in one nation would seek to secede from the nation either to form an independent nation or join another nation with whom they felt stronger ties. Yet <b>another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> was the desire of some nations to expel people from territory within its borders on the ground that those people did not share a common bond with the majority of people living in that nation.|$|E
5000|$|Ang Totoong Buhay ni Pacita M. is a 1991 Metro Manila Film Festival entry {{that tells}} the story of a singer-entertainer Pacita M. ( [...] Nora Aunor) in a seedy Quezon City nightclub.

Pacita, in earlier scenes is shown as one lacking in manners, is being tried for killing her daughter, Grace (Lotlot de Leon). She has attempted to disconnect the respirator that sustains the life of her comatose daughter. This highly acclaimed movie directed by Elwood Perez bravely tackles the sensitive issue of euthanasia.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War and the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Western Powers, particularly the US, lost appetite in sustaining the South African apartheid government. The apartheid government was given an ultimatum to hand over political power to the indigenous people of the land, failing which further sanctions would be imposed. At the time, the apartheid government could not afford any further sanctions as the economy had already begun to cripple. The apartheid growth strategy had been rendered obsolete by the global dynamics at the time. This development meant that the apartheid government had to begin negotiations with its enemies in order to pave way for the democratic elections in the country, and this represented a paradigm shift in the apartheid government's political strategy - the new strategic objective was to achieve a favourable negotiated settlement. Despite the fact that the South African apartheid state was a formidable force in Africa {{in the same way as}} the State of Israel is in the present day in the Middle East, the South African apartheid government had to succumb to the Western pressure as the US did not want South Africa to be <b>another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> for the continuation of the Cold War.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue that}} {{would come to the}} fore in the {{uprising}} was the Netherlands Antilles', and specifically Curaçao's, relationship with the Netherlands. Its status had been changed in 1954 by the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Under the charter, the Netherlands Antilles, like Suriname until 1975, {{was a part of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands, but not of the Netherlands itself. Foreign policy and national defense are Kingdom matters and presided over by the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which consisted of the full Council of Ministers of the Netherlands with one minister plenipotentiary for each of the countries Netherlands Antilles and Suriname. Other issues, however, were governed at a more local level, that of the country (Netherlands Antilles) or island (the island of Curaçao). Although this system had its proponents, who pointed to the fact that managing its own foreign relations and national defense would be too costly for a small country like Curaçao, many Netherlands Antilleans saw it as a continuation of the area's subaltern colonial status. Similarly, Dutch cultural dominance in Curaçao was <b>another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> Specifically, the island's official language was Dutch, meaning that this was the language used in schools. Many Curaçaoans' native language, however, was Papiamento. This created difficulties for many students.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recording}} of the album was not without its tensions, with {{several members of the}} band expressing feelings of resentment towards the close working relationship that was beginning to form between McGuinn and producer Terry Melcher. Rhythm guitarist David Crosby was particularly vocal in his disapproval, since he felt that McGuinn and Melcher (along with the band's manager Jim Dickson) were conspiring to keep his songs off of the album. Crosby had brought the self-penned [...] "Stranger In a Strange Land" [...] (later released by Blackburn & Snow) and [...] "The Flower Bomb Song", along with Dino Valenti's [...] "I Don't Ever Want to Spoil Your Party" [...] (later released by Quicksilver Messenger Service as [...] "Dino's Song") to the recording sessions but all three songs were rejected and remained unreleased at the time. Tension was also developing between the band's principal songwriter, Gene Clark, and the rest of The Byrds due to the higher level of income Clark was receiving from his songwriting. This resulted in Clark becoming increasingly isolated within the band and some of his best songs being relegated to appearances on B-sides or being left unreleased altogether. Ultimately, this resentment would be a contributing factor in Clark's departure from the band in early 1966. Yet <b>another</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> was the power struggle that was developing between Terry Melcher and Jim Dickson. For his part, Dickson had aspirations to produce the band himself, which led to him being overly critical of Melcher's production work and would culminate in Melcher's dismissal following completion of the album.|$|E
