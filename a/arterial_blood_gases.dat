2500|$|Since {{the blood}} {{arriving}} in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of O2 of, on average, 6kPa (45mmHg), while the pressure in the alveolar air is 13-14kPa (100mmHg), {{there will be a}} net diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood, changing the composition of the 3liters of alveolar air slightly. Similarly, since the blood {{arriving in the}} alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of CO2 of also about 6kPa (45mmHg), whereas that of the alveolar air is 5.3kPa (40mmHg), there is a net movement of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries into the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net flows of individual gases {{into and out of the}} alveolar air necessitate the replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every [...] 5seconds or so. This is very tightly controlled by the monitoring of the <b>arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>gases</b> (which accurately reflect composition of the alveolar air) by the aortic and carotid bodies, as well as by the blood gas and pH sensor on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they primarily determine the diameters of the bronchioles and pulmonary capillaries, and are therefore responsible for directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.|$|E

40|$|Acid-base {{unbalance}} is {{most common}} problem in severe ill patient, especially in condition of abnormal renal function state. Acid-base unbalances are respiratory acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is frequently appeared in clinical state. <b>Arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>gas</b> analysis is {{considered as a}} basic test to {{the intensive care unit}} patient and emergency state. Recently some researches were done, comparing with <b>arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>gas</b> analysis and venous <b>blood</b> <b>gas</b> analysis. Because of venous blood sampling is safer than <b>arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>gas</b> analysis, and beside not so different among them for detecting pH, pCO 2, HCO 3, except pO 2 measuring. This research was done in emergency room, and for explaining no different between <b>arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>gas</b> analysis and peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>gas</b> analysis result in acid-base unbalance state patient.

(Women 53, average age: 66. 7 ± 12. 1) Then compare between <b>arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>gas</b> analysis and peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>gas</b> analysis. Result: The mean arterial minus venous difference for pH, pCO 2, and bicarbonate was − 0. 0170, 2. 6528, and 0. 6124.
