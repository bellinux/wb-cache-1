In this book Morgenthau sought to articulate the difference between legal disputes between nations and political disputes between nations or other litigants. The questions driving the inquiry were: (i) Who holds <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> over the objects or concerns being disputed, (ii) In what manner can the holder of this <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> be changed or held accountable; (iii) How can a dispute, the object of which concerns a <b>legal</b> <b>power,</b> be resolved; and (iv) In what manner will the holder of the <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> be protected {{in the course of}} exercising that power. The end goal of any legal system in this context for Morgenthau is to [...] "ensure justice and peace." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> (often called <b>legal</b> competence) is {{important}} in the law since, with regard to actions having legal effect, the “exercise of legal power” delimits those actions for which manifestation of intention to achieve a legal effect is essential for the effect to ensue. The paper proposes a definition that captures this feature of <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> and marks it off rom “direct effect,” as well as from permissibility and practical ability to achieve the legal effect. This analysis of power is limited to the “immediate” <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> of a physical person characterized by the powerholder achieving a legal result by the power-holder’s own behaviour (not by representatives acting on behalf of the power-holder). It is argued that in the literature on power the concept of <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> is frequently construed {{in such a way that}} it becomes either too broad or too narrow...|$|R

50|$|Dore faced {{enormous}} {{difficulties in}} the colony. First, his heath was poor, although it did recover during {{his first year in}} the colony. Secondly, he suffered from the lack of <b>adequate</b> <b>legal</b> supplies, such as parchment and stationery, items which are essential to legal affairs. Lastly, he suffered from the lack of <b>adequate</b> <b>legal</b> resources, an affliction that was to continue to affect the colony even to the time of Chief Justice Frederick Matthew Darley in the late 19th century. This was particularly worrying as since the colony was considered by the British Government to be a settled colony, all the laws of England at the time of settlement of the colony, applied to the colony subject to any necessary modifications. Without legal books, ascertainment of the law would be difficult to define.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} nature of dynamics related to the operation of a leader's charismatic <b>power</b> over rational <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> vested in the main office or 'leader in a government organization. The mix of charismatic power and the rational <b>legal</b> bureaucratic <b>power</b> in effecting management control and coordination tend to cause dysfimctions. Weber's argument was that the rational <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> and the controls emanating from it ensure efficiency of large bureaucratic organizations. However, in reality cultural, social, political and other contextual factors intermingle with rational <b>legal</b> bureaucratic <b>power</b> and as a result many control dysfimctions manifest. Thus, the rational <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> based controls are destined to be 'ideal type' as explained by Max Weber. The main methodology of the study has been derivedfrom grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The research site is a Government university in Sri Lanka. It has been found that charismatic power of the leader can suppress the rational <b>legal</b> bureaucratic <b>power</b> and that as a result there can be functions and dysfimctions in the management controls and coordination of the organization...|$|R

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{experiences}} and perceptions that domestic violence victims reported with Mills’s power model. The victims’partners were the primary research participants in an arrest experiment. The following were empirically examined: the occurrence of violence following suspect arrest, victim perceptions of personal and <b>legal</b> <b>power,</b> victim satisfaction with the police, and victim perceptions of safety fol-lowing legal intervention. Race and two victim resource measures (i. e., employment status and income advantage) explained variance in perceptions of independence. A police empowerment scale {{was used to measure}} <b>legal</b> <b>power.</b> It was found that arrest affected the probability of reoccurring domestic violence. Suspect arrest and the vic-tim’s perceptions of <b>legal</b> <b>power</b> were related to perceptions of safety following police intervention.

40|$|The rising {{importance}} of technological development especially in Europe and the USA, {{which are the}} largest producers of databases, requires an internationally unified regulation {{for the protection of}} databases. The aim of this thesis is to present these issues and highlight the shortcomings of the current and proposed legislation in order to determine <b>adequate</b> <b>legal</b> protection of databases and how this can be achieved. The first chapter provides an overview of the definitions and the basic concepts. This includes the protection of databases by copyright and the sui generis right and a list of criteria in order to establish <b>adequate</b> <b>legal</b> protection. The second chapter outlines the legal protection of databases in the European Community, including the current legal system, its benefits and drawbacks and alternative protection to sui generis. Additionally the theories and current judicial practice are presented to further clarify the issue. The third chapter deals with the alternative legal protection to copyright of databases in the U. S. that in many ways differs from the European legislation. Similarly both copyright and database protection alternatives are presented in terms of legislation, case law and theories relevant to this area. The fourth and last chapter focuses on the international regulation of databases, and any potential changes in international regulation with regard to protecting databases. Moreover theories and rulings in this area are presented. Finally all the important points of this thesis are summarized and <b>adequate</b> <b>legal</b> measures for the protection of databases are suggested based on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the current forms of protection and judicial practice...|$|R
