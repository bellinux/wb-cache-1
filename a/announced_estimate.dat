40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{a model of}} optimal market response to <b>announced</b> <b>estimates</b> of changes in economic aggregates when the estimates {{are known to be}} subject to error. We show that under fairly general conditions, rational economic agents will not take the announcements at face value, but will attempt to extract their own perception of the true change conditional on the announcement. Ignoring this signal extraction process can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the behavioral response of asset prices to money supply shocks. The model is shown to be consistent with the data on the response of interest rates to money supply announcements...|$|R

40|$|Several studies {{report that}} even after {{accounting}} earnings are <b>announced,</b> <b>estimated</b> cumulative unexpected returns continue to drift up for firms that report unexpectedly good earnings and down for firms that report unexpectedly bad earnings. This paper shows that because Finnish companies tend {{to pay more attention}} to tax considerations than so-called economic reality when preparing their financial reports, this drift does not exist for reported earnings, i. e. net profit based on Finnish accounting regulations. It appears, however, that several other income levels assessed by financial statement analysis are important in this respect. The results imply that firms that make extensive adjustments for tax purposes have high unexpected returns. This is explained by the fact that those firms have enough income to extensively exploit the depreciation and other earnings management possibilities. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to improve the {{curriculum}} in the teaching of informal logic and critical thinking by throwing new light on a problem that is quite important in philosophy generally, and in the fields of statistics, political science and law, as well-the problem of how to evaluate loaded questions. The problem of dealing with fallacious or otherwise tricky questions has, since ancient times, been a subject of some interest to philosophers, and it is a complex problem, with many different factors that need to be taken into account. The subject is also of current interest in relation to recent concerns about the widespread abuse of statistics in polls that deceptively look precise because they are scientific surveys. But the results are skewed one way or another by effects of the wording of the question (effects not measured by the <b>announced</b> <b>estimates</b> of the probability of error). The problem here is that the connotations of the words used in the question can produce a large variance in the statistical outcome of a survey. In this paper, the factor studied is that of how to judge whether and how a question is "loaded, " in a way tha...|$|R

30|$|The {{question}} that remains open to more investigation is why would an InP be honest when <b>announcing</b> pricing <b>estimates?</b> We {{believe that a}} reputation metric – indicating long-term accuracy of an InP’s pricing estimate to the actual cost of establishing a VN request – is necessary to remedy this situation. We would like to integrate such a reputation metric within LAP to allow dissemination of path vectors attributed with corresponding prices and overall reputation score of the InPs on the paths. An InP will {{then be able to}} use pricing and reputation scores to rank multiple paths to a common destination to make a forwarding decision.|$|R
