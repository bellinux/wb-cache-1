5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> {{would have been no}} room for such soft tissue.|$|E

5|$|According to the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran, {{the films}} {{released}} {{during this period}} could not be classified as truly Indonesian films <b>as</b> <b>there</b> was no sense of nationalism within them. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E
