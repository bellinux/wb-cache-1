5|$|Oxford Street {{has been}} ranked {{as the most}} {{important}} retail location in Britain and the busiest shopping street in Europe. The street is often congested both on the pavements, due to the large number of shoppers and tourists, many of whom arrive at one of the tube stations, and on the roadway {{as a result of the}} many buses routed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
5|$|There was {{a palace}} in {{the centre of}} the tel at a {{commanding}} location consisting of several warehouses which were inferred as indicative of economic activity during the Dilmun period. Proceeding from here towards the north, <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> leads, to a large gate that probably was the entry to the palace grounds. The modest houses built in the same size and type of construction were laid along a network of roads.|$|E
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was {{closed to the public}} in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which exploded in the gardens.|$|E

5|$|Later that evening, several police cruisers {{filled with}} {{officers}} wearing riot gear {{arrived at the}} Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk's protégé Cleve Jones and {{a reporter for the}} San Francisco Chronicle, Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the bar and began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the bar and struck out at people walking <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The chief of police finally ordered the officers out of the neighborhood. By morning, 61 police officers and 100 rioters and gay residents of the Castro had been hospitalized. City Hall, police cruisers, and the Elephant Walk Bar suffered damages in excess of $1,000,000.|$|E
5|$|North Michigan Avenue is a six-lane {{two-way street}} that is {{serviced}} by Chicago Transit Authority public buses along the Magnificent Mile that connect {{the area to}} the entire Chicago metropolitan area. It is also serviced by seasonal trolley service <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and {{the foot of the}} Magnificent Mile is serviced by seasonal water transit services. Two blocks west along State Street, the Chicago 'L' rapid transit services the street via its Red Line. Pedestrian traffic abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The street {{began to}} be redeveloped in the 18th century after many of the {{surrounding}} fields were purchased by the Earl of Oxford. In 1739, local gardener Thomas Huddle began to build property on the north side. John Rocque's Map of London, published in 1746, shows urban buildings as far as North Audley Street, but only intermittent rural property thereafter. Buildings {{began to be}} erected {{on the corner of}} Oxford Street and Davies Street in the 1750s. Further development <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> occurred between 1763 and 1793. The Pantheon, a place for public entertainment, opened at No.173 in 1772.|$|E

5|$|The {{street was}} built on fields {{surrounding}} Clarendon House on Piccadilly, which were developed by Sir Thomas Bond. It was built up in the 1720s, {{and by the end}} of the 18th century was a popular place for the upper-class residents of Mayfair to socialise. Prestigious and expensive shops were established <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> but it declined as a centre of social activity in the 19th century, although it held its reputation as a fashionable place for retail, and is home to the auction houses Sotheby's and Bonhams (formerly Phillips) and the department stores Fenwick and Tiffany's. It is one of the most expensive and sought after strips of real estate in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Transport for London {{suggested}} that pedestrianisation {{may not be}} a suitable long-term measure due to Crossrail reducing the demand for bus services along Oxford Street, and proposed to ban all traffic except buses and cycles during peak shopping times. Optimisation of existing traffic signals <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> including Pedestrian Countdown signals, have also been proposed. Transport for London is concerned that in the long term traffic problems may affect trade on Oxford Street, which is now competing with shopping centres such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre. In 2015, while campaigning for election as London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan favoured the full pedestrianisation of Oxford Street, which was supported by other parties. After winning the election, he pledged the street would be completely pedestrianised by 2020, including a ban on buses and taxis. By 2017, this had been revised forward {{to the end of the}} following year.|$|E
5|$|John flirts with Catherine at a ball, {{but she is}} more {{interested}} in meeting with Henry and his sister, Eleanor (Catherine Walker). Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite her having made plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton to Wick Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney (Liam Cunningham), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her to spend the day with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does.|$|E

5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry ramped up {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and My Father and My Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E
5|$|Herrick's mansion, Greyfriars House, {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} his family until his great-grandson Samuel sold it in 1711. The property was subsequently divided and sold in 1740; three years later, New Street was built across {{the western part of the}} site. Many burials were discovered when houses were laid out <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> A townhouse, 17 Friar Lane, was built on the eastern part of the site in 1759 and survives today. During the 19th century, the site became increasingly built on. In 1863 Alderman Newton's Boys' School built a schoolhouse on part of the site. Herrick's mansion was demolished in 1871, the present Grey Friars Street was laid through the site in 1873, and more commercial developments, including the Leicester Trustee Savings Bank, were built. In 1915 the rest of the site was acquired by Leicestershire County Council which built offices on it in the 1920s and 1930s. The county council relocated in 1965 when its new County Hall opened, and Leicester City Council moved in. The rest of the site, where Herrick's garden had once been, was turned into a staff car park in about 1944, but was not otherwise built on.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century, {{coffee and}} chop houses were {{established}} on the street; Twinings was established at No.206 in 1706 by Thomas Twining, supplier of tea to Queen Anne. The company {{claims to be}} the oldest ratepayer in Westminster. The Grecian Coffee House ran from around 1702 to 1803, while Tom's ran from 1706 to around 1775. Though these premises were well-known, the alleyways around the Strand were regular haunts for pickpockets and prostitutes during this time. The Rose Tavern, at the eastern end of the street, was frequented by lawyers during the 18th century. It was later demolished and became Thanet Place. The Crown and Anchor was the main meeting place for the Catholic Association and helped established the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. It was later used for Catholic politicians such as Daniel O'Connell to address constituents. The original premises burned down in 1854, but was rebuilt. Simpson's-in-the-Strand originally started at No.100 in 1828 as a smoking and dining club. It later became a restaurant. The Strand was also notable in the 18th century as a centre for the British book trade, with numerous printers and publishers <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The prominent bookseller Andrew Millar is an example {{of one of the most}} successful publishers who owned a shop there.|$|E
