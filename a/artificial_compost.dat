40|$|Association of bound {{residues}} to soil humic matter may {{be accomplished by}} different binding mechanisms such as sequestration in hydrophobic interiors of the organic material or covalent linkage to the organic matter. The structures and chemical environments of compounds can be observed by NMR spectroscopy. We applied 15 N-NMR spectroscopy to study the soil-{{bound residues}} of 15 N-labeled simazine. As the 15 N-isotope has a low sensitivity and natural abundance 15 N-NMR experiments require long measurement times and often result in low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. Therefore, {{in addition to the}} use of 15 N-labeled simazine, 15 N-depleted compost was used {{to reduce the amount of}} background signal and enhance the sensitivity. The compost was produced from maize and wheat plants grown on sand with 15 N-depleted NH 4 NO 3 as sole nitrogen source. The plants were freeze-dried, ground and mixed with sand for composting. After a composting period of 224 days analysis of the compost revealed a 15 N-content of 267 ppm as opposed to a natural abundance of 3650 ppm. Characterization of this <b>artificial</b> <b>compost</b> produced parameter values similar to those of a natural compost. The 13 C-NMR-spectra of the humic and fulvic acids during different stages of maturity showed that there was a shift from single-bond functional groups to more complex double-bond and aromatic structures. Experiments with this compost showed an increased signal intensity. The improved sensitivity made it possible to obtain interpretable NMR signals in contrast to experiments with 15 N-simazine on native soil where no signals were detectable. The data indicated that the bound residues of simazine are composed of metabolites resulting from N-dealkylation and triazine ring destruction. Silylation of the bound residues showed a very strong binding of the residues to the matrix as only a small fraction could be solubilized...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{is a major}} laboratory {{model in}} biology. Only ten Caenorhabditis species were available in culture {{at the onset of}} this study. Many of them, like C. elegans, were mostly isolated from <b>artificial</b> <b>compost</b> heaps, and their more natural habitat was unknown. Results Caenorhabditis nematodes were found to be proliferating in rotten fruits, flowers and stems. By collecting a large worldwide set of such samples, 16 new Caenorhabditis species were discovered. We performed mating tests to establish biological species status and found some instances of semi-fertile or sterile hybrid progeny. We established barcodes for all species using ITS 2 rDNA sequences. By obtaining sequence data for two rRNA and nine protein-coding genes, we determined the likely phylogenetic relationships among the 26 species in culture. The new species are part of two well-resolved sister clades that we call the Elegans super-group and the Drosophilae super-group. We further scored phenotypic characters such as reproductive mode, mating behavior and male tail morphology, and discuss their congruence with the phylogeny. A small space between rays 2 and 3 evolved once in the stem species of the Elegans super-group; a narrow fan and spiral copulation evolved once in the stem species of C. angaria, C. sp. 8 and C. sp. 12. Several other character changes occurred convergently. For example, hermaphroditism evolved three times independently in C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. sp. 11. Several species can co-occur in the same location or even the same fruit. At the global level, some species have a cosmopolitan distribution: C. briggsae is particularly widespread, while C. elegans and C. remanei are found mostly or exclusively in temperate regions, and C. brenneri and C. sp. 11 exclusively in tropical zones. Other species have limited distributions, for example C. sp. 5 appears to be restricted to China, C. sp. 7 to West Africa and C. sp. 8 to the Eastern United States. Conclusions Caenorhabditis are "fruit worms", not soil nematodes. The 16 new species provide a resource and their phylogeny offers a framework for further studies into the evolution of genomic and phenotypic characters. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{study was}} the characterization of the structure and binding modes of non-extractable residues (NER) of the triazine herbicide simazine. The chemical environments of unaltered as well as metabolized simazine compounds can be observed directly in soil or compost matrix by 15 N-NMR spectroscopy. As the 15 N-isotope has a very low sensitivity and natural abundance 15 N-labeled simazine was used. To further enhance the {{signal to noise ratio}} and sensitivity of the NMR experiment a compost of 15 N-depleted maize and wheat as model soil was used to reduce background noise. Furthermore reactive extraction methods as NaOH extraction and silylation of the organic matrix in combination with the 14 C-radiotracer technique were applied to elucidate the structure of NER. To verify and interprete the obtained spectra ab initio calculations of simazine and its metabolites as well as of a model of NER were carried out. At first 15 N-depleted wheat and maize plants were grown on sand and composted after harvest. Characterization of this <b>artificial</b> <b>compost</b> proved its similarity to a natural compost. After 224 days analysis of the compost revealed a 15 N-content of 267 ppm corresponding to a depletion factor of 13. 7. Dilution series with the sieved 15 N-depleted compost matrix and 15 N-labeled simazine revealed an enhancement of the S/N-ratio compared to a dilution series with soil. Due to low amounts of NER the 15 N-spectra gave only weak signals, which were attributed to the presence of free chlorinated, mono- and/or didealkylated simazine metabolites. Nevertheless the improved sensitivity made it possible to obtain interpretable NMR signals in contrast to experiments with 15 N-simazine on native soil where no signals were detectable. Extraction with NaOH and silylation of the NER revealed that the largest part of the NER was tightly bound to the organic matrix, but sequestration contributed only to a small extent to the binding. Probably binding to the matrix was due to a combination of different binding mechanisms like covalent binding, ionic and hydrophobic interactions. This repartition on several binding types caused a dispersal of signal intensities resulting in a poor NMR traceability. Finally ab initio calculations of the metabolites confirmed the NMR assignments of the corresponding experimental spectra. The calculated NMR shifts of a modelled ester bond between hydroxysimazine and benzoic acid, as a model for a humic matter component, was not detected in the experimental spectra. But due to the low signal intensities no conclusions can be drawn from the absence of a signal...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} outcome of {{research}} to demonstrate the proof of concept for simulating individual, collective and interactive household waste management behaviours to provide a tool for efficient integrated waste management planning. The developed model simulates whole communities as distributions of individual households engaged in managing their own domestic waste, through home composting or recycling activities. The research addresses the personal hierarchical ordering of these activities, choices for participation and the factors affecting the waste diversion levels {{to each of the}} available outlets. These choices are driven by the underlying attitudes of the community residents, linked in part to socio-demographic factors but also containing a large random, or stochastic, element. Structures for modelling the stochastic variations are developed. The social elements of the simulation are used as control parameters determining the waste material flows through the household which provide a process simulation, or material balance, across the household. The developed models enable the investigation of possible management interventions to increase overall performance. Behavioural responses to other external stimuli can also be simulated. Model application to the simulation of environmental impacts from recycling are discussed briefly. The paper concludes with examples drawn from model validation trials on kerbside newspaper recycling schemes. <b>Artificial</b> societies, <b>Composting,</b> Environmental impact, Material balance, Recycling, Stochastic modelling, Waste management...|$|R
40|$|El títol del pre-print és Review of {{fundamentals}} {{in selecting}} {{input and output}} variables for composting process automatic controllersThis paper provides a critical analysis of the fundamental principles involved {{in the selection of}} input and output variables for automatic controllers of composting processes. Research results and technological advancements make available a number of parameters which may be used by a composting process controller. Parameters based on ventilation have been identified as the most appropriate controller output variables. On-line monitoring of odour generation potential and pathogen destruction has not become feasible, although recent advances indicate potential for electronic noses and biosensors. On-line measurement of reaction rate heavily depends on the suitability of microbial respirometric methods. Water content of the material being composted may be useful in on-line evaluation of reaction rate if relationships between water loss rate and respiration rate are adequately described. Developments in artificial intelligence offer, however, new avenues regarding real-time estimation of reaction rates. In general, the first experiences from application of <b>artificial</b> intelligence on <b>composting</b> process control indicate potential for substantial utility...|$|R
