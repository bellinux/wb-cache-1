5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

25|$|A study made by Takaki {{and colleagues}} (2006), {{focused on the}} gender {{differences}} with relationship to {{internal locus of control}} and self-efficacy in hemodialysis patients and their compliance. This study showed that females that had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards to their health and medical advices compared to the men that participated in this study. Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person's behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor's advice.|$|E

25|$|After {{having worked}} {{with members of}} 27 as guest musicians on {{previous}} full-length Oceanic, for Panopticon Isis turned to Justin Chancellor, bassist of tour-mates Tool. According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
25|$|When locals {{heard of}} the group's plans for {{starting}} a new society in the Americas, rumours were spread and criticism was lodged against Pantisocracy. This was compounded when Southey's aunt, with whom he was living, found out about both the idea and Southey's intention in marrying Edith Fricker, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> his aunt felt was below his station. His aunt immediately stopped talking to him and kicked him out of her house. When Coleridge left for London, his thoughts about Pantisocracy began to change and he backed off {{his role in the}} matter. This was partly to blame for the intervention by Mary Evans and his brother George, and partly about Southey advocating for a master class and a servant class in their new society, all of which upset Coleridge. The idea did not completely collapse until Southey abandoned the plans in August 1795 in order to become a lawyer.|$|E
25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when pointing to <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> is physically present, a pronoun {{is equivalent to}} either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There {{is nothing in the}} sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need you to go to the store and you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E

The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get rid of all the Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, [...] "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> disturbed being a racist is funny to us." ...|$|E
500|$|Anthony Winterbourne connects Huginn and Muninn to the Norse {{concepts}} of the fylgja—a concept with three characteristics; shape-shifting abilities, good fortune, and the guardian spirit—and the hamingja—the ghostly double of <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> may appear {{in the form of}} an animal. Winterbourne states that [...] "The shaman's journey through the different parts of the cosmos is symbolized by the hamingja concept of the shape-shifting soul, and gains another symbolic dimension for the Norse soul in the account of Oðin's ravens, Huginn and Muninn." [...] In response to Simek's criticism of attempts to interpret the ravens [...] "philosophically", Winterbourne says that [...] "such speculations [...] simply strengthen the conceptual significance made plausible by other features of the mythology" [...] and that the names Huginn and Muninn [...] "demand more explanation than is usually provided." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Dreams Old Men Dream" [...] was {{inspired}} by the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries and Fyodor Dostoyevskys short story The Dream of a Ridiculous Man. It tells the story of an elderly man reflecting back on the life he had and what he wished he had done before. [...] "On the Night My Love Broke Through" [...] was the last song made for the album that was recorded live. It {{was inspired}} by the works of German-American poet Charles Bukowski.

[...] The overall sound of the track is described as electronica in the vein of [...] "mid-era Radiohead."

500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off in the far distance against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E
500|$|The Court further {{stated that}} {{although}} congress allowed the resale and gifting {{of a gun}} by an individual, without requiring form or background checks, that is not proof that congress did not care about straw buyers. [...] "Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely untouched.... And yes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress does) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw arrangements are {{not a part of}} the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer’s sale." [...] The Court also rejected Abramski's claim that since Alvarez was able to buy the gun legally on his own the misrepresentation is not material, stating: [...] "Abramski’s false statement was material because had he revealed that he was purchasing the gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to be an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter, would not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on absentee purchases." [...] The court held that Abramski's case is analogous to a situation where <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> can buy a gun legally buys a gun under an alias. Such misrepresentation is material regardless of the fact that the buyer may purchase a gun legally, and the theory of [...] "no harm, no foul" [...] should not apply. Finally, the Court rejected Abramski's claim that the misrepresentation is not in violation of §924, because it is not part of what the dealer is statutorily required to maintain on his record. The Court held that §924 requires the dealer to maintain information [...] "required by this chapter", and that ATF Form 4473 is required by this chapter.|$|E
