40|$|Agriculture is the {{backbone}} of Jordan 2 ̆ 7 s economy. It provides employment and a living for 40 per cent {{or more of the}} total population. However, very few farmers have accumulated enough capital to finance their farm operations from planting to harvest. The Agricultural Credit Corporation was established to provide farmers with credit at a relatively low cost. Without the low cost loans many farmers cannot s tay on their farms. The Agricultural Credit Corporation is the most important agency in terms of the direct help it offers to farmers. The Agricultural Credit Corporation has followed a policy of making loans at a relatively low rates of interest. As a result they have had difficulty in obtaining loans from competitive markets to meet their needs. This problem has been accentuated by a persistently low level of collections from its loans. Apparently they expect to collect no more than 85 per cent of its claims. However, during the year 1965 - 66 collections were only 44 per cent of the principal after excluding doubtful loans, and 43 percent for interest. The weaknesses of the Corporation Administration appear to be: (a) Lack of studies to determine how well the corporation is serving the needs of agricultural borrowers. (b) Lack of planning for improvement in the future. (c) Loopholes in lending rules and procedure. (d) The low limits on loans to farmers. (e) Regulations that property offered as security for a loan should not exceed 60 per cent {{of the value of the}} mortgaged property. (f) Frequency of seasons in which drought occurs and results in the inability of farmers to make payments on their loans. It is recommended that the ACC should continue to seek low cost credit from sources such as the International Development Association and similar agencies. It is also recommended ACC use all of its financial resources in lending operations instead of depositing them in commercial banks. Recommendations for correcting the existing weaknesses: (a) The Corporation should develop repayment schedules for each borrower at the time the loan is made. These should be adhered to by both the borrower and the lender. The statistics and research section of the ACC should be assigned responsibility of the schedule of repayments. (b) Procedures for appraising the value of property offered as security for a loan should be developed and used as a part of every <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> and before any loan has been made. (c) The upper limit on loans should be raised to 100 per cent of the appraised value of the security mortgaged rather than the present 60 per cent of loans. (d) The Corporation should establish a special fund from which emergency loans could be issued to drought stricken areas. These funds should be provided by the Treasury. This should improve the rate of collection of loans when they are due...|$|E

5000|$|Comments by opponents: Opponents {{agree that}} a {{constitutional}} amendment is necessary to address uncertainties in the law but disagree as to what uncertainties should be addressed and how the law should be changed. The amendment fails to address crucial issues, such as what charges {{are subject to the}} constitutional fee cap and whether <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> home equity <b>loan</b> may be taken orally. Because the courts tend to favor lenders on these issues, failure of the amendment to address the issues is the same as settling the issues in the lenders’ favor to the detriment of borrowers. Moreover, the amendment does not provide enough protection to home equity line of credit borrowers, who are enticed into taking advances on the loan by the use of preprinted checks.|$|R
500|$|On 23 March 1991, Knight was {{suddenly}} replaced as CAD director by Senior State Counsel Lawrence Ang {{in a decision}} that shocked the local legal community. It turned out that Knight was {{under investigation by the}} Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). After an investigation lasting more than two months—one of the longest probes into the conduct of a public servant in Singapore—Knight was arrested on 27 May 1991 and charged with corruption the next day. He was the first Singapore legal officer to face such charges. Specifically, he was accused of cheating three businessmen into investing S$3,000,000 each into the former Batam Island Country Club on the Indonesian island of Batam, as well as giving false information to the CPIB regarding vehicle purchases, <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> car <b>loan,</b> and his corporate investments.

Citibank had received money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to put money into home equity, in order {{to prop up the}} housing market after the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Swanson had visited the bank, and was told she should apply along with her husband. She had refused to answer a question about race, but the bank employee pointed to a photo of his family who were part African-American also. Swanson disclosed that Washington Mutual Bank previously had denied her <b>a</b> home-equity <b>loan.</b> After Swanson applied to the bank, a preliminary home valuation was $240,000. Then an appraiser, Andre Lanier who worked for PCI Appraisal Services, visited the home and valued it at $170,000. After Swanson claimed, Citibank brought a motion to dismiss the claim under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6), that the grounds were too indefinite and unreasonable.|$|R
5000|$|Sogō {{devised a}} plan to make it almost {{impossible}} {{for the government to}} withdraw its support, once given. Central to Sogo's strategy was the use of <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> from the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (World Bank). This was apparently an idea put to him by future Prime Minister and then Minister of Finance, Eisaku Satō, who had previously worked with Sogō in the Railway Ministry. With the successful <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> $80 million <b>loan</b> (estimated to be no more than 15 {{percent of the cost of}} the line) in place, it ensured that the Japanese government had to remain committed to the project. At the same time, Sogō, who had kept estimated cost figures of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen deliberately low for fear that if they were too high neither the Japanese Government nor the World Bank would have supported the proposal, began to divert money from other JNR projects to the construction of the Shinkansen. This was possible because once JNR's total budget was approved by the Diet, the JNR president had [...] "discretionary authority" [...] over how to spend it. Sogo also kept down the declared maximum proposed speed at a relatively modest 200 km/h and argued successfully that this was not a new line but expansion of the existing Tōkaidō Line.|$|R
5|$|The IND Second System {{proposal}} from 1929 {{estimated that the}} cost of the southern tunnel route from Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, to Fort Hamilton would cost upward of $75,000,000, though the tunnel was not officially part of the subway plans and was illustrated as a vehicular tunnel on the map of the plans. Many of the proposals were part of this ambitious expansion plan, which would have connected the tunnel to the IND South Brooklyn Line (today's IND Culver Line). An updated proposal in 1931 had the connection to the IND at the current Smith-Ninth Streets station, with the tunnel traveling north from Staten Island through Red Hook and Gowanus. Yet another update, from 1933, was projected to cost $45,000,000, running the original route between Saint George and 67th Street in Bay Ridge. The line would then run on Second Avenue north through the Bay Ridge Flats on Brooklyn's western shore, meeting up with the Culver Line near Hamilton Avenue (the current Gowanus Expressway) between the Smith-Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue stations; it was suggested that the Hylan tunnel shafts be used.
