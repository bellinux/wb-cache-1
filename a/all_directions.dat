5|$|Alert to {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, a third and final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E

King Richard took especial pains over the {{disposition}} of his army. The probable posts of greatest danger, at the front and especially {{the rear of the}} column, were given to the military orders. They had the most experience of fighting in the East, were arguably the most disciplined, and were the only formations which included Turcopole cavalry who fought like the Turkish horse archers of the Ayyubid army.|$|E

Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world's first human beings, pour out of it in <b>all</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third-largest conurbation. There {{is a mixture of}} high-density urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around , is Heaton Park. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass through the south of Manchester, through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively. Heavy rail lines enter the city from <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E

5|$|September 3–8, 1915 – A Category 3 {{hurricane}} meanders {{around the}} islands for several days, {{during which time}} gale-force winds blow from nearly <b>all</b> <b>directions.</b> Heavy rains cause many roofs to leak, and overall damage is extensive. Enormous waves from the hurricane wreck many boats; one cargo ship in particular, the SS Pollockshields, is driven aground on a reef off Elbow Beach. The captain drowns while attempting to procure a life jacket for a crew member, but all other men are eventually rescued.|$|E
5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.|$|E
5|$|The Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem, {{published}} in 1968, {{shows that in}} a given universe, if all freely falling observers measure the cosmic background radiation to have exactly the same properties in <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> (that is, they measure the background radiation to be isotropic), then that universe is an isotropic and homogeneous Friedmann–Lemaître spacetime. Cosmic isotropy and homogeneity are important as they are {{the basis of the}} modern standard model of cosmology.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{received}} worldwide attention, {{and it had}} immediate {{effects on}} navies around the world. The preeminent naval powers, Great Britain and France, halted further construction of wooden-hulled ships, and others followed suit. A new type of warship, monitor, was produced {{based on the principle}} of the original. The use of a small number of very heavy guns, mounted so that they could fire in <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> was first demonstrated by Monitor but soon became standard in warships of all types. Shipbuilders also incorporated rams into the designs of warship hulls {{for the rest of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{staff from}} previous Metroid games – including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Super Metroid {{over the course}} of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in <b>all</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{observable}} Universe is isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the Universe are the same in <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> as observed from Earth. The Universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale Universe is homogeneous and isotropic {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A Universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in <b>all</b> <b>directions.</b> MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number of faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest, the {{breakout}} began on 6 December with the 7th Marines as the vanguard of the retreating column while the 5th Marines covered the rear. At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru-ri with its 76th and 77th Division relieving the 58th and 60th Divisions. As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division. In a last effort to stop the breakout, the customary Chinese night attack returned with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter from <b>all</b> <b>directions.</b> The Marines repulsed the Chinese attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E
