40|$|We {{present a}} novel technique, termed <b>attached</b> <b>shadow</b> coding, for {{estimating}} surface normals from shadows when the reflectance and lighting conditions are unknown. Our key idea is encoding surface points via attached shadows observed under different light source directions and then estimating surface normals {{on the basis}} of the similarity of the <b>attached</b> <b>shadow</b> codes. Because shadows do not rely on reflectance properties, our method is applicable to sur-faces with various complex reflectances such as anisotropic and composite materials. Moreover, our method is robust against noise because it takes advantage of the combination of weak constraints imposed by a number of light sources. We theoretically show that the distance between the codes at two surface points is equal to the angle between the cor-responding surface normals under the assumption of uni-form lighting and a convex object. Our method embeds high-dimensional codes into a 3 D surface normal space so that the inter-code distances are preserved. Furthermore, we extend the method in order to alleviate the effects of nonuniform lighting and cast shadows. Experimental re-sults demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new method for {{classification}} of photometric factors, such as diffuse reflection, specular reflection, <b>attached</b> <b>shadow,</b> and cast shadow. For analyzing real images, we utilize the photometric linearization method which was originally proposed for image synthesis. First, {{we show that}} each pixel can be photometrically classified by the simple comparison of the pixel intensity. Our classification algorithm requires neither 3 D shape information nor color information of the scene. Then, we show that {{the accuracy of the}} photometric linearization can be improved by introducing a new classification-based criterion to the linearization process. Experimental results show that photometric factors can be correctly classified without any special device. ...|$|E

How does the mask change its expressions? Shadows change subtly during the actual Noh drama, which {{plays a key role}} in creating elusive artistic enchantment. We here describe evidence from two experiments regarding how <b>attached</b> <b>shadows</b> of the Noh masks influence the observers' recognition of the emotional expressions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In Experiment 1, neutral-faced Noh masks having the <b>attached</b> <b>shadows</b> of the happy/sad masks were recognized as bearing happy/sad expressions, respectively. This was true for all four types of masks each of which represented a character differing in sex and age, even though the original characteristics of the masks also greatly influenced the evaluation of emotions. Experiment 2 further revealed that frontal Noh mask images having shadows of upward/downward tilted masks were evaluated as sad/happy, respectively. This was consistent with outcomes from preceding studies using actually tilted Noh mask images. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results from the two experiments concur that purely manipulating <b>attached</b> <b>shadows</b> of the different types of Noh masks significantly alters the emotion recognition. These findings go in line with the mysterious facial expressions observed in Western paintings, such as the elusive qualities of Mona Lisa's smile. They also agree with the aesthetic principle of Japanese traditional art "yugen (profound grace and subtlety) ", which highly appreciates subtle emotional expressions in the darkness...|$|R

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) The shadow {{field is}} a {{potential}} artistic device by which the divide between the unseen and seen can be given form. This exegesis will look {{into the role of}} the ‘darker’ aspects of human nature within an artistic treatment of the shadow field. Shadows can be cast or attached. Usually an originating object and its shadow are seen as separate and distinct entities with the shadow identified as a flat 2 D surface. Uses of the shadow form in art have tended to ignore the existence of a ‘shadow field’. A shadow field can be conceived as an unseen ‘continuous’ or infinite number of intervening shadow forms between an originating object and its cast or <b>attached</b> <b>shadow.</b> Its existence can be given proof by placing a semi-transparent film anywhere between the originating object and its final shadow. Artists such as James Turrell and Kumi Yamashita have explored the shadow but not the shadow field. The fact that such a field exists, has form, but remains largely unseen, opens the potential for it to be used artistically as a means to give conceptual representation to, for example, that which is ‘hidden’, ‘lost from view’, ‘there but not there’, ‘ubiquity’. To that end, this exegesis and accompanying practice asks the research question – ‘Is there a role for the shadow field as an artistic device for conceptual representation?...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{previous}} works on photometric stereo have shown how {{to recover the}} shape and reflectance properties of an object using multiple images taken under a fixed viewpoint and variable lighting conditions. However, most of them only dealt with a single point light source in each image. In this paper, we show how to perform photometric stereo with four images which are taken under distant but general lighting conditions. Our method {{is based on the}} representation that uses low-order spherical harmonics for Lambertian objects. <b>Attached</b> <b>shadows</b> are considered in this representation. We show that the lighting conditions can be estimated regardless of object shape and reflectance properties. The estimated illumination conditions can then help to recover the shape and reflectance properties. ...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{classical}} PST method almost always guarantees a visually plausible normal map, it in fact {{suffers from a}} serious accuracy problem: the simple Lambertian reflectance model adopted in PST does not strictly apply to most real-world textures, which exhibit specular reflection properties to various degrees. Even if the surface is indeed approximately Lambertian, other non-Lambertian errors can be introduced by {{the interaction of the}} light and the objects’ geometry, resulting in cast shadows, including self-shadowing, as well as interreflections. <b>Attached</b> <b>shadows</b> are also outside the simple shading model. Such non-Lambertian observations, regarded as “outliers” in a Lambertian-based linear model, may severely reduce the accuracy of LS results. Hence, a PST method that is robust to such non-Lambertian effects is needed in order to generate a high-quality normal map.|$|R
40|$|For object {{recognition}} under varying illumination con-ditions, we propose a method based on photometric align-ment.

40|$|Photometric Stereo methods seek to {{reconstruct}} the 3 d shape of an object from motionless images obtained with varying illumination. Most existing methods solve a restricted problem where the physical reflectance model, such as Lambertian reflectance, is known in advance. In contrast, we do not restrict ourselves to a specific reflectance model. Instead, we offer a method that works {{on a wide variety}} of reflectances. Our approach uses a simple yet uncommonly used property of the problem - the sought after normals are points on a unit hemisphere. We present a novel embedding method that maps pixels to normals on the unit hemisphere. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing manifold learning methods for the task of hemisphere embedding. We further show successful reconstructions of objects from a wide variety of reflectances including smooth, rough, diffuse and specular surfaces, even in the presence of significant <b>attached</b> <b>shadows.</b> Finally, we empirically prove that under these challenging settings we obtain more accurate shape reconstructions than existing methods...|$|R
40|$|Although {{significant}} {{work has}} been done in the field of face recognition, the performance of state-of-the art face recognition algorithms is not good enough to be effective in operational systems.

Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) is an effort to examine such issues to suitably guide future research in the area. This paper describes the efforts made at UMD in this direction. We present our results on several experiments suggested in FRGC. We believe that though pattern classification techniques play an extremely significant role in automatic face recognition under controlled conditions, physical modeling is required to generalize across varying situations. Accordingly, we describe a generative approach to recognize faces across varying illumination. Unlike most current methods, our method does not ignore shadows. Instead we use them to our benefit by modeling <b>attached</b> <b>shadows</b> in our formulation. 1...|$|R
40|$|A Photometric Image-Based Rendering (PIBR) con-cept is {{proposed}} that facilitates {{the generation of}} an image with an arbitrary illumination. Based on this concept, we aim to generate both diffuse and specular reflections. It {{is not necessary to}} explicitly recover 3 D shape and reflection properties of the scene. In order to control appearance changes caused by modifications in the lighting conditions, we utilize a set of real images taken in a variety of lighting conditions. Since the dif-fuse and specular reflection components have different characteristics, we separate these components and ap-ply different methods to each. A photometric lineariza-tion is introduced to control diffuse reflections as well as for separating the other components.

40|$|Traditional {{photometric}} stereo algorithms {{employ a}} Lambertian reflectance {{model with a}} varying albedo field and involve the appearance of only one object. In this paper, we generalize photometric stereo algorithms to handle all appearances of all objects in a class, in particular the human face class, by making use of the linear Lambertian property. A linear Lambertian object is one which is linearly spanned {{by a set of}} basis objects and has a Lambertian surface. The linear property leads to a rank constraint and, consequently, a factorization of an observation matrix that consists of exemplar images of different objects (e. g., faces of different subjects) under different, unknown illuminations. Integrability and symmetry constraints are used to fully recover the subspace bases using a novel linearized algorithm that takes the varying albedo field into account. The effectiveness of the linear Lambertian property is further investigated by using it for the problem of illumination-invariant face recognition using just one image. <b>Attached</b> <b>shadows</b> are incorporated in the model by a careful treatment of the inherent non-linearity in Lambert’s law.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method of}} learning generative models of objects from a set of images of the object under different, and unknown, illumination. Such a model allows us to approximate the objects’ appearance under a range of lighting conditions. This work {{is closely related to}} photometric stereo with unknown light sources and, in particular, to the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to estimate shape and albedo from multiple images up to a linear transformation [15]. Firstly we analyze and extend the SVD approach to this problem. We demonstrate that it applies to objects for which the dominant imaging effects are Lambertian reflectance with a distant light source and a background ambient term. To determine that this is a reasonable approximation we calculate the eigenvectors of the SVD on a set of real objects, under varying lighting conditions, and demonstrate that the first few eigenvectors account for most of the data in agreement with our predictions. We then analyze the linear ambiguities in the SVD approach and demonstrate that previous methods proposed to resolve them [15] are only valid under certain conditions. We discuss alternative possibilities and, in particular, demonstrate that knowledge of the object class is sufficient to resolve this problem. Secondly, we describe the use of surface consistency for putting constraints on the possible solutions. We prove that this constraint reduces the ambiguities to a subspace called the generalized bas relief ambiguity (GBR) which is inherent in the Lambertian reflectance function (and which can be shown to exist even if <b>attached</b> and cast <b>shadows</b> are present [3]). We demonstrate the use of surface consistency to solve for the shape and albedo up to a GBR and describe, and implement, a variety of additional assumptions to resolve the GBR.

40|$|We analyze {{theoretically}} the subspace best approximating {{images of}} a convex Lambertian object taken from the same viewpoint, but under different distant illumination conditions. Since the lighting is an arbitrary function, the space of all possible images is formally infinite-dimensional. However, previous empirical work has shown that images of largely diffuse objects actually lie very close to a five-dimensional subspace. In this paper, we analytically construct the principal component analysis for {{images of a}} convex Lambertian object, explicitly taking <b>attached</b> <b>shadows</b> into account, and find the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues with respect to lighting variability. Our analysis makes use of an analytic formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical-harmonic coefficients of the illumination and shows, under appropriate assumptions, that the principal components or eigenvectors are identical to the spherical harmonic basis functions evaluated at the surface normal vectors. Our main contribution is in extending these results to the singleviewpoint case, showing how the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues are affected when only a limited subset (the upper hemisphere) of normals is available and the spherical harmonics are no longer orthonormal over the restricted domain. Our results are very close, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to previous empirical observations and represent the first essentially complete theoretical explanation of these observations.
