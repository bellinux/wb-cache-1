5|$|Several {{species have}} a hot to very acrid taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. Often, they are parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes,</b> <b>they</b> are used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the labial palpi are prominent, three-segmented, {{springing}} {{from under}} the head and curving {{up in front of}} the face. There is great variation in morphology of labial palpi in different families of Lepidoptera; sometimes the palpi are separate <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are connivent and form a beak, but they are always independently movable. In other cases, the labial palpi may not be erect but porrect (projecting forward horizontally).|$|E
5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and {{retainers}} (binke 賓客) {{who lived on}} the property of a host in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other social groups, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and non-routine work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others could work as spies, scholarly protégés, or astrologers.|$|E
5000|$|On AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said, [...] "This {{is a group}} where interplay trumps all, which <b>sometimes</b> means <b>they</b> ride a groove, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> {{lay back}} <b>and</b> solo, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> cluster around a {{microphone}} <b>and</b> harmonize, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> just enjoy the ruckus they cause.... This nimbleness, along with little bits of color like the sly marimba on [...] "Calyphornya", is why No Guts, No Glory can seem simultaneously fresh and familiar." ...|$|R

25|$|Boats used in Gaelic Ireland include canoes, currachs, sailboats and Irish galleys. Ferryboats {{were used}} to cross wide rivers and are often {{mentioned}} in the Brehon Laws as subject to strict regulations.

25|$|Yellow flowers such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and marsh {{marigold}} were placed at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn {{at the doors}} and windows <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> were made into bouquets, garlands or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.|$|E
50|$|Even so, a clear {{distinction}} cannot always be made.

25|$|Woodward {{initially}} assigned Leedsichthys to the Acipenseroidea, {{considering it}} {{related to the}} sturgeon, having the large gill rakers and branching finrays in common. In 1905, he changed this to the Pachycormidae. The Pachycormidae have a somewhat uncertain position. Often they are considered very basal Teleostei — if so, Leedsichthys would be the largest known teleost — others see them {{as members of a}} Pachycormiformes forming the sister group of the Teleostei, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are seen as even more basal Amiiformes. In the latter case the extant bowfin, Amia calva, would be the closest living relative of Leedsichthys.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} janissaries, in 1389 the Ottoman army {{introduced}} {{a system of}} conscription: when needed, every town and village were obliged to provide a fully equipped conscript at the recruiting office created by {{the order of the}} Sultan. This new force of irregular infantrymen was called the azabs and they were used in many ways: to build roads and bridges for the army, to support the supplies for the front-line, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> were even used as cannon fodder to slow down enemy advance. The Başıbozuk, who were also called Delibaş ("crazy head"), were a branch of the azabs and were especially recruited among the homeless and criminals. They were fierce, undisciplined, and specialized in close combat.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the time}} of the ancient Serer Lamanes, the Serer people have {{represented}} the axis of the world {{in the form of a}} stele, symbolizing the steles of Roog. In the Serer home, sometimes in the courtyard, they represent the most sacred place of the house servicing as the centre of gravity of divine energies and one of the poles of the coronation. In the home, these steles are made of wooden slabs, forming a sacred wood. Sometimes they are raised steles supported by three rods <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are just green trees. There symbolism can be celestial or terrestrial depending on the arrangement of rods that surround them. If there are twelve rods arranged in a circle, they symbolize the celestial world, four rods forming a square symbolizes the earthly world. They are always built based on the tenets of Serer symbolism, and form the family shrine devoted to the supreme being (see Serer ancient history).|$|E
25|$|Through the 18th century, {{the area}} was ruled {{variously}} by Spanish, French, and British colonial governments. The colonists imported African slaves as laborers. Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of free people of color (gens de couleur libres), mostly multiracial descendants of European men and enslaved women, and their children. In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men. Even as more European women joined the settlements, the men had interracial unions among women of African descent (and increasingly, multiracial descent), {{both before and after}} marriages to European women. Often the European men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> settled property on them; they often freed the mothers and their children if enslaved, as part of contracts of plaçage. With this social capital, the free people of color became artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. After Great Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris (1763). They also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country and Quebec.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{research}} has been conducted on adults, children can be bystanders too. A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in 2007 came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress. These include: trivialisation, dissociation, embarrassment association, busy working priority, compliance with a competitive norm, audience modelling, and responsibility transfer. In a further study, Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed: (a) noticing that something is wrong, i.e., children pay selective attention to their environment, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> don't tune in on a distressed peer if they're in a hurry or their view is obstructed, (b) interpreting a need for help—sometimes children think others are just playing rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance, (c) feeling empathy, i.e., having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed, children might feel sorry for an injured peer, or angry about unwarranted aggression (empathic anger), (d) processing the school's moral frames—Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children's behavior in bystander situations (the definition of a good student, tribe caring, gender stereotypes, and social-hierarchy-dependent morality), (e) scanning for social status and relations, i.e., students were less likely to intervene if they didn't define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant social category as the victim, or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressors—conversely, lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around, (f) condensing motives for action, such as considering a number of factors such as possible benefits and costs, and (g) acting, i.e., all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not. It is striking how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes.|$|E

500|$|In many countries, {{national}} and regional poultry shows are held where enthusiasts exhibit their birds which are judged on certain phenotypical breed traits as specified by their respective breed standards. The idea of poultry exhibition may have originated after cockfighting was made illegal, {{as a way of}} maintaining a competitive element in poultry husbandry. Breed standards were drawn up for egg-laying, meat-type, and purely ornamental birds, aiming for uniformity. Sometimes, poultry shows are part of general livestock shows, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are separate events such as the annual [...] "National Championship Show" [...] in the United Kingdom organised by the Poultry Club of Great Britain.|$|E
500|$|Poet and biographer John Berryman {{suggested}} that there were three basic variations, or [...] "norms", of Crane's narrative style. [...] The first, being [...] "flexible, swift, abrupt and nervous", is best exemplified in The Red Badge of Courage, while the second ("supple majesty") is believed to relate to [...] "The Open Boat", and the third ("much more closed, circumstantial and 'normal' in feeling and syntax") to later works such as The Monster. Crane's work, however, cannot be determined by style solely on chronology. [...] Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters, but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction. [...] Crane's writing, both fiction and nonfiction, is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated, vivid and intense. [...] The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective and ellipses between and within sentences. [...] Similarly, omission plays a large part in Crane's work; the names of his protagonists are not commonly used <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> are not named at all.|$|E
