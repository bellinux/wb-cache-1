40|$|Germany, {{operates}} different state-of-the-art observing {{sites in}} Chile. To manage observatory operations and observation transfer, ESO developed an end-to-end Data Flow System, from Phase I proposal preparation {{to the final}} archiving of quality-controlled science, calibration and engineering data. All information pertinent to the data flow is stored in the central databases at ESO headquarters and replicated {{to and from the}} observatory database servers. In the ESO's data flow model one can distinguish two groups of databases; the front-end databases, which are replicated from the ESO headquarters to the observing sites, and the back-end databases, where replication is directed from the observations to the headquarters. A part of the front-end database contains the Observation Blocks (OBs), which are sequences of operations necessary to perform an observation, such as instrument setting, target, filter and/or grism ID, exposure time, etc. Observatory operations rely on fast <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>OB</b> database and quick recovery strategies in case of a database outage. After several years of operations, those databases have grown considerably. There was a necessity in reviewing the database architecture to find a solution that support scalability of the operational databases. We present the newly developed concept of distributing the OBs between two databases, containing operational and historical information. We present the architectural design in which OBs in operational databases will be archived periodically at ESO headquarters. This will remedy the scalability problems and keep the size of the operational databases small. The historical databases will only exist in the headquarters, for archiving purposes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn easy to {{implement}} and convenient method {{to measure the}} mean size of oil bodies (OBs) in plant seeds is proposed using a pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFGNMR) approach. PFGNMR is a well-known technique used to study either free or restricted diffusion of molecules. As triacylglycerols (TAG) are confined in OBs, analysis of their diffusion properties is a well-suited experimental approach <b>to</b> determine <b>OB</b> sizes. In fact, at long diffusion time, TAG mean squared displacement {{is limited by the}} size of the domain where these molecules are confined. In order <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the <b>OB</b> size distribution, strong intensities of magnetic field gradients are generally required. In this work we demonstrate for the first time that a standard liquid-phase NMR probe equipped with a weak-intensity gradient coil can be used to determine the mean size of OBs. Average sizes were measured for several seeds, and OB diameters obtained by PFGNMR were fully consistent with previously published values obtained by microscopy techniques. Moreover, this approach provided evidence of TAG transfer through the network of interconnected OBs, which is dependent on the ability of adjacent membranes to open diffusion routes between OBs. The main advantage of the NMR method is that it does not require any sample preparation and experiments are performed with whole seeds directly introduced in a standard NMR tube...|$|R

40|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed that chondrocytes and osteoblasts are two separate lineages with hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCs) being the terminal stage of chondrocyte differentiation, culminating in apoptosis. However, {{we have shown}} that HCs {{can contribute to the}} full osteoblast (Obs) lineage in vivo. MMP 14 is a transmembrane matrix metalloproteinase responsible for matrix remodeling that is highly expressed at the chondro‐osseous junction which coincides with the transition from HCs <b>to</b> <b>Obs.</b> Knockout of Mmp 14 in mice results in impaired endochondral ossification. To test whether loss of MMP 14 has an impact on the HC <b>to</b> <b>Obs</b> transition, we have employed a genetic recombination approach to track and compare the fate of HCs in wild‐type and Mmp 14 conditional and total null mutants. Both complete and conditional deletion of MMP 14 activity results in increased number of HC‐descendent cells in the trabecular bone. Surprisingly, conditional knockout of Mmp 14 in HC‐descendent cells results in increased trabecular bone formation. Our results suggest that MMP 14 in general negatively regulates HC <b>to</b> <b>Obs</b> transition. postprin...|$|R

40|$|The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) listing rule 3. 1 {{requires}} {{listed companies}} to immediately disclose price sensitive {{information to the}} market via the ASX’s Company Announcements Platform (CAP) prior to release through other disclosure channels. Since 1999, to improve the communication process, the ASX has permitted third-party mediation in the disclosure process {{that leads to the}} release of an Open Briefing (OB) through CAP. An OB is an interview between senior executives of the firm and an Open Briefing analyst employed by Orient Capital Pty Ltd (broaching topics such as current profit and outlook). Motivated by an absence of research on factors that influence firms <b>to</b> use <b>OBs</b> as a discretionary disclosure channel, this study examines (1) Why do firms choose to release information to the market via OBs?, (2) What are the firm characteristics that explain the discretionary use of OBs as a disclosure channel?, and (3) What are the disclosure attributes that influence firms’ decisions <b>to</b> regularly use <b>OBs</b> as a disclosure channel? Based on agency and information economics theories, a theoretical framework is developed to address research questions. This theoretical framework comprises disclosure environments such as firm characteristics and external factors, disclosure attributes and disclosure consequences. In order to address the first research question, the study investigates (i) the purpose of using OBs, (2) whether firms use <b>OBs</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>information</b> relating to previous public announcements, and (3) whether firms use <b>OBs</b> <b>to</b> provide routine or non-routine disclosures. In relation to the second and third research questions, hypotheses are developed to test factors expected to explain the discretionary use of OBs and firms’ decisions <b>to</b> regularly use <b>OBs,</b> and <b>to</b> explore the factors influencing the nature of OB disclosure. Content analysis and logistic regression models are used to investigate the research questions and test the hypotheses. Data are drawn from a hand-collected population of 1863 OB announcements issued by 239 listed firms between 2000 and 2010. The results show that types of information disclosed via an OB announcement are principally on matters relating to corporate strategies and performance and outlook. Most OB announcements are linked with a previous related announcement, with the lag between announcements significantly longer for loss-making firms than profitmaking firms. The main results show that firms which tend to be larger, have an analyst following, and have higher growth opportunities, are more likely <b>to</b> release <b>OBs.</b> Further, older firms and firms that release OB announcements containing good news, historical information and less complex information tend <b>to</b> be regular <b>OB</b> users. Lastly, firms more likely to disclose strategic <b>information</b> via <b>OBs</b> tend <b>to</b> operate in industries facing greater uncertainty, do not have analysts following, and have higher growth opportunities are less likely to disclose good news, historical information and complex <b>information</b> via <b>OBs.</b> This study is expected to contribute to disclosure literature in terms of disclosure attributes and firm characteristics that influence behaviour in this unique (OB) disclosure channel. With regard to practical significance, regulators can gain an understanding of how OBs are disclosed which can assist them in monitoring the use of OBs and improving the effectiveness of communications with stakeholders. In addition, investors can have a better comprehension of <b>information</b> contained in <b>OB</b> announcements, which may in turn better facilitate their investment decisions...|$|R

40|$|Processing {{of sensory}} {{information}} is substantially shaped by centrifugal, or feedback, projections from higher cortical areas, yet the functional properties of these projections are poorly characterized. Here, we used genetically-encoded calcium sensors (GCaMPs) to functionally image activation of centrifugal projections targeting the olfactory bulb (OB). The OB receives massive centrifugal input from cortical areas {{but there has}} been as yet no characterization of their activity in vivo. We focused on projections <b>to</b> the <b>OB</b> from the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), a major source of cortical feedback <b>to</b> the <b>OB.</b> We expressed GCaMP selectively in AON projection neurons using a mouse line expressing Cre recombinase (Cre) in these neurons and Cre-dependent viral vectors injected into AON, allowing us to image GCaMP fluorescence signals from their axon terminals in the OB. Electrical stimulation of AON evoked large fluorescence signals that could be imaged from the dorsal OB surface in vivo. Surprisingly, odorants also evoked large signals that were transient and coupled to odorant inhalation both in the anesthetized and awake mouse, suggesting that feedback from AON <b>to</b> the <b>OB</b> is rapid and robust across different brain states. The strength of AON feedback signals increased during wakefulness, suggesting a state-dependent modulation of cortical feedback <b>to</b> the <b>OB.</b> Two-photon GCaMP imaging revealed that different odorants activated different subsets of centrifugal AON axons and could elicit both excitation and suppression in different axons, indicating a surprising richness in the representation of odor information by cortical feedback <b>to</b> the <b>OB.</b> Finally, we found that activating neuromodulatory centers such as basal forebrain drove AON inputs <b>to</b> the <b>OB</b> independent of odorant stimulation. Our results point to the AON as a multifunctional cortical area that provides ongoing feedback <b>to</b> the <b>OB</b> and also serves as a descending relay for other neuromodulatory systems...|$|R
