Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing--I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some <b>accelerating</b> <b>power.</b> I now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it--that is to say, in regard to my power of ascending--for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth's attraction would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.|$|E

In these applications, power {{semiconductor devices}} are required to handle large currents and as a result they tend to dissipate large amounts of heat. In addition, the device and their attendant packages must be capable of withstanding power cycling for many years. Traditionally, devices have used high lead die attaches for high electrical and thermal conductivity. Now, with the drive in industry to replace lead-contained solder with lead-free solder alternatives, there is a drive to assess lead-free solder to use as the die attach in power device packages. This dissertation assesses the reliability of Sn 3. 5 Ag 0. 8 Cu lead-free die attach under <b>accelerated</b> <b>power</b> cycling conditions, especially the effect of surface finishes from the die and the substrate on die attach reliability because of the thin die attach thickness (< 100 mm), which is expected to increase the influence of intermetallics formed at the interfaces on the joint reliability. The main part of the thesis is to evaluate the power-cycle reliability of Sn 3. 5 Ag 0. 8 Cu die attach in power MOSFET modules subjected to <b>power</b> cycling. <b>Accelerated</b> <b>power</b> cycling tests, failure analysis, thermal transient analysis and thermo-mechanical modeling were conducted. 3 D thermal analysis correlated an increase in the package thermal impedance to the amount of crack propagation and determined that crack initiation is the limiting process under power cycling. In the experiments, die tilt was observed and die attach cracks always occurred near the middle of the bond line on the side with thicker die attach. This is not addressed in typical thermo-mechanical simulations on solder joint reliability. Such simulations predicted that the thinner side exhibits higher stress than the thicker side and were expected to be easier to fail. Microstructural characterization provided evidences that microstructure of die attach changes with thickness. First, a higher Ag 3 Sn concentration was observed in the thinner die attach due to dissolution of Ag from backside die. Second, a more uniform distribution of Ag 3 Sn precipitates exists in the thinner die attach due to faster cooling. So a thinner Sn 3. 5 Ag 0. 8 Cu die attach is more resistant to fatigue failure even under higher stresses...|$|R
