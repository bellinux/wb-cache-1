60|$|When the Head of {{a limited}} {{liability}} company, paying four per cent., is cheered on his saintly way to prayers, not only by four form-rooms of boys waiting punishment, but by his trusted prefects, he can either <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>explanation</b> or go his road with dignity, while the senior house-master glares like an excited cat and points out to a white and trembling mathematical master that certain methods--not his, thank God---usually produce certain results.

6000|$|... 57 It {{is hardly}} {{necessary}} to say, that I am not contending for any such [...] absurdity as {{that we actually}} “ought to have known” and considered [...] the case of every individual man, past, present, and future, before [...] affirming {{that all men are}} mortal: although this interpretation has [...] been, strangely enough, put upon the preceding observations. There [...] is no difference between me and Archbishop Whately, or any other [...] defender of the syllogism, on the practical part of the matter; I am [...] only pointing out an inconsistency in the logical theory of it, as [...] conceived by almost all writers. I do not say that a person who [...] affirmed, before the Duke of Wellington was born, that all men are [...] mortal, knew that the Duke of Wellington was mortal; but I do say [...] that he asserted it; and I <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>explanation</b> of the apparent [...] logical fallacy, of adducing in proof of the Duke of Wellington’s [...] mortality, a general statement which presupposes it. Finding no [...] sufficient resolution of this difficulty in any of the writers on [...] Logic, I have attempted to supply one.|$|E
60|$|When the American {{war began}} troops were {{sent out to}} Canada, and when I was in the provinces more troops were then expected. The matter was much talked of, {{as a matter of}} course, in Canada, and it had been {{discussed}} in England before I left. I had seen much said about it in the English papers since, and it also had become the subject of very hot question among the politicians of the Northern States. The measure had at that time given more umbrage to the North than anything else done or said by England {{from the beginning of the}} war up to that time, except the declaration made by Lord John Russell in the House of Commons as to the neutrality to be preserved by England between the two belligerents. The argument used by the Northern States was this: if France collects men and material of war in the neighborhood of England, England considers herself injured, calls for an explanation, and talks of invasion. Therefore, as England is now collecting men and material of war in our neighborhood, we will consider ourselves injured. It does not suit us to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>explanation,</b> because it is not our habit to interfere with other nations. We will not pretend to say that we think we are to be invaded. But as we clearly are injured, we will express our anger at that injury, and when the opportunity shall come will take advantage of having that new grievance.|$|E

6000|$|I {{belong in}} Cleveland, Ohio. One winter's night, two years ago, I reached home just after dark, in a driving snow-storm, {{and the first}} thing I heard when I entered the house was that my dearest boyhood friend and schoolmate, John B. Hackett, had died the day before, and that his last {{utterance}} had been a desire that I would take his remains home to his poor old father and mother in Wisconsin. I was greatly shocked and grieved, but {{there was no time to}} waste in emotions; I must start at once. I took the card, marked [...] "Deacon Levi Hackett, Bethlehem, Wisconsin," [...] and hurried off through the whistling storm to the railway station. Arrived there I found the long white-pine box which had been described to me; I fastened the card to it with some tacks, saw it put safely aboard the express car, and then ran into the eating-room to provide myself with a sandwich and some cigars. When I returned, presently, there was my coffin-box back again, apparently, and a young fellow examining around it, with a card in his hands, and some tacks and a hammer! I was astonished and puzzled. He began to nail on his card, and I rushed out to the express car, in a good deal of a state of mind, to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>explanation.</b> But no--there was my box, all right, in the express car; it hadn't been disturbed. [The fact is that without my suspecting it a prodigious mistake had been made. I was carrying off a box of guns which that young fellow had come to the station to ship to a rifle company in Peoria, Illinois, and he had got my corpse!] Just then the conductor sung out [...] "All aboard," [...] and I jumped into the express car and got a comfortable seat on a bale of buckets. The expressman was there, hard at work,--a plain man of fifty, with a simple, honest, good-natured face, and a breezy, practical heartiness in his general style. As the train moved off a stranger skipped into the car and set a package of peculiarly mature and capable Limburger cheese on one end of my coffin-box--I mean my box of guns. That is to say, I know now that it was Limburger cheese, but at that time I never had heard of the article in my life, and of course was wholly ignorant of its character. Well, we sped through the wild night, the bitter storm raged on, a cheerless misery stole over me, my heart went down, down, down! The old expressman made a brisk remark or two about the tempest and the arctic weather, slammed his sliding doors to, and bolted them, closed his window down tight, and then went bustling around, here and there and yonder, setting things to rights, and all the time contentedly humming [...] "Sweet By and By," [...] in a low tone, and flatting a good deal. Presently I began to detect a most evil and searching odor stealing about on the frozen air. This depressed my spirits still more, because of course I attributed it to my poor departed friend. There was something infinitely saddening about his calling himself to my remembrance in this dumb pathetic way, so it was hard to keep the tears back. Moreover, it distressed me on account of the old expressman, who, I was afraid, might notice it. However, he went humming tranquilly on, and gave no sign; and for this I was grateful. Grateful, yes, but still uneasy; and soon I began to feel more and more uneasy every minute, for every minute that went by that odor thickened up the more, and got to be more and more gamey and hard to stand. Presently, having got things arranged to his satisfaction, the expressman got some wood and made up a tremendous fire in his stove.|$|E
