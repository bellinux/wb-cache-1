However, few emipirical studies have quantified the relative contribution of seed dormancy and {{seed dispersal}} on annual plant diversity. In agroecosystems, weeds which are mostly annual species producing dormant seeds can be found both in <b>annual</b> row <b>crops</b> and in semi-natural habitats such as grasslands (fig. 1). Spatial mass effect from grasslands to <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> {{have been reported to}} support weed diversity in <b>annual</b> <b>crops.</b> Similarly, the presence of grasslands in crop successions increases weed diversity in the following <b>annual</b> <b>crops.</b> Both temporal and spatial dispersal from grasslands may thus support weed diversity in arable crops.

40|$|Weed {{communities}} are most strongly {{affected by the}} characteristics {{and management of the}} current crop. Crop rotation may thus be used to prevent the repeated selection of particular weed species. While weed {{communities are}} frequently compared among <b>annual</b> <b>crops,</b> {{little is known about the}} differences between <b>annual</b> and perennial <b>crops</b> that may be included in the rotations. Moreover, nearly all existing studies (17 articles reviewed) are based on local field experiments rather than commercial fields. We compared the weed composition in perennial alfalfas (Medicago sativa) and six annual crops: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), oilseed rape (Brassica napus), pea (Pisum sativum), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) using data from 632 commercial fields in western France. Weed species composition showed the strongest dissimilarities between perennial alfalfas and all <b>annual</b> <b>crops,</b> followed by the well-known differences between autumn- and spring/summer-sown <b>annual</b> <b>crops.</b> Indicator Species Analysis showed that most weed species either preferred perennial alfalfas (including Taraxacum officinale, Veronica persica, Crepis spp., Poa trivialis, Silene latifolia, Capsella bursa-pastoris and Picris spp.) or <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> (including Mercurialis annua, Galium aparine, Fallopia convolvulus, Chenopodium album and Cirsium arvense). Perennial alfalfas thus suppressed many weeds that are widespread (and sometimes problematic) in <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> while favouring other species. Shifted weed composition and reduced frequency of several noxious weeds suggest that perennial alfalfas may be used as a valuable part of integrated weed management, reducing the need for herbicides and sustaining plant and animal diversity in agricultural landscapes...|$|R

40|$|Gum arabic {{production}} in Sudan has {{developed over the}} years in a well-established traditional bush-fallow system in which the gum tree (Acacia senegal) is rotated with <b>annual</b> <b>crops.</b> Following the Sahel drought, the gum area has suffered from deforestation and gum production has declined. Several programs have been developed to stimulate gum production; however, many original adopters have disadopted gum production and the bush-fallow system. In this paper we apply a logit model to study the decision-making behavior of farmers in west Sudan and to identify the socio-economic factors influencing disadoption of gum production and gum agroforestry system. Variables that measure farmer’s wealth were found significant in explaining the disadoption behavior. Off-farm work was also found to positively influence the disadoption decision. Results show that a higher level of income from <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> decreases the probability of disadoption, which suggests that <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> and gum production do not compete but rather complement each other within the farm household economy. Therefore, policy measures aiming to boost the production of <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> in the region might reduce seasonal labor migration and accordingly stimulate gum production...|$|R

40|$|Carbon and {{nitrogen}} cycles in grassland, <b>annual</b> <b>cropping</b> and integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems control soil quality and regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The {{aim of this}} study was to review the knowledge on driving factors controlling soil organic carbon (OC) accumulation and greenhouse gas emissions in tropical and subtropical Brazilian ecosystems under ICL and <b>annual</b> <b>cropping</b> systems. The ICL system has a significant potential to promote soil OC sequestration, mainly due to biomass addition but also because stabilization by physical protection and organo-mineral associations. The soil OC accumulation in ICL, compared to <b>annual</b> <b>cropping,</b> can extend up to 100 cm depth. In general, emission of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from soil is higher in ICL than in <b>annual</b> <b>cropping,</b> although the opposite may also occur. The N 2 O emission in ICL, however, can be offset by soil OC accumulation, although not always. Strategies to further increase soil OC sequestration and curb N 2 O emissions must be developed for ICL, which is a system that is being encouraged in Brazil because of the many ecosystem services and economical benefits that it provides. 201...|$|R

2500|$|During the 20th century, the Lacandon {{has had a}} {{dramatic}} increase in population and along with it, severe deforestation. [...] The population of municipalities in this area, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, Ocosingo and Palenque have risen from 11,000 in 1920 to over 376,000 in 2000. Migrants include Ch'ol, Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal indigenous peoples along with mestizos, Guatemalan refugees and others. Most of these migrants are peasant farmers, who cut forest to plant crops.

The characteristics that mostly determined the tolerance of the <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> to the shade were the high interception of solar radiation, the coefficient of light and darkness as well as increased levels of chlorophyll a and b, the reduced ratio of chlorophyll a/b.

Planting E. camaldulensis with cowpeas and maize had no marked effect on the yields of the two <b>annual</b> <b>crops.</b> Sole clean-weeded E. camaldulensis had significantly thicker circumference than the Eucalyptus in the other treatments, but was comparable to Eucalyptus interplanted with the <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> in terms of branching habit. However, E. camaldulensis interplanted with maize showed a slightly higher performance (branching and circumference) than that interplanted with cowpeas. This was probably related to the fertilizer added to the maize/£. camaldulensis intercrop since no fertilizer was added to the cowpea/£. camaldulensis intercrop. Management factors such as clean weeding in sole Eucalyptus markedly increased tree performance as observed through parameters of stem circumference and branching compared to those of the unweeded sole Eucalyptus situation. Neither tree branching pattern, height growth nor soil moisture were significantly affected by intercropping with <b>annual</b> <b>crops.</b> Undersowing <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> to E. camaldulensis will facilitate maximum utilization of land and light {{in the early years of}} E. camaldulensis woodlot establishment.
