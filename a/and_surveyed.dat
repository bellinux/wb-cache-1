5|$|First {{recorded}} <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> in 1840, North Island {{has been}} a seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishermen {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, and this remains the principal focus of human activity on the island. There is also a small amount of tourism, though for the most part it is reserved as conservation habitat for vegetation communities and rare birds.|$|E
5|$|A {{large dam}} across the Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E
5|$|Worlebury Camp {{has been}} {{explored}} {{at various times}} {{over a period of}} 150 years. From 1851 to 1852, Charles Dymond, Edwin Martin Atkins, and Francis Warre excavated <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> Worlebury Camp. Dymond returned in 1880 to continue the excavation, which lasted until 1881. Another century passed before the Woodspring Museum from Weston-super-Mare excavated more of Worlebury camp in 1987 to 1988. Finally, in 1998, the Avon Extensive Urban Study team performed the latest (as of 2008) assessment of the site.|$|E

5|$|Explorer and {{archaeologist}} Alfred Maudslay visited Quiriguá {{for three}} days in 1881; {{they were the first}} pre-Columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology. He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor excavations, made paper and plaster molds of the hieroglyphic inscriptions <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> the principal sculptures; these molds were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum, with casts being transferred to the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{during the}} American {{occupation}} of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel {{were the first}} confirmed to have reached the summit Pico de Orizaba, the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set {{what may have been}} a 50-year American alpine altitude record. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first government-sponsored expedition to venture into the upper Yellowstone region that was later to become Yellowstone National Park. Heavy winter snowpack in the Absaroka Range of Wyoming prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau, forcing them to divert to the south and cross Union Pass at the northern end of the Wind River Range. After negotiating the pass the expedition entered Jackson Hole <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> the Teton Range, now within Grand Teton National Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Brisbane {{residents}} {{petitioned the}} New South Wales Government, which controlled the Queensland area until Queensland's separation in 1859, {{to establish a}} lighthouse on Cape Moreton. The government also wanted to encourage ships to use the broader and safer northern passage. Planning for the structure therefore commenced in 1852. The site was selected <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> in 1853, and the lighthouse was designed in 1854 by Edmund Blacket the New South Wales Colonial Architect of the time. However, Blacket resigned on 10 June 1854, for the private market, and left the office on 25 August. The office remained vacant until 1 October 1854, when Blacket was succeeded by William Weaver. Drawings for the tower which were completed in September 1854 were signed by Alexander Beazeley, Foreman of Works in the Colonial Architect's office. The tower was finally built during the office of Alexander Dawson who succeeded Weaver in 1856, and signed further drawings made in April 1856.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 and 1927, Norwegian Eyvind Tofte circumnavigated <b>and</b> <b>surveyed</b> {{the island}} from Odd I. However, {{he was also}} {{prevented}} from landing. The Norwegian whale-ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic, in part for research and in part to claim land for Norway. The latter was motivated by the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic, and Christensen hoped {{to be able to}} establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges and so at least the taxes went to his home country. The first expedition to land on the island was the Christensen-financed second Norvegia expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad. They landed on 2 February 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. Larsen attempted to land again in 1931, but was hindered by pack ice. On 6 March 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency.|$|E
