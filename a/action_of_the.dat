40|$|In this paper, an {{electric}} vehicle (EV) charging competition, among EV aggregators that perform coordinated EV charging, is explored while {{taking into consideration}} potential non-ideal <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aggregators. In the coordinated EV charging strategy presented in this paper, each aggregator determines EV charging start time and charging energy profiles to minimize overall EV charging energy cost by including consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighboring aggregators. <b>The</b> competitive interactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aggregators are modeled by developing a two-stage non-cooperative game among the aggregators. The game is then studied under prospect theory to examine <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> non-ideal <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aggregators in selecting EV charging start times according to subjectively evaluating their opponents' actions. It is shown that the non-cooperative interactions among the aggregators lead to a subgame perfect ϵ-Nash equilibrium when {{the game is played}} with either ideal, or non-ideal, <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aggregators. A case study presented demonstrates that <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coordinated EV charging strategy, in terms of energy cost savings and peak-to-average ratio reductions, are significantly resilient to non-ideal <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aggregators.
