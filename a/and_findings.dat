5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there were}} so many {{uncritical}} and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, <b>and</b> <b>findings</b> involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E
