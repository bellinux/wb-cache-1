5|$|Sejanus's {{position}} {{was not quite}} that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD25 to Tiberius's niece, Livilla, though under pressure quickly withdrew the request.

5|$|Compared to {{neighbouring}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few {{records of}} 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source {{from the period}} is the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to KennethII (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries. In addition to this, later king lists survive. The earliest genealogical records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date {{from the end of}} the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.|$|E

Recalled to Sword Base, Noble Team is guided underground to an ancient artifact that Halsey believes is key to winning the war against the Covenant.

40|$|Abstract Local {{discriminant}} embedding (LDE) only utilizes <b>the</b> local <b>information</b> <b>and</b> ignores <b>the</b> nonlocal <b>information.</b> Although linear {{discriminant analysis}} (LDA) utilizes <b>the</b> local <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nonlocal <b>information</b> simultaneously, it treats these two kinds of information equally. As we know, <b>the</b> local <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nonlocal <b>information</b> are both effective for feature extraction, but they have different roles in feature extraction. To utilize <b>the</b> local <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nonlocal <b>information</b> simultaneously <b>and</b> utilize them distinctively, a new feature extraction approach called weighted linear embedding (WLE) is pro-posed by using the Gaussian weighting. Further, a method to set the optimal parameter of the Gaussian weighting is put forward. WLE is evaluated on YALE, FERET face databases, the PolyU palmprint database, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> PolyU finger-knuckle-print database. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WLE...|$|R

5|$|The Family Edition, {{like the}} prior version, {{includes}} parental controls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> filtering feature. Parental controls {{come with a}} list of objectionable sites, separated into 32 categories. The list is updated every two weeks by Norton LiveUpdate. Using the list alone, Norton only blocks sites present on the list. Consequently, Norton may not block sites until the next update. Parents can customize the list, adding or removing sites. A list of allowed sites can be created to restrict children to those specific sites. This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. Children can be restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. A parental controls profile can be set up for each child, and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator. Internet usage and violations are noted in a report presented to parents. PC Magazine found that enabling parental controls added a minute to a computer's boot time.|$|E
5|$|The Sûreté's {{indirect}} {{penetration of}} military affairs involved linking the military intelligence service (SRM) to the Sûreté <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> provided by it, thereby making itself {{dependent on the}} political information and even political judgement and agenda of the civilian authorities. The central SRM then relayed this information to its local branches {{as part of its}} SRM Bulletin. As a result of the uprising, the SRM became more closely linked to the Sûreté and its methodology and philosophy in of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial activity. It was further resolved to have all officers involved in studying revolutionary parties. The focus widened from observing only internal army activities to include developments among Vietnamese anti-colonial organisations at large. General Aubert cited complacency and laziness as a factor in the ineffectiveness of the officers in implement French intelligence strategy. He further asserted that the flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not as smooth as desired. He felt that his men were often not tactful and discreet enough; citing a lack of language skills or interest in talking to their Vietnamese colleagues in an attempt to extricate information. Aubert also believed that the Vietnamese troops were effective in hiding their anti-colonial sentiments from their French colleagues.|$|E
5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. One {{of the advantages of}} working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E
