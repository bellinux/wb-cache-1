In late 1880, soon after her mother's death, Ellen awoke. She later married and had at least five children.|$|E
5|$|Hebron {{glass is}} an <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> both {{domestic}} and foreign tourists. Today, however, due to ongoing export problems, the decline in tourism, and restrictions on Palestinian freedom of movement {{in the aftermath of}} the Second Intifada, industry production has suffered. According to Nazmi al-Ju'bah, the director of RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation, under these circumstances, the survival of the Hebron glass industry is in question.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, kibbutz Beit Guvrin, {{was founded}} on the former town's lands. The {{excavated}} areas of the successive Judahite, Hellenistic, Roman-Byzantine and Crusader towns {{have been included in}} a large Israeli national park with major points of <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> tourists. There is little focus on any traces of Arab presence within the park, the period from the 7th century onward receiving little attention.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural attractions, human involvement in the area is also responsible for making tourism {{a large part of}} the regional economy. Every year, around 6.5—7million people visit the Zenkō-ji Buddhist template in Nagano. It is believed that visiting the template will grant salvation. This has resulted in the head temple of the Tendai sect being a significant <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> tourists throughout its 1,400-year history.|$|E

5|$|The ARoS Art Museum, the Old Town Museum and Tivoli Friheden {{are among}} Denmark's top tourist attractions. With a {{combined}} total of almost 1.4million visitors {{they represent the}} driving force behind tourism but other venues such as Moesgård Museum and Kvindemuseet are also popular. The city's extensive shopping facilities are also said to be a major <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> tourists, as are festivals, especially NorthSide and SPOT. Many visitors arrive on cruise ships: in 2012, 18 vessels visited the port with over 38,000 passengers.|$|E
5|$|The Pont du Gard {{has been}} a tourist <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> centuries. The {{outstanding}} quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an obligatory stop for French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), {{many of whom have}} left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as an object of historical importance and French national pride.|$|E

5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a {{telescope}} at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|The town {{used to be}} {{the focus}} of {{thriving}} river business and was an important stop on the Dublin to Limerick navigation. It supported a number of large industries, most notably a maltings and distillery, which are now defunct. Tourism has supplanted this to a certain extent with a modern marina providing support for river cruisers and watersports facilities and the town is an important angling centre, with particular <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> pike anglers. Banagher is the centre of the Shannon Callows, grassy meadows which flood in winter and provide living space for myriads of waterfowl.|$|E
5|$|Diamond Rio is an American {{country and}} Christian country music band.

It was founded by Matt Davenport, Danny Gregg, and Ty Herndon, the last of whom became a solo artist in the mid-1990s.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles I, the gentry took an {{increased}} interest as patrons and occasionally as players. A big <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> them was the opportunity that the game offered for gambling and this escalated {{in the years following}} the Restoration when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular social activity. Its patrons staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest professional players. Meanwhile, English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the West Indies, and the sailors and traders of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the 40 Watt Club became a {{well-known}} regional <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> music fans, and {{was followed by}} the Uptown Lounge; with the local industry's growth in the 1980s, both the 40 Watt Club and the Uptown Lounge moved to larger spaces, the latter taking over the landmark Georgia Theatre. The early 1980s saw a host of new bands and venues appear, while the city's musical subculture became more diversified. LSD, a hallucinogenic drug, was widely used in the college music scene in this era. Many members of Athens's most prominent later bands became locally renowned starting in the 1970s, including The B-52's.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{shallower}} pits at Aberdare {{proved a}} bigger <b>attraction</b> <b>for</b> prospective mine owners, but once Aberdare became fully worked by the 1860s the Rhondda saw a {{rapid growth in}} development. During the 1860s-1870s 20 collieries opened in the Rhondda Valleys with the leading coalowner in the Rhondda Fach being David Davis of Aberdare, and David Davies in the Rhondda Fawr. In 1865 the output of coal from the Rhondda Valley was roughly one quarter of that of Aberdare; ten years later the Rhondda was producing over two million tons, more than the Aberdare Valleys. These figures would later be dwarfed by the massive excavation rates {{seen in the last}} quarter of the 19th century up to the beginning of the First World War. In 1913 it was recorded that the Rhondda Valley's output was 9.6 million tons.|$|E
