25|$|However, Godwin's own {{reputation}} was eventually besmirched after 1798 by the conservative press, {{in part because}} he chose to write <b>a</b> <b>candid</b> biography of his late wife, Mary Wollstonecraft, entitled Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, including accounts of her two suicide attempts and her affair (before her relationship with Godwin) with the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay, which resulted in the birth of Fanny Imlay.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Ikram had been working on the draft of two books: one, <b>a</b> <b>candid</b> history written after he had retired and could write freely, {{entitled}} A History of Pakistan, 1947–1971, was finished and was to have been published by June 1973; the other, A Biography of Quaid-e-Azam, in which he wished to remedy the gap between the scholarship on Gandhi in India and that on Jinnah in Pakistan, was at an advanced stage of preparation.

25|$|He caused further {{controversy}} {{by publishing}} on 17 January 1964 <b>a</b> <b>candid</b> {{account of the}} 1963 party leadership contest, claiming perhaps unfairly, {{that it was a}} stitch- up by an Etonian 'magic circle.' Macleod's article was written in response to a book by Randolph Churchill, which he described as “Mr Macmillan’s trailer for the screenplay of his memoirs”. In his posthumously published book The Art of Memory (April 1982) Butler wrote that “every word” of the “Spectator” article “is true”. Ian Gilmour also suggests that Dilhorne’s refusal to speak out against Macleod in January 1964, when Macleod’s credibility was at a low ebb, is strong evidence that Dilhorne knew his figures to be suspect.|$|E

It appears even on pre-2007 editions of The Shining on DVD, although most DVDs of Kubrick films before then were devoid of documentaries or audio commentaries. It has some candid interviews and very private moments caught on set, such as arguments with cast and director, moments of a no-nonsense Kubrick directing his actors, Scatman Crothers being overwhelmed with emotion during his interview, Shelley Duvall collapsing from exhaustion on the set, and Jack Nicholson enjoying playing {{up to the}} behind-the-scenes camera.|$|E

25|$|Despite a {{successful}} acting and singing career, Einstein considered himself shy and a homebody. In {{one of his}} songs he sang that his greatest pleasure was staying home {{with a cup of}} lemon tea and his books, and in this he was sincere. In <b>a</b> <b>candid</b> TV interview he said that performing in front of big crowds was difficult for him (without the help of a few glugs of cognac beforehand). For this reason he ceased to perform public concerts after 1981, despite many attractive offers which in the late 1990s even reached seven figures. In 1982 he was hurt in a major car accident. His wife was also hurt, and another friend lost her life. Following the accident Einstein's eyesight, which was already myopic, got worse and he spent less time in public.|$|E

Jake Rickun, {{a writer for the}} Badger Herald, panned Reclassified. In his review, he described [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] as an ironic statement, [...] "but it’s on 'Heavy Crown,' in <b>a</b> <b>candid</b> moment of irony, where Azalea is most telling. 'Get rid of the makeup let us just see who you is,' she raps. For an Australian-born rapper who denies her roots and sits comfortably in American culture, Azalea seems to forget how much proverbial makeup she cakes on herself".|$|E

[...] Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting. It was during this period that Smith appeared on Dutch television in 1998 and provided <b>a</b> <b>candid</b> interview in which he spoke of his assessment of his music career until that point: ...|$|E

500|$|On 30 October, {{days before}} the band left for the first show in Vancouver, Harrison and his musicians {{recorded}} an abridged live performance of the song for promotional purposes at the A sound stage where they were rehearsing.

500|$|Critics praised I Not Stupid Too for its {{touching}} {{portrayal of}} the problems faced by Singaporean teenagers. According to a review in the South China Morning Post, the movie [...] "presents <b>a</b> <b>candid</b> portrait of Singaporean society at odds with its stereotypically squeaky clean image". Nie Peng of Shenzhen Daily felt the film [...] "captured the emotional depth and effectively conveyed the underlying theme of generation gaps", while movieXclusive.com reviewer Jolene Tan called it [...] "a good local movie that will have [...] laughing in stitches and crying at certain points". However, I Not Stupid Too was also panned for being overly preachy: a reviewer for The Hindu said that the movie [...] "feels like a public service program written by Singapore's social welfare department". Geoffrey Eu, a reviewer for The Business Times, commented that it [...] "takes the line that the viewer needs to be clubbed into submission rather than persuaded via a more subtle line of reasoning".|$|E
500|$|The album adopts {{unconventional}} song {{structure and}} as Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club notes, many songs [...] " [...] moody, shifting beats and drawn-out vibe sessions" [...] and {{are left to}} slowly unfurl. This is particularly prominent on [...] "Haunted" [...] and [...] "Partition" [...] which function as two-part suites. The dream-like state created on [...] "Haunted" [...] is ushered in with a stream of consciousness rap entitled [...] "Ghost" [...] which transitions from [...] "smoky ethereality to off-kilter club beat", amid a shifting bassline and ghostly keyboards. [...] "Partition" [...] begins with [...] "Yoncé", a slick rap set over a simple Middle Eastern rhythm. The song is divided by a brief interlude of camera clicks and the whirring of a car window, before launching into a second-half that melds synthesizer pulses with finger snaps to create a Southern hip hop bassline. Over this, the song follows <b>a</b> <b>candid</b> narrative that describes sex {{in the back of}} a limousine when travelling to a nightclub.|$|E
