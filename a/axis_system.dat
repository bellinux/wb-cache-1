25|$|Normal {{cortisol}} level can {{be explained}} by the strong negative feedback mechanism of cortisol on hypothalamus-pituitary <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> That is, in the beginning, 17,20-lyase deficiency will block synthesis of sex steroid hormones, forcing the pathways to produce more cortisol. However, the initial excess of cortisol is rapidly corrected by negative feedback mechanism—high cortisol decreases secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from zona fasciculata of adrenal gland. Thus, there is no mineralocorticoid overproduction. Also, there is no adrenal hyperplasia.|$|E
2500|$|Antonescu's {{policies}} were motivated, in large part, by ethnic nationalism. A {{firm believer in}} the restoration of Greater Romania as the union of lands inhabited by ethnic Romanians, he never reconciled himself to Hungary's incorporation of Northern Transylvania. Although Hungary and Romania were technically allied through the <b>Axis</b> <b>system,</b> their relationship was always tense, and marked by serious diplomatic incidents. The Romanian leader kept contacts with representatives of ethnic Romanian communities directly affected by the Second Vienna Award, including Transylvanian Greek-Catholic clergy. Another aspect of Antonescu's nationalist policies was evidenced after the Balkans Campaign. Antonescu's Romania did not partake in the military action, but laid a claim to the territories in eastern Vojvodina (western Banat) and the Timok Valley, home to a sizable Romanian community. Reportedly, Germany's initial designs of granting Vojvodina to Hungary enhanced the tensions between Antonescu and Miklós Horthy {{to the point where}} war between the two countries became a possibility. Such incidents made Germany indefinitely prolong its occupation of the region. The Romanian authorities issued projects for an independent Macedonia with autonomy for its Aromanian communities, while an official memorandum on the Timok region, approved by Antonescu, made mention of [...] "Romanian" [...] areas [...] "from Timok [...] to Salonika". The Conducător also maintained contacts with Aromanian fascists in Axis-occupied Greece, awarding refuge to Alcibiades Diamandi and Nicola Matussi of the Vlach [...] "Roman Legion", whose pro-Romanian policies had brought them into conflict with other Aromanian factions.|$|E

40|$|For dynamic {{simulation}} of human movement, segment <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> are often {{defined by the}} inertial tensor unique to each simulated body segment. When empirical three-dimensional data are sought that describe either the mass distribution or the kinematic properties of the human body, anatomical frames of reference are needed {{for the sake of}} measurement meth-odology and data comparability. Anatomical <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> are based on anatomical land-marks that ~nust represent functional and stable features in the skeletal geometry. The role of anthropometric landmarks used in defining anatomical coordinate <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> is discussed with examples from current research regarding the kinematics of the hip joint and mass distribution of the whole body. The use of anatomical frames of reference will improve the correspondence between computer simulations of the human body and the biological struc-ture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for {{the reconstruction of}} a three-dimensional object from a single two-dimensional freehand sketch composed of strokes connected at vertices. The proposed algorithm uses the angular distribution of the strokes in the sketch plane to determine one or more orthogonal three-dimensional <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> whose projection correlates with observed stroke orientations, and then uses these <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> to calculate a plausible depth for each vertex to reconstruct a 3 D object from the sketch. The proposed approach is effective for reconstructing objects that are mostly comprised of orthogonal features, as commonly found in many engineering-oriented sketches. We demonstrate an implementation of the algorithm using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization that permits reconstruction of a typical object with over 100 strokes in interactive time...|$|R

40|$|In {{parallel}} <b>axis</b> positioning <b>systems</b> an accuracy–throughput speed contradiction is present. The configuration {{is often}} {{such that the}} minimum number of actuators from kinematic {{point of view is}} used. The mechanical system should possess sufficient stiffness but also low mass. Structural stiffness, and hence accuracy, is obtained at the cost of mass. In intermittent motion systems the moving mass should be minimized, because it limits the attainable acceleration and thus the throughput speed. This dynamic performance barrier can be shifted with additional parallel actuators. To enhance prudence in the initial design phase, knowledge about the opportunities and limitations of parallel <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> is required. The basic dynamical aspects of parallel <b>axis</b> positioning <b>systems,</b> with a minimum and additional number of parallel actuators, are examined for beam and plate systems. The results of the numerical models are verified with an experimental plate system...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} {{interpretation is}} presented for "g strain," the dominant broadening in the EPR spectra of metallo-proteins. The direct cause of g strain {{is described by}} a three-dimensional tensor p, whose principal elements are random variables. The p and g tensors are not necessarily colinear. The observed EPR linewidth results from a distribution in the effective g value {{as a function of}} (a) the joint distribution function of the elements of the p tensor and (b) the spatial relationship between the two principal <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> involved. The theory is reformulated in terms of matrices that facilitate a direct comparison with earlier work. Two previous theories of g strain represent different subsets of the general theory, namely, the case of zero rotation between <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> and the case with nonzero rotation and full correlation between elements of the p tensor...|$|R

40|$|World {{energy needs}} {{increases}} {{every day and}} it becomes more difficult to meet the energy demand of the growing population without harming the environment. Therefore, renewable energy is the main area of study for concerned researchers and scientists. Electricity production by using solar energy {{is one of the}} best alternatives to fossil fuels that lose its importance, due to rising costs and damage to the environment. The number of studies to advance the efficiency of solar systems increases day by day. Especially in electricity supply, usage of high efficiency solar energy systems can meet the expectations. At this stage, solar trackers that provide us efficient utilization of solar energy, gains importance. In this paper, working principles, usage advantages and economical contributions of solar trackers are discussed. Fixed <b>systems,</b> one <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> and two <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> are compared in terms of efficiencies and economic advantages. During this study, Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) is used for comparison between systems.

40|$|The AIAA Modeling and Simulation Technical Committee {{has worked}} for several years to develop a {{standard}} by which the information needed to develop physics-based models of aircraft can be specified. The purpose of this standard {{is to provide a}} well-defined set of information, definitions, data tables and <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> so that cooperating organizations can transfer a model from one simulation facility to another with maximum efficiency. This paper proposes using an application of the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to implement the AIAA simulation standard. The motivation and justification for using a standard such as XML is discussed. Necessary data elements to be supported are outlined. An example of an aerodynamic model as an XML file is given. This example includes definition of independent and dependent variables for function tables, definition of key variables used to define the model, and <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> used. The final steps necessary for implementation of the standard are presented. Software to take an XMLdefined model and import/export it to/from a given simulation facility is discussed, but not demonstrated.
