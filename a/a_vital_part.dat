40|$|Abstract — Power demand had {{a drastic}} raise in past few decades. To fulfill the power demand, {{transmission}} line becomes <b>an</b> <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of power system. As power generating units {{are at a}} far distant from user, transmission of power to consumer is only possible via transmission and distribution lines. The manual method of transmission line design involves tedious calculation and relies on the knowledge and experience of designer. Computational design of transmission line gives faster result and wide vision of the probable solution.

With this funding seemingly guaranteed, the counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in the state, increasing their dependence on the timber payments.

5|$|Early Māori {{adapted the}} tropically based east Polynesian culture {{in line with}} the {{challenges}} associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as <b>a</b> <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E

5|$|In the Atlantic, escort {{carriers}} {{proved to}} be <b>a</b> <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap.

Submarines, which had {{proved to be}} an effective weapon during the First World War, were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics. Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes proved victorious.|$|E
