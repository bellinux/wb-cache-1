5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> build with children's blocks.|$|E
5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} {{serial bus}} {{that is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E

5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E
5|$|The Blade started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage {{shifted to the}} AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to step in to support the work of the Blade. The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade, followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade. In the later part of the century, coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community.|$|E

5|$|The {{large number}} of {{instruments}} that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances. While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel, they {{have to rely on}} <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> replicate the roles of the guest musicians for concerts elsewhere. Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts. This includes Folkearth, and Falkenbach. Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently, {{it is not uncommon to}} find bands in the genre featuring six or more members in their line-up. Some of the sextets in the genre are Schandmaul, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Midnattsol, while septets include Ithilien, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, and Lumsk. Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of Mägo de Oz totals nine performers. Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments, they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound. As an example, Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band's seven members on their debut album Åsmund Frægdegjevar. At times, guest musicians are known to become full-fledged members of the band, as was the case in Skyforger and Turisas.|$|E

25|$|DJ {{software}} requires specialized hardware {{in addition}} to <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular sound card integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs {{need to be able}} to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.|$|E
25|$|After the Literacy Project's {{call for}} bids for <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> {{accompany}} the TV programmes and literature, Acorn won the contract with the Proton, a successor of its Atom computer prototyped at short notice. Renamed the BBC Micro, the system was adopted by most schools in the United Kingdom, changing Acorn's fortunes. It was also moderately successful as a home computer in the UK despite its high cost. Acorn also employed the machine to simulate and develop the ARM architecture which, many years later, has become hugely successful for embedded systems, including tablets and cellphones. In 2013 ARM was {{the most widely used}} 32-bit instruction set architecture.|$|E

25|$|For the {{entrepreneurs}} the main challenge was that their newly created computer was {{the property of}} the NDRE, which again had a strategic cooperation with Kongsberg, both government-owned. They expressed interest in the technology and considered themselves putting it into production. The other company which showed interest for the technology was the Horten-based Norcontrol, which was working on a project for ship automation but needed <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> run the system. To raise capital, Skår took contact with his former college-mate Terje Mikalesen, who was working at Norcontrol. Mikalesen had married into a ship-owning family and was thus able to provide capital the others could not.|$|E
25|$|John Parkyn was Trinity's organist {{when the}} Aeolian-Skinner organ was installed. Before 1996, he advised the vestry that the organ {{required}} considerable work. He created a renovation plan {{which included a}} thorough cleaning, console restoration and replacement or repair of a few groups of pipes. The process was executed over three years and rededicated in January 1999. The newest technology was incorporated which allows <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> control the organ and digitally reproduce sounds from other notable organs. The Aeolian-Skinner organ still is a 3-manual, but it has 91-ranks instead of 41, making it an Opus 1482 hybrid pipe and digital organ. Instrumental sounds can be created that mimic flutes, oboes, trumpets, harps and chimes.|$|E
25|$|Currently most {{operating}} systems support {{a variety of}} networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar {{operating systems}} can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command line interface.|$|E
