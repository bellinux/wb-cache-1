5|$|The {{banks of}} the {{reservoir}} are listed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of waxcap fungi discovered growing on them. WPD appealed against this listing stating the Countryside Council for Wales's (CCW) decision was 'premature, arbirtrary and unfair', but in January 2007 a High Court Judge upheld the SSSI designation {{and said it was}} 'an important site'.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is listed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Site</b> of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) {{as it has}} pondweed and stonewort, and common toads breed there. The grassland and scrub surrounding the reservoir is also an SNCI due to the grass snakes and slowworms there.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of Gyeongju's tourist traffic {{is due to the}} city's promotion of itself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> for various festivals, conferences, and competitions.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae). Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes several local nature reserves which provide roosts for thousands of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) each winter. The mouth of the river is where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, {{some of which are}} vegetated. It has been designated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|Skagens Museum {{was founded}} {{in the dining room}} at Brøndums Hotel in October 1908. Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, Degn Brøndum, {{proprietor}} of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher's brother, and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen were elected to form the first board of governors. After P.S. Krøyer's death in 1909, his house in Skagen Plantation was used as a museum. In 1919, Degn Brøndum donated the old hotel's garden to Skagens Museum <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> for a new building. Work started in 1926 and was completed in September 1928 when the new museum was officially opened.|$|E

5|$|The Point was {{designated}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954, {{along with the}} adjacent Cley Marshes reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986. The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, IUCN category IV (habitat/species management area) and {{is part of the}} Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Point became a National Nature Reserve (NNR) in 1994, and the coast from Holkham NNR to Salthouse, together with Scolt Head Island, became a Biosphere Reserve in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma {{are similar to those}} of the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E
5|$|The scenery {{of rocky}} headlands, ravines, waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast {{recognition}} as a Heritage Coast in 1991. The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of species present. The path passes the smallest parish church in England, Culbone Church, in Culbone.

5|$|There is a deer park {{which was}} started in the 14th century and {{extended}} in the 16th and 17th centuries. There are still two areas of the estate with deer enclosures. The park contains {{a great variety of}} wildlife; much of the site (an area of 210.31 hectares) was notified in 1998 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest due to the presence of rare woodland beetles including: Ctesias serra, Phloiotrya vaudoueri and Eledona agricola.|$|E
5|$|While ashore at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink {{collected}} further {{specimens of}} rocks and lichens, the latter of which would prove {{of great interest to}} the scientific community, which had doubted the ability of vegetation to survive so far south. He also made a careful study of the foreshore, assessing its potential <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> where a future expedition might land and establish winter quarters. When Antarctic reached Melbourne, Bull and Borchgrevink left the ship. Each hoped to raise funds for a further Antarctic expedition, but their efforts were unsuccessful. An animosity developed between them, possibly because of their differing accounts of the voyage on the Antarctic; each emphasised his own role without fully acknowledging that of the other.|$|E
5|$|After {{this part}} of Poland was annexed by Nazi Germany, Oświęcim (Auschwitz) was located {{administratively}} in Germany, Province of Upper Silesia, Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz, Landkreis Bielitz. It was first suggested <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> for a concentration camp for Polish prisoners by SS-Oberführer Arpad Wigand, an aide to Higher SS and Police Leader for Silesia, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski. Bach-Zelewski had been searching for a site to house prisoners in the Silesia region, as the local prisons were filled to capacity. Richard Glücks, head of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate, sent former Sachsenhausen concentration camp commandant Walter Eisfeld to inspect the site, which already held sixteen dilapidated one-story buildings that had once served as an Austrian and later Polish Army barracks and a camp for transient workers. Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel (SS), approved the site in April 1940, intending to use the facility to house political prisoners. SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel) Rudolf Höss oversaw {{the development of the}} camp and served as the first commandant. SS-Obersturmführer (senior lieutenant) Josef Kramer was appointed Höss's deputy. Auschwitz I, the original camp, became the administrative center for the whole complex.|$|E
