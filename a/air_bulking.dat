40|$|The {{delivery}} and accumulation of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) as recorded in sediments from the Lake Maggiore (LM) in Northern Italy {{and the influence}} of the atmosphere in contaminating this subalpine ecosystem was studied. PCDD/Fs (17 congeners) and DL-PCBs (12 congeners) concentrations, congener profiles and fluxes in <b>air,</b> <b>bulk</b> deposition, aquatic settling material and surface sediments are presented in this work. Our strategy was to obtain surface sediment from areas near riverine inputs and in the depositional basins, settling material in sediment traps at one site and <b>air,</b> aerosol and <b>bulk</b> deposition profiles. Concentrations in air of 24. 5 WHO-TEQ fg m- 3 PCDD/Fs and 6. 8 WHO-TEQ fg m- 3 DL-PCBs were obtained. Bulk deposition of 136. 6 and 28. 5 WHO-TEQ pg m- 2 for dioxins/furans and DL-PCBs respectively, resulted during one sampled week. Aquatic settling material had a concentration of 11. 4 WHO-TEQ pg g- 1 for PCDD/Fs and a concentration of 2. 3 WHO-TEQ pg g- 1 for DL-PCBs. PCDD/Fs concentrations in surface sediments varied from 0. 13 to 16. 9 WHO-TEQ pg g- 1 whereas values ranged from 0. 03 to 4. 7 WHO-TEQ pg g- 1 for DL-PCBs. The concentrations obtained in the environmental compartments studied suggest a situation of low level contamination. Similarity in PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs congeners profiles in atmospheric <b>air,</b> <b>bulk</b> deposition, aquatic settling matter and surface sediment point to an important if not dominant contribution from atmospheric deposition to Lake Maggiore, especially derived from wet deposition of aerosol-bound PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs.

40|$|Abstract The basidiospores of most Agaricomycetes are ballistospores. They are {{propelled}} {{off from}} their basidia at maturity when Buller 2 ̆ 019 s drop develops at high humidity at the hilar spore appendix and fuses with a liquid film formed on the adaxial side of the spore. Spores are catapulted into the free air space between hymenia and fall then out of the mushroom 2 ̆ 019 s cap by gravity. Here we show for 66 different species that ballistospores from mushrooms can be attracted against gravity to electrostatic charged plastic surfaces. Charges on basidiospores can influence this effect. We used this feature to selectively collect basidiospores in sterile plastic Petri-dish lids from mushrooms which were positioned upside-down onto wet paper tissues for spore release into the <b>air.</b> <b>Bulks</b> of 10 4 to > 10 7 spores were obtained overnight in the plastic lids above the reversed fruiting bodies, between 10 4 and 10 6 spores already after 22 ̆ 01340 h incubation.

The heat-exchanger inlet gas temperature was varied from 5100 to 1260 R by burning JP fuel for airflow rates of 0. 4 to 10. 5 pounds per second corresponding to an approximate Reynolds number range of 300 to 9000.

Concern was expressed {{for the impact of}} this on the community. Our objectives were to employ Pb isotope ratios to evaluate the source of Pb in environmental samples for use in legal proceedings, and for use in remediation and monitoring. Isotope measurements were undertaken of bird livers, plants, drinking water, soil, harbour sediments, <b>air,</b> <b>bulk</b> ceiling dust, gutter sludge, surface swabs and blood. The unique lead isotopic signature of the contaminating Pb carbonate enabled diagnostic apportionment of lead in samples. Apart from some soil and water samples, the proportion of contaminating Pb was > 95 % in the environmental samples. Lead isotopes were critical in resolving legal proceedings, are being used in the remediation of premises, were used in monitoring of workers involved in the decontamination of the storage facility, and monitoring transport of the concentrate through another port facility. Air samples show the continued presence of contaminant Pb, more than one year after shipping of concentrate ceased, probably arising from dust resuspension. Brief details of the comprehensive testing and cleanup of the Esperance community are provided along with the role of the Community.
