40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{objective}} of this case series is to identify and define causes of failure of Szabo technique in rapid-exchange monorail system for ostial lesions. Methods and resultsFrom March 2009 to March 2011, 42 patients with an ostial lesion were treated percutaneously at our institution using Szabo technique in a monorail stent system. All patients received unfractionated heparin during intervention. Loading dose of clopidogrel, followed by clopidogrel and aspirin was administered. In 57 % of patients, drug-eluting stents were used and in 42. 8 % patients bare metal stents. The stent was advanced over both wires, the target wire and the <b>anchor</b> <b>wire.</b> The <b>anchor</b> <b>wire,</b> which was passed through the proximal trailing strut of the stent helps to achieve precise stenting. The procedure {{was considered to be}} successful if stent was placed precisely covering the lesion and without stent loss or <b>anchor</b> <b>wire</b> prolapsing. Of the total 42 patients, the procedure was successful in 33, while failed in 9. Majority of failures were due to wire entanglement, which was fixed successfully in 3 cases by removing and reinserting the <b>anchor</b> <b>wire.</b> Out of other three failures, in one stent dislodgment occurred, stent could not cross the lesion in one and in another <b>anchor</b> <b>wire</b> got looped and prolapsed into target vessel. ConclusionThis case series shows that the Szabo technique, in spite of some difficulties like wire entanglement, stent dislodgement and resistance during stent advancement, is a simple and feasible method for treating variety of ostial lesions precisely compared to conventional angioplasty...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present a simple technique for stabilizing a lingual fixed retainer wire in place with good adaptation to the teeth surfaces and checking for occlusal interferences prior to the bonding procedure. BACKGROUND: Bonding of an upper or lower fixed lingual retainer using stainless steel wires of different sizes and shapes is a common orthodontic procedure. The retainer can be constructed in a dental laboratory, made at chair side, or it can be purchased in prefabricated form. All three ways of creating a fixed retainer are acceptable. However, the method of holding the retainer wire in place adjacent to the lingual surfaces of the teeth before proceeding with the bonding process remains a problem for some practitioners. REPORT: The lingual fixed retainer was fabricated using three pieces of. 010 " steel ligature wire which were twisted into a single strand wire. Another four to five 0. 010 " pieces of steel ligature wires were twisted in the same way to serve as an <b>anchor</b> <b>wire</b> from the labial side of the teeth. The retainer wire was bonded using the foible composite. SUMMARY: The technique presented here for stabilizing the retainer wire prior to bonding provides good stabilization, adaptation, and proper positioning of the retainer wire while eliminating contamination of etched surfaces which might arise during wire positioning before bonding. This technique also allows the clinician the opportunity to check the occlusion and adjust the retainer wire to avoid occlusal interference prior to bonding maxillary retainers. This same clinical strategy can be used to stabilize wires for splinting periodontally affected teeth and traumatized teeth. King Saud Universit...|$|E

50|$|The Tower of Unity (German: Turm der Einheit) is a 30 meter high {{observation}} tower on Heldrastein, a rocky mountain belonging to Treffurt in Thuringia. The tower of Unity has an unusual history {{and is also}} from unusual design, because it is additionally guyed by <b>anchoring</b> <b>wires,</b> although it is actually free standing. The tower of Unity was built in 1962 as transmitting tower for a radar station. At {{that time it was}} an open steel lattice tower additionally guyed with the radar facility on its top. The area of this tower was not accessible for tourists at those days as it laid in the restricted area of the former border between West and East Germany. In 1989, when the border was opened, the area became again accessible for the public and the desire developed to build on Heldrastein again an {{observation tower}}, as there was until 1952 an observation tower built of stones, the such called Carl Alexander tower there. In 1996 finally permission for the transformation of the radar tower into an observation tower could be received. In order to do this changes, which cost 205,000 DM, the radome on the top was removed and the tower body was covered with wood. In addition the tower got a stairway with 166 steps and an octagonal shelter at the tower basement.|$|R

40|$|Navigating in {{the arctic}} has become more common, but it is dicult and dangerousdue to the {{presence}} of ice. Any training under safer circumstances is therefore veryvaluable, enter the need for ship simulators. Ship simulators today incorporate manyfeatures, such as cranes, <b>anchors,</b> <b>wires,</b> and state of the art physics. However, theinclusion of ice is very rare due to the complexity of simulating the feedback from theice breaking progress. The purpose of this project is to build a model and numerical methods to simulate icefracture in real-time, which is to be used in ship simulators. The model presented inthis project is implemented {{with the use of the}} physics engine AgX Multiphysics madeby Algoryx Simulation ABThe method represents the ice sheet as a non-homogeneous mesh. A collision with thehull of the ship injects deformation energy into the ice. The energy from the inelasticimpact is distributed on the ice sheet according to a quasi-static crack propagationmodel that is dened on a static mesh. The cracks are guided using stress elds thatapproximate the strain in each vertex. The distribution of the strain is done by a simplemodel which allows for breaking ice in non-uniform fragments. This is more realisticthan fracture in predened shapes which is the main contribution of this project. Thefragments become unbreakable rigid body ice oes that interact with the ship's hull bycollision and friction. The implementation of the ice model is tested by using a trimesh model of the TorViking II icebreaker using approximated buoyancy calculations, damping equations,and engine forces. Real-time performance is not achieved yet in the general case, but this is due to thechoice of collision geometry and the oe creation. Unstable force spikes from thecontacts between the ship and the ice is detected, but the overall global ice resistanceshows few abnormalities. Replacing the collision geometry and the rigid body oes isnecessary for the implementation to be able to run in real-time. Further experimentsto compare with real model data is needed to be able to validate the model...|$|R

We demonstrated that the stronger molecule-electrode coupling associated with the conjugated dithiocarbamate linker broadens transmission resonances near the Fermi energy. The broadening effect along with {{the extension of the}} π conjugation from the molecule to the gold electrodes lead to enhanced electrical conductance for BPBC molecule.
