25|$|Fully {{aware of}} the dangers of his condition, Vysotsky made several {{attempts}} to cure himself of his addiction. He underwent an experimental (and ultimately discredited) blood purification procedure offered by a leading drug rehabilitation specialist in Moscow. He also went to an isolated retreat in France with his wife Marina in the spring of 1980 as a way of forcefully depriving himself of any access to drugs. After these attempts failed, Vysotsky returned to Moscow to find his life in an increasingly stressful state of disarray. He had been a defendant in two criminal trials, one for a car wreck he had caused some months earlier, and one for an alleged conspiracy to sell unauthorized concert tickets (he eventually received a suspended sentence and a probation in the first case, and the charges in the second were dismissed, although several of his co-defendants were found guilty). He also unsuccessfully fought the film studio authorities for the rights to direct <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>called</b> The Green Phaeton. Relations with his wife Marina were deteriorating, and he was torn between his loyalty to her and his love for his mistress Oksana Afanasyeva. He had also developed a severe inflammation in one of his legs, making his concert performances extremely challenging.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{accession}} of the Soviet Union to the UCC in 1973, some Soviet works were copyrighted {{in some other}} countries. One well-known case concerned {{the actions of the}} four Soviet composers Shostakovich, Khachaturian, Prokofiev, and Myaskovsky against the movie company 20th Century Fox. 20th Century Fox had published <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>called</b> The Iron Curtain, using music of these four composers as background music and crediting the composers. The four Soviet composers initiated legal actions against the movie company, claiming that the use of their names and music in a movie whose theme was objectionable to them and that was unsympathetic to the Soviet ideology libeled them and violated their civil rights. In the U.S., the courts dismissed these claims in Shostakovich v. Twentieth Century-Fox (80 N.Y.S.2d 575 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1948), affirmed, 87 N.Y.S.2d 430 (N.Y. App. Div. 1949)), in particular because the works of these composers were in the public domain in the U.S. at that time because there were no international treaties relating to copyright between the U.S. and the USSR. The compositions themselves also had not been distorted, so the court found that the composers' moral right to the integrity of the work was not violated.|$|E

500|$|Set in the 1950s, Michael and his unnamed date (Ola Ray) {{run out of}} gas near a dark wooded area.

500|$|When {{the episode}} was being cast, Michael McKean was not slated to play Morris Fletcher. Originally, the writers for the episode {{contacted}} Garry Shandling {{to play the}} part of Fletcher. Shandling, who was good friends with David Duchovny, was unavailable because he was filming <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>called</b> Town and Country. Shandling would later appear in the seventh season episode [...] "Hollywood A.D." [...] playing himself. In the meantime, the production staff began looking for a replacement. Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files, stated that they went through [...] "lists and lists" [...] of potential actors. Vince Gilligan noted, however, that McKean {{was at the top}} of the list for inclusion. McKean was very happy to play the part, although he did specifically ask the writers not to kill off his character.|$|E

500|$|In Turkey, {{the battle}} is {{thought of as a}} {{significant}} event in the state's emergence, although it is primarily remembered for the fighting that took place around the port of Çanakkale, where the Royal Navy was repulsed in March 1915. For the Turks, 18 March has a similar significance as 25 April to Australians and New Zealanders, it is not a public holiday but is commemorated with special ceremonies. The campaign's main significance to the Turkish people lies in the role it played in the emergence of Mustafa Kemal, who became the first president of the Republic of Turkey after the war. [...] "Çanakkale geçilmez" [...] (Çanakkale is impassable) became a common phrase to express the state's pride at repulsing the attack and the song [...] "Çanakkale içinde" [...] (A Ballad for Chanakkale) commemorates the Turkish youth who fell during the battle. Turkish filmmaker Sinan Cetin, created <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Children of Canakkale".|$|E
500|$|By February 2005, Paul Lovett and David Elliot, {{who wrote}} di Bonaventura's Four Brothers, were {{rewriting}} Gordon's draft. In their script, the Rex character is corrupted and mutated into the Cobra Commander, whom Destro needs to lead {{an army of}} supersoldiers. Skip Woods was rewriting the script by March 2007, and he added the Alex Mann character from the British Action Man toy line. Di Bonaventura explained, [...] "Unfortunately, our president [...] has {{put us in a}} position internationally where {{it would be very difficult}} to release <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>called</b> G.I. Joe. To add one character to the mix is sort of a fun thing to do." [...] The script was leaked online by El Mayimbe of Latino Review, who revealed Woods had dropped the Cobra Organization in favor of the Naja / Ryan, a crooked CIA agent. In this draft, Scarlett is married to Action Man but still has feelings for Duke, and is killed by the Baroness. Snake Eyes speaks, but his vocal cords are slashed during the story, rendering him mute. Mayimbe suggested Stuart Beattie rewrite the script. Fan response to the film following the script review was negative. Di Bonaventura promised with subsequent rewrites, [...] "I'm hoping we're going to get it right this time." [...] He admitted he had problems with Cobra, concurring with an interviewer [...] "they were probably the stupidest evil organization out there [...] ". Hasbro promised they would write Cobra back into the script.|$|E
500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>called</b> JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E
