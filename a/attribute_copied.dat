Results from a field experiment reveal differences between experts and novices in their responses to email advertising. Specifically, experts report more favorable evaluations for email advertising than novices. Experts also demonstrate a preference for expert testimonials, when exposed to <b>attribute</b> <b>copy.</b> Yet when benefits-only ad copy was used, experts are most influenced by novice testimonials. In contrast, novice consumers show no copy-testimonial preference. Expert testimonials are also more effective than novice testimonials for expert and novice consumers.

40|$|The finite-set {{statistics}} (FISST) {{approach to}} multitarget tracking {{was introduced in}} the mid- 1990 s. Its current extended form dates from 2001. In 2008, an "elementary" alternative to FISST was proposed, based on "finite point processes" rather than RFS's. This was accompanied by single-sensor and multisensor versions of a claimed generalization of the PHD filter, the "iFilter. " Then in 2013 in the Journal of Advances in Information Fusion (JAIF) and elsewhere, the same author went on to claim that the FISST p. g. fl. /functional derivative approach is actually "due to" (a "corollary" of) a 50 -year-old pure-mathematics paper by Moyal; and described a "point process" p. g. fl. /functional derivative approach to multitarget tracking supposedly based on it. In this paper it is shown that: (1) non-RFS point processes are a phenomenologically erroneous foundation for multitarget tracking; (2) nearly every equation, concept, discussion, derivation, and methodology in the JAIF paper originally appeared in FISST publications, without being so attributed; (3) FISST cannot possibly be "due to Moyal"; (4) the "point process" approach described in JAIF differs from FISST only in regard to terminology and notation, and thus in this sense appears to be an obscured, phenomenologically erroneous, and improperly <b>attributed</b> <b>copy</b> of FISST.

40|$|International audienceImproving {{performance}} of Web services interactions {{is an important}} factor to burst the adoption of SOAin mission-critical applications, especially when they deal with large business objects whose transfer time is not negligible. Designing messages dynamic granularity (offloading) is a key challenge for achieving good performances. This requires the server being able to predict the pieces of data actually used by clients in order to send only such data. However, exact prediction is not easy, and consequently lazy interactions are needed to transfer additional data whenever the prediction fails. To preserve semantics, lazy accesses to the results of a Web service interaction need to work on a dedicated copy of the business object stored as application state. Thus, dynamic offloading can experience an overhead due to a prediction failure, which is the sum of round-trip and storage access delays, which could compromise the benefits of the technique. This paper improves our previous work enabling dynamic offloading for both IN and OUT parameters, and analyses how <b>attributes</b> <b>copies</b> impact on the technique, by comparing the overheads introduced by different storage technologies in a real implementation of a Web services framework that extends CXF. More specifically, we quantitatively characterize the execution contexts that make dynamic offloading effective, and the expected accuracy of the predictive strategy to have a gain in term of response time compared to plain services invocations. Finally, the paper introduces the Attribute Loading Delegation technique that enables optimized data-transfers for those applications where data-intensive multiple-interactions take place...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The high {{prevalence}} of pure red cell aplasia in Thailand {{has been associated}} with the sharp increase in number of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) copy products, based on a classical generic regulatory pathway, which have entered the market. This study aims to assess the quality of rhEPO copy products being used in Thailand. METHODS: Twelve rhEPO copy products were purchased from pharmacies in Thailand, shipped under controlled cold chain conditions to the Netherlands and characterized using (1) high performance size-exclusion chromatography, (2) asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation, (3) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with (4) Western blotting and additionally tested for (5) host cell protein impurities as well as (6) endotoxin contamination. RESULTS: Some of the tested rhEPO copy products showed high aggregate levels and contained a substantial amount of protein fragments. Also, one of rhEPO copy products had a high endotoxin level, exceeding the FDA limit. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations show that some of the tested copy products on the Thai market differ significantly from the originator rhEPO product, Epogen®. This comparison study supports a link between the quality <b>attributes</b> of <b>copy</b> rhEPO products and their immunogenicity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei is a bat-associated {{parasite}} of the subgenus Schizotrypanum and it {{is regarded}} as a T. cruzi subspecies. Here we report a draft genome sequence of T. c. marinkellei and comparison with T. c. cruzi. Our aims were to identify unique sequences and genomic features, which may relate to their distinct niches. Results The T. c. marinkellei genome was found to be ~ 11 % smaller than that of the human-derived parasite T. c. cruzi Sylvio X 10. The genome size difference was <b>attributed</b> to <b>copy</b> number variation of coding and non-coding sequences. The sequence divergence in coding regions was ~ 7. 5 % between T. c. marinkellei and T. c. cruzi Sylvio X 10. A unique acetyltransferase gene was identified in T. c. marinkellei, representing an example of a horizontal gene transfer from eukaryote to eukaryote. Six of eight examined gene families were expanded in T. c. cruzi Sylvio X 10. The DGF gene family was expanded in T. c. marinkellei. T. c. cruzi Sylvio X 10 contained ~ 1. 5 fold more sequences related to VIPER and L 1 Tc elements. Experimental infections of mammalian cell lines indicated that T. c. marinkellei has the capacity to invade non-bat cells and undergo intracellular replication. Conclusions Several unique sequences were identified in the comparison, including a potential subspecies-specific gene acquisition in T. c. marinkellei. The identified differences reflect the distinct evolutionary trajectories of these parasites and represent targets for functional investigation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Digitization of the {{geologic}} maps {{is confusing}} and time consuming process. If {{the same person}} is digitizing the data and converting it into the GIS, the way is not so important, but the result is. However, for parallel digitization, which means digitization {{of two or more}} geological maps by different users at the same time, user intervention brings confusion problems while converting digitized data into the GIS. For this reason, before initiating the project, the standards of geological map digitization should be well performed. A geological map can contain limited number of common features such as faults, folds, types of formation boundaries and dip-strike measurements. They should be represented with common attributes in all maps. For that reason a task bar is prepared for use in any digitization software that standardizes the attributes of digitized data. This task bar provides the attributes of common geological features. While digitizing, user finds the icon of the feature on the task bar and pushes that button. The <b>attribute</b> is <b>copied</b> into the PC’s ram and user pastes it into the necessary field. One advantage of this method is to simplify the digitization process and so it is much faster than non standardized and unorganized digitization. Another advantage is the digitizing may be done by people having no geological background. Using this method, 80 pieces of 1 / 50, 000 scaled geological map are converted into the GIS for about 4 months with two digitizing person. 1...|$|R

The genus' name is derived from [...] "sulfur" [...] in Latin and [...] "monas" [...] from Greek, together meaning a “sulfur-oxidizing rod”. The size of the bacteria varies between about 1.5-2.5 μm in length and 0.5-1.0 μm in width. Members of the genus Sulfurimonas are found {{in a variety of}} different environments which include deep sea-vents, marine sediments, and terrestrial habitats. Their ability to survive in extreme conditions is <b>attributed</b> to multiple <b>copies</b> of one enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that members of the genus Sulfurimonas have limited dispersal ability and its speciation was affected by geographical isolation rather than hydrothermal composition.
