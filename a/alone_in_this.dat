Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and letting the delegates choose.|$|E

25|$|For his part, Glazunov was not {{supportive}} of the modern direction Stravinsky's music took. He was not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> prejudice—their mutual teacher Rimsky-Korsakov was as profoundly conservative {{by the end of}} his life, wedded to the academic process he helped instill at the Conservatory. Unlike Rimsky-Korsakov, Glazunov was not anxious about the potential dead end Russian music might reach by following academia strictly, nor did he share Rimsky-Korsakov's grudging respect for new ideas and techniques.|$|E
50|$|The Université de Sherbrooke was {{established}} as a French-speaking Catholic university {{in a region that}} was predominantly English speaking.

In 1975, the appointment of a layman as Rector marked the end of religious activity in the institution.

25|$|Hutton {{discouraged}} fraternisation {{with the}} West Indies players and this went decidedly against Trueman's grain, {{given that he}} was a gregarious character who liked nothing better than to fraternise. Trueman had made friends with Frank Worrell and other West Indian players when he met them in English league cricket and objected strongly to Hutton's policy, claiming that he was not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> and especially as Hutton gave no reason for it. Trueman suspected the MCC hierarchy of instructing Hutton to make the demand. For his own part, he would not allow anyone to dictate to him with whom he should be friends.|$|E

In January 1859 he wrote his Provincial Superior, complaining that the expected instruction in theology was not being done and about {{the weight of his}} workload with the boys, being <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> task. A reply counseling patience brought another request for a change of the situation which included a veiled hint at the possibility of his leaving the Congregation. The situation was soon remedied to his satisfaction, as his own studies were resumed and his younger brother, David, (now {{also a member of the}} Congregation) was assigned to assist him.|$|E
25|$|Similar scenes {{appear in}} many post-New Kingdom temples, {{but this time}} the events they depict involve the gods <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> period, most temples were {{dedicated}} to a mythical family of deities, usually a father, mother, and son. In these versions of the story, the birth is that of the son in each triad. Each of these child gods is the heir to the throne, who will restore stability to the country. This shift in focus from the human king to the gods who are associated with him reflects a decline in the status of the pharaoh in the late stages of Egyptian history.|$|E

25|$|Records {{from the}} 12th and 11th centuries BC are sparse in Babylonia, {{which had been}} overrun with new Semitic settlers, namely the Arameans, Chaldeans and Sutu. Assyria however, {{remained}} a compact and strong nation, which continued to provide much written record. The 10th century BC is even worse for Babylonia, with very few inscriptions. Mesopotamia was not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> obscurity: the Hittite Empire fell {{at the beginning of}} this period and very few records are known from Egypt and Elam. This was a time of invasion and upheaval by many new people throughout the Near East, North Africa, The Caucasus, Mediterranean and Balkan regions.|$|E
25|$|Ottokar again contested the Imperial Throne in 1273, being almost <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{position}} in the electoral college. This time he {{refused to accept the}} authority of the successful candidate, Rudolf of Habsburg (Emperor 1273–1291). In November 1274 the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg ruled that all crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Frederick II (1250) must be restored, and that King Ottokar II must answer to the Diet for not recognising the new emperor, Rudolf. Ottokar refused either to appear or to restore the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia with the March of Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave Hermann VI of Baden.|$|E
25|$|On the 11th of March 2017 the Dutch {{government}} has made a decision which changed the relationship between both countries for worse. When the Turks decided to sent the minister of foreign affairs for the 400.000 Turks living in the Netherlands, to have them vote for the Turkish constitutional referendum, the Dutch government denied access into the Netherlands. Later that day minister of family affairs Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya traveled by road to the Netherlands but was escorted {{out of the country}} on orders of the Dutch government. This led to problems in Rotterdam where Dutch police used dogs and water cannon on Sunday to disperse demonstrators. The Dutch are not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> decision, The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland all have denied the Turkish government to rally in their countries for the referendum.|$|E

25|$|His {{family was}} long {{associated}} with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in Dublin, and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his The Standard Elocutionist (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. The Standard Elocutionist appeared in 168 British editions and sold {{over a quarter of}} a million copies in the United States <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound. Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic, and even Sanskrit, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of sillaginids have large enough populations to allow an entire fishery to be based around them, with King George whiting, {{northern}} whiting, Japanese whiting, sand whiting and school whiting the major species. There have been no reliable estimates of catches for the entire family, as catch statistics generally include only those species taken in large numbers, {{but there are some}} species which make up significant numbers of the bycatch. To add to this problem, many of the lesser known species are taken by subsistence fisheries and not reported. From estimates by the FAO, however, it is evident that the family {{is one of the most}} important in the Indo-Pacific region, having an estimated catch of 22 718 tonnes in 1990 <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> same report, it was shown that the greatest three utilizers of sillaginids were the Philippines, Western Australia and Thailand respectively. The records also suggested that the catch increased from 1983 when it was 17 570 t, up to the last estimate in 1990 of 22 718 t. No such estimates have been carried out since. Modern records for Australia show that this trend has reversed, with all catches from Australia totaling 4 372 t in 2006 compared with 1990's 6000 t haul. Statistics from other countries are unavailable for such comparison.|$|E
25|$|Aware {{that there}} was a war in Sudan, Churchill {{determined}} to be part of it. He was not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> because in a time generally of peace, many British Army officers wanted experience of battle to further their careers. In Churchill's case, he did not see his career as lying with the army, but had already started writing about wars and wanted a new campaign to write about. He first attempted to obtain a transfer from his regiment stationed in India to the 21st Lancers, which was the unit taking part in the war. This was granted by the War Office, but rejected by the commander of the British force in Sudan, General Kitchener. Churchill next took leave to Britain, where he enlisted friends and family to lobby Kitchener to permit him to take part. This continued to be unsuccessful, even when the prime minister Lord Salisbury made an inquiry on his behalf. Eventually, however, he prevailed upon Sir Evelyn Wood, Adjutant General of the Horse Guards, who had authority over appointments to the regiment in England, and he received an attachment to the Lancers in place of an officer who had died, on 24 July 1898. On 5 August he was in Luxor and on 24 August the regiment set out from Atbara to attack the Mahdist forces.|$|E

500|$|A month later, {{things had}} changed. The enemy were engaged by the UN forces at the Battle of Unsan in late October, which {{demonstrated}} {{the presence of}} Chinese soldiers in Korea and rendered significant losses to the American and other UN troops. Nevertheless, Willoughby downplayed the evidence about Chinese intervention in the war. He estimated that up to 71,000 Chinese soldiers were in the country, while the true number was closer to 300,000. He was not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> miscalculation.
