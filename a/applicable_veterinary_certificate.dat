40|$|Summary: The {{role of the}} {{veterinary}} {{profession is}} to promote animal health, animal welfare, {{public health and the}} protection of the environment. Veterinarians must adhere to high ethical standards and be prepared to apply their specialised knowledge and skills in the interest of others. The organisation, structure and functioning of the Veterinary Statutory Bodies and Veterinary Associations are prerequisites not only for the quality of Veterinary Services but also for private veterinary practice in a country. Both organisations provide the necessary infrastructure to ensure that veterinarians in the public and the private sectors have the necessary qualifications, scientific expertise and experience and are free from any financial, commercial, hierarchical, political and other pressures which might affect their competence to make sound professional judgments based on existing scientific data. It is essential that all veterinarians and veterinary para-professionals are licensed to practice by an autonomous Veterinary Statutory Body and subject to legal disciplinary provisions for any professional misconduct. The existing structures and functional arrangements in most Member Countries of the OIE 2 Regional Commission for the Middle East are not up to standards. Change is therefore necessary for compliance with the provisions of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code dealing with the quality of Veterinary Services, the issue of international <b>veterinary</b> <b>certificates</b> and the regulation of the practice of veterinarians and veterinary para-professionals in the public and the private sector...|$|R

40|$|Case study {{research}} into the mandatory veterinary requirements on Dutch exports of live animals and animal products provides empirical evidence on the trade effects of nontariff measures (NTMs). The paper discusses the analytical approach to assess how veterinary health attestation may create (temporary) obstacles for Dutch exports, what these obstacles are, and whether competing exporters in EU countries have encountered similar barriers. We have a dataset on 166 cases in 2004 - 06 where the process of issuing <b>veterinary</b> <b>certificates</b> for Dutch exports to non- EU destinations was disrupted. Products covered are animal-based products, live animals and feed. We use a sample of 30 cases that continued after 2006, the ‘longlasting problems’, and 39 cases that came up and got solved between 2004 and 2006, the temporary problems. The main challenge is to link the available record of recognition problems to the disruptions in exports. In order to assess trade disruptions, statistical tests of outliers and trend breaches are performed on detailed monthly trade data, {{and the issue of}} not-observed trade needs to be addressed. This raises the need to address disruption patterns around the imposition of measures in trade. The alternative patterns under examination are (i) measures that have an immediate trade impact, (ii) measures due to which trade gradually expands or reduces, and (iii) measures that divert trade to alternative export destinations. Finally, we want to examine whether the impact of veterinary health attestation on trade can be specified towards the type of trade barrier. For that, we suggest to introduce a distinction between three different types of barriers, based on whether obstacles relate to the non-conformity of products to import requirements or a failure in the conformity assessment or both. non-tariff measures, conformity assessment, animal products, International Relations/Trade, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if participation in the 4 -H <b>veterinary</b> science <b>certificate</b> program has contributed to the participant?s career decisions. Career development, for most people, is a lifelong process of engaging the work world through choosing among employment opportunities made available to them. Each individual undertaking the process is influenced by many factors, including the context in which they live, their personal aptitudes, and educational attainment. A sample of 374 was used to gather information form participants of the <b>veterinary</b> science <b>certificate</b> program. Data was collected with the use of an online survey instrument and resulted in a total of 224 responses (59. 8 %) with 122 (54. 4 %) completed surveys. This resulted in 112 (29. 9 %) usable responses for the study. Participants involved in the VSCP are gaining valuable knowledge and skills about veterinary medicine. There are some areas as indicated in the research that might need to be re-visited and changed to meet the needs of those involved in the program. It can also be concluded that the VSCP is helping participants successfully determine career choices. VSCP combines lessons, activities and hands on learning that help different learning styles to better understand veterinary medicine, in return help them in career choices. The results also indicate why participants are not completing all components of the VSCP. It is evident that if the VSCP is going to continue and prosper these finding should be addresses, and it needs to become priority for the betterment of this career development program. It is time for VSCP to look at short term verses long term experiences. The researcher feels by doing this it would determine if the time commitment is too much for the participant, or is it the commitment of the participant to complete the requirements of VSCP. The researcher also reveals it is relevant to continue the 500 clinical hours due to the parallel of the TVMA certification program, for students that want to become a certified veterinary assistant.

40|$|Brachytherapy is a {{treatment}} modality {{that is still}} under development, in veterinary {{as well as in}} human medicine. Although positive results in human research could be translated to veterinary medicine, several factors should be taken into consideration when initiating brachytherapy research, such as the incidence and pathophysiology of the specific disease in veterinary medicine as compared to human medicine, and the availability of specialized equipment and trained medical staff. HDR brachytherapy has advantages over LDR brachytherapy but both treatment modalities are not always <b>applicable</b> in <b>veterinary</b> medicine. In these cases HDR or LDR techniques could be adjusted or alternatives should be considered, e. g. a more straightforward technique such as interstitial microbrachytherapy. Microbrachytherapy in the form of 166 Ho or 90 Y microspheres seems also promising for the development of new brachytherapy techniques, such as a super selective intra-arterial approach, if possible even combined with (intra-arterial) chemotherapy. Furthermore, CT, MRI or FDG-PET imaging before and after treatment is necessary for recording tumor dimensions. In that way, RECIST or WHO criteria can be used for objective evaluation of the tumor response.

40|$|Active {{immunization}} against gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is successfully {{applied to}} prevent boar taint in pork. In men, GnRH immunization {{could be an}} alternative to hormone therapy in patients with prostate cancer. In this study, a new GnRH vaccine formulation (a modified GnRH peptide conjugate formulated with CoVaccine adjuvant) was investigated for its pharmacological efficacy and safety in young-adult male pigs. Immunization resulted in castrate-like plasma testosterone levels in all treated pigs from week 8 {{until the end of}} the study, 30 weeks after the first immunization. Testosterone depletion retarded testes growth, reduced the relative weight of the testes and accessory sex organs, and reduced sperm counts and motility. There was no clinically relevant toxicity.

40|$|Canine {{distemper}} {{is generally}} considered the most contagious disease of domestic dogs. 8, 9 The disease has become rare in dogs in the United States due largely to effective vaccines. 12 The disease persists because of persisting wildlife reservoirs of Canine distemper virus (CDV; order Mononegavirales, family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Morbillivirus), particularly in raccoons and skunks. 13 Canine distemper {{is most likely to}} affect dogs when they are crowded, stressed, immunologically susceptible, and directly or indirectly exposed to infected wildlife (Hurley, KF: 2005, Canine distemper in the shelter: lessons learned from a Chi-cago outbreak. Animal Sheltering, Sept/Oct: 39 – 43). 13 Dogs are most at risk when not routinely vaccinated in accordance with established guidelines, 12 and are vulnerable in shelters and dog rescue organizations. 6, 12 The occurrence of highly contagious diseases such as canine distemper in wholesale and retail commercial establishments is poorly documented in the veterinary literature. 5 The current study documents canine distemper in puppies purchased from 2 pet stores in Wyoming. Most or all affected dogs originated from a single large-scale, out-of-state breeding operation where canine distemper was subsequently diagnosed. Over 37 days (August 31 –October 6, 2010), canine dis-temper was confirmed in 24 young dogs of multiple breeds from 4 Wyoming towns (Table 1).

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Crib-biting/windsucking behaviour has important consequences for equine health and welfare. Lay perceptions {{of health and}} illness are of interest to medical sociologists, providing important information to medical practitioners, but have infrequently been applied in veterinary research. Objectives: To demonstrate how lay epidemiology can be applied within veterinary research by exploring the lay perceptions regarding the causes of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour in horses. Methods: Informants were recruited from professional and amateur horse owners who had or had not owned/cared for a horse that exhibited crib-biting/windsucking behaviour. In-depth interviews were used to examine perceptions {{about the development of}} this behaviour within each group until a ‘saturation’ of themes emerged. Results: The main themes that emerged as causes of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour were ‘boredom’, ‘stress’ and ‘habit/addiction’. In the group of owners/carers who did not have direct experience of this type of behaviour, ‘copying’ from other horses emerged as a strong theme and they stated that they would not wish to own a crib-biting/ windsucking horse. In contrast, those who had direct experience of horses demonstrating this behaviour did not believe copying was a cause based on their own observations and would not be put off purchasing or caring for another horse displaying this behaviour. Conclusions: Perceptions about what causes crib-biting/ windsucking was influenced by whether or not informants had personal experience of horses demonstrating this behaviour. The three main themes that emerged have some justification based on current research and highlight the need for further investigation into the underlying pathophysiology of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour.

The model has been designed with realism, clarity, easy use, broad application, modular, non marketing biase and management / business support as key elements. This {{has resulted in a}} model that does not use a propertarian format or software, and is functional on lower power hardware, <b>applicable</b> in all <b>veterinary</b> fields. The model divides costs in the following categories: overhead, staff, medicine, costs of sale and external costs. The sum of these categories and their respective share in total cost are the final result of the model. In 'discussion' much information is provided regarding the choices made when calculating a cost price. From illustrations of the model it can be concluded that the model is an effective tool for management of veterinary practices. For example the model shows that dividing cost price calculation in calculations for different sectors adds unwanted and nonrequired complexity. This also holds for cost price calculations of different parts of the practice (for example, calculating operating room housing costs over waiting room housing costs). Concluding the illustrations show that the biggest factor in cost price calculation is staff costs, the ratio direct and indirect costs of staff and the price of medication...|$|R
40|$|Conformational {{and other}} defects {{can affect the}} {{soundness}} of a horse and impede athletic performance to varying degrees. This study sought to investigate the prevalence {{of a variety of}} anatomical defects, to determine heritability estimates for a selection of these defects and to investigate the effect of a variety of these defects on the racing performance in a large sample of young Thoroughbred horses presented for sale. The study population consisted of data from 13, 603 pre-purchase <b>veterinary</b> examination <b>certificates</b> for three and four year old Thoroughbred National Hunt (NH) horses. The information was gathered using the Pre-Purchase <b>Veterinary</b> Examination <b>Certificates</b> from eight years of Tattersalls Ireland’s Derby Sale, Goffs Ireland June Sale and Doncaster Bloodstock Sales Ltd. (DBS) Spring Sale (2002 - 2009) and seven years of Tattersalls Ireland’s August Sale (2002 - 2008). All conditions noted by the veterinarian were recorded {{in order to determine the}} true prevalence of defects in this National Hunt population. It was found that 73. 58 % of the sample population had one or more defects with 12. 02 % having serious defects likely to prejudice their use for racing. Metacarpal/metatarsal exostoses and tarsal plantar desmitis affected 17. 11 % and 19. 40 % of the sample, respectively, while 9. 81 % of the horses were found to make respiratory noises and 5. 26 % had recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Age, sex and year of birth had a significant effect on the occurrence of many of the defects and panel veterinarians were significantly more likely to diagnose defects than the private veterinarians (p € 20, 001 compared to 8. 19 + 0. 276 for horses € 20, 001 compared to 0. 47 + 0. 037 for horses € 20, 001 compared to 1. 14 + 0. 075 for horses <€ 5, 000) than horses in the lower price brackets (P < 0. 001). Horses with prejudicial defects were significantly less likely to race (70. 4 % raced compared to 83. 7 %) or to win a race (33. 8 % compared to 41. 3 %) and had significantly fewer career starts (8. 68 + 0. 379 compared to 9. 91 + 0. 131), wins (0. 69 + 0. 071 compared to 0. 92 + 0. 026) and places (1. 39 + 0. 115 compared to 1. 76 + 0. 040) than horses without prejudicial defects (P < 0. 01). Horses with RLN were significantly less likely to race (69. 4 % compared to 83. 6 %) than those without RLN and had significantly fewer career wins (0. 68 + 0. 092 compared to 0. 92 + 0. 026) and career places (1. 35 + 0. 155 compared to 1. 76 + 0. 040) than those without RLN. They also had a significantly higher proportion of non-finished races than those without RLN (34. 01 %+ 2. 147 compared to 25. 29 %+ 0. 456). Horses with tarsal plantar desmitis also had a significantly higher proportion of non-finished races than those without tarsal plantar desmitis (29. 96 %+ 1. 754 compared to 25. 71 %+ 0. 489). Papillomas significantly adversely affected the number of career starts (8. 45 + 0. 470 compared to 9. 87 + 0. 128), career wins (0. 59 + 0. 079 compared to 0. 91 + 0. 025), career places (1. 30 + 0. 126 compared to 1. 75 + 0. 039) and mean earnings per start (£ 241. 5 + 41. 85 compared to £ 454. 6 + 21. 93). Horses with papillomas had significantly more non-finished races than those without papillomas (33. 34 %+ 2. 124 compared to 25. 85 %+ 0. 448) while interestingly, horses with sarcoids had significantly fewer non-finished races than those without sarcoids (19. 44 %+ 1. 805 compared to 26. 58 %+ 0. 452). Overall, the results indicate that a large proportion of Thoroughbred National Hunt horses are affected by defects of some kind. The results show that the prevalence of a large number of defects increases with age and that certain defects are viewed negatively by purchasers, thereby affecting the selling status. There was a heritable component to each of the defects and each defect was found to affect racing performance to some degree. The results indicate that veterinary pre-purchase examinations make a significant contribution in the evaluation of potential racehorses and that buyers’ estimates of value appear to correspond with subsequent racing performance. It may be of benefit to the Thoroughbred industry to monitor the prevalence of defects within the population. The low heritability of the more serious defects does suggest that genetic progress in the reduction of these defects in the horse population would be slow...|$|R
