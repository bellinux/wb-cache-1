5|$|In France, the Antoinist worship was {{classified}} as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary reports which considered {{it one of the}} oldest healer groups. Books published by Belgian and French anti-cult associations and activists sometimes included Antoinism in their lists of cults, such as Cults, State of Emergency—Better know them, better defend oneself in France and worldwide (Les Sectes, État d'urgence—Mieux les connaître, mieux s'en défendre en France et dans le monde), published by the Centre Roger Ikor, and others. However, on 27 May 2005, the 1995 annex of the French report and cult classifications in which the Antoinist worship was listed, were officially cancelled and invalidated by Jean-Pierre Raffarin's circulaire. In addition, in a 1984 letter, the French Minister of the Interior wrote that the movement was considered, from an <b>administrative</b> <b>point</b> of view, as having for exclusive purpose the exercise of a religion, thus complying with the 18th and 19th Articles of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. He added that antoinism had always been allowed to receive bequests or donations, which meant that its religious nature was never challenged. In the early 2000s, membership of an Antoinist mother in Valenciennes was used by her former husband to remove from her the custody of their son; the decision received attention from media and was criticized by the French sociologist Régis Dericquebourg as being unjustified.|$|E

25|$|Initially the Normans {{controlled}} large swathes of Ireland, {{securing the}} entire east coast, from Waterford up to eastern Ulster and penetrating as far west as Gaillimh (Galway) and Maigh Eo (Mayo). The most powerful {{forces in the}} land were the great Hiberno-Norman Earldoms such as the Geraldines, the Butlers and the de Burghs (Burkes), who controlled vast territories which were almost independent of the governments in Dublin or London.

40|$|AbstractTourism is the world's largest {{industry}} {{and one of}} the fastest growing sectors, accounting for over one-third of the value of total worldwide services trade. Tourism, in the last few decades, has become an indispensable source of income for developing countries, Turkey in particular, and this aspect of tourism has managed to catch the attention of a number of countries, principally developing ones. The tourism literature abounds a number of studies into tourism and economic growth nexus through a variety of methods such as Granger-causality, co-integration, regression analyses. However, there are hardly any studies incorporating input-output analysis. Within this context, this study sets out to examine the tourism and economic growth nexus by means of input-output analysis, covering forward and backward linkage effects, based on the 2002 input-output table, which is the latest one released by TURKSTAT. We estimate significance of the impact of tourism on economic growth. The variables used for economic growth are income and production outputs.

2500|$|A {{charter of}} Henry I in about 1130 gave the City of London its own Sheriff.

[...] This relationship continued until the Local Government Act 1888 created a new office of High Sheriff of Middlesex appointed {{in the same manner}} as other English and Welsh counties, created the County of London with its own High Sheriff, and restricted [...] the jurisdiction of the sheriffs of London to the City.|$|E
6000|$|Naturally, the land-revenue is {{the most}} {{interesting}} thing in Marwar from an <b>administrative</b> <b>point</b> of view. The basis of it is a tank {{about the size of a}} swimming-bath, with a catchment of several hundred square yards, draining through leeped channels. When God sends the rain, the people of the village drink from the tank. When the rains fail, as they failed this year, they take to their wells, which are brackish and breed guinea-worm. For these reasons the revenue, like the Republic of San Domingo, is never alike for two years running. There are no canal questions to harry the authorities; but the fluctuations are enormous. Under the Aravalis the soil is good: further north they grow millet and pasture cattle, though, said a Revenue Officer cheerfully, [...] "God knows what the brutes find to eat." [...] Apropos of irrigation, the one canal deserves special mention, as showing how George Stephenson came to Jodhpur and astonished the inhabitants. Six miles from the city proper lies the Balsaman Sagar, a great tank. In the hot weather, when the city tanks ran out or stank, it was the pleasant duty of the women to tramp twelve miles at the end of the day's work to fill their lotahs. In the hot weather Jodhpur is--let a simile suffice. Sukkur in June would be Simla to Jodhpur.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{classify}} european countries {{in terms of their}} business climate using the method of cluster analysis over the years 2008 - 2013. Changes in classification during this period are associated with events of global significance (e. g. World financial crisis) or local importance (reforms, EU strategy [...] .). Data base consists of indicators describing administrative, financial and law environment for doing business and are publicated by World Bank. Clusters indicate both geographic conditionality and specific attributes of these clusters, which suggest countries with better/worse conditions in some of the areas. Particular attention is given to development in the Czech republic. There was significant change in classificiation between 2008 and 2009 and subsequently became stable. The results of analysis correspond to the existing rankings and indicators of business demography. Potentials for improvement which might leed to stabel economic development according to the conducted analysis are outlined in the end of the thesis (f. e. implementation of unified <b>administrative</b> <b>points,</b> electronization and further simplification of bureaucratic processes) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of single-user workstations that access files remotely over a local area network. From the environmental, economic, and <b>administrative</b> <b>points</b> of view, workstations that are diskless or that have limited secondary storage are desirable at the present time. Even with changing technology, access to shared data {{will continue to be}} important. It is likely that some performance penalty must be paid for remote rather than local file access. Our objectives are to assess this penalty and to explore a number of design alternatives that can serve to minimize it. Our approach is to use the results of measurement experiments to parameterize queuing network performance models. These models then are used to assess performance under load and to evahrate design alternatives. The major conclusions of our study are: (1) A system of diskless workstations with a shared file server can have satisfactory performance. By this, we mean performance comparable to that of a local disk in the lightly loaded case, and the ability to support substantial numbers of client workstations without significant degradation. As with any shared facility, good design is necessary to minimize queuing delays under high load. (2) The key to efficiency is protocols that allow volume transfers at every interface (e. g., between client and server, and between disk and memory at the server) and at every level (e. g., between client and server at the level of logica...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the theory underpinning {{the design of}} optimal tariffs in a developing economy, {{and the experience of}} implementation of tariff reforms. A central issue is whether and when a case can be made for a uniform tariff structure. While theory advocates a differentiated tariff structure (except under a balance of payments objective), political economy considerations, inadequate information, and <b>administrative</b> convenience <b>point</b> to a minimally differentiated tariff structure. The experience of reform indicates that tariff structures are mainly influenced by income distribution and protection objectives. The ability to successfully reduce tariffs depends on measures taken to alleviate fiscal and balance of payments constraints. ...|$|R

For huge territory which was attached in the east this period designated the need of its economic development. This development included among other fixing of information about territory both as the written texts arranging the population, lands, duties (tyaglo) and in the form of the cartographical documents which were fixing the new region, allocating <b>administrative</b> <b>points</b> and etc. This article presents the comparative analysis of office administration and cartographic materials of the specified period such as the Census book of the Tara District of 1701 and the Chorographic Drawing book by S. U. Remezov. Despite the differences in objectives set for the compilers of the investigated sources, both this documents in many respects are intertwined in implementation of own intentions. This stipulated their parallel cross-lightning of the perspective connected with development of the population of a certain territory. There are given some examples which are connected with descriptions of the social and economic plan, structure of the population, housekeeping methods, the environmental conditions, means of communication and their extents. It allows to verify the identification, comparison and mutual addition of information of the Census book and Chorographic book. Moreover it confirms possibility of getting of new information which allows to visually assess the situation which developed in Middle Priirtyshje in specified historical period of time. It is obvious that drawings of S. U. Remezov have refracted the fiscal document Census book so authors suggest that it will allow to perform further historical reconstruction of the population of this territory at a boundary of the XVII–XVIII centuries. ...|$|R
