40|$|This is {{the final}} report of Defra project OF 0145. If organic farming is to expand in the arable east of England, where the knowledge, {{infrastructure}} and capital for livestock are not available, viable stockless systems will be needed. The aim is to maximise economic performance and in turn encourage conversion. Project OF 0112 showed that a stockless arable rotation was consistently more profitable that a comparable conventional rotation on the fertile silty clay loam at ADAS Terrington. Project OF 0145 researched challenges to sustaining that level of performance into the second crop rotation. The project {{was a combination of}} systems comparison, replicated experiments and monitoring of commercial farms. The core of the project was an unreplicated systems comparison with field-scale plots to allow meaningful study of patchy problems such as perennial weeds and give confidence to farmers that the system could work on a farm scale. Conversion was completed in 1995 and the rotation has since been clover, potatoes, winter wheat, spring beans, undersown spring barley. The greatest agronomic challenges continued to be with the establishment of fertility-building legumes. Despite these problems, crop yields have been maintained with good rolling average yields of 25 t/ha for potatoes, 7. 5 t/ha for winter wheat, 3. 5 t/ha for spring beans and 4. 1 t/ha for spring cereals. Disease levels in cereals have remained low and posed minimum threat to yields. Slugs and blight have affected potatoes in wet years; control of these is particularly difficult in an organic system leading to greater yield variability than would be expected in a non-organic rotation. Calabrese has grown and yielded well with few problems but weed control in onions proved both difficult and expensive and they have been dropped in the successor project OF 0301. Weighted rolling-average gross margins show a consistent and large advantage to organic (£ 912 /ha conventional, £ 1757 /ha stockless with potatoes and £ 1148 /ha stockless with vegetables). The advantage to organic has increased with time as yields and prices have been maintained whilst conventional crop prices have fallen. Soil fertility as measured by carbon and nitrogen contents has shown little change since the start of conversion in 1990. Soil available P and K have remained at ADAS Index 1 to 2 despite continued crop offtakes. However both are showing a slow progressive decline, less so with P, perhaps partly due to the rotational applications of <b>Aluminium</b> <b>Calcium</b> <b>Phosphate.</b> Annual weeds are proving relatively easy to control, being worst where crop growth is poor for reasons such as compaction on headlands. However, the perennial weeds couch grass, creeping thistles and docks are an increasing problem. Hand pulling of thistles and docks is containing the problem but the cost of this has risen dramatically in the last two years. The distribution of potato cyst nematodes (PCN) was mapped within all five plots in January 1998, 1999 and 2000. Sampling was in 25 m x 25 m sub-plots. In January 2000 viable cysts were found in 7. 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of organic conversions {{have been on}} upland grass-based livestock farms resulting in a shortage of UK-grown cereals and pulses. Across northern Europe, conventional agriculture has developed a specialised structure with many areas having no livestock, or knowledge or facilities to support livestock. Sustainable organic production on these farms has particular challenges for nutrient supply, {{for the management of}} weeds, pests and diseases and for economically viability. This report covers a three and a half year period (four crop harvests) of a longer-term programme of work, which began in 1990. The overall objective was to identify and overcome factors limiting the sustainability of a stockless arable rotation. Specific objectives were to 1) quantify crop yield and quality, 2) quantify the financial performance of the rotation and contrast with Farm Business Survey data from comparable non-organic arable farms, 3) to monitor and evaluate indicators of sustainability; particularly for nutrients, weeds, pests and diseases and 4) to communicate results, and their implications, to Defra and other stakeholders. These were all achieved. The study was located on the ADAS Research Centre at Terrington St Clement, Norfolk. The soil is a deep stoneless silty clay loam of the Wisbech series. It is derived from marine alluvium, has a naturally high pH of around 7. 5 and is retentive of water and nutrients. The project was an unreplicated study with field-scale plots. There were five plots, each of 2 ha, each in a different phase of a five-year rotation. This design, with no replication within-year, whilst allowing more meaningful crop husbandry and economic evaluation than a conventional small-plot replicated experiment, did limit statistical analysis. This was a deliberate choice as economic evaluation and demonstration were the principal initial objectives of the project. Despite this limitation, it has provided a long-term data-set gathered under realistic conditions that gave useful indicators of crop performance in a stockless rotation, and provided data for other Defra-funded projects, such as economic modelling. The project was managed by a steering group chaired by the Defra project officer. Other members included Roger Unwin, policy adviser on soil protection and organic farming in the Defra Rural Development Service, three organic farmers, and representatives of the Soil Association and Elm Farm Research Centre (EFRC). Meetings were held twice per year. Detailed written reports were submitted to each meeting for discussion. All changes to cropping and management were agreed by the group. The crop sequence from 2002 to 2004 was: potatoes and calabrese (split ⅔ potatoes and ⅓ calabrese)  winter wheat  spring beans  spring wheat (undersown)  white clover (fertility building crop). The clover was mown three to four times per year and left as a mulch. Organic registration was with the Soil Association. All crop management operations were done using normal farm machinery; the aim was to simulate typical commercial practice. No fertilisers were applied apart from <b>aluminium</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (“Redslaag”) once per rotation, at 625 kg/ha. No irrigation was applied. Undersown white clover thrived only in one year (2002) out of five. Establishment was affected variously by slug grazing, insufficient rain, and excessive rain. It was successfully re-sown in 2003 but had to be replaced by spring sown vetch in 2004 and 2005. Of all the crops grown post-conversion, fertility-building crops have been the most difficult to establish. Over the life of the programme, clover failed to successfully establish in four of the eleven years from 1995 to 2005, even when re-sown in some years. Vetch was sown in spring as a (reputedly) rapidly-growing replacement in three of the years but it was slow to establish, competed poorly with weeds and had a considerably lower accumulated nitrogen in the mulched foliage. The mean accumulated nitrogen in vetch was 102 kg/ha (range 90 to 121), whereas in clover it was 175 kg/ha (range 0 to 274). Despite the poor performance of some of the fertility-building crops, this was not clearly reflected in the performance of following cash crops. This conclusion was supported by results from replicated experiments comparing legume species over different seasons, done at Terrington in the 1990 s as part of this programme (and published in a peer reviewed journal), and by results from a stockless arable study on fertile soil in Germany. Yield of winter wheat was good with an average of 7. 0 t/ha; this compares with a typical organic yield of 4. 0 t/ha. Yield was relatively consistent, and reflected environmental conditions, with lowest yields in the very dry 1995 and the wet and dull 1997 and 2001. The highest yield of 9. 8 t/ha was in 1996 when a dry and sunny early summer was followed by rain in July and August ensuring good grain fill. Grain nitrogen content ranged from 1. 7...|$|E

40|$|Root {{characteristics}} {{associated with}} phosphorus (P) uptake under limiting soil-P conditions {{were examined in}} two sets of greenhouse experiments. Average diameter and length of soybean, cowpea, maize and sorghum roots were assessed after 7 weeks in three low-P soils amended with P fertilizer at 0, 3, 6, 11 and 23 mg P/kg. Organic acids in the rhizosphere of soybean, cowpea and pigeon pea were separately evaluated in one soil amended with or without rock phosphate, iron <b>phosphate,</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> or triple super phosphate. Unplanted soil served as the control. The growth of soybean, cowpea, maize, and sorghum was significantly improved with P application in all the soils {{and the amount of}} P applied played an important role. The shoot dry matter yield and P accumulation correlated significantly with the root length of cowpea and the average diameter of sorghum roots. Citric acid was the only organic acid detected in measurable quantities in the rhizosphere of all plants tested; on average, it varied from 4 (pigeon pea) to 17 (soybean) mu mol/g soil. For soybean, the secretion of citric acid appeared important for P acquisition in P-limiting environments whereas for cowpea, the size of the roots may be more important. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} influence of various micronized poorly water-soluble inorganic materials on the dissolution and de-agglomeration behaviour of a micronized, poorly water-soluble model drug, indomethacin, from lactose interactive mixtures. Dissolution of indomethacin was studied using the USP paddle method and the data were modelled with multi-exponential equations using a nonlinear least squares algorithm in order to obtain key parameter estimates. The dispersion of indomethacin mixtures was measured by laser diffraction. The addition of <b>aluminium</b> hydroxide and <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> to binary mixtures of indomethacin counter-intuitively improved the dissolution rate of indomethacin due to significant increases in both the estimated initial concentration and dissolution rate constant of dispersed particles of indomethacin. While some enhancement was due to pH changes in the dissolution medium, the presence of these poorly water-soluble inorganic salts caused de-agglomeration. Average particle size distributions indicated that the presence of aluminium hydroxide within the matrix of indomethacin had reduced the agglomerate concentration whilst increasing the dispersed particle concentration. These findings provide the first evidence of the ability of poorly water-soluble inorganic salts to enhance the de-agglomeration and dissolution of micronized powders, potentially translating to improved bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs...|$|R

Thus, synthetic <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> are of great significance because of their biodegradability and biocompatibility, and have been investigated for applications in bone repair/tissue engineering [26, 27], drug loading and release [28, 29], gene delivery [30, 31], and other biomedical areas. Owing to its chemical nature, <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> nanostructures may serve as an ideal candidate for both bio-imaging and drug delivery. The investigation on rare earth-doped <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> has become a hot research topic [32 – 37]. However, up to now, little work has been reported on dual or multifunctional <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> nanostructures for biomedical applications. HAp, a kind of chemically stable <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> has been used for drug storage and luminescence [38]. The development of bi-functional nanosystems of other <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> such as amorphous <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (ACP) is still scarce.

Recently, <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> have been used to provide transfection of DNA and deliver drugs via surface decoration of microparticles [8 – 13], because <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> are naturally nontoxic as well as bioresorbable. <b>Calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> are native to the body, and the problems of metabolism pathway can be greatly reduced compared to other delivery systems [14].

Many studies conducted have shown the synergistic effect between CPP-ACP and fluoride which {{can be attributed to}} the formation of CPP-stabilized amorphous <b>calcium</b> fluoride <b>phosphate,</b> resulting in the increased incorporation of fluoride ions into plaque, together with increased concentrations of bioavailable <b>calcium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> ions [4, 5, 9, 10].|$|R
