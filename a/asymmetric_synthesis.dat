25|$|However, {{there are}} several {{challenges}} that must be overcome before hydrogen bond catalysis can achieve its full potential in terms of synthetic utility. Current known reactions are very substrate specific and generally exhibit low rate acceleration and turnover, thus requiring high catalyst loading. Catalysts are often discovered and optimized by trial and error, and chemists have a poor {{understanding of the relationship}} between catalyst structure and reactivity. Additionally, the field suffers from a lack of general mechanistic understanding, which has been greatly outpaced by the discovery of new reactions. With more detailed studies of structure and mechanism in the future, hydrogen bond catalysis has great potential for enabling new, efficient, selective reactions and promising applications in <b>asymmetric</b> <b>synthesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in 2004 that excess racemic D,L-asparagine (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as arginine (Arg), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), leucine (Leu), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), serine (Ser), valine (Val), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp). The enantiomeric excess {ee=100x(L-D)/(L+D)} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly {{with that of the}} inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 D,L-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess D,L-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized. It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in L- or D-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee {{was reported}} to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if <b>asymmetric</b> <b>synthesis</b> of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.|$|E

2500|$|One {{supposition}} is {{that the}} discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the Murchison meteorite supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence {{for the existence of}} circularly polarized light originating from Mie scattering on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an enantiomeric excess within chiral material in space.
