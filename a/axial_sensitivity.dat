40|$|Coherence {{scanning}} interferometry (CSI) is {{an optical}} profilometry technique {{that uses the}} scanning of white light interference fringes over {{the depth of the}} surface of a sample to measure the surface roughness. Many different types of algorithms have been proposed to determine the fringe envelope, such as peak fringe intensity detection, demodulation, centroid detection, FFT, wavelets and signal correlation. In this paper we present a very compact and efficient algorithm based on the measurement of the signal modulation using a second-order nonlinear filter derived from Teager-Kaiser methods and known as the five-sample adaptive (FSA) algorithm. We describe its implementation in a measuring system for static surface roughness measurement. Two envelope peak detection techniques are demonstrated. The first one, using second order spline fitting results in an <b>axial</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 25 nm and is better adapted to rough samples. The second one, using local phase correction, gives nanometric <b>axial</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and is more appropriate for smooth samples. The choice of technique is important to minimize artifacts.

Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive tool capable of imaging {{skin on the}} micron scale. However, the modality’s contrast sensitivity limits its ability to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue in some non-melanoma skin cancers. In this thesis, optical coherence elastography is explored {{as a means of}} contrast enhancement through the analysis of a sample’s mechanical, rather than optical, properties. An analysis of OCT imaging performance is used to design a suitable elastography phantom. Experimental measurements are also used to optimise the image tracking software. A well-defined, controlled actuation is applied to a tissue phantom and imaged using optical coherence elastography. A stiff inclusion is subsequently discerned from the surrounding material, even though conventional image contrast is low. Elastographic detail is also depicted in tissue.

40|$|We present {{characteristics}} of a wavelength swept laser with a scanning fiber Fabry-Perot filter at 1300 nm. We investigate the dependence of the scanning frequencies in the swept laser. In conventional wavelength swept lasers, the relative intensity of the laser output decreases significantly as the scanning frequency increases. The peak wavelength of the output spectrum is red-shifted due to the nonlinear frequency downshifting in the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). In the Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) wavelength swept laser, we investigate transient intensity profiles and the full width at half maximum {{in response to the}} injection currents and detuning of the scanning frequency. The degradation of the scanning range of the swept laser is caused by the deviation from the scanning frequency at 45. 6 kHz. In addition, transient intensity profiles show significant asymmetric behavior in response to the detuned frequencies. Finally, the <b>axial</b> resolution and <b>sensitivity</b> as a function of imaging depth are analyzed for both forward and backward scans.

It makes use of two sheared and quasi-overlapped illuminating beams experiencing relative phase shifts when going through the object, and a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensor array to record the resulting interference pattern.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{quantitative}} PET imaging it {{is important}} to correct for all image-degrading effects, for example detector efficiency variation. Detector efficiency variation depends on the stability of detector efficiency when operating conditions vary within normal limits. As the efficiency of APD-based light detection strongly depends on ambient temperature, temperature-dependent detector efficiency normalization may be needed in APD-based PET scanners. We have investigated the temperature dependence of the LabPET APD-based small-animal PET scanner. MATERIALS AND METHODS First a simulation study was performed to evaluate the effect of different APD temperature coefficients on the temperature dependence of scanner sensitivity. Five experiments were also performed. First the immediate effect of temperature changes on scanner sensitivity was evaluated. Second, the effect of temperature changes that have stabilized for a few hours was investigated. In a third experiment the <b>axial</b> <b>sensitivity</b> profile was acquired at 21 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Next, two acquisitions of the NEMA image quality phantom (at 21 degrees C and 23 degrees C) were performed and absolute quantification was done based on normalization scans acquired at the correct and incorrect temperature. Finally, the feasibility of maintaining a constant room temperature and the stability of the scanner sensitivity under constant room temperature was evaluated. RESULTS Simulations showed that the relation between temperature-dependent APD gain changes and scanner sensitivity is quite complex. A temperature deviation leading to a 1 % change in APD gain corresponds to a much larger change in scanner sensitivity due to the shape of the energy histogram. In the first and second experiment a strong correlation between temperature and scanner sensitivity was observed. Changes of 2. 24 kcps/MBq and 1. 64 kcps/MBq per degrees C were seen for immediate and stabilized temperature changes respectively. The NEMA <b>axial</b> <b>sensitivity</b> profile also showed a decrease in sensitivity at higher temperature. The quantification experiment showed that a larger quantification error (up to 13 %) results when a normalization scan acquired at the incorrect temperature is used. In the last experiment, temperature variability was 0. 19 degrees C and counts varied by 10. 2 Mcts (1. 33 %). CONCLUSION The sensitivity of the LabPET small-animal PET scanner strongly depends on room temperature. Therefore, room temperature should be kept as stable as possible and temperature-dependent detector efficiency normalization should be used. However, with constant room temperature excellent scanner stability is observed. Temperature should be kept constant within 0. 5 degrees C and weekly normalization scans are recommended...|$|E

40|$|The first fiber Bragg grating (FBG) {{accelerometer}} using direct transverse {{forces is}} demonstrated by fixing the FBG by its two ends and placing a transversely moving inertial object at its middle. It is very sensitive because a lightly stretched FBG is more sensitive to transverse forces than axial forces. Its resonant frequency and static sensitivity are analyzed by the classic spring-mass theory, assuming the axial force changes little. The experiments show that the theory can be modified for cases where the assumption does not hold. The resonant frequency can be modified by a linear relationship experimentally achieved, and the static sensitivity by an alternative method proposed.

40|$|Surface Plasmons {{provide a}} {{relatively}} high <b>axial</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and thus are generally used in a thin surface film sensing and imaging. Objective lens based surface plasmon microscopy enables measurement of local refractive index on a far finer scale than the conventional prism based systems. However, researchers find that a trade-off between the lateral resolution and the <b>axial</b> <b>sensitivity</b> exists in the conventional intensity based surface plasmon microscopy. In order to optimize the trade-off, interferometric surface plasmon microscopy was exploited. An interferometric or confocal system gives the so-called V(z) curve, the output response {{as a function of}} defocus, when the sample is scanned axially, which gives a measure of the surface plasmon propagation velocity. Considering the complexity of the two arm interferometric system, in this thesis, I show how a confocal system provides a more flexible and more stable alternative. This confocal system, however, places greater demands on the dynamic range of the system. Firstly, the sharp edge of the pupil on the back focal plane of the objective can generate similar effect with the surface plasmon (SPs) ripples; Secondly, the SPs ripples that convey much of the information are much smaller compared to the in focus response which means the confocal system suffers from low signal to noise ratio (SNR). In order to overcome the limitations, I proposed pupil function engineering which was to use a spatial light modulator to modulate the illumination beam profile by using the designed pupil functions with smooth edges. The results show that the sharp edge effect of confocal setup can be greatly reduced and the SNR is improved. Based on this system, I demonstrated that images obtained from the setup are comparable with the two arm interferometric SPR microscope and other wide-field non-SPR microscope. Secondly, I demonstrate the technique of V(α). A phase Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) was applied to replace the previous amplitude SLM. I show how a phase spatial light modulator (i) performs the necessary pupil function apodization (ii) imposes an angular varying phase shift that effectively changes sample defocus without any mechanical movement and (iii) changes the relative phase of the surface plasmons and reference beam to provide signal enhancement not possible with previous configurations using ASLM. Later, I extend the interferometer concept in the confocal system to produce an ‘embedded’ phase shifting interferometer in chapter 6, where I can control the phase between the reference and surface plasmon beams with a spatial light modulator. I demonstrate that this approach facilitates extraction of the amplitude and phase of the surface plasmons to measure of the phase velocity and the attenuation of the surface plasmons with greatly improved signal to noise compared to previous measurement approaches[1]. I also show that reliable results are obtained over smaller axial scan ranges giving potentially superior lateral resolution. In the end of the thesis, future work will be discussed. Firstly, I will propose another technique called ‘artificial’ plasmon. Secondly, I will recommend constructing another system and develop the ideas discussed so the system can work in aqueous environment. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} use of zone plate interferometers for the precise location of position. The thesis begins by discussing the use of the zone plate as an optical component and examines the wavefront aberrations that can occur in higher orders of diffraction. Interferometers applicable to the measurement of position are then reviewed, including interferometers that incorporate optical zone plates as beam dividers and beam combiners. A zone plate interferometer for defining and locating multiple positions in three-dimensions is reported. Here, a three-dimensional array of positions is defined by a two-dimensional array of reflective zone plates. An optical probe containing two zone plates completes the interferometer, and is used to locate the positions. The displacement sensitivity of the probe can be controlled at the optical design stage. The variation of sensitivity with wavefront geometry is explored and expressions are derived for the transverse and <b>axial</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in terms of the conjugates of the illuminating wavefronts. Various wave front configurations were experimented with and the resulting position location patterns recorded. The measured values of sensitivity to displacement are compared to theory. A version of this interferometer was designed and developed by the author, for checking the performance of three-coordinate measuring machines used in engineering metrology. The results of trials with the interferometer, comparing the performance of measuring machines in several government laboratories, are reported. The averaged repeatability of setting, on one optically defined position, was found to be 1 µm in the transverse directions and 6 µm in the axial direction. Resulting from this work, two simple devices for pointing are described. Each uses a pair of zone plates to define an optical axis. In one case, the axis is precisely located by positioning a coherent light source and observing the interference bands generated by the device. In the other, moire bands are observed in incoherent illumination...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} done to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of oblique axial MR imaging in studying individual ACL bundle lesions. Subjects and methods: This study included forty-one (41) patients; 20 patients with no symptoms or signs of ACL injury and 21 patients in the suspected ACL lesions group. Each patient had a single MRI examination followed by a single indicated arthroscopy. The standard knee protocol (sagittal FSE proton density, coronal FSE T 2 -fat suppressed, axial FSE T 2, sagittal FSE T 1 and sagittal STIR) was designated protocol A, while the standard knee protocol plus oblique axial imaging was designated protocol B. Results: The comparative study was done using MRI protocol A versus protocol B for isolated anteromedial and posterolateral bundle {{as well as for}} ACL lesions as a whole with comparing these findings with arthroscopy as the gold standard. The addition of oblique <b>axial</b> imaging, increased <b>sensitivity</b> for ACL lesions (as a whole) from 74 % to 95 % and the accuracy from 76 % to 95 % while specificity remained similar. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of standard MR imaging for the detection of anteromedial bundle lesions were shown to be 80 %, 100 % and 86 %, while that for posterolateral bundle lesions was 78 %, 100 % and 81 % respectively. However, the addition of oblique <b>axial</b> imaging, increased <b>sensitivity</b> for anteromedial bundle lesions to 88 % and accuracy to 90 % while specificity remained similar. For posterolateral bundle lesions, the sensitivity increased to 89 % and accuracy to 90 % while specificity remains similar. Conclusion: Compared with standard MR imaging, the addition of oblique axial imaging improves the diagnostic accuracy for detecting lesions of the ACL, including both bundles’ delineation. This imaging plane seems to provide a useful adjunct to standard MR imaging when ACL lesion is suspected...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, a strong {{progress}} has been made in the photo-writing of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) in polymer optical fibers (POFs), animated by the constant wish to enhance the grating reflectivity and improve the sensing performances. In this paper, we report the photoinscription of highly reflective gratings in step-index POFs, obtained thanks to a slight etching of the cladding. We demonstrate that a cladding diameter decrease of ∼ 12 % is an ideal trade-off to produce highly reflective gratings with enhanced <b>axial</b> strain <b>sensitivity,</b> while keeping almost intact their mechanical resistance. For this, we make use of Trans- 4 -stilbenemethanoldoped photosensitive step-index poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) POFs. FBGs are inscribed at ∼ 1550 nm by the scanning phase mask technique in POFs of different external diameters. Reflectivity reaching 97 % is achieved for 6 mm long FBGs, compared to 25 % for non-etched POFs. We also report that a cladding decrease enhances the FBG axial tension while keeping unchanged temperature and surrounding refractive index sensitivities. Finally and for the first time, a measurement is conducted in transmission with polarized light, showing that a photo-induced birefringence of 7 × 10 - 6 is generated (one order of magnitude higher than the intrinsic fiber birefringence), which is similar to the one generated in silica fiber using ultra-violet laser.

40|$|Postflight {{analysis}} of the Mars Pathfinder hypersonic, continuum aerodynamic data base is presented. Measured data include accelerations along the body axis and axis normal directions. Comparisons of preflight simulation and measurements show good agreement. The prediction of two static instabilities associated with movement of the sonic line from the shoulder to the nose and back was confirmed by measured normal accelerations. Reconstruction of atmospheric density during entry has an uncertainty directly proportional to the uncertainty in the predicted <b>axial</b> coefficient. The <b>sensitivity</b> of the moment coefficient to freestream density, kinetic models and center-of-gravity location are examined to provide additional consistency checks of the simulation with flight data. The atmospheric density as derived from axial coefficient and measured axial accelerations falls within the range required for sonic line shift and static stability transition as independently determined from normal accelerations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To {{expand the}} {{availability}} of SPECT for biomedical research, we developed a SPECT imaging system on an existing animal PET detector by adding a slit-slat collimator. As the detector crystals are pixelated, the relative slat-to-crystal position (SCP) in the axial direction affects the photon flux distribution onto the crystals. The accurate knowledge of SCP {{is important to the}} <b>axial</b> resolution and <b>sensitivity</b> of the system. This work presents a method for optimizing SCP in system design and for determining SCP in system geometrical calibration. The optimiza-tion was achieved by finding the SCP that provides higher spatial resolution in terms of average-root-mean-square width of the axial point spread function (PSF) without loss of sensitivity. The calibration was based on the least-square-error method that minimizes the difference between the measured and modeled axial point spread projections. The uniqueness and accuracy o...|$|R
