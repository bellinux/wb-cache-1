50|$|Macy {{was laid}} out in 1860 {{at the time the}} {{railroad}} arrived in the neighborhood. The community was originally known as Lincoln, but when it was discovered that there was already another Lincoln in Cass County, the name was changed in order to prevent confusion in the mail system. The namesake of Macy is David Macy, president of the Indianapolis, Peru and Chicago Railway. The post office <b>at</b> <b>Macy</b> has been in operation since 1880.|$|E
5000|$|In 1931 Biala's work {{appeared}} in New York <b>at</b> <b>Macy</b> Galleries. In this exhibition of Provincetown artists she was identified, anachronistically, as [...] "J. Tworkov." [...] A year later, as Janice Ford Biala, she contributed paintings {{to a show}} called [...] "1940" [...] at Parc des Expositions, Paris. Reporting on this show, a New York critic said [...] "The things and figures in her painting gravely turn about as if in some slow and harmonious joy. Not a hilarious joy nor a country dance. Something much richer and more contemplative than hilarity." [...] At this time she wrote to her brother Jack [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life I'm convinced that I am really an artist." ...|$|E

5000|$|William Ivers (Jeffrey Donovan): A creepily charming attorney, he {{was hired}} in season six by the governor's office to {{investigate}} any questionable behavior within the morgue, aiming directly <b>at</b> <b>Macy,</b> although Jordan was a brief potential suspect. He disappointingly finds nothing wrong and later targets the morgue's current spending as an open door to major disaster, enforcing a new, strict budget depriving the morgue of much-needed equipment. This loss causes many problems in two important cases ("Night of The Living Dead" [...] and especially [...] "Isolation"), with the latter resulting in the new budget being revoked and Ivers' exit. He briefly returns in [...] "Dead Again", teaming with Jordan when a woman presumed murdered from a case Ivers had been prosecuting attorney 6 years prior somehow ends up dead in the morgue.|$|E

In 1944 Gerardo Vega, of Costa Rica, {{was the first}} Latin-American native to pioneer when he began work in Panama. Regional committees overseeing various countries of Latin and South America were appointed. Retrospectively a stated purpose for the committee was to facilitate {{a shift in the}} balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. Back in North America, the first all-Indian assembly in the Americas was first established in 1948 on the Omaha Indian Reservation <b>at</b> <b>Macy,</b> Nebraska. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. Shoghi Effendi then called for two international conventions to be held at April 1951; one was held in Panama City for the purpose of electing a regional National Spiritual Assembly ...|$|E

40|$|Since their {{inception}} <b>at</b> <b>Macy</b> {{conferences in}} later 1940 s complex systems remain {{the most controversial}} topic of inter-disciplinary sciences. The term `complex system' is the most vague and liberally used scientific term. Using elementary cellular automata (ECA), and exploiting the CA classification, we demonstrate elusiveness of `complexity' by shifting space-time dynamics of the automata from simple to complex by enriching cells with memory. This way, we can transform any ECA class to another ECA class [...] - without changing skeleton of cell-state transition function [...] - and vice versa by just selecting a right kind of memory. A systematic analysis display that memory helps `discover' hidden information and behaviour on trivial [...] - uniform, periodic, and non-trivial [...] - chaotic, complex [...] - dynamical systems.
