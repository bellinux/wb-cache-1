30|$|Optical fiber {{vibration}} {{is detected}} by the coherent optical time domain reflection technique. In {{addition to the}} vibration signals, the reflected signals include clutters and noises, which {{lead to a high}} false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate.</b> The “cell averaging” constant false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> algorithm has a high computing speed, but its detection performance will be declined in nonhomogeneous environments such as multiple targets. The “order statistics” constant false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> algorithm has a distinct advantage in multiple target environments, but it has a lower computing speed. An intelligent two-level detection algorithm is presented based on “cell averaging” constant false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> and “order statistics” constant false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> which work in serial way, and the detection speed of “cell averaging” constant false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> and performance of “order statistics” constant false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> are conserved, respectively. Through the adaptive selection, the “cell averaging” is applied in homogeneous environments, and the two-level detection algorithm is employed in nonhomogeneous environments. Our Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that considering different signal noise ratios, the proposed algorithm gives better detection probability than that of “order statistics”.|$|R

30|$|Both {{the true}} and false <b>alarm</b> <b>rates</b> are {{significant}} {{and in the}} optimal situation, they should be {{as close as possible}} to one and zero, respectively. However, we prefer to have a lower false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> than a higher true <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> because a false alarm imposes much effort in drilling down the WBS to find out the source of variation. Hence, we recommend setting a lower control level to avoid such costly effort.|$|R

40|$|Many {{different}} demands {{can be made}} of {{intrusion detection}} systems. An important requirement is that an intrusion detection system be effective; that is, it should detect a substantial percentage of intrusions into the supervised system, while still keeping the false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> at an acceptable level. This article demonstrates that, for a reasonable set of assumptions, the false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> is the limiting factor {{for the performance of}} an intrusion detection system. This is due to the base-rate fallacy phenomenon, that in order to achieve substantial values of the Bayesian detection rate P�Intrusion⎪Alarm�, we have to achieve a (perhaps in some cases unattainably) low false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate.</b> A selection of reports of intrusion detection performance are reviewed, and the conclusion is reached that there are indications that at least some types of intrusion detection have far to go before they can attain such low false <b>alarm</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

25|$|A news {{commentator}} {{writing for}} The Lancet, Andrew Meldrum, said that President Mugabe’s Youth Militia threatened health professionals that provided medical treatment to political opponents. He said that, combined with decreasing education standards, low pay, and {{a shortage of}} medical supplies like latex gloves, this led doctors to leave Zimbabwe at an <b>alarming</b> <b>rate.</b> According to Douglas Gwatidzo, {{the chairman of the}} Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights group, Zimbabwe had only one doctor assigned to a group of 12,000 citizens. Doctors in Zimbabwe fill only 25% of the medical posts available, and even fewer specialist positions are taken. According to Meldrum, this poses serious challenges to health care for diseases like HIV/AIDS and cholera. Similarly, the effects of cholera are exacerbated without proper nutrition, and Zimbabwe has faced food shortages for the last several years.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{decrease in}} the member of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an <b>alarming</b> <b>rate,</b> thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, {{increase the amount of}} detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth. In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the relationships between automation false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate,</b> human trust in automation, and human use of automation, specifically under conditions of simulated high risk. The experiment involved military pilots flying combat and non-combat missions while employing a missile warning sensor with two levels of automation. The experiment was performed in a high fidelity F- 16 simulator with U. S. Air Force F- 16 pilots as test subjects. Three sensor false <b>alarm</b> <b>rates</b> were tested. The results showed that the level of missile warning sensor automation preferred by the pilots was strongly dependent on the false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> of the automation. The data demonstrated that as false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> increased, pilot trust of the missile warning sensor decreased, resulting in the pilot preferring a lower level of automation. However, the results also showed that even when pilots expressed little trust in the system, they preferred to use some level of automation rather than turn the system off. This result was attributed to the cost/benefit tradeoff of using the automation, as well as the extreme difficulty and hazard associated with the task. Analysis of the pilot mean reaction time in response to a missile warning sensor alert showed that reaction time increased as the false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> increased, although this effect appeared to be less significant the higher the false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate.</b> Missile hit data indicated that as false <b>alarm</b> <b>rate</b> increased, the number of missiles that hit the pilot’s aircraft also increased, demonstrating a degradation in pilot survivability. Missile hit results also indicated that using a higher level of automation improved pilot survivability for the scenarios tested.
