5|$|Hereditary hemorrhagic {{telangiectasia}} (HHT), {{also known}} as Osler–Weber–Rendu disease and Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome, is a rare <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD), a {{hereditary}} kidney condition, {{is known to be}} associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases, but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture. As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|The {{peppered}} moth Biston betularia {{is also a}} model of parallel evolution {{in the incidence of}} melanism in the British form (f. carbonaria) and the American form (f. swettaria) as they are indistinguishable in appearance. Genetic analysis indicates that both phenotypes are inherited as <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominants.</b> Cross hybridizations indicate the phenotypes are produced by isoalleles at a single locus.|$|R

5|$|Mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene {{were linked}} to <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> (i.e. {{requiring}} only one abnormal copy) FH in a 2003 report. The gene {{is located on the}} first chromosome (1p34.1-p32) and encodes a 666 amino acid protein that is expressed in the liver. It has been suggested that PCSK9 causes FH mainly by reducing the number of LDL receptors on liver cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives with the disease may have a new mutation. It seems that carrying two abnormal copies of the gene is not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
50|$|Cardiomyopathies are {{generally}} inherited as <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominants,</b> although recessive forms have been described, and dilated cardiomyopathy {{can also be}} inherited in an X-linked pattern. Consequently, in addition to tragedy involving an athlete who succumbs, there are medical implications for close relatives. Among family members of index cases, more than 300 causative mutations have been identified. However, not all mutations have the same potential for severe outcomes, {{and there is not}} yet a clear understanding of how these mutations (which affect the same myosin protein molecule) can lead to the dramatically different clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).|$|R
50|$|There is {{also another}} {{mutation}} (W) which is <b>autosomal</b> incomplete <b>dominant.</b> Homozygotes for this plumage color mutant have white plumage, whereas heterozygotes for the gene show a diluted plumage color. But quails homozygous for this gene have low viability.|$|R
50|$|A {{congenital}} form is also known. This may be inherited {{either in}} an <b>autosomal</b> recessive or <b>dominant</b> fashion. In these cases the thumbs {{are almost always}} affected: the other fingers may be affected.|$|R
5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> inheritance, meaning that an {{affected}} individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic {{digestive}} tract bleeding, and various problems due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Other {{causes that}} can {{secondarily}} produce parkinsonism are stroke and drugs. Parkinson plus syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy must be ruled out. Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes. Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself. Genetic forms with an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> or recessive pattern of inheritance are {{sometimes referred to}} as familial Parkinson's disease or familial parkinsonism.|$|E
40|$|Congenital fiber-type disproportion {{myopathy}} causes impaired muscle maturation or development. It {{is characterized}} by moderate to severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness at birth or {{during the first year}} of life, especially in the lower extremities.

40|$|Von Willebrand's {{disease is}} the most common {{inherited}} bleeding disorder of dogs occurring with particularly high frequency in Doberman pinscher dogs. Because of its method of transmission (<b>autosomal</b> incomplete <b>dominant),</b> the clinical and laboratory severity of the disease varies considerably. “Stress” may be required to make the increased bleeding tendency clinically apparent. This report describes five cases of Von Willebrand's disease in Doberman pinscher dogs and illustrates the variety of clinical expressions that the disease may take...|$|R
5|$|The {{disorder}} {{has been}} reported in more than 100 families worldwide, though some sources cite up to 400 families, and it is inherited in an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> pattern. It is considered to be under-diagnosed because of the variability in its expression. The pattern of mutations and spectrum of symptoms are heterogeneous between individuals. Less severe skin phenotypes are seen in women and people of both sexes who have a late onset of skin symptoms.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been reports in other genetic conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta type 1, <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> polycystic kidney disease and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, α1 antitrypsin {{deficiency}} and hereditary hemochromatosis, but evidence for these associations is weaker. Genetic studies in other connective tissue-related genes have mostly yielded negative results. Other abnormalities to the blood vessels, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, {{have been reported in}} a proportion of cases. Atherosclerosis does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} {{mutations}} in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein, which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} studied 8 {{patients}} with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FHO) an <b>autosomal</b> genetic <b>dominant</b> disease due to mutation {{of the gene}} encoding a cell surface receptor for LDL. Anatomic and pathologic abnormalities caused by LDL-cholesterol and B-Apolipoprotein high plasma levels were found. We also measured malondialdehyde levels in plasma and atherosclerotic plaques of the only autoptic case observed. MDA-levels are an index of lipid peroxidation.

5|$|Counseling and {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of genetic testing for HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> cerebellar ataxias. Presymptomatic testing for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with genetic variants such as polycystic kidney disease, familial Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with the syndrome {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta - Caused by a {{mutation}} in type 1 collagen, <b>dominant</b> <b>autosomal</b> disorder, results in weak bones and irregular connective tissue, some cases can be mild while {{others can be}} lethal.

40|$|A 7 -year-old {{male with}} the Aarskog Syndrome is described. This {{observation}} is the seventh {{of the italian}} literature. The child had the typical findings of the syndrome: short stature, abnormal facies, short fingers with interdigital webbing, unusual scrotal folds encircling the penis ventrally, cryptorchidism and mild mental retardation. Endocrinological study showed only a reduction of Testosterone secretion attributable to malposition of the testis.

40|$|Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) is a {{group of}} {{conditions}} where there is an abnormal formation of enamel in terms of quantity, structure and composition. AI is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, there are sex linked and <b>autosomal</b> versions, <b>dominant</b> and/ or recessive, with phenotypes of hypoplastic, hypocalcified or hypomature enamel. Only recently, through clinical, genetic and molecular studies of affected families, phenotypic-genotypic correlations are being established in this group of anomalies. Aim: To carry out a genetic, clinical and molecular analysis of a Chilean family affected with an enamel malformation, which probably would correspond to Amelogenesis Imperfecta <b>Dominant</b> <b>Autosomal</b> (AIDA), of hypoplastic type, resulting from g. 6395 G>A mutation in the enamelin gene. Patients and Methods: A genealogical pattern was created for five generations. Five members of this family group were clinically examined, and four of them had a molecular analysis that consisted of the detection of a mutation in the enamelin gene using PCR. Results: In this family, the enamel malformation presents a <b>dominant</b> <b>autosomal</b> pattern of inheritance. The clinical examination of the group allowed a diagnosis of Amelogenesis Imperfecta, of the hypoplastic local type. However, the molecular analysis revealed that the members analyzed did not exhibit the g. 6395 G>A mutation reported for the enamelin gene (ENAM). Conclusions: The enamel phenotype in this family could be explained by the presence of one of four other mutations recently described in this or another gene, thereby supporting the findings of allelic heterogeneity reported in the literature.

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD), also Hornstein–Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, Hornstein–Knickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons {{is a human}} <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> {{genetic disorder}} that can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas {{are the most common}} manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.|$|E
5|$|Germline {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause Microcephaly {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> gene, which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E
2500|$|The bay {{family of}} coat colors is {{dependent}} on two <b>autosomal</b> simple <b>dominant</b> genes: Extension and Agouti. The role of the Extension gene is to produce a protein called Melanocortin 1 receptor or Mc1r. Mc1r allows the black pigment eumelanin to form in hair. Closely tied to this process, {{the role of the}} Agouti gene is to produce Agouti signalling peptide Asip, which disables Mc1r, effectively allowing the red pigment phaeomelanin to [...] "show through." [...] However, this disabling does not occur throughout the coat; it occurs only in pulses on the body coat and not at all on the extremities or points.|$|R
