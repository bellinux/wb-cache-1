The chocolate bar was advertised positively: chilled, favored by consumers on a taste test, and offered at a discount. In the experimental condition, the chocolate bar was described as discounted since it was broken. The chocolate bar was packed in a <b>transparent</b> <b>wrapper,</b> so the broken piece of chocolate could clearly {{be seen by the}} students. Students in the low-effort experimental group were twice as likely to purchase the chocolate bar after being presented negative information, while in the high-effort group, students were half as likely to purchase the chocolate bar.|$|R

In this paper we exploit an overlooked feature of the ESP 8266 WiFi chip, i. e. the AT commands interpreter, to implement a sensor/actuator that meets the above specifications. To test our design, we implement a library that provides a <b>transparent</b> <b>wrapper</b> for AT commands.

40|$|Prior {{work has}} shown that {{collapsible}} pipelining techniques {{have the potential to}} significantly reduce clocking activity, which can consume up to 70 % of the dynamic power in modern high performance microprocessors. Previous collapsible pipeline proposals either rely on single phase clocking (by forcing latches into transparent state) or do not discuss the mechanisms by which stages are merged. In this work two flip-flop designs featuring an <b>additional</b> <b>transparent</b> state suitable for collapsing stages are presented. Transparency is achieved either by decoupling the master and slave clocks to keep both latches transparent, or by using a bypass mux that routes around the flip-flop. Both of these designs are evaluated in the context of transparently gated pipelines, an ad-hoc collapsible pipelining technique. Detailed analysis shows that the decoupled clock flipflop is the most attractive in terms of energy and delay. 1...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{component}} for {{optical signal}} processing and optical communication was investigated. This component consists {{in its most}} basic configuration of a thin dielectric or semiconductor waveguide layer and an <b>additional</b> <b>transparent</b> layer in which a grating is etched. At a specific wavelength and angular orientation of an incident light beam, the structure 'resonates'. No light is transmitted, all light is reflected. These structures were realized using silica and silicon nitride materials (#lambda#= 565 nm) or semiconductor materials (InP/InGaAsP, #lambda#= 1. 55 #mu#m). The results are as follows: Spectral resonance bandwidth between 0. 03 nm and several nm, finess between 300 and 15. 000, contrast ratio up to 100 for transmission and reflection, and modulation of the resonance at frequencies up to 10 MHz. Possible applications are: Dynamic spectral filters, active mirrors for laser resonators, and fast spatial light modulators. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology for deploying flexible dynamic configuration into embedded systems whilst preserving the reliability advantages of static systems. The methodology {{is based on}} the concept of decision points (DP) which are strategically placed to achieve fine-grained distribution of self-management logic to meet application-specific requirements. DP logic can be changed easily, and independently of the host component, enabling self-management behavior to be deferred beyond the point of system deployment. A <b>transparent</b> Dynamic <b>Wrapper</b> mechanism (DW) automatically detects and handles problems arising from the evaluation of self-management logic within each DP and ensures that the dynamic aspects of the system collapse down to statically defined default behavior to ensure safety and correctness despite failures.

40|$|The best {{currently}} available transparent insulation materials (TIM) are characterised by a diffuse radiation transmission value of around 75 % and a thermal conductivity value below 1 W/(qmK). As an <b>additional</b> <b>transparent</b> cover (glass, special plaster) {{is needed for}} potection against the weather in outdoor applications, the radiation transmission decreases. However, the U-value is simultaneously improved by resulting airgaps and devices for temporary thermal insulation (mechanical blinds, etc.). In a series of demonstration projects, the first TIM facade systems were tested in operation and their functionality was confirmed. The shading devices guaranteed thermal comfort in summer but improvements are necessary for higher reliability for particular application conditions. By using TIM, together with conventional measures, in the renovation of an existing building in Freiburg, a specific heating energy consumption of 43 kWh/(qma) was achieved, a reduction of about 80 % relative to the o riginal consumption of the building. The "self- sufficient solar house" in Freiburg, which is being built at present, will demonstrate that with TIM and the latest technology for energy saving and solar energy use, a residential building can meet all its energy needs by the solar radiation incident on its outer surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, image manipulation, {{which is}} related to matting and {{compositing}} process, is commonly used. Processed object may vary, however matters may arise when the object is transparent. Not many {{research has been conducted}} about the issue due to the difficulties in extracting transparency value and object refraction. In this research an application to execute matting process of a transparent object and compositing it into a new image is developed. Matting process will be executed using Grabcut method, followed by calcu-lation of transparency value of an object using alpha matting. The transparency value is then used in compositing an object with a new background, while re-fraction will be executed using refraction calculation of ray tracing. Adding a transparent object into new image (new background) process, first user should determine the eye’s position and distant between new image and transparent ob-ject. Then, assume the <b>additional</b> <b>transparent</b> object as a screen to trace rays from eye. Each ray will be bent and hit the new image. The color of new image will add into the transparent object area. Experiments result showed that extracted transparency value was affected by lighting, refraction of the old background, which unknown and object's refraction index. Refraction result looks natural compared with the actual condition. Moreover, eye position can be configured by the user to obtain results as desired. ...|$|R

40|$|Achieving {{correlated}} equilibrium is {{an important}} and extensively investigated problem {{at the intersection of}} many fields: in particular, game theory, cryptography and efficient algorithms.

Traditionally, secure computation replaces a trusted party by multiple players computing on their separate shares of the data. In contrast, we directly replace a trusted party by a transparent device 1 that correctly and privately evaluates any function by performing only public operations on unseen data.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the quest}} to {{understand}} damage and failure of ceramics in ballistic events, simplified experiments {{have been developed to}} benchmark behavior. One such experiment is known as edge on impact (EOI). In this experiment, an impactor strikes the edge of a thin square plate, and damage and cracking that occur on the free surface are captured in real time with high speed photography. If the material of interest is <b>transparent,</b> <b>additional</b> information regarding damage and wave mechanics within the sample can be discerned. Polarizers can be used to monitor stress wave propagation, and photography can record internal damage. This information serves as an excellent benchmark for validation of ceramic and glass constitutive models implemented in dynamic simulation codes. In this paper, recent progress towards predictive modeling of EOI is discussed. Time-dependent crack propagation and damage front evolution in silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum oxynitride (AlON) ceramics are predicted using the Kayenta macroscopic constitutive model. Aspects regarding modeling material failure, variability, and volume scaling are noted.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the usage of}} a partiton based Fubini calculus for Poisson processes. The approach is an amplification of Bayesian techniques developed in Lo and Weng for gamma/Dirichlet processes. Applications to models are considered which all fall within an inhomogeneous spatial extension of the size biased framework used in Perman, Pitman and Yor. Among some of the results; an explicit partition based calculus is then developed for such models, which also includes a series of important exponential change of measure formula. These results are then applied to solve the mostly unknown calculus for spatial Lévy-Cox moving average models. The analysis then proceeds to exploit a structural feature of a scaling operation which arises in Brownian excursion theory. From this a series of new mixture representations and posterior characterizations for large classes of random measures, including probability measures, are given. These results are applied to yield new results/identities related to the large class of two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet models. The results also yields easily perhaps the most general and certainly quite informative characterizations of extensions of the Markov-Krein correspondence exhibited by the linear functionals of Dirichlet processes. This article then defines {{a natural extension of}} Doksum’s Neutral to the Right priors (NTR) to a spatial setting. NTR models are practically synonymous with exponential functions of subordinators and arise in Bayesian non-parametric survival models. It is shown that manipulation of the exponential formulae makes what has been otherwise formidable analysis <b>transparent.</b> <b>Additional</b> interesting results related to the Dirichlet process and other measures are developed.

40|$|Graphene, a {{monolayer}} of sp 2 -bonded carbon atoms or one monolayer of graphite, has {{a special}} atomically thick two dimensional structure and possesses unique mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. These properties make graphene a good candidate material for transparent conductors. Monolayer graphene oxide (GO) sheets with sizes ranging from a few to ~ 200 μm are synthesized based on a chemical method. In order to obtain ultra-large graphene oxide (UL-GO), three main modifications were made in our experiments: i) using the natural graphite with a large lateral size (up to ~ 800 μm) as starting material; ii) using intercalation and thermal shock to perform exfoliation, avoiding the destructive process of ultrasonication; iii) using a three-step centrifugation to sort the GO by sheet size. New thermal and chemical schemes, which include (i) a modified thermal treatment, (ii) acid treatment in a HNO 3 bath and (iii) doping by immersing in a SOBr 2 solution, are developed to treat graphene films to improve the electrical conductivity and transparency. It is shown that a longer thermal treatment at 1100 ⁰C as well as additional acid and doping treatments reduce the sheet resistance by about 20 – 50 % with improved transmittance. The final product has a sheet resistance of 1600 Ω/sq and a transparency of 82 %, which is quite sufficient to replace the transparent conducting films made from indium tin oxide for many existing applications in photovoltaic cells and optoelectronics. The transmittance and sheet resistance measured after 3 months of exposure to air confirms {{the stability of the}} improved characteristics after the <b>additional</b> treatments. <b>Transparent</b> conductive films are produced using the ultra-large graphene oxide (UL-GO) sheets that are deposited layer-by-layer on a substrate using the Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) assembly technique. The density and degree of wrinkling of the UL-GO monolayers are turned from dilute, close-packed flat UL-GO to graphene oxide wrinkles (GOWs) and concentrated graphene oxide wrinkles (CGOWs) by varying the LB processing conditions. The method demonstrated here opens up a new avenue for high-yield fabrication of GOWs or CGOWs that are considered promising materials for hydrogen storage, supercapacitors, and nanomechanical devices. The films produced from UL-GO sheets with a close-packed flat structure exhibit exceptionally high electrical conductivity and transparency after thermal reduction and chemical doping treatments. A remarkable sheet resistance of ~ 500 Ω/sq at 90 % transparency is obtained, which outperforms the graphene films grown on a Ni substrate by chemical vapor deposition. The technique used in this work to produce transparent conductive UL-GO thin films is facile, inexpensive, and tunable for mass production. Regarding the theoretical part, the effects of the degree of functionalization, molecular structure and molecular weight of functional groups on the Young’s modulus of graphene sheets were investigated through molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics simulations. The dependence of shear modulus, strength and critical wrinkling strain of graphene sheets on the chemical functionalization was also examined. It is found that Young’s modulus depends greatly on the degree of functionalization and molecular structure of the functional groups, while the molecular weight of the functional groups plays a minor role in determining Young’s modulus. The chemical functionalization also reduces the shear modulus and critical wrinkling strain. The binding energy between the functional groups and the graphene sheets is mainly responsible for these findings...|$|R

They described swelling {{and the size}} reduction of wood particles during the dissolution basing on the colour intensity and viscosity of the solution mixture. Meanwhile, Kilpelainen et al. reported a complete dissolution of 8  wt% of dried wood sawdust samples (Norway spruce and Southern pine) in both [bmim][Cl] and [amim][Cl] ILs, in the temperature range from 80 to 130 °C after 8  hours [24]. The complete dissolution of wood in these ILs was attributed to the water content and the particle size of wood samples. Water was found to significantly reduce the solubility of wood in ILs [19] and smaller particles were reported as better to be dissolved in water [24]. Furthermore, Sun et al. demonstrated that both softwood (southern yellow pine) and hardwood (red oak) can be dissolved in [emim][CH 3 COO] [25]. More than 90 % (w/w) of the added wood was dissolved after mild grinding, at 110 °C within 16  hours. The authors concluded that [emim][CH 3 COO] is more efficient in dissolving biomass than [bmim][Cl] and [amim][Cl]. A high-throughput screening in the dissolution of cellulose and wood chips in ILs with 5 % (w/w) at 90 °C for 12  hours was made by Spiess et al. [26]. The investigation was performed at identical conditions in a single experiment to allow a comparison {{of a variety of}} ILs. They found out that [emim][Cl], [bmim][Cl] and [emim][Et 2 PO 4] were only able to partially dissolve different wood chips (spruce, silver fir, common beech and chestnut). Additionally, [emim][CH 3 COO] was defined as the most efficient for dissolving cellulose, and [amim][Cl] was found to be the most suitable for use in biomass, dissolving all tested wood. Only Silver fir was not completely dissolved in [emim][CH 3 COO] [26]. By heating wheat straw and pine wood at 100 °C after 24  hours, [emim][CH 3 COO] demonstrated to be a poor solvent [27]. At the same conditions, [bmim][Cl] was the most efficient in the dissolution of straw and [emim][Cl] tended to be the most promising solvent for both types of biomass. For the best results, the <b>additional</b> investigation with <b>transparent</b> solutions did not exclude presence of biomass fibres after filtration indicating an incomplete dissolution [27]. In fact, Lee et al. stated a very low solubility of wood flour (<[*] 5  g/kg) and a high solubility of microcrystalline cellulose (> 100 [*]g/kg) in [emim][CH 3 COO], proving that the presence of lignin restricts the solubility of wood flour in this IL [28]. In the dissolution of beech and spruce wood at 115 °C, [emim][CH 3 COO] showed to be more suitable for the first one, but complete dissolution was observed for none of the examined biomasses even during a 72 -hour process [29]. An incomplete dissolution of pine wood in this IL at 120 °C and 155 °C within 3  hours was also reported [30]. These findings were the opposite of those presented earlier by Singh et al [31]. Basing on the microscopic observations, Torr et al. clearly demonstrated that [emim][CH 3 COO] is capable to completely dissolve all major components found in the plant cells of switchgrass after 3  hours at 120 °C [31]. On the other hand, [bmim][CH 3 COO] was tested to dissolve poplar wood and a dissolution yield of 96  wt% was obtained at 130 °C after 12  hours, while [bmim][Cl] only achieved 23  wt% of poplar dissolution [32]. This indicates that [CH 3 COO] anion has a great influence on the dissolution of biomass. In the dissolution of sugarcane bagasse at 100 °C within 0.5 - 8  hours, once again [emim][CH 3 COO] demonstrated to be more effective than other ILs such as [bmim][Cl] and [emim][DEP] [33].|$|R
