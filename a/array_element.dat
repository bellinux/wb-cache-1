40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an annular-array ultrasonic endoscope probe, a preparation method thereof and a fixing rotating device. The probe comprises a metal cylinder {{located in the}} center and a plurality of piezoelectric <b>array</b> <b>elements</b> arranged around the metal cylinder and formed by cutting piezoelectric ceramic circular rings or monocrystalline circular rings. A backing material layer is equipped between the piezoelectric <b>array</b> <b>elements</b> and the metal cylinder. A matching material layer is covering on the outer sides of the piezoelectric <b>array</b> <b>elements.</b> Decoupling materials are filled among the piezoelectric <b>array</b> <b>elements.</b> The probe further comprises a plurality of coaxial cables correspondingly connected with the piezoelectric array elements; and annular grids sleeved on the metal cylinder, each having a gear-shaped structure and applied for arranging and separating the coaxial cables. By directly cutting piezoelectric ceramic circular rings or piezoelectric monocrystalline circular rings to make the piezoelectric <b>array</b> <b>elements,</b> the probe provided in the invention prevents the problems generated when a multi-layer material with a certain thickness is forcibly reeled into a cylindrical shape in a conventional method and characterized in that the <b>array</b> <b>elements</b> are not coaxially arranged; the <b>array</b> <b>elements</b> on the interface positions are not aligned; a conventional probe is easy to be damaged, disengaged and broken, etc. 本发明涉及一种环状阵列超声波内窥镜探头及其制备方法和固定旋转装置，所述探头包括：位于中心的金属圆柱；围绕金属圆柱排列的由压电陶瓷圆环或压电单晶圆环切割而成的多个压电阵元，且压电阵元与金属圆柱之间设有背衬材料层，压电阵元外覆盖有匹配材料层，压电阵元之间填充有去耦材料；分别与所述多个压电阵元对应连接的多根同轴电缆线；以及套设在所述金属圆柱上具有齿轮状结构用于排列和分隔所述同轴电缆线的环状格子。本发明通过直接从压电陶瓷圆环或压电单晶圆环上切割出多个压电阵元，避免了现有方法中将一定厚度的多层材料强行卷曲成圆管状的过程中所造成的各个阵元不同心排布、接口位置阵元不对齐、探头易破损、易脱离、易断裂等问题。Department of Applied PhysicsInventor name used in this publication: 戴吉岩Inventor name used in this publication: 张国峰Inventor name used in this publication: 周丹Inventor name used in this publication: 焦逸静Inventor name used in this publication: 林国豪Inventor name used in this publication: 陈燕Inventor name used in this publication: 陈王丽华Title in Traditional Chinese: 環狀陣列超聲波內窺鏡探頭及其製備方法和固定旋轉裝置Chin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Ultrasound imaging is an efficient, noninvasive, {{method for}} medical diagnosis. A {{commonly}} used approach to image acquisition in ultrasound system is digital beamforming. Digital beamforming, {{as applied to}} the medical ultrasound, is defined as phase alignment and summation of signals that are generated from a common source, by received at different times by a multi-elements ultrasound transducer. In this paper first: we tested all signal processing methodologies for digital beamforming which included: the effect of over sampling techniques, single trans mit focusing and their limitations, the apodization technique and its effect to reduce the sidelobes, the analytical envelope detection using digital finite impulse response (FIR) filter approximations for the Hilbert transformat ion and how to compress the dynamic range to achieve the desired dynamic range for display (8 bits). Here the image was reconstructed using physical <b>array</b> <b>elements</b> and virtual <b>array</b> <b>elements</b> for linear and phase array probe. The results shown that virtual <b>array</b> <b>elements</b> were given well results in linear array image reconstruction than physical <b>array</b> <b>elements,</b> because it provides additional number of lines. However, physical <b>array</b> <b>elements</b> shown a good results in linear phase array reconstruction (steering) than virtual <b>array</b> <b>elements,</b> because the active elements number (Aperture) is less than in physical <b>array</b> <b>elements.</b> We checked {{the quality of the}} image using quantitative entropy. Second: a modular FPGA-based 16 channel digital u ltrasound beamforming with embedded DSP for ultrasound imaging is presented. The system is implemented in Virtex- 5 FPGA (Xilinx, Inc.). The system consists of: two 8 channels block, the DSP which composed of the FIR Hilbert filter b lock t...|$|R

5000|$|Binary MSD radix sort, {{also called}} binary quicksort, can be {{implemented}} in-place by splitting the input array into two bins - the 0s bin and the 1s bin. The 0s bin is grown {{from the beginning of}} the array, whereas the 1s bin is grown from the end of the array. The 0s bin boundary is placed before the first <b>array</b> <b>element.</b> The 1s bin boundary is placed after the last <b>array</b> <b>element.</b> The most significant bit of the first <b>array</b> <b>element</b> is examined. If this bit is a 1, then the first element is swapped with the element in front of the 1s bin boundary (the last element of the array), and the 1s bin is grown by one element by decrementing the 1s boundary array index. If this bit is a 0, then the first element remains at its current location, and the 0s bin is grown by one element. The next <b>array</b> <b>element</b> examined is the one in front of the 0s bin boundary (i.e. the first element that is not in the 0s bin or the 1s bin). This process continues until the 0s bin and the 1s bin reach each other. The 0s bin and the 1s bin are then sorted recursively based on the next bit of each <b>array</b> <b>element.</b> Recursive processing continues until the least significant bit has been used for sorting. [...] Handling signed integers requires treating the most significant bit with the opposite sense, followed by unsigned treatment of the rest of the bits.|$|E
