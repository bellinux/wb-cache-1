40|$|Six {{samples of}} <b>aircraft</b> {{interior}} <b>fabrics</b> were evaluated {{with regard to}} resistance to ignition by radiant heat. Five samples were <b>aircraft</b> seat upholstery <b>fabrics</b> and one sample was an <b>aircraft</b> curtain <b>fabric.</b> The <b>aircraft</b> seat <b>fabrics</b> were 100 % wool (2 samples), 83 % wool/ 17 % nylon, 49 % wool/ 51 % polyvinyl chloride, and 100 % rayon. The <b>aircraft</b> curtain <b>fabric</b> was 92 % modacrylic/ 8 % polyester. The five samples of <b>aircraft</b> seat upholstery <b>fabrics</b> were also evaluated with regard to resistance to ignition by a smoldering cigarette. The four samples of wool-containing <b>aircraft</b> seat <b>fabrics</b> appeared to be superior to the sample of rayon seat fabric in resistance to ignition, both by radiant heat and by a smoldering cigarette...|$|R
