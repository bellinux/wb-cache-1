50|$|Transamination catalyzed by aminotransferase {{occurs in}} two stages. In the first step, the α amino group of an {{aminoacid}} {{is transferred to}} the enzyme, producing the corresponding α-keto acid and the aminated enzyme. During the second stage, the amino group is transferred to the keto <b>acid</b> <b>acceptor,</b> forming the amino acid product while regenerating the enzyme. The chirality of an amino acid is determined during transamination. For the reaction to complete, aminotransferases require participation of aldehyde containing coenzyme, pyridoxyl-5'-phosphate (PLP), a derivative of Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6). The amino group is accommodated by conversion of this coenzyme to pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP). PLP is covalently attached to the enzyme via a Schiff Base linkage formed by the condensation of its aldehyde group with the ε-amino group of an enzymatic Lys residue. The Schiff base, which is conjugated to the enzymes pyridinium ring {{is the focus of}} the coenzyme activity.|$|E

Its charging ability is lost after mutating this nucleotide. This ability is stimulated somewhat {{by the addition of}} a second hairpin helix that mimicks the anticodon arm, which suggests that information originating from the anticodon stem-loop can be transmitted to the active site of the enzyme by the core of the protein...|$|E

Meldrum’s <b>acid</b> <b>acceptors</b> can be easily accessed and numerous derivatives have been prepared to investigate the scope of the enantioselective 1, 4 -addition. The reaction is tolerant to a wide range of heteroaromatic and functional groups. The significance of substituting the position para, meta, and ortho to the electrophilic centre is also highlighted. Primary and secondary organozinc reagents are shown to be compatible in this reaction. A highly enantioselective synthesis of carboxylic acid derivatives having an -quaternary centre through copper-catalyzed 1, 4 -addition of dialkylzinc reagents to aryl acetate derivatives is also described. This method employs a commercially available phosphoramidite ligand and readily accessible Meldrum’s <b>acid</b> <b>acceptors.</b> A brief insight into the observed selectivity is also discussed. The significance of this method was established by the expedient preparation of chiral diesters, succinimides, γ-butyrolactones, and isocyanates from highly functionalized benzyl Meldrum’s acids. In addition to 1, 4 -addition, the enantioselective asymmetric synthesis of benzylic tertiary and quaternary stereogenic centres via 1, 6 -addition of dialkylzinc reagents to Meldrum’s <b>acid</b> <b>acceptors</b> is outlined. This work represents one of the early examples of 1, 6 -asymmetric conjugate addition reactions and discussions on the regioselectivity of the process are disclosed. On a different subject matter, the occurrence and persistence of C–H•••X (O, S, Br, Cl, and F) bond in solution using 1 H NMR spectroscopy is discussed for a large number of benzyl Meldrum’s acids. The latter are novel and reliable probes for the evaluation of this type of non-classical interactions in solution. The persistence of the C–H•••X bond in solution is demonstrated to be dependent upon structural features present on the aromatic moiety and the benzylic position of the benzyl Meldrum’s acid derivatives.

Membrane fragments solubilized with Thesit (dodecyl alcohol polyoxyethylene ether) can utilize UDP-glucose and UDP-ManNAcA to effect elongation of teichuronic acid isolated from native cell walls. When UDP-glucose {{is the only}} substrate supplied, the detergent-solubilized glucosyltransferase incorporates a single glucosyl residue onto each teichuronic <b>acid</b> <b>acceptor.</b> When both UDP-glucose and UDP-ManNAcA are supplied, the glucosyltransferase and the N-acetylmannosaminuronosyltransferase act cooperatively to elongate the teichuronic <b>acid</b> <b>acceptor</b> by multiple additions of the disaccharide repeat unit.

40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi, the {{parasite}} that causes Chagas' disease, proliferates in the cytosol of mammalian cells. When the trypomastigote forms exit the infected cell, they become extensively sialylated because {{the parasite}} contains an enzyme called trans-sialidase. This enzyme efficiently catalyzes {{the transfer of}} bound sialic acid residues from host glycoconjugates to acceptors containing terminal beta-galactosyl residues on the parasite surface. The sialic <b>acid</b> <b>acceptors</b> are developmentally regulated mucin-like glycoproteins that are extremely abundant on the trypomastigote surface. In the present study, we determined whether passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies specific for sialic <b>acid</b> <b>acceptors</b> could reduce the acute infection induced by T. cruzi in a highly susceptible mouse strain. We found that passive transfer to naive mice of an immunoglobulin G 1 monoclonal antibody directed to a sialylated epitope of these mucin-like glycoproteins significantly decreased parasitemia {{and the number of}} tissue parasites as measured by a DNA probe specific for T. cruzi. Upon challenge with trypomastigotes, mice which received this antibody also had a significant increase in survival. A statistically significant reduction in parasitemia could be accomplished with relatively small doses of immunoglobulin, and Fab fragments alone could not mediate protective immunity. The precise mechanism of parasite elimination is unknown; however, this monoclonal antibody does not lyse trypomastigotes in vitro in the presence of human complement or mouse spleen cells...|$|R

Membrane-associated teichuronic acid was extracted from the wall-membrane fraction of reaction mixtures by sodium dodecyl sulfate. The synthesis of membrane-associated teichuronic acid required UDP-glucose, UDP-ManNAcUA, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and was inhibited by tunicamycin. Glucose incorporated into wall-bound teichuronic acid remained in wall fragments after extraction with sodium dodecyl sulfate, and its incorporation required UDP-glucose and UDP-ManNAcUA (but not UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) and was insensitive to tunicamycin. Radioactive material incorporated into wall-bound teichuronic acid could be released by treatment with mild acid or by digestion with lysozyme, indicating that the wall-bound teichuronic acid was covalently linked to peptidoglycan. There were about 600 pmol of wall-bound teichuronic <b>acid</b> <b>acceptor</b> sites for glucose per mg of protein as measured in incorporation reaction mixtures lacking UDP-ManNAcUA.

40|$|Escherichia coli RNase D and RNase II {{have been}} {{purified}} to homogeneity and compared {{for their ability}} to remove extra nucleotides following the -C-C-A sequence in tRNA precursors. RNase D and RNase II are single-chain proteins with molecular weights of 38, 000 and 78, 000, respectively. Both enzymes require a divalent cation for activity on tRNA precursors, but, in addition, RNase II is stimulated by monovalent cations. RNase D specifically removes mononucleotide residues from a mixture of tRNA precursors to generate amino <b>acid</b> <b>acceptor</b> activity for essentially all amino acids. Although RNase II can also remove precursor-specific residues, no amino <b>acid</b> <b>acceptor</b> activity is recovered. Similarly, RNase D action on the E. coli tRNATyr precursor is limited, whereas RNase II causes extensive degradation. In contrast to the processive mode of hydrolysis by RNase II, RNase D removes nucleotides randomly and slows down greatly at the -C-C-A sequence, thereby allowing the tRNA to be aminoacylated and protected from further degradation. These results suggest that RNase D is the 3 '-processing nuclease in vivo and that RNase II is a nonspecific degradative enzyme.
