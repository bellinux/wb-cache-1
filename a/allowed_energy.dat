25|$|Since {{the source}} of an EPR {{spectrum}} {{is a change in}} an electron's spin state, it might be thought that all EPR spectra for a single electron spin would consist of one line. However, the interaction of an unpaired electron, by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins, results in additional <b>allowed</b> <b>energy</b> states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei.

50|$|Cooper {{originally}} considered {{only the}} case of an isolated pair's formation in a metal. When one considers the more realistic state of many electronic pair formations, as is elucidated in the full BCS theory, one finds that the pairing opens a gap in the continuous spectrum of <b>allowed</b> <b>energy</b> states of the electrons, meaning that all excitations of the system must possess some minimum amount of energy.

50|$|For example, the light, or {{electromagnetic}} radiation emitted or absorbed by an atom has only certain frequencies (or wavelengths), {{as can be}} seen from the line spectrum associated with the chemical element represented by that atom. The quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond to definite energies of the light quanta, or photons, and result from the fact that the electrons of the atom can have only certain <b>allowed</b> <b>energy</b> values, or levels; when an electron changes from one allowed level to another, a quantum of energy is emitted or absorbed whose frequency is directly proportional to the energy difference between the two levels.

50|$|Doping a {{semiconductor}} {{in a good}} crystal introduces <b>allowed</b> <b>energy</b> states {{within the}} band gap, but {{very close to the}} energy band that corresponds to the dopant type. In other words, electron donor impurities create states near the conduction band while electron acceptor impurities create states near the valence band. The gap between these energy states and the nearest energy band is usually referred to as dopant-site bonding energy or EB and is relatively small. For example, the EB for boron in silicon bulk is 0.045 eV, compared with silicon's band gap of about 1.12 eV. Because EB is so small, room temperature is hot enough to thermally ionize practically all of the dopant atoms and create free charge carriers in the conduction or valence bands.|$|E
