5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Courts of <b>Appeals,</b> <b>in</b> Immediato v. Rye Neck School District, Herndon v. Chapel Hill, and Steirer v. Bethlehem School District, {{have ruled}} {{that the use of}} {{community}} service as a high school graduation requirement did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the bed to the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E
50|$|Judicial appeals {{were heard}} by Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary and Lords of Appeal {{under the age}} of seventy-five. Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were {{entitled}} to emoluments. Thus, Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary ceased to be paid at the time they ceased to hold office and became Lords of Appeal. The Senior Lord of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary received £185,705 as of 2009 (the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales was the only judicial figure who received a higher salary). The other Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary received £179,431.|$|R

5|$|Over her {{ten years}} on the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 {{opinions}} where {{she was in the}} majority. The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming two—not high numbers for an appellate judge of that many years and a typical percentage of reversals.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie Lee Gardner (January 16, 1961 – June 18, 2010) was an American {{criminal}} {{who received}} {{the death penalty for}} murder in 1985, and was executed by a firing squad by the state of Utah in 2010. Gardner's case spent nearly 25years in the court system, prompting the Utah House of Representatives to introduce legislation {{to limit the number of}} <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> capital cases.|$|E
5|$|Section 25 {{was not a}} more {{significant}} source of criminal <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> large part becauseas Barron v. Baltimore (1833) heldthe Bill of Rights (including its criminal procedure provisions) was viewed as inapplicable to the state governments. This continued until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after {{the adoption of the}} Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
50|$|Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary {{held the}} rank of Baron and seats in the House for life. Under the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 they ceased to be Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary {{at the age of}} seventy, but could be {{permitted}} by ministerial discretion to hold office as late as age seventy-five. The original Act provided for the appointment of only two Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary, but as of 2009 twelve could be appointed; this number could have been further raised by a Statutory Instrument approved by both Houses of Parliament. Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were, by custom, appointed to the Privy Council if not already members. They served on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which is the highest court of <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> certain cases. Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were often called upon to chair important public inquiries, such as the Hutton inquiry.|$|R
50|$|The Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary {{were joined}} by the Lords of Appeal, who include members of the House of Lords, not {{necessarily}} created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, who held or had held high judicial office. Lords of Appeal retained their titles for life but were incapable of hearing cases {{after the age of}} 75. Only Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary received salaries: in 2004, the salary for the Senior Lord of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary was £185,705, and for other Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary it was £179,431.|$|R
50|$|The {{two most}} senior Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were {{designated}} the Senior and Second Senior Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary respectively. The Senior Lord of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary historically was the Law Lord who was senior {{by virtue of}} having served in the House for the longest period. With the appointment of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in 2000, however, it became an appointed position.|$|R
5|$|The 1949 trial {{defendants}} {{appealed to}} the Second Circuit Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1950. In the appeal they raised issues {{about the use of}} informant witnesses, the impartiality of the jury and judge, the judge's conduct, and free speech. Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{was born}} in Baltimore, Maryland, to an American-born mother and a Greek {{immigrant}} father. He attended Johns Hopkins University and graduated from the University of Baltimore School of Law, and entered the United States Army in 1941. Agnew served as an officer during World War II, earning the Bronze Star, and was in 1951 recalled for service during the Korean War. He worked as an aide to U.S. Representative James Devereux before he {{was appointed to the}} Baltimore County Board of Zoning <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1957. In 1960, he lost an election for the Baltimore County Circuit Court, but in 1962 was elected Baltimore County Executive. In 1966, Agnew was elected the 55th Governor of Maryland, defeating his Democratic opponent George P. Mahoney and independent candidate Hyman A. Pressman.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Abu-Jamal was punished with solitary {{confinement}} {{for engaging in}} entrepreneurship contrary to prison regulations. Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary , which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. In litigation before the US Court of <b>Appeals,</b> <b>in</b> 1998 he successfully established his right to write for financial gain in prison. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail {{in an attempt to}} establish whether he was writing for financial gain.|$|E
50|$|The {{judicial}} functions {{could also}} be exercised by Lords of Appeal (other members of the House who happened to have held high judicial office). No Lord of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary or Lord of Appeal could sit judicially beyond the age of seventy-five. The judicial business of the Lords was supervised by the Senior Lord of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary and their deputy, the Second Senior Lord of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary.|$|R

5|$|In June 2001, the Brussels Correctional Court {{declared}} itself incompetent to {{hear the}} case, as it related to political misconduct. In February 2003, the Brussels Appellate Court followed and gave a similar judgement. The original plaintiffs then appealed, and the case {{was sent to the}} Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Ghent, which upheld the complaint; the Vlaams Blok non-profit organisations were fined, and it was deemed that the Vlaams Blok was an organisation that sanctioned discrimination. The Vlaams Blok lodged an appeal which was rejected, and in November 2004, the ruling was made definite, when it was upheld by the Court of Cassation. The ruling meant that the party would lose access to state funding and access to television, effectively shutting the party down.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{his promise}} to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone {{appointed}} him to the Board of Permit <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking {{a position in the}} California State Assembly. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run—Art Agnos. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.|$|E
5|$|Owsley's {{political}} career began in 1809 {{when he was}} elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, serving one term. Governor Charles Scott appointed him to the Kentucky Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1810, where he served alongside his teacher, John Boyle. Soon after Owsley's appointment, the legislature reduced the number of justices on the court, and Owsley resigned his seat. He was elected to the state House again in 1811. When a vacancy on the Court of Appeals occurred in 1813, Governor Isaac Shelby re-appointed Owsley to the court.|$|E
50|$|Her {{subsequent}} <b>appeal</b> {{was heard}} <b>in</b> the Court of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> London in February 1941 and on 10 February 1941 the sentence was commuted to fourteen years’ penal servitude.|$|R
5000|$|Many jurisdictions {{recognize}} {{two types}} of <b>appeals,</b> particularly <b>in</b> the criminal context. The first is the traditional [...] "direct" [...] <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review. The second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case.|$|R
50|$|Two of the Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were {{designated}} the Senior and Second Senior Lords of <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary. Formerly, {{the most senior}} of the Law Lords took these posts. Since 1984, however, the Senior and Second Senior Lords were appointed independently.|$|R
5|$|Sotomayor was {{nominated}} to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she {{was nominated}} by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was slowed by the Republican {{majority in the}} United States Senate, but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.|$|E
5|$|Sumner sat on {{the court}} when it heard the <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> the Quock Walker cases in 1783, {{concerning}} a former slave who was seeking confirmation of his freedom. A ruling {{in one of these}} cases confirmed that the state constitution had effectively abolished slavery. In 1785 he was chosen by the legislature to sit on a committee which revised the laws of the state, to modernize them and remove references to British authority. In 1789 {{he was a member of}} the state convention that met to ratify the United States Constitution, in which he explained to the convention the meaning and importance of habeas corpus. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1791.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{was born}} in Cincinnati in 1857. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of War. William Taft {{attended}} Yale {{and was a member}} of Skull and Bones secret society like his father, and after becoming a lawyer was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named Solicitor General and as a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of <b>Appeals.</b> <b>In</b> 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.|$|E

5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered {{the wording of the}} ordinance to be too vague. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the ordinance by voter initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second Circuit Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Manhattan on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the {{herbicides}} contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were {{not intended to be}} used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
