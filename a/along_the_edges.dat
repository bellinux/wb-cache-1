5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The school's {{residential}} {{village is}} composed of five residence halls located <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the lake. There are two men's dormitories (Oak Hill and Red Hill) and three women's dormitories (Mount Vernon, Monticello, and Montpelier). The four smaller dormitories opened in 2001, while the largest residence hall, Red Hill, opened in 2003. In addition to student housing, Red Hill also contains three classrooms and an office suite on its basement level. Located {{in the basement of}} Mount Vernon is an auditorium referred to as Town Hall, where the school's daily chapel sessions and other special events are held. The residence halls are set up in an arc shape around the lake.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia occurs {{along the}} eastern coast of Australia from Wollongong, New South Wales {{in the south to}} Rockhampton, Queensland in the north. There are {{isolated}} populations offshore on Fraser Island, and inland at Blackdown Tableland National Park and Crows Nest in Queensland, and also inland incursions {{at the base of the}} Glasshouse Mountains in southern Queensland, at Grafton in northern New South Wales, and Bilpin and Lawson in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney.B.oblongifolia grows in a range of habitats—in damp areas with poor drainage, <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of swamps and flats, as well as wallum shrubland, or coastal plateaux. It is also found in open forest or woodland, where it grows on ridges or slopes, or heath. Soils are predominantly sandy or sandstone-based, though granite-based and clay-loams are sometimes present.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{the width of}} P-selectin band {{patterns}} on the rolling behavior of HL- 60 myeloid cells <b>along</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> band patterns was studied. The P-selectin and polyethylene glycol (PEG) pattern was produced via microcontact printing using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp. HL- 60 cells were flowed across the pattern using a syringe pump at low and high volume flow rates, and the lengths of <b>the</b> cells' tracks <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and velocities <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> were obtained using a designed Matlab code. It was found that on the 5 [mu]m P-selectin band with patterns, the cells were moving horizontally instead of <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> because <b>the</b> patterns were too thin, while they were rolling <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> for <b>the</b> wider patterns. The 10 [mu]m, 15 [mu]m, and 20 [mu]m patterns reflected the expected trend of resulting in increased track length <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> with increasing P-selectin widths. The 15 [mu]m band width corresponded to the highest rolling velocities <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> <b>The</b> 5 [mu]m width gave the next to highest velocity which resulted likely because the 5 [mu]m had the smallest P-selectin area to which the cells could interact, except that the cells were not rolling <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> at this width. In addition, the 10 [mu]m band width resulted in <b>the</b> lowest rolling <b>edge</b> velocity, which was unexpected. As expected, <b>the</b> rolling velocities <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> for <b>the</b> 10 [mu]m and 15 [mu]m decreased when the flow rate was increased because only the cells with the strongest adhesion interactions remained on the patterns under higher shear stress. But the 5 [mu]m and 20 [mu]m patterns showed the opposite trend of decreasing with increasing flow rate. The unexpected results {{suggest that there are}} still important considerations to be studied when researching cell rolling behavior. by Minhee Sung. Thesis (S. B.)

5|$|On {{the west}} side of the hill was a shallow creek (Burnett Creek), and on the east side a very steep embankment. Because of the nature of the position, Harrison did not order {{temporary}} works to be created around the position, as was ordinarily done by encamped armies. The Yellow Jacket company, with Captain Spier Spencer in command, was posted on the southern end of the camp perimeter. The rest of the militia formed a rectangular formation <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the bluff surrounding the camp. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bartholomew commanded the Indiana militia units guarding the steep bluff on the eastern side of the formation. The regulars, commanded by Major Floyd, and the dragoons, commanded by Maj. Joseph Daveiss and former congressman Capt. Benjamin Parke, were kept behind the main line in reserve.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree was}} well known to Māori before its {{scientific}} discovery. The generic Māori language term for plants in the Cordyline genus is tī, and names recorded as specific to C.australis include tī kōuka, tī kāuka, tī rākau, tī awe, tī pua, and tī whanake. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight {{the characteristics of the}} tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether it was a large tree (tī rākau, tī pua), the whiteness of its flowers (tī puatea), whether its leaves were broad (tī wharanui), twisted <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> (tī tahanui), or spiky (tī tarariki). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (tī manu), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (tī whanake) and nets (tī kupenga). The most widely used name, tī kōuka, refers {{to the use of the}} leaf hearts as food.|$|E
5|$|Remi {{developed}} {{a love of}} cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as Huckleberry Finn, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe and The Pickwick Papers, {{as well as the}} novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the First World War, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.|$|E

5|$|The Interior Department {{announced}} in July 1921 that Edward Doheny had been awarded a lease to drill <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of naval reserve Elk Hills in California. The announcement attracted little controversy, as the oil {{would have been}} lost to wells on adjacent private land. Wyoming Senator John Kendrick had heard from constituents that Teapot Dome had also been leased, but no announcement had been made. The Interior Department refused to provide documentation, so he secured {{the passage of a}} Senate resolution compelling disclosure. The department sent a copy of the lease granting drilling rights to Harry Sinclair's Mammoth Oil Company, along with a statement that there had been no competitive bidding because military preparedness was involved—Mammoth was to build oil tanks for the Navy as part of the deal. This satisfied some people, but some conservationists, such as Gifford Pinchot, Harry A. Slattery, and others, pushed for a full investigation into Fall and his activities. They got Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. to begin a Senate investigation into the oil leases. La Follette persuaded Democratic Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh to lead the investigation, and Walsh read through the truckload of material provided by the Interior Department through 1922 into 1923, including a letter from Harding stating that the transfer and leases had been with his knowledge and approval.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who tilled lands <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming {{was made possible}} in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. Planting and weeding often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet. For other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the bone structure of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of each plate over the course of an aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested growth on the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length at relatively constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on whether they had wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to have grown more slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. This pattern of growth is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E

25|$|The {{changing}} climate {{forced the}} Inuit {{to work their}} way south, forcing them into marginal niches <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the tree line. These were areas which Native Americans had not occupied or where they were weak enough for the Inuit to live near them.

25|$|Undercutting is {{when the}} weld reduces the {{cross-sectional}} thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces {{the strength of the}} weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression {{along the length of the}} weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough filler metal <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because it will create greater temperature gradients between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an electrode angle, a dampened electrode, excessive arc length, and slow speed.|$|E
