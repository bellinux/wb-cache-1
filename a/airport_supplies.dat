40|$|A virtual {{environment}} of <b>airport’s</b> power <b>supply</b> is very useful for anti-accident training. In this paper, an effective method of anti-accident training for <b>airport’s</b> power <b>supply</b> based on Delta 3 D VR engine was proposed. The architecture of <b>airport’s</b> power <b>supply</b> training system was introduced. The electric closet’s operating simulation was accomplished {{based on the}} device’s operation logic. The model of fault and relay protection was designed according to electrical characteristics. A finite automaton model of diesel engine was presented based on operating conditions for virtual operation. Finally, a VR based <b>airport’s</b> power <b>supply</b> system was built and verified in worker’s training...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of photovoltaics (PV) to refrigeration for {{the distribution of}} chilled supermarket produce has been pioneered in the United Kingdom (UK).

An economic assessment of PV chilled delivery has been undertaken and {{compared with that of}} diesel powered refrigeration units. The analysis indicates that a payback time of 18 years for a PV refrigerated supermarket trailer can be achieved. Further analysis is presented for other chilled applications of <b>airport</b> catering <b>supply</b> and household milk delivery.

Estonian defence police investigated this under the sections of Estonian penal code criminalising incitement to criminal acts, vandalism, and terrorism. Having traced the blogger to a resident of Moscow publicly identified only as [...] "Aleksei", Estonian State Prosecutor's Office issued a request, under applicable MLAT, to Russian Federation's authorities for legal aid continuing the investigation, and eventually for bringing Mr. [...] "Mirny" [...] to trial. (The MLAT's operativeness depends on all the mentioned offences being unlawful under both state's laws.) Russian Federation refused cooperation, upon which Estonia issued an all-European arrest warrant for the suspect.|$|R

However, the multitude of information present in these places often leads to a multiplication of display devices and overloads the passenger with information which does not necessarily concern them.

This is particularly true in the case of public display devices such as the display screens which can be found in airports. This type of screen displays information concerning all avaible flights, whereas a passenger considered individually will only be interested in one flight. This therefore leads the user to carry out a task of information research which can be all the more tedious when {{there is a great deal}} of information present...|$|R
