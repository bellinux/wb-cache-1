5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is paired with <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate {{addition of the}} enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization {{and in the next}} step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E

The song {{reached the top of the}} charts for three weeks in Germany and stayed a full 30 weeks in the survey. It is the longest consecutive chart run of <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson song in the German charts.|$|E

A patrikios Gabras appears in 1018, who was blinded for {{plotting}} along with the Bulgarian Elemag to restore the recently subdued Bulgarian Empire; it is unclear, however, what his relation with the Chaldian Gabrades is, or whether {{he might be a}} Bulgarian noble. In 1040, <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Gabras was {{one of the leaders of}} a failed aristocratic conspiracy against the Domestic of the Schools Constantine, a brother of Emperor Michael IV (r. 1034–1041). He too was blinded along with his fellow conspirators.|$|E
5|$|United faced Liverpool {{at home in}} the {{following}} round, where the visitors took the lead from <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Owen header inside three minutes. In spite of creating plenty of goalscoring chances, the team failed to equalise until the 86th minute, when Yorke scored off a Beckham free kick. In the second minute of stoppage time, Ole Gunnar Solskjær hit a shot that sent Liverpool goalkeeper David James the wrong way to give United the win.|$|E
5|$|Appian Way later {{produced}} another biopic, Public Enemies (2009), <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Mann-directed mob drama starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. Following {{the final}} years of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Depp) as he is pursued by FBI agent Melvin Purvis during Great Depression, the film was an adaptation of Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34. A commercial success, it also received generally positive reviews, though critics found historical inaccuracies in the film. The company, along with Dark Castle Entertainment, released the 2009 psychological horror film Orphan, which told the story of a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious 9-year-old girl. The film was considered by the adoption community to promote negative stereotypes about orphans. Although the film received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success.|$|E

5|$|Carruthers joined Conference Premier club York City on 28 September 2009 on a one-month loan {{to provide}} {{competition}} for the left-side. He made his debut in a 1–1 home draw with Stevenage Borough on 3 October 2009, after coming on as a 76th-minute substitute. In November 2009, the loan was extended until 2 January 2010. Carruthers scored his first York goal with the opening goal in a 2–1 home victory over Wrexham on 5 December 2009 after heading in <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Rankine cross. After the loan spell concluded, he was offered a one-and-a-half-year contract by York and was subsequently released by Oxford. He signed for York permanently on 6 January 2010. He scored in his first match after signing, opening the scoring in a 4–1 home win over Hayes & Yeading United on 16 January 2010, converting from a Richard Brodie cross.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{locations}} {{outside of}} Australia have included Kenya, the United States and the UK, which has seen Neighbours episodes filmed there on four occasions. In February 1990, Lyme Park in Cheshire doubled as the Ledgerwood estate set in Yorkshire. Derek Nimmo guest-starred as the fictitious Lord Ledgerwood {{in two of}} the episodes. In November 1992, the characters Rick Alessi (Dan Falzon) and Debbie Martin (Marnie Reece-Wilmore) visited London to attend <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson concert. The second London-based storyline was broadcast in late March 2007, when Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) were seen taking a ride on the London Eye and being married on a boat on the River Thames. A new storyline shot in the UK aired in March 2017, and another will air in 2018.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the White team scored {{a pair of}} touchdowns on {{successive}} possessions and took a 17–9 lead. Both were made {{on a pair of}} long Phillip Sims touchdown passes to Chris Black on a 44-yard reception and to Yeldon on a 50-yard reception. The Crimson team responded with a two-play, 70-yard drive that saw a Demetrius Hart run of 23 yards and a 47-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Kenny Bell. After the unsuccessful two-point conversion, the White team led 17–15 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. In the fourth, both defenses again held both offenses scoreless. The only points came late in the game when Vinnie Sunseri recovered <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Williams fumble and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown and a 24–15 White victory.|$|E

He {{has since become}} a triple premiership player, a NAB Cup winner, a six-time All-Australian—three times as captain—a triple Carji Greeves Medallist, <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Tuck Medallist, an AFLPA Best Captain Award winner, and a four-time {{recipient}} of the AFLPA Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award. Selwood has also captained Australia in the International Rules Series, represented the Victorian state team as the youngest player to feature in the all-star event, and has been awarded life membership with Geelong. Selwood holds {{one of the highest}} winning–percentage records of any player in VFL-AFL history, helping the club reach three successive AFL Grand Finals from 2007–2009 and another in 2011. After serving one season as the club vice-captain in 2011, Selwood was appointed as the captain of Geelong at the beginning of 2012.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a 1–1 draw in Villarreal and a 3–0 win at the Emirates Stadium secured Arsenal's {{status as}} United's semi-final opponents. The draw had {{determined}} that United would play {{the first leg}} at home, and after Rooney, Tevez and Ronaldo had early chances, John O'Shea opened the scoring, firing home <b>a</b> <b>Michael</b> Carrick cross after Arsenal had failed to clear a corner. United continued to make chances throughout the game, but despite Arsenal making a couple of chances themselves, the match finished at 1–0 and United travelled to the Emirates Stadium a week later needing only to avoid defeat {{to become the first}} defending champions to reach the final since Juventus in 1997. Although Arsenal only needed to overturn a one-goal deficit, their chances of victory were drastically reduced within the first 11minutes of the match; Park Ji-sung took advantage of a slip by Kieran Gibbs to double United's aggregate lead in the eighthminute, before Ronaldo fired home a 41-yard free kick in the 11th minute. With two away goals on the United scoreboard, Arsenal now had to score four goals to reach the final. However, it was United who scored the next goal, as they hit Arsenal on the break and Ronaldo scored within 15 seconds of Arsenal losing the ball {{at the other end of}} the pitch. 15minutes from time, Arsenal were awarded a penalty kick after Darren Fletcher brought Cesc Fàbregas down in the penalty area, a foul for which Fletcher was sent off – although replays showed that Fletcher knocked the ball away from Fàbregas immediately before bringing him down, resulting in some controversy as to whether Fletcher deserved a red card for the foul. Robin van Persie scored the penalty to make the score 3–1, but it was not enough to prevent United from reaching the final unbeaten for the third time in their history.|$|E
