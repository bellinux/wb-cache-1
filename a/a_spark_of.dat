However, her secret bribery comes out {{on the eve of the}} election and she loses the election and twelve donors towards her foundation. Facing the possibility of jail and the overall humiliation and disgrace, she pours herself a glass of wine (in the original series, her favorite tipple was Vodka). Yet, before she can drink it J.R. and John Ross arrive, with J.R. vowing to make things right by her and reminding her that she is a strong woman. After they leave she dumps out the wine and instead seeks comfort in Ann. J.R. through means of blackmail is able to get the charges dropped and after thanking him, Sue Ellen invites him in for tea, <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>of</b> their past romance being seemingly reignited. Later she comes to the aid of John Ross and helps him in securing control of the newly established Ewing Energies, by pushing his ex-girlfriend Elena Ramos out of the company. Despite pleas from Bobby, Ann, and Christopher she does so.|$|E

He conducted experiments in which hydrogen and ordinary air were combined in known ratios, and then exploded with <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>of</b> electricity. Furthermore, he also described an experiment in which he was able to remove, in modern terminology, both the oxygen and nitrogen gases from a sample of atmospheric air until only a small bubble of unreacted gas was left in the original sample. Using his observations, Cavendish observed that, when he had determined the amounts of phlogisticated air (nitrogen) and dephlogisticated air (oxygen), there remained a volume of gas amounting to 1/120 of the original volume of nitrogen.|$|E

25|$|Mismanagement {{irreparably damaged}} its reputation, {{including}} such practices as not reporting points totals in time, running races late and behind schedule, deliberately scheduling its own events opposite {{the events of}} other sanctioning bodies to weaken their attendance, and a less-than-attentive attitude to members. In its last two years it went through a name change to National BMX Association (NBmxA) in 1979. It tried to reorganize in 1981, starting new tracks and by most accounts had <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>of</b> new energy and enthusiasm, but still suffered lack of ridership (racers were committed to other point races with the other sanctioning bodies). This was to no avail. The NBA, suffering financial difficulties, ceased sanctioning its own races and started joint operations and did merge its membership (but did not merge its management) with the NBL after the 1981 season.|$|E

There, Edgar introduced his brother to his childhood sweetheart, Sarah Elmira Royster. Edgar's foster-father John Allan also corresponded with Henry. In one letter, dated November 1, 1824, Allan apologized that Edgar was slow in writing a letter to Henry, complaining that his foster-son [...] "had little else to do, for he does nothing...

500|$|Formby {{was tempted}} {{back to work}} by the {{theatrical}} impresario Emile Littler, who offered him the lead role of Percy Piggott in Zip Goes a Million, a play based on the 1902 novel Brewster's Millions by G. B. McCutcheon; Formby was offered £1,500, plus {{a share of the}} box-office takings. The show premiered at the Coventry Hippodrome in September 1951 before opening at the Palace Theatre, London on 20 October. The Times commented unfavourably, saying that although the audience were appreciative of the play, they [...] "could not conceivably have detected <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>of</b> wit in either the lyrics or the dialogue"; the paper was equally dismissive of Formby, writing that [...] "he has a deft way with a song or a banjo, but little or no finesse in his handling of a comic situation".|$|E

In the {{critical}} review entitled [...] "Weep over this princely pile of slush", Mark Schilling criticized the film as [...] "a weeper that ... left me surprisingly dry eyed" [...] and added that [...] "There's hardly <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>of</b> originality in the entire enterprise, unless you count the casting of Tadanobu Asano – the coolest Japanese actor of his generation – as a sad-but-wise circus clown." [...] Reviewer Matiko Wataru of the [...] "Eiga-Judge" [...] website said that [...] "this innocent and sad tale tragedy of the boy is too simplistic and the screenplay did not do much.". However, the review praised the [...] "beautiful scenery {{of the city of}} Shonai" [...] and said the film was a [...] "sad and beautiful combination of children and animals".|$|E
500|$|Finding it {{ironic that}} Outliers {{provided}} {{suggestions on how}} to resolve cultural biases, the Sunday Times review by Kevin Jackson agreed that the book itself suffered from an unbalanced focus on American subjects, predicting that this would lead to better sales in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Jackson was disappointed in the book's lack of new ideas, noting that it merely expands on the concept that [...] "you have to be born at the right moment; at the right place; to the right family (posh usually helps); {{and then you have to}} work really, really hard. That's about it." [...] He was also skeptical towards Gladwell's arguments for the 10,000-Hour Rule by countering that The Beatles' success had more to do with [...] "the youthful spirit of the age, the vogue for guitar bands and <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>of</b> collaborative chemistry".

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out offour, calling it [...] "well-cast" [...] and commending it for playing to each actor's strengths. Ebert gave {{particular}} praise to Spacey, labeling him [...] "superb", and Aniston, judging her performance to be a [...] "surprise" [...] and a return to form, stating [...] "she has acute comic timing and hilariously enacts alarming sexual hungers". Ebert called Horrible Bosses [...] "cheerful and wicked". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly reacted positively, calling the film [...] "abouncy, well-built, delightfully nasty tale of resentment, desperation, and amoral revenge" [...] and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin also praised the cast, stating that the picture [...] "succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads, who remain likeable even while resorting to homicide", adding the [...] "acting more than compensates for the film's other failings." [...] Rabin singled out Day's performance as [...] "apotent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>of</b> madness can elevate a ramshackle lowbrow farce into a solid mainstream comedy through sheer force of charisma." [...] Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net credited director Seth Gordon with having assembled [...] "the perfect cast", claiming [...] "the six leads kill in every scene", but echoed Nathan Rabin's sentiments that Day is the [...] "real standout". Douglas summarized the picture as [...] "dark fun that works better than expected due to a well-developed script, an impeccable cast and a director who knows how to put the two together". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated [...] "the timing of the cast...is impeccable" [...] and appreciated that the script did not attempt [...] "to cut its coarseness with a hypocritical dose of sweetness or respectability". The review concluded that [...] "in the ways that count and even when it shouldn’t, Horrible Bosses works." ...|$|E
