25|$|Three {{employees}} of the Radio Corporation of America, an Air Force contractor, were killed when a B-29 Superfortress crashed in 1948 in Waycross, Georgia. Their widows brought an action in tort seeking damages in federal court, under the Federal Tort Claims Act. As part of this action, they requested production of <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> concerning the crash, but were told by the Air Force that the release of such details would threaten national security. Because {{of the failure of}} the government to produce the documents, a directed verdict in favor of the plaintiffs was granted by the trial court. The judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The United States Supreme Court reversed the decision, and remanded it to the trial court. After this, a settlement was reached with the widows, who received an aggregate sum of $170,000 in exchange for a release of liability to the Government.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{behavioral}} factors underlying the reporting intentions of cycling accidents. The proposed analytical framework is an adapted {{version of the}} Theory of Planned Behavior accounting for the linkage between attitudes and the perceived difficulties, {{in order to understand}} the barriers impeding cycling <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> intentions. The barriers consist of attitudes that <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> is useless, preference to allocate time to other activities, concerns about family distress and social image, distrust in the police, and medical consultation aversion. The framework was validated by means of a survey, which yielded 1, 512 complete responses from cyclists. The estimated structural equation model revealed: (i) the perceived difficulties are related to reporting intentions, attitudes that <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> is useless, and the preference to allocate time to other activities; (ii) medical consultation aversion has a higher weight than distrust in the police in demotivating cycling <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> intentions; (iii) the latent factors are mainly related to socio-economic characteristics and last cycling accident characteristics; (iv) information provision regarding the societal benefits of <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> is important for increasing the reporting rate...|$|R

2500|$|In a 2006 NTSB special {{investigation}} {{report on the}} industry, the board reported emergency medical helicopter flight hours increased by 54 percent since 1991, but the rate of accidents per 100,000 flight hours increased 77 percent. FAA reports show that these accidents frequently involve controlled flight into terrain, spatial disorientation, and weather. [...] "On the <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> I have reviewed, there doesn't {{appear to be a}} common thread linking these accidents," [...] according to independent safety expert Barry Schiff. But three out of four of those accidents occurred when no patient was on board the aircraft — a fact aviation lawyer and helicopter-pilot Justin Green said is attributed to lax regulations by the FAA. When no patient or organ is aboard, the helicopters can be operated VFR under less restrictive Part 91 regulations, as the accident flight was. The NTSB had previously recommended that the FAA require all operations to be conducted under the more restrictive Part 135 regulations whenever medical personnel are on board.|$|E
