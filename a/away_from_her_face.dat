25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
500|$|Actress {{and model}} Sherri Stoner {{served as the}} {{performance}} model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones {{and the way in}} which she raises her eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the video is {{dedicated}} to the Broadway musical Cabaret. The video begins with soldiers in black leather uniforms in a cabaret with a close-up of a soldier passed out in female fishnet stockings and heels as another lone soldier stares into the distance. The scene then cuts to male dancers performing elaborate choreography while marching forward with a Star of David. As the intro of the song begins, Gaga is shown leading a funeral procession, carrying the Sacred Heart on a pillow. When the lyrics begin, she sits on a throne wearing an elaborate headpiece and binocular-like eyepieces, with a smoking pipe in her hand, watching her dancers perform a rigorous routine in the snow. Gaga is then seen as the character Sally Bowles from Cabaret, dancing and simulating sex acts with three men on a stage with twin beds surrounded by spotlights, all wearing nothing but underwear, intercut with shots of Gaga lying on a larger bed dressed in a red latex nun outfit. She subsequently appears dressed in a white hooded robe, reminiscent of Joan of Arc, with her dancers, interspersed with a shot of her as the nun, consuming a set of rosary beads. After this, Gaga and her dancers are shown in a sequence in black-and-white in their military uniforms performing a tribute dedicated to the late choreographer Bob Fosse, who won an Academy Award for his direction of the film version of Cabaret. Gaga is seen in a blonde bob and a similar outfit to one of Liza Minnelli's performance costumes. The video moves to a scene of her wearing a bra equipped with AR-15 rifle barrels [...] and her dancers performing another dance routine. She is then shown in the empty club, scenes of war breaking out flash by, and the lone soldier appears again. Going back to the Joan of Arc scene, she struggles with her dancers and disrobes. The video ends with her dressed as the nun, the film burning <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> outwards. Klein explained that the video was, [...] "about a woman's desire to resurrect a dead love and who can not face the brutality of her present situation. The pain of living without your true love." ...|$|E
60|$|She held herself <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was deathly white now. Her eyes {{questioned}} him fiercely.|$|R
60|$|She {{wrenched}} herself free, {{and leaped}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was bright now, {{and the promise}} of smiles was made good.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} between them for awhile. The Duc d'Aumont's {{eyes were fixed}} {{steadily}} on a distant point on the horizon, but Lydie's eyes never for a second strayed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|She caught {{hold of my}} {{hand and}} grasped it convulsively. The hard lines seemed to have fallen <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She smiled tremulously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't, don't grieve," [...] {{he said in}} an {{unsteady}} voice, as he {{took the}} little hands in his and pulled them <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{was evidently}} puzzled. Little by little the {{animosity}} {{seemed to have}} died <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She looked at the sleeping man thoughtfully, and then once more at me.|$|E
60|$|The girl turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the partition, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{white and}} drawn, her eyes inexpressibly sad. She rose to <b>her</b> feet, <b>facing</b> Theriere.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the blood}} slowly fell <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> neck and <b>face,</b> and <b>her</b> heart ceased to pound, her eyes cleared and she grew gentle again, seeing his pained and frightened face.|$|R
6000|$|... "It be {{the cruel}} truth, My Lady Bertrade," [...] said Norman of Torn sadly. And, then, {{as she turned}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him, burying <b>her</b> <b>face</b> in <b>her</b> raised arms, he came to her side, and, laying his hand upon her shoulder, said sadly: ...|$|R
60|$|He disregarded her bidding to {{the extent}} of placing his arm around her waist. He made no attempt, however, to draw her hands <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> or stop her tears.|$|E
60|$|This last {{question}} came abruptly, in harsh, trenchant tones, altogether different {{to those of}} her smooth contralto voice. He turned his eyes <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> {{and looked down at}} his own hands, which were clasped in front of him.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} {{she felt a}} firm, hot grip on her wrist, and her left hand was {{forcibly}} drawn <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> whilst an eager voice spoke quick, vehement words, the purport of which failed at first to reach her brain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{perhaps it}} is," [...] said Maggie, resolutely {{clearing}} <b>away</b> the clouds <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{with a bright}} smile, and throwing herself backward in her chair. [...] "Perhaps {{it comes from the}} school diet,--watery rice-pudding spiced with Pinnock. Let us hope it will give way before my mother's custards and this charming Geoffrey Crayon." ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE. Take care. I'm {{losing my}} senses again. (Summoning all her courage, she takes <b>away</b> <b>her</b> hand <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{and puts it}} on his right shoulder, turning him towards her and looking him {{straight}} in the eyes. He begins to protest agitatedly.) Gloria: be sensible: it's no use: I haven't a penny in the world.|$|R
60|$|And so, after a {{good deal}} of argument, our hero was {{constrained}} to go; nor did he even have an opportunity to bid adieu to his inamorata. Nor did he see her any more, except from a distance, she standing on the poop deck as he was rowed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> all stained with crying. For himself, he felt that there was no more joy in life; nevertheless, standing up in the stern of the boat, he made shift, though with an aching heart, to deliver her a fine bow with the hat he had borrowed from the Spanish captain, before his brother bade him sit down again.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do? Oh! {{what shall we}} do?" [...] moaned Madame Belhomme. But she had dragged the apron <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and was looking with some puzzlement at meek, gentle little Jeanne, who had {{suddenly}} become so strange, so dictatorial, all unlike her habitual somewhat diffident self.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he looked}} up with a triumphant leer at the calm face of Marguerite. She still did not feel really frightened, only puzzled and perturbed; but all the blood had rushed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> leaving her cheeks ashen white, and {{pressing}} against her heart, until it almost choked her.|$|E
60|$|It had all {{happened}} so suddenly that no one--least of all Licinia--could guess {{what it was}} that had so angered my lady. Dea Flavia had raised herself to a sitting posture, and thrown her hair back, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> which looked flushed and wrathful, whilst two sharp furrows appeared between her brows.|$|E
60|$|Alicia's grief {{gradually}} exhausted itself. She feebly {{raised her}} head, and, turning it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me, hid <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> I {{saw that she}} was not fit for talking yet, and begged her to go upstairs to the drawing-room and lie down a little. She looked apprehensively toward the folding-doors that shut us off from the front parlor.|$|R
60|$|I {{pressed her}} against my heart, and my lips {{imprinted}} a delicate kiss upon her forehead. After which, with chaste decorum, she once more turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me, covered <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and {{head with the}} shawl, and drew back into the remote corner of the carriage, where she remained, silent and absorbed, no doubt, in the contemplation of her happiness.|$|R
6000|$|The picture {{which the}} girl had made as she dashed up to the pasture gate (<b>her</b> hat-rim blown <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> brown <b>face</b> and {{sparkling}} eyes), united with the kindliness in her voice as she accepted his gallant aid, entered a deep impression on the tourist's mind; {{but he did not}} turn his head to look at her--perhaps he feared Bill's elbow quite as much as his guffaw--but he listened closely, and by listening learned that she had been [...] "East" [...] for several weeks, and also that she was known, and favorably known, all along the line, for whenever they met a team or passed a ranch some one called out, [...] "Hello, Berrie!" [...] in cordial salute, and the men, old and young, were especially pleased to see her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miriam was a beauty. I {{had known}} that before, though I think I hardly {{expected}} to see such wonderful loveliness. She was tall and extremely graceful, dark--at least her hair was dark, but her skin was wonderfully fair and clear. Her hair was gathered <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> {{and she had a}} high, pure, white forehead, and the straightest, finest, blackest brows. Her face was oval, with very large and dark eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sarsby {{picked up}} his bag and {{departed}} without any further protest. The girl stood upon the steps and watched him, and as she watched, some of the darkness seemed to pass <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> He disappeared around the corner. She was alone--free, at any rate! She drew a long breath, and the dull streets and gray sky seemed suddenly to have become like the walls and canopy of a new paradise.|$|E
60|$|The cab drove off, {{skirting}} the gaily-lit crescent of Regent Street. The smile {{almost at once}} died away from her lips. She leaned forward and looked at herself {{in one of the}} oblong mirrors. Her face was almost colourless, the skin seemed drawn closely round her eyes, giving her almost a strained look. For the rest, her hair, smoothly brushed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> was in perfect order, her prim little hat was at exactly the right angle, her little white tie alone relieved the sombreness of her black jacket. She sighed and suddenly felt a moistening of her hot eyes. She leaned far back into the corner of the cab.|$|E
6000|$|... “If we {{girls at}} Court could grow such roses as that,” {{continues}} Beatrix, with her laugh, “what wouldn’t {{we do to}} preserve ’em? We’d clip their stalks and put ’em in salt and water. But those flowers don’t bloom at Hampton Court and Windsor, Henry.” She paused for a minute, and the smile fading <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> April <b>face,</b> gave place to a menacing shower of tears: “Oh, how good she is, Harry,” Beatrix went on to say. “Oh, what a saint she is! Her goodness frightens me. I’m not fit to live with her. I should be better, I think, if she were not so perfect. She has had a great sorrow in her life, and a great secret; and repented of it. It {{could not have been}} my father’s death. She talks freely about that; nor could she have loved him very much—though who knows what we women do love, and why?” ...|$|R

60|$|She looked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{him out of}} the window. Beneath her veil {{her eyes}} were a little misty. She saw nothing of the trimly {{partitioned}} fields, the rolling pastoral country. Before her vision tragedies seemed to pass,--the blood-stained paraphernalia of the battlefield, the empty, stricken homes, the sobbing women in black, striving to comfort their children whilst their own hearts were breaking. When she turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the window, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was hardened. Once more she found herself almost hating the man who was her companion. Whatever might come afterwards, at that moment she had the sensations of a murderess.|$|R
60|$|Theodosia was thirty-five and {{was nothing}} like! the slim, dimpled {{girl who had}} stood on the porch steps and watched her husband drive away that morning fifteen years ago. She was stout and comely; the auburn hair was darker and arched <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> in smooth, shining waves instead of the old-time curls. Her face was unlined and fresh-coloured, but no woman could live in {{subjection}} to her own unbending will {{for so many years}} and not show it. Nobody, looking at Theodosia now, would have found {{it hard to believe that}} a woman with such a determined, immoveable face could stick to a course of conduct in defiance of circumstances.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{received}} our praises with {{a gracious}} smile, yet with a composed gravity which somewhat puzzled me. She seemed perfectly obliging and amiable, {{yet there was}} a serious reticence about her that quite piqued my curiosity. I could not help recurring {{to the idea of}} a lady in disguise; though I scarcely knew to what circumstance about her I could attach the idea. So far from the least effort to play the lady, her dress was, in homely plainness, a perfect contrast to that of the girls who had preceded her. It consisted of strong dark-blue stuff, made perfectly plain to her figure, with a narrow band of white linen around her throat. Her dark brown hair was brushed smoothly <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and confined simply behind in a net; there was not the slightest pretension to coquetry in its arrangement; in fact, the object seemed to be to get it snugly out of the way, rather than to make it a matter of ornament. Nevertheless, I could not help remarking that there was a good deal of it, and that it waved very prettily, notwithstanding the care that had been taken to brush the curl out of it.|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot wist {{not what}} to do, albeit {{his heart was}} rent with love and pity. Then by and by he came close to her and he said: [...] "Lady, lady! What is this you do! May God have pity on us both, for you tear my heart strings with your grief." [...] Therewith, they two being alone, he sank down upon his knees before her, and he took her hands into his and strove to draw them <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> And for a while she would not let him {{withdraw}} her hands and then {{after a while she}} did let him, and so he held them imprisoned very tight in his own. Yet ever she kept her face turned away from him so that he could see but little of it. So with her face turned away she said after a while, [...] "Launcelot! Launcelot! Art thou not sorry for me?" [...] He said: [...] "Yea, lady, I am sorry for thee and I am sorry for myself, and for which of the two I am more sorry I cannot tell. For God knoweth I would abide by my duty and my faith, and mefeareth thou wouldst have me do otherwise." [...] Then the Queen said: [...] "Launcelot, what is duty and what is faith when we measure these things with the measurement of happiness and unhappiness?" [...] And Sir Launcelot said, [...] "Lady, for God's sake, forbear." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then King Pelles {{was very}} sorry for the Lady Elaine and he lifted her up and embraced {{her in his arms}} and kissed <b>her</b> upon the <b>face.</b> And King Pelles sought to comfort her, wiping <b>away</b> the tears <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> And he said, [...] "My daughter, weep not so." [...] She said, [...] "Lord, I cannot help it." [...] Then he said: [...] "My daughter, weep no more, for it shall be as thou wouldst have it. Go now in God's name upon this quest, if so be it will ease thy heart to do so, and I will send safe escort with thee." ...|$|R
60|$|After the kiss, {{her eyes}} again slowly filled with tears. She sat still, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him, with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> drooped aside, and her hands folded in her lap. The tears fell very slowly. There was {{complete}} silence. He too sat there motionless and silent on the hearthrug. The strange pain of his heart that was broken seemed to consume him. That he should love her? That this was love! That he should be ripped open in this way!--Him, a doctor!--How they would all jeer if they knew!--It was agony to him to think they might know.|$|R
6000|$|When the big cake {{had been}} cut and divided among the guests, Wetzel {{discovered}} the gold ring within his share. He presented the ring to Betty, and gave his privilege of kissing Susan to George Reynolds, with the remark: [...] "George, I calkilate Susan would like it better {{if you do the}} kissin' part." [...] Now it was known to all that George had long been an ardent admirer of Susan's, and it was suspected that she was not indifferent to him. Nevertheless, she protested that it was not fair. George acted like a man who had the opportunity of his life. Amid uproarious laughter he ran Susan all over the room, and when he caught her he pulled <b>her</b> hands <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> blushing <b>face</b> and bestowed a right hearty kiss on her cheek. To everyone's surprise and to Wetzel's discomfiture, Susan walked up to him and saying that as he had taken such an easy way out of it she intended to punish him by kissing him. And so she did. Poor Lewis' face looked the picture of dismay. Probably he had never been kissed before in his life.|$|R
