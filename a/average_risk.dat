25|$|Ovarian {{cancer has}} low prevalence, {{even in the}} high-risk group of women from the ages of 50 to 60 (about one in 2000), and {{screening}} of women with <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> {{is more likely to}} give ambiguous results than detect a problem which requires treatment. Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of <b>average</b> <b>risk,</b> the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it {{is more likely to be}} treated successfully.|$|E
25|$|Screening is not {{recommended}} in women who are at <b>average</b> <b>risk,</b> as evidence does not support a reduction in death and {{the high rate of}} false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.|$|E
25|$|After obtaining scores, {{researchers}} {{are able to}} use the information to determine if there is a difference in the <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> estimate of the individual compared to the <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> estimate of their peers. Generally in negative events, the mean risk of an individual appears lower than the risk estimate of others. This is then used to demonstrate the bias' effect. The optimistic bias can only be defined at a group level, because at an individual level the positive assessment could be true. Likewise, difficulties can arise in measurement procedures, as {{it is difficult to determine}} when someone is being optimistic, realistic, or pessimistic. Research suggests that the bias comes from an overestimate of group risks rather than underestimating one's own risk.|$|E

Therefore, this elasticity is unity for someone with <b>average</b> relative <b>risk</b> aversion, whereas consumers with above <b>average</b> relative <b>risk</b> aversion transfer some of their aggregate- output risk to consumers with below <b>average</b> relative <b>risk</b> aversion.

25|$|The {{presumption}} {{was that}} by detecting cancer {{in an earlier}} stage, women {{will be more likely}} to be cured by treatment.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} portfolio optimization under Value at <b>Risk,</b> <b>Average</b> Value at <b>Risk</b> and Limited Expected Loss constraints {{in a continuous}} time framework, where stocks follow a geometric Brownian motion. Analytic expressions for Value at <b>Risk,</b> <b>Average</b> Value at <b>Risk</b> and Limited Expected Loss are derived. We {{solve the problem of}} minimizing risk measures applied to portfolios. Moreover, the portfolio’s expected return is maximized subject to the aforementioned risk measures.

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} financial innovation on portfolio risks when traders have belief disagreements. I decompose traders’ <b>average</b> portfolio <b>risks</b> into two components: the uninsurable variance, defined as portfolio risks that would obtain without belief disagreements, and the speculative variance, defined as portfolio risks that result from speculation. My main result shows that financial innovation always increases the speculative variance through two distinct channels: by generating new bets and by amplifying traders’ existing bets. When disagreements are large, these effects are sufficiently strong that financial innovation increases <b>average</b> portfolio <b>risks,</b> decreases <b>average</b> portfolio comovements, and generates greater speculative trading volume relative to risk-sharing volume. Moreover, a profit-seeking market maker endogenously introduces speculative assets that increase <b>average</b> portfolio <b>risks...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen) {{reduce the}} risk of breast cancer but increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer. There is no overall change in the risk of death. They are thus not recommended for the prevention of breast cancer in women at <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> but may be offered for those at high risk. The benefit of breast cancer reduction continues for at least five years after stopping a course of treatment with these medications.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a fuzzy model to estimate the possibility of neonatal mortality. A computing model was built, based on the fuzziness of the following variables: newborn birth weight, gestational age at delivery, Apgar score, and previous report of stillbirth. The inference used was Mamdani's method and the output was the risk of neonatal death given as a percentage. 24 rules were created according to the inputs. The validation model used a real data file with records from a Brazilian city. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to estimate the accuracy of the model, while <b>average</b> <b>risks</b> were compared using the Student t test. MATLAB 6. 5 software was used to build the model. The <b>average</b> <b>risks</b> were smaller in survivor newborn (p < 0. 001). The accuracy of the model was 0. 90. The higher accuracy occurred with risk below 25 %, corresponding to 0. 70 in respect to sensitivity, 0. 98 specificity, 0. 99 negative predictive value and 0. 22 positive predictive value. The model showed a good accuracy, as well as a good negative predictive value and could be used in general hospitals...|$|R

We find that Koenig’s equation as the superior one when we use the harmonic mean to compute <b>average</b> relative <b>risk</b> aversion. Our reinterpretation of Koenig’s generalized equation is that Pareto efficiency requires that the consumption of an individual with <b>average</b> relative <b>risk</b> should be proportional to the real GDP. ...|$|R

25|$|Screening is not {{recommended}} in women who are at <b>average</b> <b>risk,</b> as evidence does not support a reduction in death and {{the high rate of}} false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks. Those at very high risk may have their ovaries removed as a preventive measure. If caught and treated in an early stage, ovarian cancer is often curable. Treatment usually includes some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Outcomes depend on the extent of the disease, the subtype of cancer present, and other medical conditions. The overall five-year survival rate in the United States is 45%. Outcomes are worse in the developing world.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} testing the robustness of the positive correlation between <b>average</b> stock <b>risk</b> and stock market returns documented by Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003). This is addressed by investigating this relationship in the Canadian market by using an improved market timing methodology. We examine both the statistical and financial properties of <b>average</b> stock <b>risk,</b> as measured for equal- and value-weighted portfolios using a daily sample of all TSE-listed Canadian firms between January 1975 and December 2001. In order to further test the robustness of the relationship, we examine two sub-samples, January 1980 to December 1989 and January 1990 to December 1999. We find that the positive trend in <b>average</b> stock <b>risk</b> previously noted by Campbell et al (2001) and by Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003) is only present over our entire time period and not over each of the sub-periods. This questions the generality of the result for the entire period. Further, our findings {{do not support the}} positive correlation between <b>average</b> stock <b>risk</b> and stock market return. Our analysis shows only a weak statistical link and practically no financial timing ability when this time-series is used in an active market timing investment strategy. When macro-economic variables are introduced into our forecasting models, the in-sample statistical properties of the risk-return relationship increases significantly {{at the expense of the}} out-of-sample forecasting accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{growth and}} {{evolution}} of urban areas generate new challenges for safety and security driving societal, economic, and ecological developments at local and worldwide levels. Cities comprise {{a high degree of}} critical infrastructure with an increasing complexity and interdependency. In addition, modified and new threats ranging from natural to man-made and malicious hazards ask for more robust and sustainable cities. This work combines and extends existing empirical, engineering, and simulative methods to define and determine quantities for resilience assessment of urban areas in a comprehensive approach. Based on a multitude of possible events in a city quarter with a larger number of infrastructures, susceptibilities, vulnerabilities, and <b>averaged</b> <b>risks</b> are analyzed in a systematic and quantitative way. The use of an established empirical-historical database gives first insights to identify susceptible elements or endangered areas in the considered urban environments. It is coupled to an approach for consequences where state-of-the-art physical-engineering hazard and damage propagation and quantification models are integrated forvulnerability assessment. The consideration of multiple threats and multiple possible locations cumulates in an object- and location-dependent quantification of <b>averaged</b> <b>risks</b> to visualize the most critical regions and infrastructure aspects indensely populated areas. In this article, the approach is exemplarily applied to terroristic threats. The integration of the three-dimensional visualized approach into existing risk assessment and management processes will help to create cities that are more resilient...|$|R
