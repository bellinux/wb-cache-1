5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, <b>and</b> <b>asthma,</b> {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E

40|$|Asthma is {{a common}} condition, which is {{associated}} with atopy and allergic conditions including hay fever, eczema, <b>and</b> food allergies. <b>Asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy are both complex conditions where genetic and environmental factors are implicated in causation. Interactions between genetic and environmental factors, likely via epigenetic mechanisms, are widely thought {{to be important in}} determining the risk for developing <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy. The nature of the relationship between <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy is unclear and {{the answer to the question}} “does atopy cause asthma?” remains unknown. This review explores the relationship between <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy from a gene–environment interaction perspective and tackles the question “are similar gene–environment interactions present for <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy?” The main finding is that gene–environment interactions are described for <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy in children but these interactions are seldom sought for both <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy in the same population. In the few instances where a gene–environment interaction is related to both <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy, there is no consistent evidence that similar interactions are common to <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy. Many plausible gene–environment interactions for <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy are yet to be explored. Overall, from the gene–environment interaction perspective, there is absence of evidence to better understand the complex relationship between <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> atopy...|$|R
5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, <b>and</b> <b>asthma,</b> diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, {{and culture of the}} sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes <b>and</b> <b>asthma.</b>|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that Hispanic migrants in the U. S. experience better respiratory health than their U. S. -born counterparts; this is reflective of a Hispanic health paradox (HHP). I address the following research questions {{with a focus on}} the HHP among children in the urban US border setting of El Paso, Texas: 1) Does acculturation relate to current <b>asthma</b> symptoms <b>and</b> diagnosed <b>asthma?</b> 2) Does the relationship between acculturation <b>and</b> current <b>asthma</b> symptoms <b>and</b> diagnosed <b>asthma</b> persist when controlling for relevant risk factors? 3) How does acculturation modify the relationships between the risk factors <b>and</b> current <b>asthma</b> symptoms <b>and</b> diagnosed <b>asthma?</b> Data were collected through a cross-sectional, observational mail survey of all primary caretakers of 4 th and 5 th graders in the El Paso Independent School District (N= 1, 513 Hispanic families). Generalized linear models (GLM) and interaction effects were used. Acculturation was a positive and significant predictor of <b>asthma</b> symptoms <b>and</b> diagnosed <b>asthma.</b> Low birth weight, prenatal smoking, pest exposure, and breastfeeding modified the effect of acculturation on <b>asthma</b> symptoms <b>and</b> diagnosed <b>asthma.</b> Overall the results of the research suggest that acculturation matters yet it is not equally risky for all Hispanic children. These findings foster an understanding of how the effect of acculturation on Hispanic children 2 ̆ 7 s respiratory health is intensified or attenuated by distinct individual-level risk factors. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Asthma</b> <b>and</b> CORD {{are both}} {{heterogeneous}} lung diseases including many different phenotypes. The classical <b>asthma</b> <b>and</b> CORD phenotypes {{are easy to}} discern because they reflect extremes of a phenotypical spectrum.
