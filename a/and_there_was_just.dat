500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{was created}} {{on the final}} day of {{recording}} for The Joshua Tree. It developed from a lengthy jam that the band recorded in a single take. Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really in this world, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> something really beautifully right {{about the idea that}} the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, in an October 27, 2005, {{appearance}} on Larry King Live, Bob Woodward commented: [...] "They did a damage assessment within the CIA, {{looking at what}} this did that [...] Joe Wilson's wife [...] was outed. And turned out it was quite minimal damage. They {{did not have to}} pull anyone out undercover abroad. They didn't have to resettle anyone. There was no physical danger to anyone, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> some embarrassment." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the first, rain-affected day Hampshire {{progressed to}} 299 for 4 off 76 overs, with Michael Brown putting on 93 at the Rose Bowl.

Cardiff UCCE's Christopher Salmons scored 84 not out, an innings that included six fours and five sixes, which made up {{nearly half of}} the students' total of 169. Hampshire were 80 for 3, 210 runs ahead, at close. On the third and final day Hampshire declared on 146 for 6, setting a target of 277.

2500|$|Schwartz {{said that}} he wrote the highly {{regarded}} Pilot episode in his boxer shorts. [...] "I {{had no idea what}} would come of it <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> that purity to it." [...] The script for the Pilot attracted most of the regular cast to the project, including film star Peter Gallagher, who said of the Pilot, [...] "In that recently post-9/11 America, I read this script and thought it was astounding. I thought it was exactly the right story to be telling at that point in time. It was about a family living in a not very embracing community, one that doesn't necessarily share all their values. [...] they don't lose their sense of humor or their inclination to help. They still open their arms and embrace this outsider kid. And I thought that was powerful in an era with a kind of xenophobia, a kind of looking-over-your-shoulder and getting small and angry, sort of creeping into the PATRIOT Act-fueled environment. This espoused a kind of America... It just felt right. And it had a sense of humor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Basil {{was first}} modeled on Bing Crosby, but the animators {{eventually}} took inspiration from Leslie Howard. Initially, Ratigan {{had been designed}} as thin, weasely, and ratlike. Following the screening of Champagne for Caesar, Glen Keane noted that following the casting of Price, [...] "is expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character." [...] Additionally, during one story meeting, Glen Keane decided to base the stature of Ratigan on then-Disney CEO Ron Miller, who was a 6'6" [...] former football player for the Los Angeles Rams. Furthermore, Keane lifted his personality as he was thumbing through these [...] "photographs of people of London in the 1800s, of railroad men, {{and there was this}} one guy smoking a cigar — he had a top hat <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> something about this guy — this Ratigan...this rat sucking the cigar, completely dressed to the hilt, he was sharp and perfect — he's a sewer rat dressed like a king and he lives as a king!"
