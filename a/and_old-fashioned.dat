Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved. However, not all of these reforms had been completed when the Germans started Operation Barbarossa fourteen months later.|$|E

This continued until 1946, when they returned to work on the promenade service.|$|E

The young couple settled in the Marienpalais, but Anastasia {{was not allowed to}} arrange her apartments according to her own taste. She was homesick and found a strict <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> court and an oppressive atmosphere.

25|$|Yamaguchi {{intentionally}} {{tried to}} create uncool <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> lyrics, in order to juxtapose with the song's modern sound. He wrote the lyrics an hommage to kayōkyoku pop lyrics of the 1970s and 1980s, specifically the songs of Momoe Yamaguchi and Akina Nakamori. Yamaguchi felt that stylistically, the song's chorus melody was directly inspired by Shōwa period kayōkyoku, but someone unfamiliar with the genre might misinterpret as purely inspired by dance music. After Yamaguchi finished songwriting, the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera arranged the initial demo, with bassist Ami Kusakari later reworking the demo to blend Iwadera's style with hers.|$|E

The documentary Saving Grace-Resurrecting American History, written and directed by Emmy Award-winning writer and director Eric Futterman, follows the process of using laser scanning to recreate the monument in computers, then sending the data to Ireland, where stonecutters used both high technology computer equipment <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> stone-cutting tools to create a new 7,000 pound monument.|$|E
25|$|International Settlement's club acts, {{with their}} can-can dancers <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> chorus girls, {{were unable to}} compete with the {{incredible}} talent and excitement of the emerging Broadway scene, and by the early 1960s their popularity had fallen below a critical level. But despite the brilliance and innovation of Broadway's entertainment scene of the 1950s and 1960s, its live entertainment clubs would also lose their popularity with time. As of the first decade in the 21st century, Broadway had lost its standup comedy clubs and its live music clubs, only to be replaced by cocktail lounges with recorded music. However, some live music clubs still operate in other areas of North Beach.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{features}} for works of Margit Sandemo are {{among other things}} history, fantasy, romance, suspense and supernatural phenomena. The plots of her books are often very complex and meandering, and continue from one book to another. In the central role are distinct amulets, old writings and symbols, which the main characters decipher in order to solve riddles stage by time, while fighting against evil powers. The events {{of the majority of}} her novels take place in Europe in the Middle Ages and in the beginning of Modern Times, especially in Norway and Iceland. Sometimes the main characters have adventures further away, such as in Spain and Austria. Medieval knight castles, bewitched forests <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned,</b> idyllic manor milieu are among the settings the stories take place in.|$|E

25|$|In 1867, {{his father}} was {{appointed}} prebendary and rector of Tibohine, and {{the family moved to}} neighbouring Frenchpark, in County Roscommon. He was home schooled by his father and his aunt due to a childhood illness. While a young man, he became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the Irish language. He was influenced in particular by the gamekeeper Seamus Hart and the wife of his friend, Mrs. Connolly. He was crushed when Hart died (Douglas was 14) and his interest in the Irish language, which was the first language he began to study in any detail, as his own undertaking, flagged for a while. However, he visited Dublin a number of times and realised that there were groups of people, just like him, interested in Irish, a language looked down on at the time by many and seen as backward <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned.</b>|$|E

Wellesz described his paintings as evidencing an [...] "intensity of feeling which gives a very special and very moving quality to his work. His devotion is reflected in his figures: it charges with symbolic meaning the smallest details of his paintings; and, in a hidden, almost magical way, it speaks from the concord of his pure and glowing colours." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Virgin Records began reissuing Eno's albums in remastered digipaks. Modern {{reception}} of Another Green World {{has been more}} unanimously positive. Steve Huey of AllMusic called the album [...] "a universally acknowledged masterpiece" [...] and [...] "the perfect introduction to his achievements {{even for those who}} find ambient music difficult to enjoy." [...] Mike Powell of Pitchfork hailed it as Eno's definitive album, and Q magazine wrote that it was [...] "breathtakingly ahead of its time". J. D. Considine, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), said that Eno used the recording studio for the album [...] "as an instrument, molding directed improvisations, electronic effects, <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> songcraft into perfectly balanced aural ecosystems".

500|$|House of Music {{expanded}} on Tony! Toni! Toné!'s previous traditional R work {{by emphasizing}} live instrumentation and ballads. In {{the opinion of}} Daily Herald writer Dan Kening, the album continued the band's mix of contemporary R <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> soul, deeming it [...] "half a tribute to their '60s and '70s soul music roots and half a masterful blend of modern smooth balladeering and danceable funk." [...] Salon critic Jennie Yabroff believed House of Music mostly featured ballads {{in the form of}} [...] "slow, emotional numbers with muted beats" [...] that accentuated the lyrics. According to Drum magazine, mid-tempo songs such as [...] "Thinking of You" [...] and [...] "Still a Man" [...] relied strongly on 1960s R/soul [...] "given a contemporary face", while up-tempo songs such as [...] "Lovin' You", [...] "Don't Fall in Love", and [...] "Let's Get Down" [...] had elements of funk.|$|E
500|$|Alabama {{has been}} {{credited}} with [...] "substantially broadening country's audience while {{becoming one of the}} most popular acts in American musical history" [...] by Michael McCall of The Encyclopedia of Country Music. The band was notable for its three-person lead (as [...] "most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band"), their collective hair length and facial hair (which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier), and their prominent electric bass and drums. They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups, and both played their own instruments and wrote their own songs. Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience, although their clean-cut image appealed to the more conservative, older country audience as well. Kurt Wolff described the band's appeal: [...] "They're just rebel enough for the young folks, but their parents also dig the boys' pretty harmonies, sentimental soft spots, <b>and</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> family values." [...] Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne, and also raised awareness for environmental issues.|$|E
