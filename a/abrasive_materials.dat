25|$|In {{the double}} toggle jaw crushers, the {{oscillating}} {{motion of the}} swing jaw {{is caused by the}} vertical motion of the pitman. The pitman moves up and down. The swing jaw closes, i.e., it moves towards the fixed jaw when the pitman moves upward and opens during the downward motion of the pitman. This type is commonly used in mines due to its ability to crush tough and <b>abrasive</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{hardened}} metal {{is usually}} more brittle than softer metal, through-hardening (that is, hardening the metal uniformly throughout the piece) {{is not always}} a suitable choice for uses where the metal part is subject to sliding contact with hard or <b>abrasive</b> <b>materials.</b> In such circumstances, case-hardening can provide a part that will not fracture (because of the soft core that can absorb stresses without cracking) but also provides adequate wear resistance on the surface.|$|E

A tungsten carbide cutter is needed, but the complex {{shape of a}} forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special drill bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has cutting edges of tungsten carbide brazed to a steel body; a center spur keeps the bit from wandering.|$|E

This can be improved {{with the use of}} snow tires, which have a tread designed to compact snow in a manner that enhances traction. However, the key to maintaining a roadway that can accommodate traffic during and after a snow event is an effective anti-icing program that employs both chemicals and plowing. The FHWA Manual of Practice for an Effective Anti-icing Program emphasizes [...] "anti-icing" [...] procedures that prevent the bonding of snow and ice to the road. Key aspects of the practice include: understanding anti-icing in light of the level of service to be achieved on a given roadway, the climatic conditions to be encountered, and the different roles of deicing, anti-icing, and <b>abrasive</b> <b>materials</b> and applications, and employing anti-icing [...] "toolboxes", one for operations, one for decision-making and another for personnel.

2500|$|Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) {{is among}} the hardest of all tool {{materials}} and is therefore extremely resistant to wear. [...] It consists of a layer of diamond particles, typically about [...] thick, bonded as a sintered mass to a tungsten-carbide support. Bits are fabricated using this material by either brazing small segments {{to the tip of}} the tool to form the cutting edges or by sintering PCD into a vein in the tungsten-carbide [...] "nib". [...] The nib can later be brazed to a carbide shaft; it can then be ground to complex geometries that would otherwise cause braze failure in the smaller [...] "segments". PCD bits are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and other industries to drill abrasive aluminum alloys, carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, and other <b>abrasive</b> <b>materials,</b> and in applications where machine downtime to replace or sharpen worn bits is exceptionally costly. It should be noted that PCD is not used on ferrous metals due to excess wear resulting from a reaction between the carbon in the PCD and the iron in the metal.|$|E
