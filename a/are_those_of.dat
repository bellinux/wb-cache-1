5|$|Bristol's {{boundaries}} are defined in several ways, {{depending on whether}} they <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the city, the developed area, or Greater Bristol. The narrowest definition {{of the city is}} the city council boundary, which includes a large section of the western Severn Estuary up to (but not including) the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.|$|E
5|$|Other animals Deinonychus shared {{its world}} with include herbivorous dinosaurs {{such as the}} armored Sauropelta and the ornithopods Zephyrosaurus and Tenontosaurus. In Oklahoma, the {{ecosystem}} of Deinonychus also included the large theropod Acrocanthosaurus, the huge sauropod Sauroposeidon, the crocodilians Goniopholis and Paluxysuchus, and the gar Lepisosteus. If the teeth found in Maryland <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Deinonychus, then its neighbors would include Astrodon and a nodosaur (called Priconodon) only known from teeth. The middle portion of the Cloverly Formation ranges in age from 115 ± 10Ma near the base to 108.5 ± 0.2Ma near the top.|$|E

5|$|Several other {{geometrical}} {{solutions to}} Apollonius' problem {{were developed in}} the 19th century. The most notable solutions <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Jean-Victor Poncelet (1811) and of Joseph Diaz Gergonne (1814). Whereas Poncelet's proof relies on homothetic centers of circles {{and the power of}} a point theorem, Gergonne's method exploits the conjugate relation between lines and their poles in a circle. Methods using circle inversion were pioneered by Julius Petersen in 1879; one example is the annular solution method of HSM Coxeter. Another approach uses Lie sphere geometry, which was developed by Sophus Lie.|$|E
5|$|Sideways {{curvature}} of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has {{been attributed to}} adolescent-onset scoliosis. Although it was probably visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, and would not have caused a hunchback. The bones <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a male with an age range estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E

5|$|The remains visible today <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> {{the stone}} bath house and mansio, built in {{approximately}} 130CE after Letocetum ceased {{to have a}} military function and became a civilian settlement. The settlement reached its peak during the 2nd and 3rd centuries and at this time occupied 8.1–12 hectares (20–30 acres). At {{the end of the}} 3rd century, the town relocated within high defensive walls astride Watling Street. After the Romans left early in the 5th century the settlement went into decline. The modern village of Wall emerged in the land once occupied by Letocetum.|$|E
5|$|Thorium borides, carbides, silicides, and {{nitrides}} are refractory materials, as <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> uranium and plutonium, {{and have}} thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels. All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen {{to form the}} thorium hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The hydrides are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.|$|E

5|$|Watersheds {{bordering}} the Bull Run River drainage basin <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the West Fork Hood River {{to the east}} and northeast, the Sandy River to the south and west, and the Columbia River to the north. Small Columbia River tributaries, each with a subwatershed {{bordering the}} Bull Run watershed, flow north from a ridge between the Bull Run and Columbia rivers. These include Eagle, Tanner, Moffett, McCord, Horsetail, Oneonta, Multnomah, and Bridle Veil creeks, which plunge over one or more waterfalls as they enter the Columbia Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Academics Reşit Haylamaz and Fatih Harpci {{say that}} Ar-Rafiq Al-A'la is {{referring}} to God. He was buried where he died in Aisha's house. During {{the reign of the}} Umayyad caliph al-Walid I, al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) was expanded to include the site of Muhammad's tomb. The Green Dome above the tomb was built by the Mamluk sultan Al Mansur Qalawun in the 13th century, although the green color was added in the 16th century, under the reign of Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Among tombs adjacent to that of Muhammad <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> his companions (Sahabah), the first two Muslim caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar, and an empty one that Muslims believe awaits Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Fossil caddisflies {{have been}} found in rocks dating back to the Triassic. The largest numbers of fossilised remains <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> larval cases, which are made of durable {{materials}} that preserve well. Body fossils of caddisflies are extremely rare, the oldest being from the Early and Middle Triassic, some 230 million years ago, and wings are another source of fossils. The evolution of the group to one with fully aquatic larvae seems to have taken place some time during the Triassic. The finding of fossils resembling caddisfly larval cases in marine deposits in Brazil may push back the origins of the order to the early Permian period.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Vicars' Chapel is {{rubble masonry}} however the south face {{which can be}} seen from the close is of white Conglomerate quarried locally. The shields on the wall <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Nicholas Bubwith, {{suggesting}} that construction was started during his reign as bishop between 1407 and 1424, and John Stafford who was bishop from 1424 until 1443 suggesting that construction was completed under his episcopate. The lower floor was a chapel, and a spiral stair led up to the library. The chapel was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Katherine. It is now used by the chaplain of Wells Cathedral School. The interior is decorated with 19th century gesso work by Heywood Sumner.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1899, Joan Gamper {{placed an}} {{advertisement}} in Los Deportes declaring his wish {{to form a}} football club; a positive response resulted in {{a meeting at the}} Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended: Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Josep Llobet, John Parsons and William Parsons. As a result, Football Club Barcelona was born. The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900; the prevailing Catalonia conception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> his home team, Crystal Palace.|$|E
