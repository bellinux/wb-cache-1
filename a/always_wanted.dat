And I said– jokingly, of course– that I wouldn't be in The 39 Steps unless the action {{included}} the famous chase scene in which Hannay is pursued by a biplane.

He comes to see Parker as the son he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> and attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails. Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage.

5|$|After being released, JJ terminates his {{contract}} with Dhingra's company, embarks on a country-wide tour for his concerts and finally morphs fully into 'Jordan' - the true rockstar, which he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to be. He turns into a bitter, arrogant, and lonely man after finding that the fame does not fill the void in his life. Khatana is now his manager, but fails to control him, and Jordan is constantly involved in fights with the media and fans. Inspite of all this, he remains a highly popular artist.|$|E
5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> {{the actor}} for the film, {{but he was}} always unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do it because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Forest won the European Cup with a 1–0 {{victory over}} Malmö FF at the Olympiastadion. They {{also won the}} League Cup again after beating Southampton 3–2; Taylor led the team out at Wembley as Clough felt it was Taylor's turn – they <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to lead their team out {{together}} but were always denied permission by Football League chairman Alan Hardaker. After this success Forest bought Asa Hartford and Frank Gray, though Harford was sold on after two months after Taylor realised his limited passing range did not fit Forest's style of play. Forest were denied a third consecutive League Cup win in 1980 after a defeat in the final by Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the film}} on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to call it Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Second World War, MacLaren's wife {{inherited}} {{a large sum}} of money which enabled them to live in comfort. They bought an estate on which MacLaren had a house built, and the couple were able {{to live in the}} extravagant manner he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted.</b> Around this time, on a visit to America, MacLaren made a brief appearance in the Hollywood film The Four Feathers, which starred his friend, former cricketer C. Aubrey Smith. In the 1940s, his health began to fail. He was hurt in a car crash and then contracted cancer. He died on 17 November 1944, aged 72; his wife died a few months later.|$|E
5000|$|To me, he's the {{greatest}} of all time. He's a friend of mine, and someone that I always watch and admire, because he <b>always</b> <b>wants</b> to improve, he <b>always</b> <b>wants</b> to get better, and he doesn't settle for anything less than the best. So, when you watch the best and you're able to learn from the best, hopefully that helps me get better. —Tom Brady, on Peyton Manning in 2011.|$|R

5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, {{but he said he}} gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
