40|$|There is a {{large number}} of {{existing}} buildings and new constructions in Slovenia, for which the owners don't know what energy properties their buildings are showing. In comparison to new constructions, the bigger problem are proving to be with existing buildings, where the problems are in obtaining information and details of the analysis for the calculation of these properties. The goal of the thesis was to design a web application which would be used by the general public that offers information about the energy performance of building, using the building typology. When designing the application, a key assumption was that the user supplies only information which is not already contained in existing public databases in order to facilitate the process of obtaining results. Precise details of buildings were obtained from the databases of the Geodetic Administration of the Republic of Slovenia. The obtained data were properly structured and a data model of buildings was designed, which the application offers to the user. A further procedure requires from the user only a basic description of the thermal building envelope. For example it is necessary to define the materials in structural elements of roof, wall and floor. Based on the data entered by the user and acquired from the model of buildings, the application seeks for a specific typical building, which is showing similar characteristics to the user one. We have made a thorough review of typical buildings from project Intelligent Energy Europe Tabula, which represents the latest building typology in Slovenia. The results of the project Tabula were used to design a specific procedure to search for a most <b>appropriate</b> <b>typical</b> building based on data specified by the user. This procedure takes into account the construction period of the building as well as building size. With all collected data, the building is first categorized in one of the six periods of construction and then on the basis of surfaces of structure elements and its heat transfer coefficient, seeks for the most similar typical building and assigns its energy indicators as a final result. We adapted the OntoWiki system to the algorithm requirements and made a prototype application. The last part of the thesis is a comparison of the actual data on delivered energy, derived from the E-TOOL, with results given by the application, with which we evaluated the nature of such allocation of energy indicators and gave reasons for the deviations. ...|$|E

All these pictures are designed as parodies that gently poke fun of this behaviour and seek to provide the target audience with some critical reflections on Instagram as media and they use it. The photos are complete with the polaroid colour filters and quadratic frames that is defining of the Instagram format, and were thought to appear to the target audience during their daily scroll through their Instagram news feed. Through an interview with a close-knit group of girls, we examined their use of and thoughts on Instagram as well as their reception of our preliminary communication product. We discovered - contrary to our preconceived notions about their behaviour on Instagram - that they are not self-centred individuals crying out for attention, but are in fact a strong, social neotribe in the Maffesolian sense. They value and document their togetherness through Instagram; they share their precious moments, their everyday fun and their collective interests and passions. Furthermore, we learned that the girls do all recognize the situations satirized in @opstilletelleroprigtigt and understand the intention of these pictures, but find the message irrelevant to their age group. They already see themselves as capable of critical thinking in relation to the polished world we see in different media contexts, but thought that younger girls might need our message to better navigate in the virtual worlds that highlight perfection and beauty while censoring away the normal and less-than-perfect parts of life.

Our experimental results demonstrate that compared to conventional approaches, our proposed marking mechanism improves fairness. Moreover, rate increase functions possible under the relaxed requirement reclaim available bandwidth aggressively and improve throughput in both static and dynamic traffic scenarios. I...|$|R

30|$|According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology (VanDenBos 2007), {{deviance}} {{is defined}} as “any behavior that deviates significantly from what is considered <b>appropriate</b> or <b>typical</b> for a social group” (pp. 276), while delinquency {{is defined as}} a “behavior violating social rules or conventions” (pp. 265). There is an apparent overlap between these two concepts, although the same dictionary defines juvenile delinquency as an “illegal behavior by a minor (usually identified as a person under age 18), including behavior that would be considered criminal in an adult” (pp. 510). This conceptual overlap is confounding and is frequently reflected in the measurement instruments used in research, with delinquency scales and deviance scales frequently having identical contents. Although the term delinquency is the most often used in the literature, it is closely associated with law-breaking behaviors. Given that our aim was to develop a scale that includes illegal behavior but also rule-breaking behavior that is not illegal, we considered that the term deviance was broader and therefore more adequate to our purposes.|$|R
