5|$|After the war, 53,000 Belgian {{citizens}} (0.6 {{percent of}} the population) were found guilty of collaboration, providing the only estimate of the number involved during the period. Around 15,000 Belgians served in two separate divisions of the Waffen-SS, divided along linguistic lines. In particular, many Belgians were persuaded {{to work with the}} occupiers as a result of long-running hostility to Communism, particularly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of the Soviet Union in 1941.|$|E
5|$|During wartime, Swift {{became a}} special constable with {{responsibility}} for traffic control.

During a visit by Schindler to Budapest in November 1943, they learned that he had been bribing Nazi officers to let him bring Jewish refugees into his factory in Poland, which he ran as a safe haven. This further encouraged the committee, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of Hungary, to try negotiating with the SS.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Parachute Brigade was {{the second}} {{parachute}} infantry brigade to be formed by the British Army in 1942; it was initially part of the 1stAirborne Division but in 1943, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of Italy, became an independent formation. As an independent brigade it was variously assigned at different times, and served {{under the command of}} the 2nd New Zealand Division, the 8th Indian Infantry Division, and the 1st Airborne Task Force.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Invasion</b> of Poland in 1939, Goebbels {{used his}} {{propaganda}} ministry and the Reich chambers to control {{access to information}} domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals {{for the remainder of}} the Nazi era. Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of Poland in September 1939, Hitler {{ordered that}} the Polish {{leadership}} and intelligentsia should be destroyed. The Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen (Special Prosecution Book Poland)—lists {{of people to}} be killed—had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939. The Einsatzgruppen (special task forces) performed these murders {{with the support of}} the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland. Members of the SS, the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces), and the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign. Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani people, and the mentally ill.|$|E

After the overhaul, {{she arrived in}} Leyte Gulf to escort reinforcement and supply transports and convoys. She dealt with daily air attacks, as the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the liberation of the Philippines. She departed Leyte Gulf on 2 December to the Palaus, where she later joined a Mindoro-bound convoy. She provided anti-aircraft fire for the convoy and provided cover fire for invading forces. She provided cover for two more days before retiring to the Palaus.|$|E

After the Japanese surrender on September 1945, Chin Kang Huay Kuan resumed its normal activities of running welfare programmes for needy clan members and organising cultural events.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of 43AD. This lasted only until around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion,</b> he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{homogeneity}} of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular {{times and places}} sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris. The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas. This style, known as Amarna art, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal governance system initially created <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E
5|$|German U-boat {{bases in}} {{occupied}} Norway operated between 1940 and 1945, when the Kriegsmarine (German navy), converted several naval bases in Norway into submarine bases. Norwegian coastal cities became {{available to the}} Kriegsmarine <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of Denmark and Norway in April 1940. Following {{the conclusion of the}} Norwegian Campaign (June 1940), the occupying Germans began to transfer U-boats stationed in Germany to many Norwegian port cities such as Bergen, Narvik, Trondheim, Hammerfest and Kirkenes. Initial planning for many U-boat bunkers began in late 1940. Starting in 1941, the Todt Organisation began the construction of bunkers in Bergen and Trondheim. These bunkers were completed by Weyss & Freytagg AG between 1942 and 1943.|$|E
5|$|Hess did {{not build}} a power base or develop a coterie of followers. He was {{motivated}} by his loyalty to Hitler {{and a desire to}} be useful to him; he did not seek power or prestige or take advantage of his position to accumulate personal wealth. He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Invasion</b> of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E
