5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire was {{perceived}} by the public {{to be the main}} RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower <b>attrition</b> <b>rate</b> and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E

5|$|The Government {{accepted}} the RAAF's recommendation, and delayed its decision on a MirageIII replacement until late 1981. This gave General Dynamics {{an opportunity to}} offer the improved F-16C to the RAAF. The capability of these aircraft was closer {{to that of the}} F-18 as they were equipped with BVR missiles. Richardson and another RAAF pilot test-flew F-16Cs in May 1981. The F-18 design was also improved during 1981, and was redesignated the F/A-18. When RAAF test pilots flew these aircraft during 1981, they found that the deficiencies they had detected in 1980 were now addressed. Overall, the RAAF concluded that while both aircraft met its requirements and the F-16 was less expensive, the F/A-18 was the superior design as it was more technologically mature, easier to maintain during operational deployments, and likely to have a much lower <b>attrition</b> <b>rate.</b> The Government accepted this advice, and announced on 20 October 1981 that 75 F/A-18s would be ordered. As part of this announcement, Minister for Defence Jim Killen acknowledged that the F-16 would have been seven percent cheaper to purchase, but stated that the F/A-18's lower running costs and expected <b>attrition</b> <b>rate</b> greatly reduced the difference between the lifetime cost of the two designs.|$|E

5|$|De Ferran {{remained}} the {{leader for the}} rest of the final lap to win the event. Bräck finished second, ahead of Castroneves who finished third. Da Matta took fourth, and Andretti finished fifth. Tracy, Vasser, Kanaan, Franchitti, and Servià rounded out the top ten finishers. Papis, Townsend Bell, Moreno, Alex Tagliani, and Bryan Herta were the next five finishers, with Carpentier, Shinji Nakano, Gidley, Jourdain, Gugelmin, and Wilson the last of the classified finishers. It was de Ferran's first victory of the season, his second on an oval track, and the sixth of his career. He became the eleventh driver to win a race in 2001, tying a record established the previous year. There were five lead changes in the race; two drivers reached the front of the field.

This thesis investigates the ability of models incorporating a number of economic measures to predict naval aviator <b>attrition</b> <b>rates.</b> Using data from 1978 to 1990, this study examined {{a wide range of}} potential economic explanatory variables and their effects on naval aviator <b>attrition</b> <b>rates.</b> The naval aviator data set was grouped into six populations, separated by aviation community (helicopter, jet and propeller) and by years of service (5 - 8 and 9 - 12). Three separate linear regression models for each of the aviator groups were developed, and their predictive ability evaluated. The study found that: no single model was best at predicting <b>attrition</b> <b>rates</b> for all groups; simple models using one or two variables performed better than complex, multivariate models; the most useful predictor variable was the national unemployment rate; <b>attrition</b> <b>rates</b> with the highest levels and variability were in the jet and propeller pilot groups with five to eight years of service, and the most significant models, able to outperform a naive prediction, were found for these groups [...] Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf later named the AV-8B among the seven weapons—along with the F-117 Nighthawk and AH-64 Apache—that {{played a crucial role}} in the war. In the aftermath of the war, from 27 August 1992, until 2003, USMC AV-8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of Operation Southern Watch.

5|$|Kanaan {{ran out of}} fuel on {{the final}} lap; he stopped his car between turns three and four. Andretti's {{strategy}} of four pit stops meant he was not required to conserve fuel and maintained his lead to win the race. Tagliani finished second, Fernández took third, Zanardi fourth and Dixon fifth. Tracy, Gugelmin, Papis, Nakano and Kanaan rounded out the top ten. There were four lead changes in the race; five drivers reached {{the front of the}} field. De Ferran's total of 49 laps led was the highest of any competitor. There were eleven cautions (a new track record) during the race for 31 laps. The victory was Andretti's first (and only) win of the season, his seventh at Toronto (which surpassed the record of most wins in a CART event whom Andretti previously jointly held by Al Unser Jr. with six), and the 41st of his career.

5|$|A {{study of}} coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B.aemula grew on ridges (dry heath) and B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet heath), {{and the two}} species did not overlap. Manipulation of {{seedlings}} in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the <b>attrition</b> <b>rate</b> was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E

5|$|With the Mirage2000 and F-18L rejected, the RAAF {{was faced}} with a choice between the F-16 and F-18A. Richardson and several other RAAF pilots tested United States Air Force (USAF) F-16Bs in 1979 and 1980, and {{reported}} that the aircraft had excellent performance but could be difficult to control at times. The evaluation team was also concerned about the reliability of the F-16's engine and regarded the aircraft as technologically immature. It was also noted that the aircraft's radar was inferior to that of the F-18A, and that F-16s could not fire the beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and long-range anti-shipping missiles that the F-18A was capable of operating. In contrast, the evaluation team was impressed by the F-18A, and regarded it as being a more robust and survivable aircraft as it had been designed to operate from aircraft carriers; these features were important for operations from bare bases in northern Australia. Richardson and three other RAAF pilots test-flew F-18As, and reported that the aircraft handled well, but had some deficiencies with its flight control system and engines; these were not seen as major flaws by the evaluation team, however. The F-18A's twin engines were considered to be its main advantage over the single-engined F-16, as research conducted by the evaluation team found that the <b>attrition</b> <b>rate</b> for single-engined fighters was twice that for aircraft with two engines. Overall, however, the RAAF judged that both the F-16 and F-18A were too immature for a decision to be made in 1980 as had been originally planned, and recommended to the Government that this be deferred by a year.|$|E

Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate. More than 60% of IAF's air combat losses took place during the disastrous battles over Kalaikunda and Pathankot. However, the IAF lost most of its aircraft on ground and the <b>attrition</b> <b>rate</b> (losses per 100 sorties) of the IAF stood at 1.49 while PAF's <b>attrition</b> <b>rate</b> was 2.16, because the IAF has larger number of aircraft with higher number of take off and landing sorties.|$|E
