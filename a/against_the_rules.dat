5|$|He {{also started}} a {{successful}} private company {{in partnership with}} the older and more experienced Michael Grubb, one of the directors of the SOIC and founder of the first Swedish trading office in Canton. They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> and regulations in the charter of the SOIC. Grill took advantage of the fact that his father was a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich mandarins.|$|E
5|$|The club {{achieved}} mid-table league {{positions for}} two seasons, {{but they were}} relegated in 1934 as a penalty for breaking amateur regulations. The club had paid their players a small sum of money for each game. Although <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> this was common at the time; Malmö FF were the only club to show it in their accounting records. In addition to relegation to Division2, the club suffered bans for the entire {{board of directors and}} twenty-six players. The version of events told by Malmö FF and local press suggests that local rival IFK Malmö reported the violation to the Swedish Football Association. This belief has contributed to the longstanding competitive tensions between the clubs.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} appointment, Ramon Perellos became {{very active in}} {{correcting}} cases of corruption and abuse within the Order. One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross by grace). This title implied that a graced knight could replace a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This procedure was not well reputed among elder knights who spent their lifetime {{at the service of}} the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring to return to their homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the Order. The pleas of Perellos to eliminate such prejudicial recommendations were considered legitimate by Pope Innocent XII who agreed to forbid them.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to define the prevalence and types of corneal astigmatism in relation with corneal optical power, axial length, sex and patient age. 641 cataract patients were included in a descriptive study. Complete eye examinations were included in a descriptive study. Complete eye examinations were performed. The data were analysed by standard procedures including analysis of variance, chi square test and multiple linear regression models. With <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> astigmatism was 55. 6 % in younger cases and <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism was 55. 6 % in younger cases and <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism was 43. 7 % in older cases (P< 0. 0001). <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism was 55. 8 % in older males and 34. 6 % in older females (P< 0. 0001). There was 0. 023 d decrease in kpol for each year increase in age 1 (P< 0. 0001). Axial length in males was 23. 35 ± 1. 79 mm (P< 0. 05) for second degree model to show relationship between astigmatism and axial length R 2 was 0. 019 and 0. 03 by increasing axial length up to 26 mm corneal power decreased, but further increase in axial length led to corneal power increase. For each diopter increase in corneal power there was 0. 1 diopetr increase in net astigmatism (P< 0. 0001). In corneal powers less than 45. 5 diopter {{there was no difference between}} direction of astigmatism, but in corneal powers more than 45. 5 diopter with <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism was dominated (P= 0. 01). younger cases had more with <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism andolder cases had more <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism was more common in older males than in older females. With <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism ratio shifted to ATR astigmastism ratio with age but there was no change in <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> astigmatism ratio with age. Males had 0. 22 mm axial length more than females. There was significant relationship between axial length and net astigmatism. Abnormal size eyes had more astigmatism. Emmetropization mechanism of cornea did not work for eyes longer than 26 mm. Myopia was related to total astigmatism.

President Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries.
