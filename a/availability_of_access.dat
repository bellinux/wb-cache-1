5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

5000|$|A new {{decision}} on January 25, 2011, the CRTC ruled that usage-based billing {{could now be}} introduced. Prime Minister Harper signalled that the government may be looking into such a ruling: [...] "We're very concerned about CRTC's {{decision on}} usage-based billing {{and its impact on}} consumers. I've asked for a review of the decision". Some have suggested that this adversely affects net neutrality, since it discriminates against media that is larger in size, such as audio and video.

50|$|There are two {{public access}} points to Kennisis Lake. One access point nears the {{southeast}} {{shore of the}} lake, while the other access point {{is close to the}} Kennisis Dam. The <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> opens the public to the opportunity of fishing on the lake. Kennisis has been stocked with thousands of lake trout since 1925. At all depths, the lake is well oxygenated all year round. This contributed to the optimal conditions for growth and naturalized reproducing of the trout population. Despite a lack of breeding sites being documented, natural reproduction is evident with reported fair catches of unmarked lake trout.|$|E
50|$|The key water-dependent {{or related}} sectors with the {{potential}} for meeting part of the current and projected demand for jobs in Africa are social services, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, retail and hospitality, manufacturing, construction, natural resources exploitation (including mining) and energy production (including hydro, geothermal and expected fracking for oil and natural gas). All these sectors depend to a varying extent on the <b>availability</b> <b>of,</b> <b>access</b> to, and reliability of water resources. Irresponsible water use by some sectors can create short-term employment, but result in negative impacts on the availability of water resources and jeopardize future jobs in other water-dependant sectors. Climate change, water scarcity and variability have direct impact on the major sector outputs and thus ultimately on the overall economy of most African countries.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{actuality}} films {{may have}} disappeared from movie theaters, actuality footage, especially from video, has had considerable {{impact in the}} digital era.

5000|$|New {{patterns}} of consumption were arising, especially with trading ships being able to navigate around Africa. Commodities that were once expensive were becoming more affordable. Products often define people in terms of gender, age, and <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>access.</b> This notion of social definition outlines the main theme of the explosion of commodities from 16th century and onwards. The exchange system had to do precisely with accessibility and availability of commodities on a grand scale. It {{is important to note}} that this was not just a European phenomenon. The Europeans were not the only people who developed a sensibility of how consuming different things could define their relationships domestically and abroad. In this context, there was a broader view of consumption and one’s place within the world. A person would consume in order to show off their financial position and their social location. Coffee is an example of a commodity that became more popular as Europeans [...] "discover" [...] it in Ottoman lands and experience it. Turquerie would not be just about furnishings, decorations, art, fashion, and clothing, but also what people put in their bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of relics in the Byzantine {{world can be}} seen from the veneration given to the pieces of the True Cross. Many great works of Byzantine enamel are staurothekes, or relics containing fragments of the True Cross. Other significant relics included the girdle worn by the Virgin, and pieces of the body or clothing of saints. Such relics (called contact relics, or secondary relics) were, however, scarce and did not provide most believers with ready access to proximity to the holy. The growth in the production and popularity of reproducible contact relics in the fifth and sixth centuries testifies to the need felt for more widespread access to the divine. These contact relics usually involved the placing of readily available objects, such as pieces of cloth, clay tablets, or water then bottled for believers, in contact with a relic. Alternatively, such objects could be dipped into water which had been in contact with the relic (such as the bone of a saint). These relics, a firmly embedded part of veneration by this period, increased the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the divine but were not infinitely reproducible (an original relic was required), and still usually required believers to undertake pilgrimage or have contact with somebody who had.|$|E
