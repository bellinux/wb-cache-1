This paper systematically evaluates the impact of such adjustments on indicators estimated from the EU-SILC (Community Statistics on Income and Living conditions) which is expected to become the reference source for comparative statistics on income distribution and social exclusion in the EU. Emphasis is put on the robustness of cross-country comparisons to alternative adjustments. Results from a sensitivity analysis considering both simple, classical adjustments and a more sophisticated approach based on modelling parametrically the tails of the income distribution are reported.

Actual airport {{policies}} may comprise both short-term (flexible) adjustments and long-term (rigid) <b>adjustments.</b> <b>Data</b> Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a standard tool to assess the relative efficiency. Two interesting approaches, namely Distance Friction Minimization (DFM) model and Context-Dependent (CD) model, are noteworthy here.

Likewise, CD model seeks to reach efficient frontiers in a series of steps. Stepwise DFM model is integrated of DFM and CD model.

Father-child conflicts contribute to children's problem behavior, while father-child acceptance and sibling affection contribute significantly to children's general self-esteem. However, contrary to previous studies no support was found for the association between marital relationship and sibling relationship, or for that between marital relationship quality and children's adjustment...|$|E

A direct thinning method is first applied to a synthetic data set in order to identify optimal data selection strategies. Experi-ments on synthetic data suggest that a thinned data set should combine homogeneous samples, and high gradient and variance of gradient samples for optimal performance. This result leads to the modification of our previously de-veloped Density <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Data</b> Thinning algorithm (DADT). The modified DADT (mDADT) algorithm is used to thin the AIRS profiles. Experiments are conducted to compare the thinning performances of mDADT with two simple thinning algorithms.
