5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E

African-American children and those living in old housing have also been found to be at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E

5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is the leading}} cause of death worldwide. Although there are a number of {{algorithms}} in use for determining the risk of coronary artery disease and thus predicting future cardiovascular events, the data available regarding their validity among the Saudi population are insufficient. Objective: We studied the validity of three clinical score systems in predicting a high risk population defined as having excessive coronary calcification: the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Risk Equation, the Framingham Risk Score, and the European Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation. Methods: We analyzed data from 462 patients aged ⩾ 40  years. High-risk features were if the Coronary Calcium Score was either > 400 or in the ⩾ 75 th percentile using Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) score. The scores for the three algorithms were then calculated using the participants’ clinical data. Results: A total of 87 (18. 8 %) patients were positive for coronary calcification. Among them, 60 (13 %) were classified as being <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> according to the MESA score. Analyzing these patients by the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Risk Equation resulted in nine (15 %) as being <b>at</b> low <b>risk,</b> 12 (20 %) <b>at</b> intermediate <b>risk,</b> and 39 (65 %) <b>at</b> high <b>risk.</b> The Framingham Risk classification resulted in 14 (23 %) being <b>at</b> low <b>risk,</b> 13 (22 %) <b>at</b> intermediate <b>risk,</b> and 33 (55 %) <b>at</b> high <b>risk.</b> The European Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation risk classification showed 24 (40 %) <b>at</b> low <b>risk,</b> 12 (20 %) <b>at</b> intermediate <b>risk,</b> and 24 (40 %) <b>at</b> high <b>risk,</b> with p <  0. 0001.
