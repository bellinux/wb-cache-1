50|$|Fitzpatrick v. Kelly, L.R. 8 Q.B. 337 (1873), was an English case {{decided by}} the Queen's Bench that adopted a strict {{liability}} standard for violations of the Adulteration of Food Act (35 & 36 Vict. c. 74, s. 2 (1872)). The defendant was prosecuted for selling <b>adulterated</b> <b>butter,</b> and {{the court did not}} require a showing of mens rea.|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 19 th century Dutch butter {{was losing}} its reputation. After the {{introduction}} of margarine about 1870, some dishonest merchants took the opportunity to sell an adulterated article as pure butter. Although the amount of <b>adulterated</b> <b>butter</b> was a small fraction of total output, it did great harm to the Dutch butter trade abroad. Many farmers were slow in adopting the more scientific methods of dairying practised on large farms in Denmark. The depreciation of the butter became a challenge for the government and for dairy farmers. Butter Control Stations under government supervision were readily founded {{all over the country and}} farmers who entered the scheme of supervision were allowed to use a government buttermark, guaranteeing that the butter was pure. A parallel control system was made for cheese production. At the same time, production methods were improved by agricultural education. The Government marks succeeded in greatly enhancing the reputation of the Dutch butter and cheese. About the beginning of the 20 th century factories gradually took over the production of dairy products from the farmer...|$|E
50|$|Some food {{manufacturers}} substitute {{less expensive}} {{materials such as}} {{vegetable oils and fats}} in place of cocoa butter. Several analytical methods exist for testing for diluted cocoa <b>butter.</b> <b>Adulterated</b> cocoa <b>butter</b> is indicated by its lighter color and its diminished fluorescence upon ultraviolet illumination. Unlike cocoa <b>butter,</b> <b>adulterated</b> fat tends to smear and have a higher non-saponifiable content.|$|R
30|$|Both beige {{and yellow}} shea butters {{prepared}} {{according to the}} improved Megnanou et al. (2007) method, presented the same fondant (soft) texture and rancidity-less and moderate shea characteristic odor. Such characteristics are conformed to usual consumers’ criteria about shea butter (Carette et al. 2009; Mégnanou and Niamké 2013 b). It is important précising about the studied samples that beige shea butter would be a natural (original) fat because of its water-exclusive extraction (Elias 2015, Jasaw et al. 2015). The yellow one, despite of the natural statute of Cochlospermum tinctorium dye, could be considered as an <b>adulterate</b> shea <b>butter.</b> Indeed, Cochlospermum tinctorium is exploited as medicinal plant; its roots aqueous extract would be drink {{in the treatment of}} many diseases (Diaw 1982). However, both beige and yellow shea butters of the present study with conform sensorial characteristics would constitute natural (BIO) available cheap and accessible edible fats. Moreover, the present optimized shea butters also exhale a slight sweety fragrance {{similar to that of the}} sweet almond oil. Such fragrance was not noticed by Megnanou et al. (2007) about the optimized shea butter, and could be justify by the improvement of the optimized method by avoiding the step of shea oil heating (for dehydration) which could destroy the volatile compounds responsible of the fragrance.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{detection}} of lard in cocoa butter through changes in fatty acids composition, triacylglycerols profile, and thermal characteristics. Cocoa butter was mixed with 1 % to 30 % (v/v) of lard and analyzed using a gas chromatography flame ionization detector, high performance liquid chromatography, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results revealed that the mixing of lard in cocoa butter showed an increased amount of oleic acid in the cocoa butter while there was {{a decrease in the}} amount of palmitic acid and stearic acids. The amount of POS, SOS, and POP also decreased with the addition of lard. A heating thermogram from the DSC analysis showed that as the concentration of lard increased from 3 % to 30 %, two minor peaks at − 26 °C and 34. 5 °C started to appear and a minor peak at 34. 5 °C gradually overlapped with the neighbouring major peak. A cooling thermogram of the above <b>adulterated</b> cocoa <b>butter</b> showed a minor peak shift to a lower temperature of − 36 °C to − 41. 5 °C. Values from this study {{could be used as a}} basis for the identification of lard from other fats in the food authentication process...|$|R
40|$|The {{authentication}} of {{food products}} from the presence of non-allowed components for certain religion like lard is very important. In this study, we used proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ((1) H-NMR) spectroscopy {{for the analysis of}} <b>butter</b> <b>adulterated</b> with lard by simultaneously quantification of all proton bearing compounds, and consequently all relevant sample classes. Since the spectra obtained were too complex to be analyzed visually by the naked eyes, the classification of spectra was carried out. The multivariate calibration of partial least square (PLS) regression was used for modelling the relationship between actual value of lard and predicted value. The model yielded a highest regression coefficient (R(2)) of 0. 998 and the lowest root mean square error calibration (RMSEC) of 0. 0091 % and root mean square error prediction (RMSEP) of 0. 0090, respectively. Cross validation testing evaluates the predictive power of the model. PLS model was shown as good models as the intercept of R(2) Y and Q(2) Y were 0. 0853 and - 0. 309, respectively...|$|R
