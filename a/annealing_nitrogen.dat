40|$|Quantum well (QW) intermixing {{was carried}} out by post-growth rapid thermal {{annealing}} in InGaAsN/GaAs QW laser structures grown by solid-source molecular-beam epitaxy. The intensity and width of the photoluminescence peak showed a dependence on annealing temperature and time, and the maximum intensity and minimum linewidth were obtained after the wafer was annealed at 670 °C for 60 s. The peak luminescence energy blueshifted with increasing annealing time, although it plateaued at an annealing time that corresponded to that yielding the maximum luminescence intensity. The diffusion coefficient for indium was determined from a comparison between experimental data and modeling, but showed that QW intermixing alone was not sufficient to account for the relatively large blueshift after annealing. Defects related to the incorporation of nitrogen in the QW layer were responsible for the low photoluminescence efficiency in the as-grown samples and were annealed out during rapid thermal annealing. During <b>annealing,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> interstitials moved to vacancy sites within the QW and thus suppressed QW intermixing.

40|$|The {{epitaxial}} growth and characterization of dilute Ga(1 -x) In(x) As(1 -y) N(y) films and quantum wells are presented. Starting with the epitaxy on GaAs, recent {{results on the}} local bonding of nitrogen in Ga(1 -x) In(x) As(1 -y) N(y) are reviewed, revealing that bonding of nitrogen is controlled by an interplay between bond cohesive energy and reduction of local strain. Thus, III-N bonding in Ga(1 -x) In(x) As(1 -y) N(y) can be changed from Ga-N to In-N by post-growth thermal <b>annealing.</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> loss due to the annealing process is not observed. We then adopted this concept for the epitaxy on InP substrates, which is equivalent to a drastic increase in indium content of the Ga(1 -x) In(x) As(1 -y) N(y) system and thus an extension to longer wavelength. The low-energy shift of quaternary pseudomorphically strained Ga(0. 4) In(0. 6) As(1 -y) N(y) double quantum wells upon nitrogen incorporation is reported. The deterioration of the photoluminescence characteristics in terms of reduced peak intensity and increased linewidth with increasing nitrogen incorporation can be partially compensated by rapid thermal annealing, which {{is accompanied by a}} blueshift with respect to the as-grown samples. Within the resolution limits of our secondary ion mass spectrometry experiments, no annealing-induced loss of nitrogen was observed even for the high indium content Ga(1 -x) In(x) As(1 -y) N(y) quantum well structures.
