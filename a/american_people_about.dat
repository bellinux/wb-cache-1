25|$|From January 1993 {{until my}} {{resignation}} from the United Nations in August 1998, I witnessed first hand the duplicitous Iraq {{policies of the}} administration of Bill Clinton, the implementation of which saw a President lie to the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> a threat he knew was hyped, lie to Congress about his support of a disarmament process his administration {{wanted nothing to do}} with, and lie to the world about American intent, which turned its back on the very multilateral embrace of diplomacy as reflected in the resolutions of the Security Council Hillary Clinton so piously refers to in her speech, and instead pursued a policy defined by the unilateral interests of the Clinton administration to remove Saddam Hussein from power.|$|E
25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E
25|$|When she {{got back}} to the United States she {{submitted}} a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should create a new State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state for}} African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s, and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.|$|E

Khánh said Taylor and the US would need to be [...] "more practical and not have a dream of having Vietnam be an image of the United States, because the way of life and people are entirely different." [...] He added that Taylor's [...] "attitude during the last 48 hours—as far as my small head is concerned—has been beyond imagination". Justifying the removal of the HNC, Khánh said they were [...] "exploited by counter-revolutionary elements who placed partisan considerations above the homeland's sacred interest."

500|$|More recently, {{some critics}} have reassessed the film positively, {{and it has been}} cited as 1943's [...] "great {{emotional}} drama." [...] Critics and scholars note that the film {{is a good example of}} the type of anti-fascist films produced in America early in World War II. Kevin Starr states that the film [...] "remains astonishing in its bold effort to shape American public opinion", and is a film which [...] "preaches a hard-line Popular Front message." [...] Robert Fyne, author of The Hollywood Propaganda of World War II (1997) notes the film's [...] "strong warning to the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> demagoguery, domestic fascism, and mind control, while praising the virtues of freedom of the press." [...] One film historian has concluded that Keeper of the Flame is [...] "truly provocative in that it was one of Hollywood's few forays into imagining the possibility of homegrown American Fascism and the crucial damage which can be done to individual rights when inhumane and tyrannical ideas sweep a society through a charismatic leader." [...] Other authors have noted that the film is different from other anti-fascist films of the period in that it clearly links wealth and fascism and points out the ways in which patriotism may far too easily be turned toward fascist ends.|$|E

25|$|By {{his second}} year in office, Bush was told by his {{economic}} advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed {{that he had done}} everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the Census Bureau reported that 14.2% of all Americans lived in poverty.

[...] In 2005, the Vietnamese Association of Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin (VAVA) sued 36 U.S. chemical companies for supplying the dioxin-laced herbicides to the Department of Defense. The suit was dismissed in Federal District court in 2007 and the reinstatement appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was unsuccessful. [...] The Supreme Court refused to hear this case and cases brought by US Vietnam War veterans in 2009. [...] Subsequently, VAORRC and VFP helped draft legislation to address the main unresolved issued surrounding the use of Agent Orange herbicides in Vietnam.

60|$|What I want to {{ask your}} {{attention}} to; at this point, is that Illinois and Missouri came into the Union about the same time, Illinois {{in the latter part}} of 1818, and Missouri, after a struggle, I believe sometime in 1820. They had been filling up with <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> the same period of time; their progress enabling them to come into the Union about the same time. At the end of that ten years, in which they had been so preparing (for it was about that period of time), the number of slaves in Illinois had actually decreased; while in Missouri, beginning with very few, at the end of that ten years there were about ten thousand. This being so, and it being remembered that Missouri and Illinois are, to a certain extent, in the same parallel of latitude, that the northern half of Missouri and the southern half of Illinois are in the same parallel of latitude, so that climate would have the same effect upon one as upon the other, and that in the soil there is no material difference so far as bears upon the question of slavery being settled upon one or the other,--there being none of those natural causes to produce a difference in filling them, and yet there being a broad difference to their filling up, we are led again to inquire what was the cause of that difference.|$|E
