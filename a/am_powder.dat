40|$|AbstractThe {{technology}} of Additive Manufacturing (AM) is an enabler for more eco-friendly lightweight aircraft parts {{due to the}} possibility to use the freedom of design. Since the process of laser beam melting is powder bed based, {{there is a huge}} influence of the powder quality on the building process. The most common process for the <b>AM</b> <b>powder</b> production is the inert gas atomization based on molten material. There are different process types which are mainly used for a large scale powder production. In order to analyze new or expensive alloys for the AM process, small and flexible atomization plants to produce smaller amounts of powder are needed. This work summarizes the required powder properties for aluminum alloys as well as the different suitable atomization processes. Current challenges concerning <b>AM</b> <b>powder</b> quality will be described and a new atomization plant concept for high-grade powder in small quantities, based on the process of thermal spraying, will be introduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} additively {{manufactured}} parts and their designed functionality (e. g. Bionic Handling Assistant) {{can be very}} easily impaired, taking into consideration the variety of parameters that are influencing the Additive Manufacturing (<b>AM)</b> <b>Powder</b> Bed Fusion (PBF) processes. Therefore a reliable in-line part and process monitoring {{as well as a}} real-time optimization of these processes are crucial, so that the products meet the required quality and safety standards in the different fields of application. This paper will discuss an approach to in-line quality control for the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process, one of the AM PBF processes. The first experimental results of the system will be presented...|$|E
40|$|While {{tribology}} {{involves the}} study of friction, wear, and lubrication of interacting surfaces, the tribosurfaces are the pair of surfaces in sliding contact with a fluid (or particulate) media between them. The ubiquitous nature of tribology {{is evident from the}} usage of its principles in all aspects of life, such as the friction promoting behavior of shoes on slippery water-lubricated walkways and tires on roadways to the wear of fingernails during filing or engine walls during operations. These tribosurface interfaces, due to the small length scales, are difficult to model for contact mechanics, fluid mechanics and particle dynamics, be it via theory, experiments or computations. Also, there is no simple constitutive law for a tribosurface with a particulate media. Thus, when trying to model such a tribosurface, {{there is a need to}} calibrate the particulate media against one or more property characterizing experiments. Such a calibrated media, which is the “virtual avatar” of the real particulate media, can then be used to provide predictions about its behavior in engineering applications. This thesis proposes and attempts to validate an approach that leverages experiments and modeling, which comprises of physics-based modeling and machine learning enabled surrogate modeling, to study particulate media in two key particle matrix industries: metal powder-bed additive manufacturing (in Part II), and energy resource rock drilling (in Part III). The physics-based modeling framework developed in this thesis is called the Particle-Surface Tribology Analysis Code (P-STAC) and has the physics of particle dynamics, fluid mechanics and particle-fluid-structure interaction. The Computational Particle Dynamics (CPD) is solved by using the industry standard Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is solved by using finite difference discretization scheme based on Chorin 2 ̆ 7 s projection method and staggered grids. Particle-structure interactions are accounted for by using a state-of-the art Particle Tessellated Surface Interaction Scheme and the fluid-structure interaction is accounted for by using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM). Surrogate modeling is carried out using back propagation neural network. The tribosurface interactions encountered during the spreading step of the powder-bed additive manufacturing (AM) process which involve a sliding spreader (rolling and sliding for a roller) and particulate media consisting of metal <b>AM</b> <b>powder,</b> have been studied in Part II. To understand the constitutive behavior of metal AM powders, detailed rheometry experiments have been conducted in Chapter 5. CPD module of P-STAC is used to simulate the rheometry of an industry grade <b>AM</b> <b>powder</b> (100 - 250 microns Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), to determine a calibrated virtual avatar of the real <b>AM</b> <b>powder</b> (Chapter 6). This monodispersed virtual avatar is used to perform virtual spreading on smooth and rough substrates in Chapter 7. The effect of polydispersity in DEM modeling is studied in Chapter 8. A polydispersed virtual avatar of the aforementioned <b>AM</b> <b>powder</b> has been observed to provide better validation against single layer spreading experiments than the monodispersed virtual avatar. This experimentally validated polydispersed virtual avatar has been used to perform a battery of spreading simulations covering the range of spreader speeds. Then a machine learning enabled surrogate model, using back propagation neural network, has been trained to study the spreading results generated by P-STAC and provide much more data by performing regression. This surrogate model is used to generate spreading process maps linking the 3 D printer inputs of spreader speeds to spread layer properties of roughness and porosity. Such maps (Chapters 7 and 8) can be used by a 3 D-printer technician to determine the spreader speed setting which corresponds to the desired spread layer properties and has the maximum spread throughout. The tribosurface interactions encountered during the drilling of energy resource rocks which involve a rotary and impacting contact of the drill bit with the rock formation in the presence of drilling fluids have been studied in Part III. This problem involves sliding surfaces with fluid (drilling mud) and particulate media (intact and drilled rock particles). Again, like the <b>AM</b> <b>powder,</b> the particulate media, viz. the rock formation being drilled into, does not have a simple and a well-defined constitutive law. An index test detailed in ASTM D 5731 can be used as a characterization test while trying to model a rock using bonded particle DEM. A model to generate weak concrete-like virtual rock which can be considered to be a mathematical representation of a sandstone has been introduced in Chapter 10. Benchtop drilling experiments have been carried out on two sandstones (Castlegate sandstone from the energy rich state of Texas and Crab Orchard sandstone from Tennessee) in Chapter 11. Virtual drilling has been carried out on the aforementioned weak concrete-like virtual rock. The rate of penetration (RoP) of the drill bit has been found to be directly proportional to the weight on bit (WoB). The drilling in dry conditions resulted in a higher RoP than the one which involved the use of water as the drilling fluid. P-SATC with the bonded DEM and CFD modules was able to predict both these findings but only qualitatively (Chapter 11...|$|E

40|$|Additive Manufacturing (<b>AM)</b> <b>Powder</b> Bed Fusion (PBF) {{processes}} open up {{new possibilities}} {{in terms of}} geometrically and functionally optimized parts and assemblies. Notwithstanding, the unpredictable quality and reliability of additive manufactured parts, due to e. g. geometrical deviations, delaminations {{as well as the}} lack of reproducibility are underlining the fact that quality control and quality assurance must be further developed in order to manufacture a product which is fit at first time for its designed purpose. This paper will discuss an approach to identify the overall tasks for an in-line quality control system for AM PBF processes. Starting from the quality management aspects for AM PFB processes, a method for the determination of the defects and failures detectable during the manufacturing process was developed and implemented in order to set the premises for an overall inline quality control respectively for an in-process monitoring system for PBF processes...|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{the optimal}} quality for Additive Manufactured (AM) parts does not only depend on setting the right process parameters. Material {{feedstock}} also {{plays an important}} role when aiming for high performance products. The metal AM processes that are most applicable to industry, Powder Bed Fusion and Directed Energy Deposition, use metal powder as raw material. Therefore, controlling the quality and correctly characterizing the particles used in the process is a key step to successfully apply metal AM techniques. A correct flow of the powder and a constant apparent density over the build plate/substrate ensure a smooth process, less porosity and better surface resolution. In the present paper a methodology for <b>AM</b> <b>powder</b> characterization will be proposed, based on parameters like particle size distribution and shape, and experimental results will be presented. A series of representative materials from the above-mentioned techniques are studied to find the optimal particle parameters required in the metal AM processes...|$|E
40|$|The winning {{entry to}} the open {{competition}} to design and manufacture a series of medals for the inaugural London Design Biennale, 2016. The theme of the inaugural London Design Biennale was Utopia by Design, which celebrates the 500 th anniversary of the publication of Sir Thomas More’s classic, Utopia (1516). The proposal was submitted on Jan 4 th 2016 to a panel of judges including, Sir John Sorrell (President of the Biennale), Dr Christopher Turner (Director of the Biennale) and Ben Evans (Executive Director of the Biennale and Director of London Design week). The panel awarded the winning design to me in February 2016. The proposal for the medal was focused on expanding my research work in 3 D Printed Metals working in partnership with Renishaw, UK. Previous research work had focused on 3 D printed Titanium and Near Net forming techniques. The research questions tested in the project were, 1. What affect does different alignment of parts within additive manufacturing systems have on the continuity, accuracy and quality of surface finish? 2. Can 3 D Geometries be successfully printed {{without the need for}} support structures on face angles above 45 degrees? The medal was extremely groundbreaking both for the artist and the manufacturing partner, Renishaw. It {{was the first time that}} the artist had created a fully finished multiple design using 3 D printed stainless steel. It was the first time that Renishaw had been able to achieve an almost completely enclosed hollow object without the use of any support structures. This relationship was mutually developed as the artist and technician both shared files and production solutions within propriety software designed for Additive Manufacturing. The medal material, Marine grade Stainless Steel was used for its conceptual relationship to Thomas More's debasing of precious metals in his book Utopia. This new <b>AM</b> <b>powder</b> had just been released and the research enabled complex geometries and thin wall section parts to be tested and provide case study references for Renishaw. The research phase of 3 D digital model making, prototyping and building in stainless steel using Renishaw's SLM 250 Additive manufacturing system took 6 months to refine to a level that matched the artists requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to fabricate parts composed of a nickel-based superalloy containing high levels of aluminum and titanium (NSAT) by using electron beam melting (EBM) additive manufacturing (AM) technology and utilizing thermal feedback from a multi-wavelength pyrometer to perform process improvements leading to near defect-free parts. EBM is an AM technology that utilizes metal powder to fabricate parts in layer-by-layer manner. A multi-wavelength pyrometer was implemented in an Arcam S 12 (Arcam AB, Sweden) EBM system to observe and record surface temperatures throughout fabrication. Temperature data from the EBM system and the multi-wavelength pyrometer were graphed using MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) to obtain temperature feedback leading to cooling rate determination with the ultimate goal of modifying EBM build parameters to fabricate defect-free NSAT parts. Metallography of fabricated parts was performed to detect defects such as cracks and porosity. ^ Nickel-based superalloy materials are of special interest to aerospace and nuclear industries due to their mechanical properties that allow such alloys to withstand severe operating conditions such as high temperature and pressure. Their best properties include creep resistance, high tensile strength, and oxidation resistance (Ekrami et al, 2006). However, nickel-based superalloy materials are susceptible to surface cracking during traditional fabrication processes such as casting due to thermal stresses during solidification (Wang et al, 2011). Processing of such alloys by utilizing an advanced manufacturing method such as <b>AM</b> <b>powder</b> bed fusion technology can further help control processing, reduce time-to-market, and reduce fabrication costs. NSAT alloys are challenging to process in powder bed fusion systems due to their propensity to crack during solidification or immediately after solidification. By minimizing thermal gradients throughout the part (e. g. by using powder bed fusion that preheats powder before melting), it was hypothesized that thermal stresses would be decreased which would lead to fabrication of parts containing reduced cracking. It was the ultimate goal of this research to determine if EBM could fabricate defect-free NSAT parts. ^ A main objective {{of this research was}} to fabricate parts from NSAT powder precursor using the EBM process. To achieve dense parts and continuously improve the system parameters in an effort to reduce cracking, a multi-wavelength pyrometer was externally installed atop an Arcam S 12 EBM system. The multi-wavelength pyrometer is a non-contact device capable of measuring the temperature of an object without the need of knowing emissivity, or the object 2 ̆ 7 s surface ability to emit radiant energy (Felice, 2002). To automatically determine an emissivity, the instrument measured the target object 2 ̆ 7 s wavelengths to calculate a temperature whose radiance curve is compared to an ideal Planck curve. If the curve matches, the target is said to be an ideal blackbody (emissivity= 1), otherwise the radiance corresponds to a non-blackbody and emissivity is automatically calculated to match a Planck curve. Since the Arcam S 12 system emits X-rays, the installation of the multi-wavelength pyrometer included a radiation shield to safely protect the operator from radiation exposure. The instrument allowed the characterization of the EBM process that consisted of various steps during fabrication (e. g., heating of the start plate, raking, powder distribution, and melting). ^ The EBM system parameter modifications examined included beam speed, beam current, beam focus, line order, line offset, number of repetitions, and the preheat cycle (all of which affect thermal behavior during fabrication). Systematic modification of these system parameters was explored to identify parameters that significantly reduce the amount of cracking observed in fabricated parts when compared to the initial parameters. Two major modifications were found that produced a significant reduction in cracking which included utilizing unidirectional scanning and performing multiple melt cycles. It was theorized that unidirectional scanning reduces the thermal gradient between hatch lines (due to the scanning pattern that inherently reduces localized heating) and that the multiple melt cycles re-melt the forming surface which has shown to reduce defects such as porosity (Medina, 2013). The work presented here showed the strategy for developing system parameters used, the improved parameters developed for reduction in cracking, as well as possible recommendations for future work. ...|$|E
