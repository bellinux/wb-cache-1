500|$|The {{second season}} was also well {{received}} by critics. Entertainment Weekly praised its [...] "vivid, vital, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> fun" [...] storytelling and, {{according to the}} Hollywood Reporter, the show made a [...] "strong case for being one of TV's best series"; its seriousness made it the only drama comparable to Mad Men or Breaking Bad. The New York Times gave the series a mixed review, criticizing its number of characters, their lack of complexity and a meandering plot.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were as positive. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "alternately deeply moving and really, really stupid". His main {{criticism}} of the episode was the it portrayed mental illness {{in a manner that}} was [...] "offensive at worst <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> idiotic at best". Furthermore, he derided the [...] "magical mentally handicapped person" [...] trope as [...] "cringe-worthy" [...] and cliche. VanDerWerff, however, wrote that the episode was saved largely due to the [...] "beautiful little scenes that let you see the weight of everything Scully's been carrying around her".|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut's {{works have}} evoked ire on several occasions. His most {{prominent}} novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, has been objected to or removed at various institutions {{in at least}} 18 instances. In the case of Island Trees School District v. Pico, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a school district's ban on Slaughterhouse-Five—which the board had called [...] "anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> filthy"—and eight other novels was unconstitutional. When a school board in Republic, Missouri decided to withdraw Vonnegut's novel from its libraries, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library offered a free copy to all the students of the district.|$|E
500|$|Not all non-video game {{publications}} {{gave the}} same {{praise for the}} game. [...] Common Sense Media gave it all five stars and called it [...] "a perfect game {{for a bunch of}} teenagers to play because it's wacky, fast-paced, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> fun." [...] However, Maxim gave it a score of seven out of ten and stated that [...] "With matches of five-on-five taking place on small fields with really basic controls, Strikers is classic arcade-style soccer, but the game gets an extra kick from power-ups, random Bowser attacks, and a Telemundo-style announcer." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it a similar score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "immediately likable".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} art of the series as {{detailed}} and distinct, with several noting the difference in the illustrations of The Cain Saga and Godchild. B. D. Gest's M. Natali wrote that [...] "one senses immediately how {{the art of}} Kaori Yuki has evolved and improved since [...] ". About.com's Deb Aoki placed the series on her recommended reading list of horror manga, commenting on the [...] "ravishing" [...] artwork and [...] "lush gothic details." [...] While describing the series as [...] "the manga equivalent of Twizzlers" [...] and the premise as [...] "ahistoric <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> silly," [...] Katherine Dacey of Popculture Shock added, [...] "Kaori Yuki's distinctive artwork and macabre sensibility make this overripe setup entertaining, even if the occasionally slangy dialogue and CSI-style forensics seem implausible in a Victorian London setting." ...|$|E
500|$|Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "A genuine {{moment of}} {{vulnerability}} plays stunningly on the meticulously layered 'Cold Case Love'". Writing for GQ, Will Welch declared the song as a [...] "sweeping, grandiose, almost ludicrously over-stuffed and endless album closer". He {{wrote that the}} song is [...] "epic, evocative, on-message (eat shit, Chris Brown) <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> catchy". Welch cited [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] as his favorite song on the album, while a reviewer for Rap-Up declared it, alongside [...] "Wait Your Turn", [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", as their favorite song from the album. Writing for Complex magazine, out of 26 Rihanna songs, Claire Lobenfeld placed the song at number 24 and compared it to the material present on Timberlake's 2006 studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds.|$|E
500|$|Run-D.M.C. rapped {{over the}} most sparse of musical backing tracks. In {{the case of}} [...] "Sucker MCs", there was a loud, Oberheim DMX drum machine, a few {{scratches}} and nothing else, while the rhymes harangued weak rappers and contrasted them to the group's success. [...] "It's like That" [...] was an aggressively delivered message rap whose social commentary has been defined variously as [...] "objective fatalism", [...] "frustrated and renunciatory", <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> [...] "reportage". Run-D.M.C. wore street clothes, tracksuits, sneakers, one even wore glasses. Their only possible concession to an image extraneous to that of kids on the street was the stylistic flourish of black fedoras atop their heads. This stood {{in sharp contrast to}} the popular artists of the time, who had variously bedecked themselves with feathers, suede boots, jerri curls, and red or even pink leather suits.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic Entertainment (Mar. 1995, James Daly): [...] "Midnight Stranger isn’t perfect, but if {{offers an}} {{intriguing}} glimpse of how multimedia games can move beyond glorified cartoons. The game can be gritty, frustrating, <b>and</b> sometimes <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> weird; but it delivers enough intrigue and hidden surprises to keep anyone interested...

500|$|Nathan Drake has {{attracted}} mainly positive reviews, many focusing on his likability. Tom Cross of Gamasutra called Drake a [...] "lovable jerk" [...] who is [...] "light, flippant, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> fun", {{calling him a}} perfect caricature of a scoundrel. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku remarked that: [...] "the short take is that Nathan Drake has attitude without being a jerk, and he cheerfully but woefully gets in over his head. This helps make him charming rather than annoying." [...] Comparing Drake to a similar character, Matt Casamassina at IGN claimed: [...] "Nathan Drake, the hero in Naughty Dog's Uncharted 2, is more realistic, funny, charming, likable and altogether human in 30 minutes than Leon S. Kennedy is through an entire career of Resident Evil games." [...] Rush Frushtick at UGO admitted that Drake {{may appear to be}} [...] "a dick", but that he was [...] "a likable dick". GamesRadar listed Nathan as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, contrasting him with characters like Halo protagonist Master Chief and Marcus Fenix of the Gears of War series in that unlike them, Drake is never in control of the situation. Empire also included Drake on their list of the 50 greatest video game characters, ranking him as 22nd. Nathan Drake is also seen as a PlayStation mascot.|$|E
500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{included}} on several music publications' [...] "End of the Year" [...] lists and critics' polls, including The Village Voices Pazz & Jop albums list at number seven. The album achieved commercial success with two hit singles and debuting at number-one on the Billboard Pop Albums and Soul Albums chart. It later {{came to be}} viewed by critics {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential albums. Christgau wrote in 2007 that the [...] "temptations and contradictions" [...] of commercial stardom consumed Sly Stone and resulted in [...] "the prophetic 1971" [...] album, [...] "its taped-over murk presaging Exile on Main St., its drum-machine beats throwing knuckleballs at [...] and , it was darker than the Velvet Underground and Nico and funkier than shit, yet somehow it produced two smash hits, including the stark, deep 'Family Affair'." [...] AllMusic described the album as [...] "funk at its deepest and most impenetrable," [...] stating that [...] "what makes Riot so remarkable is that it's hard not to get drawn in with him, as you're seduced by the narcotic grooves, seductive vocals slurs, leering electric pianos, and crawling guitars." [...] Zeth Lundy of PopMatters deemed it [...] "a challenging listen, at times rambling, incoherent, dissonant, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> uncomfortable" [...] with [...] "some episodic moments of pop greatness to be found". Lundy went on to discuss its radical departure from the band's past music: ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated {{it three}} out of four stars and commented, [...] "The movie is part farce (unplanned entrances and exits), part slapstick (misbehavior of corpses) <b>and</b> part <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> wacky eccentricity. I think the ideal way to see it would be to gather your most dour and disapproving {{relatives}} and treat them to a night at the cinema." ...|$|R

Sports talk shows are also very popular ranging from high-budget shows like The Best Damn Sports Show Period to Max Kellerman's original public-access television cable TV show Max on Boxing.|$|R
500|$|On {{its initial}} broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.998 million viewers. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, with TV Guide ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time". BuddyTV's Don Williams deemed the finale [...] "absolutely fantastic", and ranked it tenth {{on his list}} of the top Supernatural episodes {{of the first three}} seasons. Although he [...] "respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [...] deal"—the ending was a [...] "complete jaw-dropper"—he pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected. Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, TV Guides Tina Charles described the episode as [...] "creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> awesome", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki [...] "totally {{stepped up to the plate}} and knocked one out of the park", and Ackles was [...] "nine kinds of awesome". On the latter, Charles noted, [...] "From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all." [...] McCormick was described as [...] "creepy", leading to Charles' [...] "huge compliment" [...] of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone. For the critic, the [...] "totally unexpected" [...] Bon Jovi sing-along [...] "totally rocked" [...] and has [...] "instantly become a classic". Her main disappointment with the episode, however, was the lack of Sam [...] "going dark side". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the episode as one of the [...] "gems" [...] of the third season, and believed it likely to end up as one of her [...] "Favorite 'Supernatural' Episodes of All Time". The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson agreed, giving the episode a grade of A-. Although it [...] "got off to a shaky start with some weirdly paced scenes", it ended up a [...] "finale that wrapped us in sticky threads of old fears, mind-bending new business and one awesome Bon Jovi song".|$|E

The Huffington Post called the start of the second season [...] "far more elegant and engaging" [...] than that of the first, and appreciated the show's maturation, increased assurance and momentum as well as the visually improved settings and the new actors' performance.

2500|$|The {{increased}} attention {{for the film}} has also led to some news outlets to reconsider the mixed original reception of the film; Joe Queenan of The Guardian argued that [...] "No, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not breathtakingly self-indulgent <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> awful; it is actually jaw-droppingly great. Those of you who do not share this opinion are idiots." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V.
