5|$|To {{enter the}} whole wheat bread market, the bakery {{imported}} its own wheat-cleaning machine from Hungary; the machine <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be smuggled out since Hungary {{did not have}} diplomatic relations with Israel at the time. However, health-food consumers were wary of the first whole-wheat loaves because they were white, not brown. Working with the Health Food Association, Angel's {{came up with the}} solution of adding all-natural molasses to the bread to give it a brown color.|$|E

The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed. It was not until 15:00 hours that the relief effort was launched and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.|$|E

Even today several old Syriac {{documents}} (not destroyed by the Portuguese) still survive in the Malabar coast - proving they are older than the Portuguese arrival.|$|E

25|$|Until early 2010, {{the album}} {{was going to be}} called 18 Good Reasons with the album cover stylised to recall the Motown era. But the chance {{discovery}} of a photograph of 13-year-old Collins playing drums in the Getty Images library caused a change in direction, resulting in the album being called Going Back. In an interview on Today in September 2010, Collins noted he <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay for use of the picture of himself as the cover image. However, the 2016 reissue of the album will use an entirely new cover photograph featuring present-day Collins instead of recreating or reusing the original cover.|$|E
25|$|The {{arbitration}} {{began in}} the Belvedere Palace, in Vienna, at noon on November 2, 1938. The Czechoslovak and Hungarian delegations were allowed to present their arguments. Chvalkovský was brief and left the task of presenting the Czechoslovak case to Krno. Although it was explicitly demanded by Czechoslovak representatives, both arbiters refused to let Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and Subcarpathian Prime Minister Voloshyn participate. Ribbentrop and Ciano reasoned that only {{the representatives of the}} central governments could participate (namely Czechoslovakia in this case rather than the partially autonomous Slovakia or Carpatho-Ruthenia). They assumed that Chvalkovský would be more submissive and Tiso would complicate the negotiations. The negotiation was a formality and a new border was drawn after half a day. When the award was announced by Ribbentrop around 7 p.m., the Czechoslovak delegation was so shocked that Jozef Tiso <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be talked by Ribbentrop and Chvalkovský into signing the document.|$|E
500|$|U2 {{returned}} to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded {{better than they}} originally thought. They briefly {{returned to}} Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and said, [...] "It was something {{we had to go}} through to realize {{what we were trying to}} get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that we <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." [...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|E

500|$|Britten Austin tempers his {{praise for}} Bellman's realism with the {{observation}} that the effects are chosen to work in song, rather than to be strictly correct or even possible. Thus in Epistle 72, [...] "Glimmande Nymf", the memorable rainbow with its glowing colours [...] "of purple, gold and green" [...] is seen after nightfall. He comments [...] "Never mind. It is a beautiful scene, even if its chronology calls for much poetic license." [...] Or in Epistle 80, [...] "Liksom en herdinna", the farmer is for some reason going to or coming from market on a Sunday, when the market would be closed; and his cart [...] "heavy on staggering wheel" [...] must have been absurdly full if it contained chickens, lambs, and calves all at once. But {{it had to be}} a Sunday to allow Ulla Winblad to step out of her swaying chaise, on an outing from the city. Britten Austin remarks that [...] "until such solecisms are actually pointed out, one does not even notice them." [...] It is the same with the meals, which would cause [...] "terrible indigestion" [...] if the listener <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> eat them, but [...] "as a feast for mind, eye and ear they are highly satisfactory", the imagination filled with [...] "all the poetic wealth" [...] that Bellman provides.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis {{described}} Mukerji's {{performance in}} the 2011 film No One Killed Jessica as [...] "one of her best performances till date". The film (co-starring Vidya Balan) was Mukerji's first commercial success since Ta Ra Rum Pum, and was especially noted for being a success {{despite the absence of}} a prominent male actor. The film was a semi-biographical thriller based on the Jessica Lal murder case in which Mukerji played the fictional character of Meera Gaity, a foul-mouthed television journalist who is deeply involved with the case. To promote the film, she reprised the role of Gaity on the C.I.D. television series. In an interview with The Telegraph she said, [...] "It was such a different role to portray. It wasn't a role that was typical of a Hindi film heroine. Meera was more like a hero. It was a character that actually took the story forward. [...] Meera made a lot of things happen. It wasn't something that I had ever done before. I <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> play a man!" [...] Certain critics, however, were critical of her performance, including Anupama Chopra of NDTV, who called her role, [...] "the fatal, false note in No One Killed Jessica," [...] arguing that [...] "the character is written superficially and Rani's portrayal of her is equally banal. It's all about externals. She argues a lot and proudly labels herself a bitch but her hair stays perfectly in place and in the end, she even gets to do a super-hero-like slow motion walk." [...] Nonetheless, the role earned her several awards and nominations, including a third Best Supporting Actress trophy at Filmfare.|$|E

2500|$|The {{crisis of}} the 1990s was by some viewed {{as the end of}} the much buzzed welfare model called [...] "Svenska modellen", {{literally}} [...] "The Swedish Model", as it proved that governmental spending at the levels previously experienced in Sweden was not long term sustainable in a global open economy. Much of the Swedish Model's acclaimed advantages <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be viewed as a result of the post WWII special situation, which left Sweden untouched when competitors' economies were comparatively weak.|$|E

[...] Moring said, [...] "We wondered if our 'moral obligation' to warn Christians about the potentially disturbing subject matter somehow 'trumped' our professional commitment to avoid plot spoilers—especially the worst plot spoiler of all: divulging the end. After some discussion, we agreed that the right decision was to not give away the end to Million Dollar Baby." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{marriage}} equality at the time Rustin and partner Walter Naegle took an unconventional step to solidify their partnership and protect their unification. In 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time, in order to legalize their union.

2500|$|The night flying {{missions}} of the 8th aided in tallying up some incredible figures for locomotive and vehicle [...] "kills". North Koreans found it almost suicidal to move large vehicle convoys by day. When they did attempt it, marauding fighter-bombers, chopped the convoys to pieces. Moving large convoys at night seemed the only sensible choice, so the North Koreans began hauling their supplies {{under the cover}} of darkness. Rail traffic also took to moving at night, speeding from one tunnel to another until dawn. But night flying was a dangerous undertaking. The North Koreans knowing they had to protect their truck convoys placed flak batteries on hills and mountaintops that overlooked crucial road routes. At times, the gunners <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fire down into the valleys to hit the attacking B-26s. These flak traps could be deadly, and their plunging fire claimed many B-26 lives.|$|E
