This can be a particularly severe problem in studying reactions in liquids. An alternative approach is to slow down reactions by studying samples held at cryogenic temperatures, such as 77 K (liquid nitrogen) or 4.2 K (liquid helium).

25|$|<b>Activation</b> <b>energies</b> for fusion {{reactions}} are generally high because the protons in each nucleus {{will tend to}} strongly repel one another, as they each have the same positive charge. A heuristic for estimating reaction rates is that nuclei {{must be able to}} get within 100 femtometers (1 × 10−13 meter) of each other, where the nuclei are increasingly likely to undergo quantum tunneling past the electrostatic barrier and the turning point where the strong nuclear force and the electrostatic force are equally balanced, allowing them to fuse. In ITER, this distance of approach is made possible by high temperatures and magnetic confinement.|$|E
