5|$|Beach Thomas {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} the toothed steel trap for {{catching}} rabbits, supporting the RSPCA in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it both inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals such as domesticated cattle <b>and</b> <b>pet</b> dogs.|$|E
5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> scans) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or after the operation and {{is based on the}} combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.|$|E

50|$|Sims <b>and</b> <b>pets</b> {{have several}} {{different}} motives {{that they want}} to do. This could include needing to use the bathroom, or the litter box, or needing to sleep, or relax.

5|$|Stimulation-oriented {{treatments}} include art, music <b>and</b> <b>pet</b> therapies, exercise, and {{any other}} kind of recreational activities. Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the person's routine.|$|E
5|$|The tadpoles feed on detritus, algae, and bacteria. Tadpoles in more {{advanced}} phases of development may show {{a preference for}} vegetable matter, but also scavenge or become carnivorous on aquatic life. Captive tadpoles have eaten boiled lettuce <b>and</b> <b>pet</b> food in pellet form. If population density is high, tadpoles have cannibalised one another.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5000|$|People <b>and</b> <b>Pets</b> Dog Airlines LLC (doing {{business}} as PawFund Animal Rescue) was a {{company based in}} Houston, Texas. The company originally intended to begin for-hire flights transporting dogs and cats in 2015 after obtaining the required FAA certification. People <b>and</b> <b>Pets</b> operated one aircraft, a Cessna 150, based at West Houston Airport. The company asserted {{it was the only}} [...] "pet-only" [...] airline operating their own flights, as opposed to the now defunct Pet Airways that operated using multiple contracted air carriers. People <b>and</b> <b>Pets</b> began charity animal rescue flights on March 1, 2015.|$|R

5|$|Carrots can {{be eaten}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Only 3 percent of the β-carotene in raw carrots is {{released}} during digestion: this can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil. Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby <b>and</b> <b>pet</b> foods. A well-known dish is carrots julienne. Together with onion and celery, carrots are one of the primary vegetables used in a mirepoix to make various broths.|$|E
5|$|More recently, giant spiders have {{featured}} in {{books such as}} the 1998 fantasy novel Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling. This book was later followed by a motion picture of the same name, using the giant spider Aragog from the novel as a supporting character <b>and</b> <b>pet</b> of grounds keeper, Hagrid. In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a book about many of the creatures within the Harry Potter universe, these giant spiders are also known as Acromantulas.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI <b>and</b> <b>PET.</b> An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

25|$|Animals in {{the wild}} appear to be {{relatively}} free from eating disorders although their body composition fluctuates depending on seasonal and reproductive cycles. However, domesticated animals including farm, laboratory <b>and</b> <b>pet</b> animals are prone to disorders. Evolutionary fitness drives feeding behavior in wild animals.
