5|$|The {{name was}} {{painted on the}} {{aircraft}} on 5 August by Allan L. Karl, an enlisted man in the 509th. Regularly-assigned <b>aircraft</b> <b>commander</b> Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious {{when he arrived at}} the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now-famous nose art.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1945, Tibbets {{formally}} {{named his}} B-29 Enola Gay after his mother. Enola Gay had been personally selected by him {{while it was}} still on the assembly line at the Glenn L. Martin Company plant in Bellevue, Nebraska. The regularly assigned <b>aircraft</b> <b>commander,</b> Robert A. Lewis, was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious {{when he arrived at the}} aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.|$|E
50|$|During {{this phase}} the group {{received}} {{a substantial number}} of aircraft to replace those lost of written off. However replacements for lost crewmen were few and made by transfer of individuals. The influx of replacement crews from the Combat Crew Replacement Center at Bovingdon did not begin commence until March 1943 when the personnel requirements of Operation Torch were largely fulfilled. As the 91st developed combat experience, it experienced a decrease in <b>aircraft</b> <b>commanders,</b> apart from missing aircraft and wounds, from moving pilots into command and staff positions. Without an adequate pool of replacements, many co-pilots were upgraded to <b>aircraft</b> <b>commanders.</b>|$|R

5|$|The April 1942 {{reorganisation}} {{that created}} the Allied Land Forces and Allied Naval Forces also created the Allied Air Forces under Brett. Unlike MacArthur, Brett created a completely integrated headquarters, with a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officer, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, as his chief of staff. Each United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) staff officer was paired with a RAAF officer, with the senior staff posts divided evenly between them. A majority of command positions were held by Australians. To make up shortages of USAAF aircrew, RAAF aircrew were assigned to USAAF air groups, serving in every role except <b>aircraft</b> <b>commander.</b>|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the United States Army Air Forces on 19 March 1945, Bockscar was {{assigned}} to Captain Frederick C. Bock and crew C-13, and flown to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah in April. The name chosen for the aircraft, and painted on it after the mission, was a pun on {{the name of the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>commander.</b> It left Wendover on 11 June 1945 for Tinian, where it arrived 16 June. It was originally given the Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 7 but on 1 August was given the triangle N tail markings of the 444th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and had its Victor changed to 77 to avoid misidentification with an actual 444th aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{aspired to}} become an astronaut, and joined the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. In 1974, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in {{mechanical}} engineering, graduating with top honors. After graduation, he joined the U.S. Air Force. After flight training in Oklahoma, he was stationed in Alaska where {{he served as a}} F-4E <b>Aircraft</b> <b>commander</b> and NORAD Alert Force commander. During the Cold War, his duties included commanding squadrons to intercept Soviet military aircraft. In 1980, as budget cutbacks were reducing his squadron's flying time, Fletcher turned down a regular commission in the Air Force. He left the Air Force with the rank of captain, having received the Air Force Commendation Medal and the Outstanding Unit Award.|$|E

Shortly after take-off, the crew observed generator warning lights and loss of busbar voltage. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>commander,</b> Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison, climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. When {{it became clear that}} control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment crew to exit the aircraft and the co-pilot to eject, before ejecting himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan crew to successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Paul Tibbets, Spaatz and Curtis LeMay met on Guam on 7 August, the {{day after}} the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have a Fat Man bomb ready by 11 August, as {{originally}} planned, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if it could be readied by 9 August. Parsons agreed to do so. For this mission, Ashworth was the weaponeer, with Lieutenant Philip M. Barnes, of the 1st Ordnance Squadron as assistant weaponeer on the B-29 Bockscar. Walter Goodman and Lawrence H. Johnston were on board the instrumentation aircraft, The Great Artiste. Leonard Cheshire and William Penney were on the observation plane Big Stink. Robert Serber was supposed to be on board but was left behind by the <b>aircraft</b> <b>commander</b> because he had forgotten his parachute.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a light group, the 3rd Attack Group, {{equipped}} {{with a mixture of}} Douglas A-20 Havocs and B-25 Mitchells. This group was not just short of aircraft; it was critically short of aircrew as well. To make up the numbers the USAAF turned to the RAAF for help. Australian aircrew were assigned to most of the group’s aircraft, serving in every role except <b>aircraft</b> <b>commander.</b> In addition to the RAAF aircrew with the USAAF squadrons, there were RAAF units in the Port Moresby area. No. 30 Squadron RAAF, which had arrived in Port Moresby in September 1942, was equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter. Both the aircraft and the squadron proved adept at low level attacks. Also in the Port Moresby area were the 35th and 49th Fighter Groups, both equipped with Bell P-400, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters, but only the last were suitable for long range escort missions.|$|E
5000|$|Non-commissioned {{officers}} {{may be said}} to have {{charge of}} certain smaller military units. They cannot, however, hold command as they lack the requisite authority granted by the head of state to do so.

This distinction in title also applies to officers who are <b>aircraft</b> <b>commanders</b> ("pilot in command"), as well as officers and enlisted soldiers who are tank and armored vehicle commanders.
