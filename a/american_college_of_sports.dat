40|$|Objectives: Despite robust {{growth in}} {{participation}} in marathons and endurance sports among older individuals, guidance regarding pre-participation cardiovascular evaluation of these athletes is lacking. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the utility of currently available pre-participation cardiovascular evaluation guidelines as applied to a cohort of older novice endurance athletes. Methods: We applied data from 1457 novice runners and endurance athletes aged 35 [*]years and older to two pre-participation screening tools, the <b>American</b> Heart Association/American <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sports</b> Medicine Pre-Participation Questionnaire and the 2001 Working Group recommendations for pre-participation screening of masters athletes (2001 Masters). Results: Application of the <b>American</b> Heart Association/American <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sports</b> Medicine Pre-Participation Questionnaire identified 42. 1 % for which pre-participation cardiovascular evaluation was indicated. Of those who met criteria, 51. 5 % reported completion of a healthcare evaluation. Application of the 2001 Masters guidelines identified 75. 2 % who qualified for pre-participation electrocardiogram and 34. 0 % for pre-participation stress testing. Of those who met 2001 Masters criteria for pre-participation testing, 43. 7 % and 24. 6 % underwent recommended electrocardiogram and stress testing, respectively. While there was modest concordance with recommendations for pre-participation evaluations based on both <b>American</b> Heart Association/American <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sports</b> Medicine Pre-Participation Questionnaire and 2001 Masters, only athlete age was independently associated with completion of a pre-participation healthcare evaluation and only athlete age and athlete’s participation in marathons were independently associated with pre-participation stress testing. Conclusion: Among older novice endurance athletes, application of the <b>American</b> Heart Association/American <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sports</b> Medicine Pre-Participation Questionnaire and 2001 Masters guidelines identifies a significant percentage of athletes for whom pre-participation evaluation and testing are recommended. Concordance with these guidelines was modest and providers were primarily influenced by athlete age and competitive goals when planning pre-participation testing.

40|$|Syfte: Studiens syfte var att undersöka samband mellan hur universitetsstudenter skattar sin fysiska aktivitetsnivå och hur de registrerar aktivitetsnivå med hjälp av dagbok samt att se om de kom upp i ACSM (<b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sport</b> Medicine) och WHO´s (World Health Organisation) rekommendationer. Metod: Studien hade en icke experimentell, deskriptiv och korrelerande design där 26 försökspersoner, två män och 24 kvinnor, rekryterades via anslag. De fick först svara på en enkät och därefter registrera sin aktivitet via en 7 -dagars aktivitetsdagbok. Resultat: Studenterna ansåg inte att de hade en stillasittande livsstil och alla deltagare utom en ansåg sig komma upp till ACSM´s rekommendationer av fysisk aktivitet 30 minuter per dag av måttlig intensitet alla dagar i veckan. Trettiofem procent kom inte upp i WHO´s rekommendationer och av dessa överskattade 67 % sin fysiska aktivitetsnivå. Sextiofem procent kom inte upp i ACSM´s rekommendationer och av dessa överskattade 94 % sin aktivitetsnivå. Konklusion: Studenterna hade en låg fysisk aktivitetsnivå utifrån ACSM´s rekommendationer och majoriteten av de som inte levde upp till WHO och ACSM rekommendationer överskattade sin fysiska aktivitetsnivå. Det krävs dock mer omfattande studier för att dra några generella slutsatser då denna studie hade en skev könsfördelning och ett lågt antal deltagare. Keywords: Self-estimation, Perception, Activity diary, Physical Activity level, Overestimation.  Objectives: The main {{objective}} was to compare self-estimated physical activity level with the registration of physical activity level among college students. A secondary {{objective was to}} investigate if the subjects reached the level of physical activity recommended by <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sport</b> Medicine (ACSM) and World Health Organisation (WHO). Method: A non-experimental, descriptive and correlated design. 26 subjects, 2 men and 24 women, were included. A questionnaire was used to investigate their perceived level of physical activity and a 7 -day activity diary {{was used for the}} registration of activity level. Results: The students did not perceive to have a sedentary lifestyle and all subjects except one believed they reached the level recommended by ACSM. Thirty-five percent did not reach the recommendations of WHO and 67 % of these overestimated their physical activity level. Sixty-five percent did not reach ACSM´s recommendations and 94 % of these overestimated their physical activity level. Conclusion: The students had a low physical activity compared to the recommendations of ACSM and subjects who did not reach WHO and ACSM´s recommendations overestimated their physical activity level.   Due to the small number and adverse gender in the subjects, numerous studies need to be done in order to complete any further conclusions. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{predicted}} that life expectancy will raise sharply in future stages, especially in western countries. In fact, {{life expectancy of}} developed countries is currently {{over the age of}} 70. Aging implies a series of physical, psychological, cognitive and social changes that condition one's self-concept, creating adaptive strategies and the knowledge to maintain one's well-being in spite of the changes. Albeit aging is a natural and inevitable process, the benefits of physical fitness on physical and functional deterioration have been thoroughly confirmed. However, although this information is widely known, the majority of elderly people of these countries execute little practice of physical activity in order to improve their Quality of Life (QoL). In response to this attitude, the aim {{of this paper is to}} argue and justify that a healthy aging process is associated with maintained health, physical and cognitive function and social participation. It shows numerous research studies which demonstrate that integrated programs of physical fitness can provide benefits in a number of predictors of QoL, such as physical functioning, physical role, general health and social functioning, self-perceived QoL and mental components.

However, little is known about whether recreational walkers self-select a pace which elicits this intensity and how they interpret the term “brisk walking. ” Methods. The walking speed of 82 adults was covertly observed in a public park. Fifty-nine of these participants demonstrated their interpretation of “brisk walking” and the speed was noted. Eleven of these subjects subsequently walked on a treadmill at their observed and “brisk walk” speeds. Heart rate (HR), respiratory gases, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured. Results. Mean observed and “brisk” walking speeds were 1. 56 0. 17 m s 1 and 1. 79 0. 19 m s 1 respectively (P < 0. 001). Mean exercise intensities during the treadmill test (n 11) were 59. 0 13. 4 % VO 2 max and 67. 3 11. 6 % HRmax for the observed speed (1. 60 0. 24 m s 1).

In accordance with the <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sport</b> Medicine (ACSM) exercise guidelines for hypertensives, one group (N= 3) participated in a 2 - 3 days/week full-body resistance training program and a second group (N= 3) participated in a 3 - 5 days/week/ 30 - 60 min aerobic training program during a four-week period.

Method: Thirty five patients with stable CHF were recruited for the study. Each subject performed six minutes corridor walk and 6 -minute bicycle ergometry testing. The 6 -minute walk required the subjects to walk at a self selected speed on a 20 meter marked level ground for 6 -minute. All the subjects also performed a 6 -minute exercise on a stationary bicycle ergometer with initial resistance of 20 watts and increased by 10 watts after 3 -minutes. The perceived rate of exertion was assessed using a modified Borg Scale after each exercise mode. The maximum oxygen consumption was derived using <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sport</b> Medicine equations. Results: Result showed high positive correlation between distance walked in the 6 -minute and the maximum volume of oxygen (VO 2 max) (r = 0. 65, P &lt; 0. 01). The average distance walked was 327 m &plusmn; 12. 03 m. The VO 2 max estimated during bicycle ergometry was higher (13. 7 &plusmn; 1. 9 L) than during the six minutes walk (8. 9 &plusmn; 1. 2 L).
