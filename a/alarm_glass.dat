5000|$|As a ghost Marty travels by teleporting {{from one}} place to the other {{although}} he can seemingly walk as a human would in whatever location he is in. Although he cannot physically touch people or things (leaning against walls excepted) he can manipulate objects such as vases and furniture which prove crucial in many cases in putting attackers of Jeff at bay. In one case ("Just for the Record") Marty saves the trapped Jeff from a burning warehouse by using his concentration to shatter the fire <b>alarm</b> <b>glass.</b> Marty can also generate remarkably powerful wind squalls by simply blowing. [...] However, Marty can also be very jealous, and often jumps to conclusions. In the episodes [...] "Never Trust a Ghost" [...] and [...] "Murder Ain't What it Used to Be", he becomes enraged when it appears that his widow Jeannie has been unfaithful. While Marty possesses certain extra sensory abilities, his capability to understand situations where he is not present are as limited as a humans. In the episode [...] "The House on Haunted Hill" [...] Marty appears terrified of the ghostly noises in the attic of a deserted house, more so than even Jeff, and he doesn't appear to have any sense of other paranormal phenomenon when he can not physically see them. He also shows a subservience to the 1920s American gangster ghost of Bugsy in the eighth episode [...] "Murder Ain't What it Used to Be".|$|E

5000|$|The Geneforge storylines {{takes place}} in an era {{resembling}} the medieval time period, but {{with the addition of}} some modern innovations, such as wiring, levers and buttons, <b>alarms,</b> <b>glass,</b> and other steampunk-esque tools. The games involve a group of mages called [...] "Shapers", who dominate the game world due to their ability to create life as they see fit. The player character is cast as an apprentice Shaper in the first three games, as a neophyte rebel in the fourth, and as an unaligned amnesiac in the fifth. Crises in the game result from the Shapers' mistreatment of their creations while trying to ensure that their art does not wreak havoc on the world, versus the freedom of intelligent creations at the cost of said havoc. The player is left to determine what {{is the right thing to}} do, such as using mysterious skill canisters which may breed arrogance in the user in return for increased power.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the gender gap}} in wages of young adults in the late 1970 s, mid 1980 s, and 2000, {{in the middle and}} the tails of the wage distribution using quantile regression. We also examine the importance of school quality indicators in predicting future labor market performance. We conduct analyses for three major racial groups in the US: Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. We employ base year and follow up data from two rich longitudinal studies: the National Longitudinal Study (NLS) of high school seniors in 1972 and the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) of eighth graders in 1988. Our results indicate that school quality is an important predictor of and positively associated to future wages for Whites, but it is less so for the two minority groups. We confirm significant gender disparities in wages favoring men across three surveys in the 1970 s, 1980 s, and 2000 that are unaccounted for. While the unexplained gender gap is evident across the entire wage distribution, it is more pronounced for Whites and less pronounced for Blacks and Hispanics. Overall, the gender gap in wages is more pronounced in higher paid jobs (top 10 percent) for all groups, indicating the presence of a n <b>alarming</b> <b>glass</b> ceiling...|$|R
50|$|The hoard {{was brought}} to Gotland Museum where it went on public display in the Treasury (Skattkammaren) for the next 25 year. At first it was {{displayed}} in a custom built iron case with armored glass and in the mid 1980s it was moved to an ordinary <b>glass</b> <b>alarmed</b> showcase.|$|R
40|$|The {{boundaries}} between viewer and artwork are well established by gallery and museum conventions, and reinforced via the minimal yet authoritative presence of thin cordon strings, white lines {{marked on the}} floor, <b>alarms,</b> <b>glass</b> cases, raised platforms and gallery staff. Relational art overrides these boundaries, inviting the audience into the spatiality and fabric of an artwork, requiring the work to be viewed, experienced or completed only once the audience member is actively involved and participating. The work Sunset Video is placed within the installation C 20 th Mythological Beasts: At Home with the Locust People, the viewer is only able to view the video work by entering the physical space of the installation work, disrupting the conventional relationship between artwork and viewer, and potentially enhancing the viewers empathic contemplation. At {{the time of this}} works creation in 1975, video as an integrated component of a sculptural installation (at this time called an ‘environment’), was an innovation, as was video as an art form. The significance of the work Sunset Video is attested by its long exhibition history including: with C 20 th Mythological Beasts: 1975, West Street Gallery, Sydney; 1976, Three Statements on Environment, Ewing and George Paton Galleries, University of Melbourne; 1976, Post Object Show, Experimental Art Foundation, Adelaide; 1995, Sutton Gallery, Melbourne; as a video only: 2004, Sutton Gallery, Melbourne; 2005, Bellas Milani Gallery, Brisbane; 2007, Performance Space, Sydney. Additionally the work has been included in the inaugural selection of 20 Australian video artists for Monash University’s Australian Video Art Archive...|$|R
60|$|He was {{springing}} up to stop me, but {{was forced to}} drop back, and I {{made my way to}} the drawing-room, where my mother happened to be alone. She was much <b>alarmed,</b> but a <b>glass</b> of wine restored Clarence; and inspection showed that the thick trowser and winter stocking had so protected him that little blood had been drawn, and there was bruise rather than bite in the calf of the leg, where the brute had caught him as he was getting over the stile as the rear-guard. It was painful, though the faintness was chiefly from tension of nerve, for he had kept behind all the way home, and no one had guessed at the hurt. My mother doctored it tenderly, and he begged that nothing should be said about it; he wanted no fuss about such a trifle. My mother agreed, with the proud feeling of not enhancing the obligations of the Fordyce family; but she absolutely kissed Clarence's forehead as she bade him lie quiet till dinner-time.|$|R
