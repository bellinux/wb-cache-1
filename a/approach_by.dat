5|$|Additionally, {{several studies}} have also {{utilized}} oligonucleotide usage patterns to identify the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance <b>approach</b> <b>by</b> Willner et al. and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al. This latter study also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns {{can be used to}} identify genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats. Additionally some methods as TriageTools or Compareads detect similar reads between two read sets. The similarity measure they apply on reads is based on a number of identical words of length k shared by pairs of reads.|$|E
5|$|At Champotón, {{the fleet}} was {{approached}} by {{a small number of}} large war canoes, but the ships' cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not <b>approach.</b> <b>By</b> means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire, sailing as far north as Pánuco River. As the fleet returned to Cuba, the Spanish attacked Champotón to avenge the previous year's defeat of the Spanish expedition led by Hernández. One Spaniard was killed and fifty were wounded in the ensuing battle, including Grijalva. Grijalva put into Havana five months after he had left.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy IX was {{developed}} alongside Final Fantasy VIII, but {{took a different}} <b>approach</b> <b>by</b> returning to the more traditional style of the early Final Fantasy games. Consequently, Final Fantasy IX was influenced significantly by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to other titles in the series. It was released to critical acclaim and holds the highest Metacritic score of all Final Fantasy installments. It is often cited by critics and fans {{as one of the}} best entries in the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling over five million copies worldwide by March 2003 and five and a half million copies by February 2016. In 2016 ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{arrived at}} Maracaibo {{to find the}} city largely deserted, its {{residents}} having been forewarned of his <b>approach</b> <b>by</b> the fortress's troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, {{and some of the}} remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Elephant Point was an {{airborne}} operation {{conducted by a}} composite Gurkha airborne battalion that took place on 1 May 1945. In March 1945, plans were made for an assault on Rangoon, the capital of Burma, as a stepping-stone {{on the way to}} recapturing Malaya and Singapore. Initial plans for the assault on the city had called for a purely land-based <b>approach</b> <b>by</b> British Fourteenth Army, but concerns about heavy Japanese resistance led to this being modified {{with the addition of a}} joint amphibious-airborne assault. This assault, led by 26th Indian Division, would sail up the Rangoon River, but before it could do so, the river would have to be cleared of Japanese and British mines. In order to achieve this, coastal defences along the river would have to be neutralized, including a battery at Elephant Point.|$|E
5|$|The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes {{different}} factions {{within the}} state to collaborate on mitigation projects. This policy takes a more of a community-based <b>approach</b> <b>by</b> adding several groups {{for the purpose of}} multiple perspectives and inventive approaches. The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits for both parties. In example, if a partaking business were to add cool roofs, there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is beneficial for the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is beneficial for the business.|$|E

5|$|The aim of {{the game}} remains the same from its predecessor: {{complete}} increasingly difficult challenges {{to move on to}} the next race. The difficulty level is changed by increasing the top speed of the craft, through four different classes (Vector, Venom, Rapier and Phantom). The number of laps needed to complete a race also increased with each new class. Victory in the challenge modes is the game's ultimate accomplishment. These modes are similar to a championship where players have to race every track to become champion; however, rather than tallying up points, Challenge mode takes a very single player-centric <b>approach</b> <b>by</b> only allowing progress to the next track by coming in first on the current track. Players can lose the mode by losing all three lives, which are lost by finishing a race in worse than third position. By winning all the races, the player is crowned champion and given access to faster modes, new tracks and ultimately the Piranha craft.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Alien vs. Predator {{originated}} from the Aliens versus Predator comic book in 1989, and was hinted at when an Alien skull {{appeared in a}} trophy case aboard the Predator ship in Predator 2. Screenwriter Peter Briggs created the original spec screenplay in 1990–1991, {{which was based on}} the first comic series. In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002. The project was delayed chiefly because 20th Century Fox was working on Alien Resurrection. A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer John Davis, who hoped to give the film an original <b>approach</b> <b>by</b> setting it on Earth.|$|E
