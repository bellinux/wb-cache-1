50|$|Since 1990 {{many small}} private {{companies}} specializing {{mainly in the}} production of light sporting aircraft were founded. These firms are headed by very experienced engineers and workers, being former employees of big state owned <b>aeronautical</b> <b>factories.</b> Czech Republic became third largest manufacturer of such planes (after France and Germany).|$|R

50|$|In July 1918, Nobile {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with the engineers Giuseppe Valle, Benedetto Croce and Celestino Usuelli, which they called the <b>Aeronautical</b> Construction <b>Factory.</b> During this period he also lectured at the University of Naples, obtained his test pilot's license and wrote the textbook Elementi di Aerodinamica (Elements of Aerodynamics). He became convinced that medium-sized, semi-rigid airships were superior to non-rigid and rigid designs. The company's first project was the Airship T-34, which was designed for a trans-Atlantic crossing. When the British R34 crossed the Atlantic in 1919, Nobile and his partners sold the T-34 to the Italian military. Later the U.S. Army acquired the ship, and commissioned it as the Roma. The Roma ultimately crashed in Norfolk, Virginia in 1922 after hitting high tension power lines, killing 34.|$|R
50|$|After a {{combination}} of air combat losses, losses {{on the ground to}} enemy air attack on bases and the overrunning of airfields by enemy troops, after 11 days the VVKJ almost ceased to exist. However, continued domestic aircraft production during the invasion supplied the VVKJ with an additional eight Hurricane Is, six Dornier Do-17Ks, four Blenheim Is, two Ikarus IK 2s, one Rogozarski IK-3 and one Messerschmitt Bf 109 from the local <b>aeronautical</b> industry's aircraft <b>factories</b> and workshops.|$|R
