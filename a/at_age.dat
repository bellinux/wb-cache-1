40|$|Background Fluctuations in the {{national}} economy shape labour market opportunities and outcomes, which in turn may influence the accumulation of cognitive reserve. This study examines whether economic recessions experienced in early and mid-adulthood are associated with later-life cognitive function. Method Data came from 12   020 respondents in 11 countries participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Cognitive assessments in 2004 / 2005 and 2006 / 2007 were linked to complete work histories retrospectively collected in 2008 / 2009 and to historical annual data on fluctuations in Gross Domestic Product per capita for each country. Controlling for confounders, we assessed whether recessions experienced <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 25 – 34, 35 – 44 and 45 – 49 were associated with cognitive function <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 50 – 74. Results Among men, each additional recession <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 45 – 49 was associated with worse cognitive function <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 50 – 74 (b=− 0. 06, CI − 0. 11 to − 0. 01). Among women, each additional recession <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 25 – 44 was associated with worse cognitive function <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 50 – 74 (b 25 – 34 =− 0. 03, CI − 0. 04 to − 0. 01; b 35 – 44 =− 0. 02, CI − 0. 04 to − 0. 00). Among men, recessions <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 45 – 49 influenced risk of being laid-off, whereas among women, recessions <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 25 – 44 led to working part-time and higher likelihood of downward occupational mobility, which were all predictors of worse later-life cognitive function. Conclusions Recessions <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 45 – 49 among men and 25 – 44 among women are associated with later-life cognitive function, possibly through more unfavourable labour market trajectories.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{test whether}} {{mortality}} selection was a dominant {{factor in determining}} trends in old age mortality, by empirically studying {{the existence of a}} negative correlation between trends in late middle age mortality and trends in old age mortality among the same cohorts. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort approach was applied to period data on total and cause specific mortality for Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, in 1950 - 1999. The study described and correlated mortality trends for five year centralised cohorts from 1895 to 1910 <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 55 - 69, with the trends for the same cohorts <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 80 - 89. The research distinguished between circulatory diseases, cancers, and diseases specifically related to old age. MAIN RESULTS: All cause mortality changes <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 80 - 89 were strongly positively correlated with all cause mortality changes <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 55 - 69, especially among men, and in all countries. Virtually the same correlations were seen between all cause mortality changes <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 80 - 89 and changes in circulatory disease mortality <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 55 - 69. Trends in mortality <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 80 - 89 from infectious diseases, pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, symptoms, or external causes showed no clear negative correlations with all cause mortality trends <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 55 - 69. CONCLUSIONS: The consistently positive correlations seen in this study suggest that trends in old age mortality in north western Europe in the late 20 th century were determined predominantly by the prolonged effects of exposures carried throughout life, and not by mortality selectio...|$|R

40|$|Background. Smoking {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in {{young women and}} {{little is known about}} early multilevel independent risk or protective factors that are predictive of daily smoking in young women. Methods. Multiple logistic regression was conducted on data from NGHS, a 10 -year cohort study of Black (1, 213) and White (1, 166) girls recruited from three clinical centers in the United States, ages 9 - 10 years on entry to ages 18 - 19. Results. Compared with never smokers, White girls were at higher risk than Black girls of being daily smokers <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 18 - 19. Early predictors of daily smoking <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 18 - 19 years included lower parental education, one parent in the household, drinking alcohol <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 11 - 12, higher drive for thinness <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 11 - 12, lower behavioral conduct <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 11 - 12, and lower stress <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 10 - 11 and higher stress <b>at</b> <b>ages</b> 12 - 13. For both Black and White girls weight-related variables were significant. Stress, behavioral conduct, and one-parent household were also important predictors for White girls. Conclusions. There is evidence that childhood and adolescent factors are related to young adult smoking behavior. Body weight concerns as well as family, social environment, and behavioral factors are important issues in determining which girls will become daily smokers.
