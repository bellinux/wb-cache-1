40|$|Benign {{recurrent}} intrahepatic cholestasis {{is characterized}} by <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> cholestasis. The purpose of our study of 26 patients was to emphasize some features uncommonly or never reported in this disease: (a) in each patient, the <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> cholestasis were stereotypic; (b) <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> cholestasis were not associated with pruritus in 15 % of our patients; (c) the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> cholestasis during pregnancy or oral contraceptive use might be a fortuitous coincidence; (d) gallstones were found in several patients with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis and might be present earlier than in the general population; (e) in some of our patients, during <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> cholestasis, serum transaminases were very high, exceeding 15 times the upper limit of normal; (f) mild portal inflammatory infiltration was found in one third of our patients; (g) no treatment shortened the duration of cholestasis, {{and in a few}} patients, plasmapheresis seemed to diminish jaundice and improve biochemical disorders...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} who experienced 26 <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> acute pancreatitis were studied. Endotoxaemia, {{as measured by}} the limulus lysate assay, was present in 13 <b>of</b> the <b>attacks.</b> Six out <b>of</b> seven patients with systemic complications of the disease had endotoxaemia. C 3 catabolism was increased in all 26 <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> pancreatitis, and a falling level of C 3 during <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> severe pancreatitis was associated with a fatal outcome. There was statistical evidence of more complement activation in serum samples taken when patients had positive limulus lysate tests than when endotoxin was not detected in their blood...|$|R

5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 {{there was some}} {{confidence}} in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match. Larwood's active participation was curtailed by an <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> gastritis; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs.|$|E

5|$|An {{attack by}} sea across Lake Constance on Rheineck and Rorschach on July 21 {{was one of}} the few {{successful}} Swabian operations. The small Swiss detachment was taken by surprise, the villages plundered and burnt. A much larger <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> an army of about 16,000 soldiers in the west on Dornach, however, met a quickly assembled but strong Swiss army. In the battle of Dornach on July 22, 1499, the Swabian and mercenary troops suffered a heavy defeat after a long and hard battle. Their general Heinrich von Fürstenberg fell early in the fight, about 3,000 Swabian and 500 Swiss soldiers died, and the Swabians lost all of their artillery again.|$|E
5|$|As a child Juha Vainio was {{diagnosed}} with congenital heart disease, causing his lips to turn blue, and the onset of rapid breathlessness. He underwent a heart operation in early 1949 {{at the same time}} as his mother suffered an <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis from which she later recovered. Juha was at first kept in the adults' ward due to the serious nature of the operation, but later transferred to the children's ward to recover. He soon went home and began to get better.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Toshack was included, reinforcing the new ball <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> Lindwall and Miller and the off spin and leg spin of Ian Johnson and Colin McCool respectively. Australia bowled first, and Toshack took two quick wickets to reduce the hosts to 3/158 after a 137-run second wicket partnership. Toshack ended with 2/39 as Australia dismissed Worcestershire for 233. He was not required to bat as Australia made 8/462 declared, and then took 1/40 in the second innings as the tourists started their campaign with an innings victory, setting {{the tone for the}} summer.|$|E

5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> a second substrate.|$|E
5|$|Debate exists {{over the}} {{significance}} and {{outcome of the}} battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but {{they were unable to}} take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.|$|E

The game was released in Europe and North America in November 2009. The game was originally planned to use the Z moniker, despite starting with events that occur in Dragon Ball, but was changed to Kai to associate it with the Dragon Ball Kai revision.|$|E

Blamey charged him with responsibility for the next phase of Operation Cartwheel, the capture of Lae. Herring would command I Corps, which would be part of New Guinea Force, under Blamey and later Mackay. Blamey intended to have Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead command the subsequent phase of the operation, the assault on Madang.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E
