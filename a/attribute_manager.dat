40|$|Abstract The {{expansion}} of inter-organizational scenarios based on different authorization schemes involves {{the development of}} integration solutions allowing different authorization domains to share, in some way, protected resources. This paper analyzes different emerging technologies. On the one hand, we have two XML-based standards, the SAML standard, which is being widely accepted as a language to express and exchange authorization data, and the XACML standard, which constitutes a promising framework for access control policies. On the other hand, PERMIS is a trust management system for X. 509 attribute certificates and includes a powerful authorization decision engine governed by the PERMIS XML policy. This paper presents a sample scenario where domains using these technologies can be integrated allowing, for example, the use of attribute certificates in a SAML environment and the utilization of the PERMIS authorization engine to decide about the disclosure or concealment of attributes. In order to design this scenario we have based our work on a Credential Conversion Service (CCS) which is able to convert ACs into SAML attributes, and a User <b>Attribute</b> <b>Manager</b> (UAM) which controls the disclosure of credentials. These modules are governed by policies defining the conversion process (the Conversion Policy) and the disclosure of attributes (the Disclosure Policy). ...|$|E
40|$|We {{believe that}} {{globalization}} and its socio-economic {{implications of the}} world and world economic crisis {{is one of the most}} debated issues from several years. The publication "The Economist’’ named globalization as the most used word of the century. The most relevant dimension of globalization is the economy with the more dynamic factors: technological development, the hegemony of liberal conceptions (closely linked to the triumph of the ideology of market economy) and explosive development of countries or regions. Economic globalization has manifested a series of visible effects such as: the emergence of new markets and foreign trade (interconnected at global level), the appearance of: transnational companies, multilateral agreements on trade, broadening the scope of WTO, transformation of multinational companies in transnational companies and the emergence of global economic markets. Regionally, we noticed that the trendof concentration of economic activity is more pronounced and advanced in the European continent. Expanding globalization in Europe was achieved because of the fall of communism, and the neoliberal reformation which took place in Western European countries. Events like the fall of the Berlin Wall, followed by the fall of communism eradicated many political, economic, religious or cultural barriers. There were born new relations between state and market, public and private. European Union is, in our view, a regional office ofglobalization, representing the best performing integrative system in the world (by creating free trade area, customs union, common market, the Economic and Monetary Union). In terms of the European Commission,European model is a third way towards globalization, a middle path between protectionism and uncontrolled economy. To understand why the EU is an advanced approximation of globalization, perhaps a regional model of globalization, we must first understand the link between globalization and regional integration. Regional integration can be considered a preparatory step toward a global system, showing the need to solve the problem of sovereignty disposals as a member <b>attribute</b> <b>manager...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{book will}} help {{managers}} {{thrive in the}} ever-evolving workplace. Many managers are poorly equipped {{to succeed in the}} years to come because their knowledge base is too narrow and the environment they must operate in is becoming too complex. They are fed insights and facts on ever-narrow topics at work, through business publications, and often at university. Their world is becoming so complex that they need to broaden their appreciation for how business is evolving in ways that are normally considered.

40|$|Excerpt] We {{know that}} {{hospitality}} customers usually make purchases by simultaneously evaluating several criteria. A typical buying decision might {{take into account}} service quality, delivery speed, price, and any special buying incentives, for instance. It is imperative that businesses take into account customer preferences and choices when making decisions regarding product and service <b>attributes.</b> <b>Managers</b> {{need to understand how}} customers integrate, value, and trade off different product and service attributes. By the same token, information about customer demands and preferences must be incorporated into the design and day-to-day management of service-delivery processes. In this paper we describe a particularly effective way to determine those customer preferences and to assess the tradeoffs that customers make in considering various product and service bundles. The methodology we describe is discrete-choice analysis (DCA). After explaining DCA, we provide guidelines for incorporating customer-preference information into the design and management of business processes. The DCA approach provides a robust and systematic way to identify the implied relative weights and attribute trade-offs revealed by decision makers 2 ̆ 7 choices (whether customers or managers) ...|$|R

40|$|Companies with {{different}} attributes are managed by executives {{with different}} skill sets. This sorting of managers to firms {{contributes to the}} substantial variation in cor-porate outcomes as well as executive compensation. This paper shows that job-matches are driven by complementarities in firm <b>attributes</b> and <b>manager</b> <b>attributes.</b> In a struc-tural estimation of the primitives governing the executive labor market, two empirically unexplored matching dimensions- the complementarities between the firm’s degree of diversification and the manager’s cross-industry experience, and the complementari-ties between the firm’s research intensity and the manager’s innovation propensity-are more value-relevant than the previously studied complementarities between firm size and managerial talent. Further, attributes of the active firms and managers im-pact both their bargaining powers and payoffs. In particular, higher matching quality is associated with both better subsequent firm performance, measured by Tobin’s Q, and longer executive tenure duration. Financial markets also capture the information content on matching quality when senior executive appointments are announced, in that investors react much more positively to better executive-firm matches...|$|R

Results indicate that <b>manager</b> <b>attribute</b> average performers' feedback seeking significantly less to performance-enhancement motives than superior performers' seeking.

40|$|This is {{comparison}} of methods study, {{to determine which}} method (Importance Performance Analysis or SERVQUAL) would produce the most relevant gaps analysis attuned {{to the needs of}} restaurant managers in Poland and the USA. This work continues the author 2 ̆ 7 s research from 2008 when they used the Importance Performance Analysis technique to compare actual experience data with what customers had expected, in two different sample populations, (Poland and the USA). This paper is empirical and involves data from 200 restaurant visits in Poland and the USA. The sampling unit consists of 50 urban casual restaurants (25 per country), with each restaurant visited 4 times by different trained mystery shoppers, half using the SERVQUAL method and half using the IPA method. Quantitative analysis will be performed within both the IPA and SERVQUAL techniques. SERVQUAL gap analysis seemed to suggest that results from Poland and the USA are similar. However, IPA grids revealed the most important differences between customer 2 ̆ 7 s expectations (importance) and their experiences (performance). Methods like SERVQUAL are useful in comparing restaurant groups (such as cross culturally). However, the IPA method is a better way to analyze quality of service in individual restaurant enterprises, with its prioritized list of <b>attributes</b> <b>managers</b> can identify and address in training to reduce the gap between customer 2 ̆ 7 s expectations and their experiences.

The dynamic model that we use to estimate the relative importance of the components in the decomposition is a generalization of the performance evaluation models by Lockwood and Kadiyala (1988) and Ferson and Schadt (1996). We find that the restrictions imposed in existing models may lead to different inferences about manager selectivity and timing skill. The results from our sample of 78 asset allocation mutual funds indicate that several funds exhibit significant expert market timing, but for most funds variation in market exposures does not yield any economically significant return. Funds with high turnover and expense ratios are associated with managers with better skills...|$|R
