The aim {{of the study is}} to present a coherent review of the extant literature on factors affecting the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> people with <b>disabilities</b> in regular employment. METHOD: We conducted a search of the electronic databases PsychINFO and Web of Science (period: 1996 - 2011) supplemented with a search for additional relevant articles by means of cross-referencing. In total 48 articles were selected, coded and analyzed by three coders into three overarching themes.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} mothers’ attitude and self-esteem among deaf children who are currently enrolled in deaf high schools in Iran. While family system theory is typically used in trying counseling and therapy, much {{can be learned from}} examining it by studying the relationship between deaf children and their mothers. Family systems theory has been used in trying to understand problems of communication between children and their families (Widerman, 1995). In general, attention with some significant findings has been focused on environmental factors such as parenting, communication at home, and type of schooling as potential contributors to self-esteem (Crocker, 2008). However, the role of other variables such as family’s attitude has not been systematically explored. This implies that the picture is far from complete. It is also not clear what kind of factors effect on deaf children’s self-esteem. Henceforth, {{the findings of this study}} may be helpful in the development of curriculum goals for increasing self-esteem in deaf children. Counselors and social workers can do much to promote positive family relationships as well as <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> in deaf children. The sample consisted of 200 deaf children (100 boys and 100 girls) and 200 normal-hearing mothers. The study was conducted at deaf high schools in Iran. Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, Parental Attitudes towards Deafness and interviews Scale were used. The results showed that a relationship existed between mothers’ attitude and deaf children’s self-esteem. Additionally, according to the Pearson correlation test, there is a relationship between the mothers’ attitudes and self-esteem in deaf children. Children whose mothers ably communicated had higher self-esteem scores than their counterparts whose mothers could not ably communicate. The findings of this study may be helpful in the development of curriculum goals for increase of self-esteem in deaf children. Counselors can do much to promote positive family relationships as well as <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> in deaf children. Also, these findings may expand our understanding of the characteristics of deaf children’s self-esteem and their families’ attitudes.

40|$|Due to {{increased}} life expectancy, {{the number of}} older Australians with a long-term disability, such as intellectual disability is increasing. More people with disability are facing retirement. People with intellectual disability can be reluctant to leave their familiar work environment, and may {{find it hard to}} envisage life in retirement. Older people with an intellectual disability meet significant barriers to enjoying an active retirement. This Policy Bulletin describes the implementation and evaluation of the Transition to Retirement (TTR) Program that was examined in a three-year collaborative program of applied research involving university researchers and disability service providers. The Program sought to involve older Australians with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities {{in the creation of a}} ‘retirement lifestyle’. The TTR Program engaged 27 participants, the majority of whom lived in disability-specific housing, in community-based social activities, such as gardening, walking, and knitting. The Policy Bulletin found that older Australians with disabilities are often prevented from engaging in these social activities, due to a lack of transportation, limited social groups, and limited ties to the community. The Policy Bulletin demonstrates that the TTR Program increased the number of acquaintances and social satisfaction of participants, and resulted in decreased working hours. The Program was also linked to an increase in awareness and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> among members <b>of</b> the community who participated in the Program as mentors. The Policy Bulletin concludes by suggesting that the Program should be scaled up in order to assess its success in wide-scale adoption.

This paper investigates the role of family environment, caregiver characteristics, and personal resources in the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> and depressive feelings of persons with orthopedic disability. Participants and procedure Data were collected from 161 Turkish people with orthopedic disability (mean age = 35. 60 years, SD = 10. 18) and their family caregivers (e. g., parent, spouse). The participants with disability completed scales for functional independence, <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability,</b> family environment, locus of control, learned resourcefulness, and depression. The family caregivers completed measures of social support, their own depression, burden of caregiving, and acceptance-rejection of their care recipient. Results Analyses via multivariate statistics and SEM showed that depressive feelings of individuals with orthopedic disability and their acceptance of the disability were predicted by multiple factors, including the affected persons’ learned resourcefulness and locus of control, family environment, and interactions with their family caregiver, but not by their functional independence. Conclusions Overall, a supportive family environment and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> appear to {{lower the risk of}} having depression for individuals with orthopedic disability.

50|$|Wright’s most {{prominent}} work “Physical Disability - A Psychosocial Approach Second Edition” is wide in scope as it addresses many components <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> physical <b>disability</b> on personal and societal levels. Wright contrasts coping and succumbing {{as the two}} frameworks from which one approaches disability. She also presents a stage model of psychosocial adjustment to disability, by presenting the four major changes. The four changes are enlargement of scope, subordination of the physique, containment <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> effects, and transformation from comparative to asset values. Enlargement of scope includes the individual recognizing values separate from the disability, the individual will begin to acknowledge areas of skill that are not affected by the disability and while the four changes are not necessarily a phase model, this is typically the first change to occur. A second change Wright dubs the “subordination of the physique”. In this phase the individual begins to limit the importance of physical appearance {{as a source of}} identity; often the person will increase the emphasis on personality or personal traits which are not connected to the disability. The third component is containment <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> effects, which is when the individual views the disability as affecting only the parts of them which it actually affects instead of generalizing any limitations to other areas of the individual. Finally, there is a transformation from comparative to asset values in which the individual ceases using others as a comparison for success of value and focuses more on one’s on intrinsic values.|$|R

Methods: 262 CKD patients without dialysis at a hospital in Taiwan were consecutively recruited, from 2010 to 2011, and followed up for 3 years. At enrollment, demographic and clinical data were obtained, including baseline level measurement of AOD, using the <b>Acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Disability</b> Scale-Revised (AODS-R). During follow-up, the authors assessed the effect of AOD on progression to dialysis and all-cause mortality by using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: Of the patients included in the analyses, 145 (55. 3 %) whose total scores of AOD were below the median (86. 00) were regarded as having low AOD at enrollment. At the end of 3 -year follow-up, 25 have died and 57 initiated dialysis. Participants with low AOD {{were more likely to have}} the composite end-point of progression to dialysis or death (adjusted hazard ratios [AHR] = 1. 89, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 18 - 3. 20). In addition, CKD stage at IV or above and hemoglobin level were found to be associated with the occurrence of the composite end-point. Conclusion: AOD was associated with an increased risk for poor clinical outcomes, thus suggesting that prompt awareness and management of the psychological reactions may improve clinical outcomes of patients with CKD...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{we examined the}} process of self-understanding <b>of</b> one' s <b>disabilities</b> in a high-functioning autistic child from his childhood to adolescence. In this study, we attempted to clarify the process <b>of</b> parent' s <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> their children,s <b>disability</b> <b>of</b> children with high-functioning autism to be from infantile period to adolescence. Our study is also concerned with what kind of support is helpful to high-functioning autistic children and their parents. A total of 11 mothers of children with high-functioning autistic children participated in this study. The 11 autistic children had been diagnosed according to currently used criteria（DSMIV, 1994 ）. The age of these children was from 6 -years-old to 19 -years-old. We are supporting these children in our remedial education class for disability or educational guidance. These mothers gave retrospective answers to a written questionnaire {{with the process of}} acceptanceof their children' s disabilities. The results indicated that the process <b>of</b> parental <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> their children' s disabilities involves various factors, such as the characteristics of the child' s disability and the availability of support, and that it is important for us to look at the process <b>of</b> parent' s <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> autistic children in relation to their children' s developmental critical period. On the basis of these results, we discussed the appropriate support for parents. We emphasized that we shoud be aware of the process of the psychological adjustment of the parents, particularly in case <b>of</b> mild developmental <b>disabilities</b> such as high-functioning autistic child...|$|R
40|$|Professionals on IEP teams {{increasingly}} are considering the potential contributions of assistive technology as they develop programs {{for students with}} disabilities. However, a significant technological “generational gap” may exist between the members of these teams and the young people they seek to serve, as {{the quality and quantity}} of student interactions with technology may differ dramatically from those of IEP team members. This gap may manifest itself in the selections of technology that may impair social <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> students with <b>disabilities</b> by their peers, or that students will not use. In this paper we suggest a variety of both low-tech and high-tech tools that hold unique dual promise to (a) facilitate successful access to the general education curriculum, and (b) enhance social acceptance by nondisabled peers...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is designed to}} consider the concept of Quality of Life (QOL) for people with severely/profoundly motor and intellectual disabilities. This paper aims to clarify the condition of their QOL from information of parents as their care givers. The 7 subjects, who have profound motor and intellectual disabilities within the Ohoshima's classification from 1 to 4, are school leavers at the stage of youth or adulthood. As it is too difficult for subjects to express their feeling of QOL because <b>of</b> their profound <b>disabilities,</b> data are collected from semi-structured interviews with 6 mothers {{and a pair of}} mother and father, who are parents of the subject and belong to the parents association for children/people with physical disabilities in A prefecture. The acquired data are analyzed by the contents of discourse and classified by the categories from the viewpoints of QOL. The results are showed by case studies {{in the context of the}} actual situation of each subjects. The case studies suggest that QOL of people with profound <b>disabilities</b> consists <b>of</b> several basic elements, especially parents' <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> their <b>disabilities,</b> effects <b>of</b> school education, relationships in the family, parents' wishes for future life and separation, their living condition and social support...|$|R
