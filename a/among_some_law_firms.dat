5000|$|Lockstep {{compensation}} {{is a system}} of remuneration in which the employees' salaries are based purely on their seniority within the organization. For example, in the legal profession, where this system is most commonly found, all law school graduates hired by a <b>law</b> <b>firm</b> who graduated {{in the same year}} receive the same base pay, regardless of the background, experience, or ability of each. These associates will also receive automatic annual pay raises, bonuses, and promotions. Alternatively, <b>some</b> <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> implement a lockstep compensation system starting with partners or partner-track associates. During the late-2000s financial crisis, <b>some</b> <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> began replacing the lockstep system with [...] "merit-based" [...] systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> and {{corporate}} legal departments maintain in-house libraries, {{the size and}} content of which {{vary depending on the}} practice area and needs of the organization. These libraries would rarely, if ever, be available to individuals outside the organization, although in <b>some</b> locales <b>law</b> <b>firm</b> librarians have informal lending agreements between <b>firms.</b> Private <b>law</b> libraries often participate in the AALL's Private Law Librarians & Information Professionals Special Interest Section.|$|R

50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> have {{modified}} their lockstep {{system to}} allow for performance-based bonus structures. These bonuses can partially cure the incentive-based issues that stem from lockstep compensation. Other <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> have moved toward adopting a purely merit-based compensation system for associates. Purely merit-based models have been criticized as too volatile to endure, however, with the prominent failed example of Dewey & LeBoeuf failing under a merit-based partnership system.|$|R

5000|$|In most cases, the {{law allows}} the party sending the letter to demand payment of legal costs {{associated}} with the sending of the letter. In theory, this allows anybody that observes a violation of a law that may be covered by an [...] to hire an attorney, have a letter sent, and be reimbursed for the attorney's fees. In practice, a lawyer may do this without having been hired by a client who has been wronged, in essence searching for violators of covered laws and demanding payment from them for having found them.

5000|$|The {{enforceability}} of non-compete {{agreements in}} the state of Florida is quite common. <b>Some</b> <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> build their <b>law</b> practice around these agreements and represent employees, employers and potential new employers of an employee currently bound by a non-compete agreement. The agreement is not allowed to be overly broad and generally difficult to enforce if it is for more than two years. However, Florida courts will rarely refuse to enforce a non-compete agreement due to its length or geographic scope. Instead, under Florida law, courts are required to [...] "blue pencil" [...] an impermissibly broad or lengthy non-compete agreement to make it reasonable within the limits of Fla. Stat. § 542.335. Also if the agreement is part of a general employment contract then there is the possibility of a prior breach by an employer. This may cause the non-compete clause of the contract to become unenforceable. However, recent case law from Florida's appellate courts has eroded the utility of the prior breach defense.|$|R

50|$|Sliding scale {{fees are}} when {{different}} customers are charged different prices {{based on their}} income, which {{is used as a}} proxy for their willingness or ability to pay. For example, <b>some</b> nonprofit <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> charge on a sliding scale based on income and family size. Thus the clients paying a higher price {{at the top of the}} fee scale help subsidize the clients at the bottom of the scale. This differential pricing enables the nonprofit to serve a broader segment of the market than they could if they only set one price.|$|R

30|$|The final {{network is}} {{constructed}} {{by taking the}} union of all complete bipartite graphs (one for each legal case) and adding the weights of corresponding edges. Thus, the edge weight in the final graph is simply {{the sum of the}} weights of the corresponding edge across all bipartite graphs. Note that the final graph is not necessarily bipartite, as lawyers win and lose cases, and participate with different sets of lawyers in different cases. Once the final network is generated, a lawyer with a large in-degree (or a large in-weight) and a small out-degree (or small out-weight) is likely to have a greater importance in the network. Note that lawyers that win many cases against many lawyers are indeed relevant to this network. On the other hand, lawyers that win few cases against few lawyers are likely to have a lower relevance. Last, note that <b>some</b> <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> tend to register several lawyers for a given legal case, allowing any of them to officially represent the firm in the suit (mostly for convenience of the firm). The definition of weights used here in some sense compensates for this practice, as it divides by the number of lawyers in the winning set.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Leaving {{science to}} pursue a career in patent law {{requires}} a considerable invest-ment of time and energy, and possibly money, with no guarantee of finding a job or of return-ing to science should the decision prove infelicitous. Yet the large number of former scientists now practicing patent law shows that it can be done. I provide suggestions for investigating the potential opportunities, costs, risks, and rewards of this career path. The molecular biologist wishing to retool herself or himself as a pat-ent law professional has a number of specific career options to choose from.

50|$|Today, CLCs hold an established, if {{in funding}} terms {{sometimes}} precarious, {{place in the}} Victorian and wider Australian legal scene and have shaped the legal profession in various ways, although these are difficult to identify and quantify. For example, <b>some</b> larger Victorian <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> now permit-even encourage-employees to undertake some voluntary work, most often {{in the area of}} individual casework. This certainly testifies to wider community demands for adequate representation for all before the law, and to increasing pressures for <b>law</b> <b>firms</b> to be responsible ‘corporate citizens’, and the former development in particular may be attributed partly to the work of CLCs. However, the private legal profession has arguably been less responsive to CLCs’ attempts to bring about broader and more fundamental changes in the ways the law and lawyers operate.|$|R

Although he apologized a few days later, on February 2, 2007 Stimson resigned his position with the Pentagon, saying he believed the flap would prevent him from effectively doing his job. The controversy broadened the reputation of Federal News Radio, however, as the station's morning hosts and reporters were interviewed by news organizations around the world about the controversy.|$|R

40|$|It seems axiomatic <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>law</b> {{teachers}} that small group “Socratic” teaching {{in one form}} or another is a superior teaching method. 1 Unfortunately, when taught to small groups it is also an expensive teaching method. While new and/or well funded schools have been able to embrace it, others find that they cannot afford the method. The Law School at the University of Sydney is one of the oldest in Australia. For many years, it has also been one of the worst funded. Our exploration of other teaching methods was driven by our dissatisfaction with the traditional lecture method of teaching, fuelled by these economic restraints. Our explorations led us to consider the Keller Plan teaching method. Educational research suggested that the Plan could be at least as effective as intensive small group teaching, but available at a price that we could afford. The Keller Plan, also known as a Personalised System of Instruction (PSI), is a teaching method which combines “mastery learning” with principles of reinforcement learning theory. Since we find that few law teachers are familiar with these concepts, the first part of this paper will be an introduction to mastery learning and its particular refinement in the Keller Plan. We will then describe some of the research which compares the Keller Plan with other teaching models, and finish with a description of a particular implementation of the Keller Plan which we used in 1990 at the University of Sydney, in a class of 130 students...|$|R
