5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E
5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. <b>An</b> <b>edge</b> tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E

5|$|DAGs can model many {{different}} kinds of information. A spreadsheet can be modeled as a DAG, with a vertex for each cell and <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> whenever the formula in one cell uses the value from another; a topological ordering of this DAG can be used to update all cell values when the spreadsheet is changed.|$|E
5|$|For {{the same}} reason, the version {{history of a}} {{distributed}} revision control system generally has {{the structure of a}} directed acyclic graph, {{in which there is a}} vertex for each revision and <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> connecting pairs of revisions that were directly derived from each other. These are not trees in general due to merges.|$|E

5|$|Polonium is a {{radioactive}} element {{that exists in}} two metallic allotropes. The alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis, with <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> length of 335.2 picometers; the beta form is rhombohedral. The structure of polonium has been characterized by X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> hard <b>edge</b> is {{used when}} there is an abrupt change in brightness, such as a field with a horizon to a bright sky. <b>A</b> soft <b>edge</b> is <b>a</b> wider, {{smoother}} change from light to dark. This is used when the light and dark portions are not distinctly separated, such as a mountain and sky. <b>A</b> soft <b>edge</b> filter is less noticeable than <b>a</b> hard <b>edge.</b> It also has the benefit of making the sky more intense, darkening the sky the closer on the top. Below is a picture of what <b>a</b> hard <b>edge</b> and soft edge filter would look like.|$|R

5|$|A {{solution}} to the minimax path problem between the two opposite corners of a grid graph {{can be used to}} find the weak Fréchet distance between two polygonal chains. Here, each grid graph vertex represents a pair of line segments, one from each chain, and the weight of <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> represents the Fréchet distance needed to pass from one pair of segments to another.|$|E
5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

50|$|A {{sharpening}} jig {{is often}} used when sharpening woodworking tools. Many of the tools used in woodworking have steel blades which are sharpened to <b>a</b> fine <b>edge.</b> <b>A</b> cutting <b>edge</b> is created on the blade at {{the point at which}} two surfaces of the blade meet. To create this cutting <b>edge</b> <b>a</b> bevel is formed on the blade, usually by grinding.

5|$|Brown's main {{contribution}} to the game, however, was not {{to the development of}} new plays but to the organization and administration of teams. Before Brown, football was seen as a chaotic affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy and preparation seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E
5|$|Fast is {{considered}} a skilled forward with good skating ability, hockey sense, and speed, the latter of which gives him <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> in retrieving pucks along the boards. He excels on the forecheck, is a reliable defensive forward, and plays well in the offensive, defensive, and neutral zones. Alain Vigneault has praised his work ethic and dependability, and teammate Tanner Glass has noted his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful plays with the puck along the defensive zone wall. One of Fast's drawbacks is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play, but his physical game improved after he added muscle in the 2014 offseason.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E

5|$|In this context, a {{dependency}} graph is a graph {{that has}} a vertex for each object to be updated, and <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. A cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency, and is generally not allowed, because {{there would be no}} way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle.|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. <b>An</b> <b>edge</b> is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{oxidation}} {{states can}} occur as Zintl phases, as either free lead anions, as in Ba2Pb, with lead formally being lead(−IV), or in oxygen-sensitive ring-shaped or polyhedral cluster ions {{such as the}} trigonal bipyramidal Pb52− ion, where two lead atoms are lead(−I) and three are lead(0). In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> from their sp3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external lone pair. They may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium.|$|E
