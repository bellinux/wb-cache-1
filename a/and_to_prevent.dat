5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} {{to drive out}} the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> him from defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal intubation, usually simply {{referred}} to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open airway or {{to serve as a}} conduit through which to administer certain drugs.

5|$|A governor, Sir John Fowell, was {{appointed}} to run the local defences, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> smuggling, while Sir Henry was heavily fined by Parliament. By 1661 and the restoration of Charles II to the throne, the guns at Kingswear were mounted on the roof, which had been accidentally burnt down during the fighting in the war and had been replaced with a new lead version. Sir John retained his role as governor and, although Charles briefly reasserted {{the rights of the}} town over the defences, control quickly passed to the Crown. By the 18th century, Kingswear had fallen into ruin, although 12-pounder, 9-pounder and 8-pounder (5.4kg, 4kg and 3.6kg) guns were still installed there in 1717.|$|E

5|$|After Ali's death, the Shias of Iraq {{declared}} Ali's {{eldest son}} Hasan {{the successor to}} Ali, thus proclaiming him as their new caliph. However, Hasan {{was not interested in}} becoming caliph, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> further bloodshed, he signed the Hasan–Muawiya treaty and abdicated in favor of Muawiyah, who became the first caliph of the Umayyad caliphate. Muawiyah died in Medina at the age of forty-five in 669, and was succeeded by Yazid I in 61 AH (680 CE) but Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali refused to accept Yazid's leadership. After being invited by the Shiites of Iraq in the same year, Husayn started his march to Iraq. However, during their stay at Karbala, his army was massacred by Yazid at the Battle of Karbala on 10 Muharram (10 October) and his death is commemorated by Shia every year during Muharram.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. As the numbers in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, both ships were mobilized to lay a series of minefields, initially to protect Germany's coastlines in the North and Baltic Seas. In August, the two ships laid offensive minefields off the British coast, and Nautilus made a similar attempt in October that was cancelled when radio intercepts indicated British naval forces were present. In June 1915, Albatross {{was transferred to the}} eastern Baltic, where she began to lay offensive minefields. The last of these resulted in the Battle of Åland Islands on 2 July after a group of Russian armored cruisers intercepted Albatross and her escorts. The cruisers badly damaged Albatross, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> her sinking, her captain beached the ship off the coast of neutral Sweden.|$|E

Among the dead were all five Coast Guard personnel posted aboard the fire barge. African Americans suffered 202 dead and 233 injured, which accounted for 15% of all African-American naval casualties during World War II. Naval personnel worked quickly to contain the fires <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> other explosions. Injuries were treated, those seriously injured were hospitalized, and uninjured servicemen were evacuated to nearby stations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35am (11.20am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25pm (12.20pm on Sundays).|$|E

5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and {{action was taken}} by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the hills and common land <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> encroachment. Local lords of the manor indicated {{that they would like to}} give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot stuffing.|$|E
5|$|During the Interregnum, Gallants Bower was {{decommissioned}} but {{the castle}} itself remained in use; the Carews' house was pulled down. A governor, Sir John Fowell, {{was appointed to}} run the castle and the local defences, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> smuggling. Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and initially granted Dartmouth Castle, and the former annual subsidy, to the town once again. By 1662, however, the fortifications in Dartmouth were garrisoned by a royal force of 23 men and Sir John, who continued in his post as captain and governor until 1677. Fears of a Dutch and French attack resulted in the castle being maintained until the 1690s.|$|E
