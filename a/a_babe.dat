5|$|The Yankees {{scored the}} first {{run of the}} game in the third inning on <b>a</b> <b>Babe</b> Ruth solo home run into the right field bleachers. In the {{following}} half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.|$|E
500|$|During his lifetime, Ruth {{had become}} a symbol of the United States. During World War II, Japanese {{soldiers}} could think of no greater insult than to yell in English, [...] "To hell with Babe Ruth", to anger American soldiers. Ruth replied that he hoped that [...] "every Jap that mention my name gets shot". Creamer recorded that [...] "Babe Ruth transcended sport and moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages". Wagenheim stated, [...] "He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable." [...] According to Glenn Stout, [...] "Ruth's home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for. <b>A</b> <b>Babe</b> Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{artist of}} a French Romanesque capital has enjoyed himself showing the infant Moses {{threatened}} by crocodiles and perhaps hippos, as often shown in classical {{depictions of the}} Nile landscape. This very rare treatment in fact anticipates modern Biblical criticism: [...] "The cameo {{of the birth of}} Moses does not fit the reality of the Nile, where crocodiles would make it dangerous to send <b>a</b> <b>babe</b> in a basket onto the water or even to bathe by the shore: even if the poor were forced to take the risk, no princess would".|$|E

2500|$|Allan's memoirs were {{positively}} reviewed by Marika Sboros, an ex-Rand Daily Mail reporter now writing for BizNews. [...] "Allan's memoirs are well written, punctuated with her characteristic style: the surgical journalistic precision, creativity, biting wit, bitchiness, and black humour aimed {{as much at}} herself as others." [...] She continues: [...] "There is an overwhelming unadorned, painful honesty and openness in her version of events and minutiae of the detail, a compelling coherence throughout". Sboros continues by commending the apolitical nature of the memoirs, citing the honesty of her privileged white upbringing: [...] "She comes across as what {{she was at the}} time: not just <b>a</b> <b>babe,</b> but a foetus in the woods of South African apartheid politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ward's father, Robert Quigley King, who {{was born}} on August 13, 1832 in Tarlton, was their first child to survive. Understandably, Almena insisted on going along with David on his supply trips after that, {{carrying}} with her the infant Robert Quigley King as <b>a</b> <b>babe</b> in arms. Their next child was Samuel Noble King, {{who was born}} in Tarlton on October 22, 1834. He went all his life by his middle name of [...] "Noble". The Kings named him after their country neighbor, Samuel Noble, who had come from Emmitsburg, Maryland {{to become one of the}} first settlers of Tarlton and who had a large farm just south of Tarlton. Mary Elizabeth King, was born to David and Almena in Tarlton on April 1, 1837, and David King, Jr., later to become a Civil War colonel, was born in Tarlton on September 11, 1839.|$|E
