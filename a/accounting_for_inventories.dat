50|$|In his 1960 Accounting {{principles}} Braden and Allyn {{described and}} pictured the cost-flow principle: As direct material passes from the storeroom into the factory for conversion into finished products {{and back into}} the storeroom for storage until sold, costs are being gathered in totals and per unit for each stage of the productive process. Each movement in the factory operation is accounted for at the time it occurs. This is the cost-flow principle. Assisting in the carrying out of this principle is the perpetual inventory method of <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>inventories.</b> In the operation of this method of handling inventory, a record is made of the issue of direct and indirect materials from the storeroom, as well as a record of their receipt when they are purchased. The continuous accounting for the flow of materials at the time of occurrence is essential to an accounting for costs.|$|E

I characterized spatial and environmental patterns of species richness of phyllostomid bats in Atlantic Forest of South America and examined the degree to which temperature seasonality relative to other important environmental gradients was related to patterns of diversity across 60 heterogeneously sampled assemblages. I compared efficacy of different methods of <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>inventory</b> completeness (rarefaction, species estimation, minimum number of individuals and raw data) in characterizing gradients of bat diversity.

Temperature seasonality was consistently the most important predictor of species richness across all methods of <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>inventory</b> completeness as well as between spatial and non-spatial regression methods. Spatial auto-correlation of both species richness and regression residuals was lowest for species richness estimators and highest for data rarefied to the highest sample sizes. Strong and characteristic environmental gradients typifying Atlantic Forest of South America translate into coin-cident gradients of richness of bat assemblages. Although data were characterized by heterogeneous sampling efforts, relationships of species richness with seasonality of temperature were strong and easily detectable.

Which method an accountant selects can {{have a significant effect}} on net income and book value and, in turn, on taxation. Using LIFO <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>inventory,</b> a company generally reports lower net income and lower book value, due to the effects of inflation. This generally results in lower taxation. Due to LIFO's potential to skew inventory value, UK GAAP and IAS have effectively banned LIFO inventory accounting.

The purpose of this thesis was to review the framework for standardization of inventory reporting afloat under one stores (inventory) accounting system, referred to as the Material Financial Control System-Retail (MFCS-Retail). Additional analysis was conducted on general funds obligational reporting for afloat Operating Targets (OPTARS) and the conversion to the Standard Accounting and Reporting System, Field Level (STARS-FL) system. Empirical research was conducted at DFAS Operating Locations in San Diego, California and Norfolk, Virginia to review existing stores accounting and general funds management procedures. Additionally, financial reconciliation procedures were reviewed for inventory and financial accounting, with the goal of using artificial intelligence to reduce unmatched receipts and expenditures. Emphasis was placed on areas that could be streamlined and automated to provide timeliness in reporting, while reducing workload afloat. The major finding of this research was that standardizing <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>inventories</b> afloat under MFCS-Retail and STARS-FL for OPTAR management allows for streamlining detailed inventory management and financial reporting ashore. A major benefit is the reduction of workload afloat through the standardization of re ortin across the fleet. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|E

Primary accounting, document circulation, inventory, Chart of accounts, accounting forms and features of conducting analytical research, reporting as components of accounting, provide information and communication relation at the company. Globalization events are characterized by the virtual revolutionary development of information and communication technologies used in all the levels and sectors of economic activity. These tasks are determined by the following external factors as the competition conditions, the advantage in the buyer's market and the importance of his choice. Adaptability of the company is determined by the ability to respond quickly to the external and internal factors of influence. In modern conditions, the organization of <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>inventories</b> affecting the efficiency of functioning of the whole company is becoming rather actual. Therefore, the organization of effective accounting and analytical support of management of inventories as one of the main components of assets is a priority task in the company’s activity.

The implementation of solutions is possible by creating an additional module in the configuration of 1 C. The development and application of modern tools in the automation of relevant processes and management practices in the company are determined by the need to improve the effectiveness of organization of production process, and the functioning of the accounting department, caused by the intensification of the accounting reform processes, and forming competitive advantages in the market, maximizing revenues, and optimizing use of resources.

Conclusions include: (1) <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>inventory</b> at both the origin and destination can yield significantly different EOQ/EPQ results, but relatively modest regret; and (2) failure to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> consolidation effects among multiple products sent to a common destination can lead to substantial errors. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a firm that}} markets, procures, and delivers a good with a single selling season {{in a number of}} different markets. The price for the good is market-dependent, and each market has an associated demand distribution, with parameters that depend on the amount of marketing effort applied. Given long procurement lead-times, the firm must decide which markets it will serve prior to procuring the good. We develop a profit maximizing model to address the firm's integrated market selection, marketing effort, and procurement decisions. The model implicitly <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>inventory</b> pooling across markets, which reduces safety stock costs but increases model complexity. The resulting model is a nonlinear integer optimization problem, for which we develop specialized solution methods. For the case in which budget constraints exist, we provide a novel solution approach that uses a tailored branch-and-bound algorithm. Our approach solves a broad range of 3000 test instances in an average of less than 2 seconds, significantly outperforming a leading commercial global optimization solver. ...|$|R
