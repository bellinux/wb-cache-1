In addition, they {{have to decide whether}} the body is to be cremated or buried, and register the death. The funeral director also helps to make <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.|$|E
5|$|Juskalian {{returned}} to the United States in August 1964 and was posted to headquarters of Military District of Washington (MDW) as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training, his last Army assignment before retirement. During his three years at MDW, he {{served as chairman of}} the Joint Military Executive Committee that was chiefly responsible for planning and carrying out all <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> participation of military services in the inauguration of President Lyndon B.

The three Indian satellites launched were Cartosat-2D, INS-1A, and INS-1B. <b>Arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{launch of the}} 104 satellites were made between ISRO's commercial arm Antrix Corporation Limited, {{under the auspices of}} the Indian Government's Department of Space, and the international customers.|$|E
5|$|When Moses Hazen, the {{messenger}} bearing news of Arnold's raid, reached Quebec City and notified British Governor and General Guy Carleton of the raid, Carleton immediately dispatched additional troops from there and Trois-Rivières to St. Jean. Carleton himself went to Montreal on May 26 to oversee <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{defense of the}} province, which he decided to concentrate on St. Jean, {{as it was the}} most likely invasion route.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E

5|$|Demobilisation also {{included}} establishing <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> medical care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually {{transferred from the}} services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary to build new hospitals {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and mental disorders, however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales. The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service, and this led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, {{and because it}} was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England to argue the Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> trading post on Kent Island.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E

5|$|On October 29, 1861, a {{group of}} Kentuckians—Johnson among them—met at Russellville, Kentucky to discuss the {{formation}} of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth, believing the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky's citizens. Johnson chaired the committee that authored the convention's final report, and personally introduced some of its key resolutions. The report called for a sovereignty convention to sever ties with the Federal government. Johnson, Breckinridge, and Humphrey Marshall were among the notable members of the Committee of Ten that made <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> convention.|$|E

5|$|Soon after D-Day in 1944, Rainbow {{transferred}} to the Foreign Office to head {{a section of the}} secretariat of the European Advisory Commission (EAC) at Norfolk House, making <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> post-war administration of Germany. In June 1945, she moved to Berlin as part of the Allied Control Council. For a time, she slept with a revolver under her pillow during the turbulent times just after the Battle of Berlin. After the Second World War, Allied-occupied Germany was divided into four zones, managed by the British, American, French and Russians. Berlin was also divided into four zones, and Rainbow worked as the UK secretary in the Economic Directorate alongside counterparts from France, America and Russia to co-ordinate administering the districts and supplying food to the population.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom and her Allies {{had been}} at war against Napoleon's French Empire since 1803, but by early 1814 Wellington's army had fought {{its way through the}} Peninsula to France, and the eastern Allies were {{threatening}} France's eastern borders. On 31 March 1814, allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Within a month of Napoleon's abdication, he had been exiled to Elba. It appeared that the war was over, and <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> peace were discussed at the Congress of Vienna. But on 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France, where he raised an army.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} her {{daughter}} in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1857 national convention {{to be held in}} Providence, but because she {{would not be able to}} attend it, she handed responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony’s plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman’s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.|$|E

The club's managing director Keith Edelman confirmed {{in a statement that}} the investment would be used directly to fund for the new stadium. The collapse of ITV Digital (part-owned by Granada) in April 2002 coincided with news that the company was tied in to pay £30million once <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new stadium were finalised.|$|E
5|$|The support <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> RAAF's Hercules were {{reformed}} during 1999 and 2000. On 24August 1999, {{the training}} sections of Nos. 33, 36 and 37 Squadrons and No. 503 Wing were combined to form No. 285 Squadron. This new squadron was assigned responsibility for training aircrew to operate C-130s and Boeing 707s using flight simulators, {{as well as}} aircraft temporarily assigned to the unit from the operational squadrons. Retired Hercules have also been used to train loadmasters. In May 2000, heavy maintenance of the C-130s, previously carried out by No.2 AD (reformed as No.503 Wing in July 1992) was contracted out to Qantas. Since the retirement of the Boeing 707 from RAAF service in June 2008, No.285 Squadron has been dedicated to C-130 training.|$|E
