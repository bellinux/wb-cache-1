25|$|Very gently {{massaging}} {{the area}} and applying heat may encourage blood flow and relieve pain according to the gate control theory of pain, although causing additional pain may indicate the massage is exacerbating the injury.

Before Laake could get back to Oslo minister of defence Ljungberg, the latter had left the general staff's offices to attend a cabinet meeting. The top officers of the Norwegian Army were gathering at the general staff in Oslo. In {{the early hours of}} 9 April 1940, Hatledal repeatedly attempted to get in contact with defence minister Ljungberg, and confusion reigned in the general staff as no orders from the politicians came. No attempts were made by the general staff at preparing for mobilization by warning the telegraph offices, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, or the newspapers. General Laake was of the opinion that it served no purpose to prepare for mobilization, as the mobilization itself would take <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> to carry out in any case.

She stayed in Washington long enough to participate in a National Woman's Party suffrage rally, during which she was arrested, arraigned, and sentenced to five days in jail. The specific charges against her and others, who had burned President Woodrow Wilson in effigy on the White House lawn, were [...] "building fires on government property, standing on the coping around the White House, or attempting to make disorderly speeches." [...] Among a group of women who refused bail, she spent <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in jail, during which she took part in a hunger strike. Upon her release, she insisted on testifying as an unfriendly witness before the Overman Committee, which had been set up to investigate Bolshevik activity in the United States. Deflecting questions about her religious beliefs, marriages, and other personal matters during her two days of testimony, she tried to convince the subcommittee, led by Senator Lee S. Overman, that Russia had a right to self-determination. Soon thereafter, she began a cross-country speaking tour, [...] "The Truth About Russia", arranged by Anna Louise Strong, during which she addressed large audiences in Detroit, Chicago, Spokane, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other American cities. According to Gardner, Bryant was the first woman to defend Lenin and Trotsky at political gatherings across the United States. Gardner writes, [...] "Her message was simple, 'Hands off Russia!'

2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{effect of}} Bell’s palsy is Wallerian Degeneration (WD), which may take days to become evident. [...] Because of the slow-acting {{nature of this}} pathology, a patient may present healthy electroneuronography results {{despite a lack of}} volitional control of the facial muscles immediately following the onset of Bell’s palsy. [...] This is because the degeneration has not yet reached completion, and some fibers are still intact.

50|$|According to a myth told by Chinese peasants, the {{original}} plow-oxen lived in Heaven, as the Ox stars.

Therefore, to punish the oxen for getting the message wrong, and not to appear himself to be a liar, he restricted the Oxen to the Earth, where they became regular oxen, working the farms helping the people of Earth with their farm work (Christie, 1968: p. 91 and 92).|$|R

Public schools on the island were closed by officials until further notice. Although warnings were issued for the Mariana Islands, most residents did not heed warnings. Stores selling supplies such as plywood, lumber, nails, screws, batteries and butane stoves reported only {{a slight increase in}} sales. There were also no sales of flashlights and generators ahead of the system.

2500|$|First-class cricket {{is a form}} of {{the game}} in which teams of a {{recognised}} high standard compete. Test cricket is first-class at international level; the term [...] "first-class" [...] is habitually applied to domestic matches only, although a player's Test statistics are included in his overall first-class statistics. A first-class match must have eleven players per side, two innings apiece and a scheduled duration of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> Historically, however, there have been instances of first-class matches being arranged for less than three days, and there have been others with twelve or thirteen players per side; these are exceptional cases and form a tiny percentage of the whole. If the game is not completed within the allotted time then it is drawn, regardless of who has scored the most runs when time expires. Limited overs matches in which the teams have only one innings each are not first-class (see List A and Twenty20 sections below) and these cannot result in a draw (they can, however, result in a tie or be declared a [...] "no result").|$|E
