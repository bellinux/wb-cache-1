40|$|Obligate avian brood parasites show {{dramatic}} {{variation in}} {{the degree to which}} they are host specialists or host generalists. The screaming cowbird Molothrus rufoaxillaris is one of the most specialized brood parasites, using a single host, the bay-winged cowbird (Agelaioides badius) over most of its range. Coevolutionary theory predicts increasing host specificity the longer the parasite interacts with a particular avian community, as hosts evolve defences that the parasite cannot counteract. According to this view, host specificity can be maintained if screaming cowbirds avoid parasitizing potentially suitable hosts that have developed effective defences against parasitic females or eggs. Specialization may also be favoured, even in the absence of host defences, if the parasite's reproductive success in <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> is lower than that in the main host. We experimentally tested these hypotheses using as <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> two suitable but unparasitized species: house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and chalk-browed mockingbirds (Mimus saturninus). We assessed host defences against parasitic females and eggs, and reproductive success of the parasite in current and <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts.</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> did not discriminate against screaming cowbird females or eggs. Egg survival and hatching success were similarly high in current and <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts,</b> but the survival of parasitic chicks was significantly lower in <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts.</b> Our results indicate that screaming cowbirds have the potential to colonize novel hosts, but higher reproductive success in the current host may favour host fidelity...|$|R
40|$|Aphids {{are known}} as {{important}} pests of plants specially almond trees. Seasonal population fluctuation of two aphid species, Brachycaudus amygdalinus (Schout.) and Hyalopterus amygdali (Blanch.) were studied in 1999 - 2000 on almond trees in Najafabad area. Characteristics such as times of egg hatch, appearance, outbreak, spring migration to <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts,</b> migration from <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> in fall, oviposition, number of eggs laid, damage degree, <b>alternative,</b> other primary <b>hosts</b> and some natural enemies were investigated. In early spring damage signs of B. amygdalinus were expressed on almond twigs as serious leaf curling followed by retarded growth of twigs and shortened internodes. Shortly after that H. amygdali colonized other leaves. For both species egg hatching was coincided in late winter however colonization and population increase of H. amygdalei were observed two weeks later than what was observed for B. amygdalinus. With the onset of warm season, both species moved from almonds to <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> for aestivation.

40|$|Goss’s wilt is a {{bacterial}} disease found in corn {{caused by the}} bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis (Cmn). This disease was first discovered in 1969 in Dawson county Nebraska and has since been confirmed in thirteen states in the United States and three provinces in Canada. Factors {{that contribute to the}} spread of Goss’s wilt are infected corn residue, no-till, continuous corn, storms, infected seeds, and <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts.</b> Infected residue is the primary inoculum source for Goss’s wilt because the bacteria requires either a living hosts or residue to survive. Practices such as no-till and continuous corn can leave large amounts of corn residue on the soil surface and potentially influence the inoculum potential of Cmn. Early theories on Cmn infection assumed that wounds created from storms were initially required for infection to occur. Recent research has revealed that Cmn can infect corn without wounds, but storms can still aid the bacteria by moving it from the soil surface and onto lower portions of the plant. These factors are helpful in allowing Cmn to move short distances and build up the inoculum potential in infected fields. However, long distance movement of Cmn is limited but possible through infected seeds. Seeds infected with Cmn is rare but researchers have demonstrated the ability of Cmn to infect kernels and an even lower percentage of infected seed can transmit Cmn from the seed to the seedling. This gives Cmn the ability to travel longer distances but is less likely to occur. Another source of inoculum and possibly the least understood factor potentially contributing to the movement and inoculum potential of Cmn are the known <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts.</b> Some grass species {{have been found to be}} hosts for Cmn. Many of these hosts are considered weeds and can be found in production fields potentially serving as a bridge hosts in non-hosts crops. The cover crop annual ryegrass is the only <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> utilized as a cover crop. When using annual ryegrass as a cover crop living tissue is available for Cmn to overwinter in. The objective of this research was to evaluate the susceptibility of <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> when inoculated with Cmn, factors contributing to the spread and persistence of Goss’s wilt in Indiana, and the influence a susceptible cover crop could have on the overwintering of Cmn and corn yields. ^ In experiments evaluating <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> for their susceptibility to Cmn, early studies used a 1 x 106 or 1 x 107 Colony Forming Units (CFU) per ml inoculum concentrations to screen weeds when determining <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> for Cmn. Only two studies had gone further and compared <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> for their level of susceptibility to that of a corn hybrid at a single higher inoculum concentration. Our greenhouse experiment evaluated annual ryegrass, giant foxtail, and johnsongrass for their level of susceptibility compared to a susceptible and moderately resistant corn hybrid with a tenfold dilution ranging from 1 x 100 to a 1 x 107 CFU per ml inoculum concentrations. Days required for initial lesion development to occur was also recorded and compared amongst the different hosts and inoculum concentrations. The two corn hybrids had higher disease severity than the <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts.</b> The two corn hybrids also had more disease severity as inoculum concentrations increased, while <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> showed no difference between the different inoculum concentrations. Hosts required similar number of days for initial lesions to develop, except annual ryegrass was a few days slower to develop lesions. Hosts also required fewer days for lesion development to begin as inoculum concentrations increased. In conclusion, corn is a better host for Cmn and contributes more to the inoculum potential. <b>Alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> however, still had lesion development at lower inoculum concentrations, and may be able to serve as a refuge in non-hosts crops.

40|$|Abstract: Chytridiomycosis is {{a disease}} of {{amphibians}} caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dend-robatidis. It can be highly virulent and is unusual in that it appears to drive many host species to local extinction during outbreaks. One mechanism that could facilitate this {{is the ability to}} grow saprophytically or on <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts.</b> This is common in other chytrids but has not been demonstrated for B. dendrobatidis in the field. B. dendrobatidis can grow on arthropod exoskeletons in the laboratory, and freshwater shrimp can be the most abundant animals in tropical rain forest streams. We therefore used diagnostic quantitative poly-merase chain reaction to determine the infection status of freshwater shrimp from areas in which they are sympatric with frog species that have suffered declines in association with outbreaks of chytridiomycosis. We detected B. dendrobatidis on three individual shrimp belonging to two genera and collected from two widely separated streams. Two of the individuals had high levels of infection. This indicates that the presence of <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> is likely to contribute to the extreme virulence of chytridiomycosis outbreaks in some systems. The presence of <b>alternative</b> <b>hosts</b> may allow B. dendrobatidis to remain in the environment after local extinctions of amphibian hosts, preventing the recovery of amphibian populations.

Species that share infectious diseases are well-known to interact indirectly through the process of apparent competition, but there has been little attention given to the role of vectors in these indirect interactions.
