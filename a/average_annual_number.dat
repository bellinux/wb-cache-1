Non-native invasive plant (NNIP) species can have significant effects on forest regeneration, structure, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat, costing {{billions of dollars}} annually. Understanding how NNIPs in the Midwest may spread in the future requires understanding their response to site and climate characteristics. Current research suggests climate change may influence invasive plant presence and spread. In this study, I modeled the relationship between invasive species presence, site characteristics (e. g. disturbance, live tree volume, city distance, edge distance, physiography, and type of water [e. g. streams] present on plot), and climate (<b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of days the temperature is ≥ 90 ˚F and <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of days the temperature is ≤ 32 ˚F) for five non-native invasive plants (multiflora rose [Rosa multiflora], common buckthorn [Rhamnus cathartica], non-native bush honeysuckles [Lonicera spp. ], garlic mustard [Alliaria petiolata], and reed canary grass [Phalaris arundinacea]) sampled by the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis program in seven Midwestern states for 2005 - 2006 Species’ response to site and temperature predictors varied due to trait differences such as shade tolerance and moisture affinity. For most species, presence {{was positively related to}} biotic disturbance (disease(s) and/or animal(s)) and mesic physiography and negatively related to distance from a city or a nonforest edge. The best predictor for the presence of NNIPs was <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of days the temperature is ≤ 32 ˚F, with all five species presence correlated with the <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of days the temperature is ≤ 32 ˚F.

Annual incidence rates for each one-year age group cohort were comparable before and after changes. Childhood TBM remains rare in France. No increase in incidence was observed after changes in BCG vaccination strategy.

One of the major databases (Scopus) contains 942 scientific articles that were published during the 5 -year time period 2006 – 2010. Of these, 195 (21 %) reported on single patient cases and 12 (1 %) were reports of 2 cases. Little is known about their influence on advancement of the field or scientific merits. Do brain metastases case reports attract attention and provide stimuli for further research or do they go largely unrecognized? Different measures of impact, visibility and quality of published research are available, each with its own pros and cons. For the present evaluation, article citation rate was chosen. The median number of citations overall and stratified by year of publication was 0, except for the year 2006 when it was 2. As compared to other articles, case reports remained more often without citation (p, 0. 05 except for 2006 data).

Little {{is known about the}} impact of AF on utilization of noninpatient health care or about sex or race differences in AF-related utilization. We examined rates of inpatient and outpatient utilization by AF status in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Methods and Results-—Participants with incident AF enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare for at least 12 continuous months between 1991 and 2009 (n= 932) were matched on age, sex, race and field center with up to 3 participants without AF (n= 2729). Healthcare utilization was ascertained from Medicare claims and classified by primary International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision code. The <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>numbers</b> of days hospitalized were 13. 2 (95 % CI 11. 6 to 15. 0) and 2. 8 (95 % CI 2. 5 to 3. 1) for those with and without AF, respectively. The corresponding <b>numbers</b> of <b>annual</b> outpatient claims were 53. 3 (95 % CI 50. 5 to 56. 3) and 22. 9 (95 % CI 22. 1 to 23. 8) for those with and without AF, respectively. Most utilization among AF patients was attributable to non-AF conditions. The adjusted rate ratio for annual days hospitalized for other cardiovascular disease–related reasons was 4. 58 (95 % CI: 3. 41 to 6. 16) for those with AF versus those without AF. The association between AF and healthcare utilization was similar among men and women and among white and black participants. Conclusions-—Participants with AF had considerably greater healthcare utilization, and the difference in utilization for other cardiovascular disease–related reasons was substantial. In addition to rate or rhythm treatment, AF management should focus on the accompanying cardiovascular comorbidities. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2014; 3 :e 001006 doi: 10. 1161 /JAHA. 114. 001006...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{tendency}} to centralize childhood cancer treatment among cancer treatment hospitals in Osaka, Japan over a 28 -year period. Methods: The subjects were patients {{under the age of}} 15, newly diagnosed with cancer in Osaka between 1975 and 2002 (n = 4738). They were categorized into three groups by the time diagnosed (1975 – 84, 1985 – 93 and 1994 – 2002). The International Classification of Childhood Cancer was used as the disease classification. The degree of centralization was examined using a Pareto analysis, the Gini coefficient and the <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of cases per hospital. Results: During this period, the number of children with cancer in Osaka has decreased by nearly half, from 2. 1 to 1. 2 million and the number of hospitals treating childhood cancer decreased from 37 to 20. However, the Pareto curve and Gini coefficient were almost con-stant (0. 747, 0. 737, 0. 756 in Gini coefficient for the three diagnosed periods). The <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>numbers</b> of cases per hospital were much low and marginally increased from 5. 6 during 1975 – 84 to 6. 1 during 1994 – 2002 in the hospitals that treated 90 % of all cancers.

This study investigated the prevalence and spatial distribution of fasciolosis in dairy cow herds in Ireland using an in-house antibodydetection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay applied to bulk tank milk (BTM) samples collected during the autumn of 2012. A total of 5, 116 BTM samples were collected from 4, 602 different herds, with 514 farmers submitting BTM samples in two consecutive months. Analysis of the BTM samples showed that 82 % (n = 3, 764) of the dairy herds {{had been exposed to}} Fasciola hepatica. A total of 108 variables, including averaged climatic data for the period 1981 - 2010 and contemporary meteorological data for the year 2012, such as soil, subsoil, land cover and habitat maps, were investigated for a possible role as predictor of fasciolosis.

30|$|The main {{characteristic}} of the current experiment consists in targeting Japan, {{one of the most}} seismically active regions in the world. To demonstrate that Japan provides sufficient numbers of observed earthquakes, we have compared seismic activities for the CSEP’s Californian, Italian, and Japanese laboratories. The testing region consists of 7, 862 nodes in California and 8, 993 nodes in Italy, and both spread down to a depth of 30 km with a spatial resolution of 0.1 ° × 0.1 °. We pay attention to the <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of earthquakes per node with magnitudes M ≥ 4.95 because this is the same range that is applied to observed earthquakes in the forecasts of long-term classes in all CSEP laboratories. According to Schorlemmer et al. (2010 b), the <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of M ≥ 4.95 earthquakes in the California testing region is 6.18. Normalizing this figure by the number of nodes, we obtain an <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> of 6.87 × 10 − 4 earthquakes per node. For the testing region in Italy, we use data from the Italian Seismic Bulletin, recorded by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) between 16 April 2005 and 31 March 2009. The number of M ≥ 4.95 earthquakes during this period is 4, giving an <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of 1.03. Dividing this figure by the number of nodes (8, 993), we obtain an <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> of 1.34 × 10 − 4 earthquakes per node. For the natural laboratory in Japan, we take the “All Japan” testing region and use the JMA catalog from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2008. During this 10 -year period, there were 792 earthquakes of M ≥ 4.95 down to a depth of 100 km, with an average of 79.2 earthquakes per year. Dividing this figure by the number of nodes (20, 662), we obtain an <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> of 3.83 × 10 − 3 earthquakes per node. This figure is approximately 5.6 -fold larger than that for California (6.87 × 10 − 4) and 28.7 -fold larger than that for Italy (1.34 × 10 − 4), underscoring the argument that sufficient numbers of earthquakes are expected to be observed in the Japanese laboratory. Assuming the reader would like to know the seismicity in “All Japan” down to a depth of 30 km in order to fairly compare this with California and Italy: the obtained <b>annual</b> <b>number</b> per node (1.81 × 10 − 3) is again larger than that for these two regions. We have performed the same analysis for the “Mainland” and “Kanto” regions and obtained <b>annual</b> <b>averages</b> of 1.35 x 10 − 3 and 8.00 × 10 − 3 earthquakes, respectively, per node, where the smaller node spacing of 0.05 ° × 0.05 ° for “Kanto” (Fig. 1 (c)) was taken into consideration. These figures are again larger than those obtained for the Californian and Italian test fields. While most other CSEP testing regions are using the 5 -year testing as a long-term class, a mere 1 -year class in Japan is sufficient to obtain stable or at least interesting results.|$|R
