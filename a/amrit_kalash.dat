It uses a combination of dozens of different herbs and fruits. Ingredients include herbs such as White Musali, Liquorice, Giant Potato, Aswagandha, Gum Arabic tree, Indian asparagus, caper, aloe, Curculigo orchioides, Amla, Tinospora cordifolia, simpleleaf chastetree and elephant creeper.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to examine modifying effects of Maharishi <b>Amrit</b> <b>Kalash</b> 4 (MAK 4) and Maharishi <b>Amrit</b> <b>Kalash</b> 5 (MAK 5) on {{phagocytic}} and digestive functions of macrophages in male ICR mice. Mice at 4 week of age were divided into 3 groups: no treatment group (control), MAK 4 treated group (MAK 4 group) and MAK 5 treated group (MAK 5 group). MAK 4 and MAK 5 were given p. o. at 50 mg/kg per day (5 days/week) for 7 weeks. Phagocytic function of reticuloendothelial system evaluated by the carbon clearance was enhanced by the treatment of MAK 4 and MAK 5. Superoxide anion (O 2 -) production of peritoneal macrophages increased significantly in both MAK 4 and MAK 5 groups. The acid phosphatase activity of peritoneal macrophages increased significantly in MAK 4 group compared to the control group, but not in MAK 5 group. The activities of β-glucuronidase and lactate dehydrogenase in both MAK 4 and MAK 5 groups increased significantly {{when compared to the}} control group. These results suggest that MAK 4 and MAK 5 promote the phagocytic and digestive functions of macrophages and have a stimulatory effect on macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Maharishi <b>Amrit</b> <b>Kalash</b> (MAK) 5, {{one of the}} Ayurvedic food supplements, {{belongs to}} a group of {{substances}} known as Rasayana. MAK 5 and other Rasayanas are believed to enhance the body's resistance to infections and disease, and enhance longevity. In this study, we determined the effects of administration of MAK 5, one of the Ayurvedic food supplements on immune functions in young and old mice. Methods Male C 3 H/He N mice were divided into five groups: two no treatment groups (old control: 22 -month-old and young control: 2 -month-old) and three MAK 5 treated groups with differing dose of MAK 5. MAK 5 was given p. o. at 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg per day (3 days/week) for 2 months. Results We found that glucose consumption of peritoneal macrophages from old mice treated with MAK 5 at all doses and incubated for 48 and 72 h were significantly greater than that in the control group. Nitric oxide production of peritoneal macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in old mice treated with MAK 5 at all doses was significantly greater than that in the old control group, but not compared to the young control group. Stimulation index (S. I.) in old mice gavaged with MAK 5 at all doses was significantly higher than that in the old control group. IL- 2 production stimulated by Con A in old mice given MAK 5 at all doses was significantly higher than that in the old control group. Production of IFN-γ stimulated by Con A in old mice given MAK 5 at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg were significantly higher than that in the old control group. IL- 4 production of splenic lymphocyte stimulated by Con A in old mice given MAK 5 at dose levels of 100 and 200 mg/kg were significantly higher than that in the old control group. Conclusion The results suggest that MAK 5 suppressed the age associated glucose consumption of peritoneal macrophages and cellular immune function reduction, and that it contributes to the prevention of the immunosenescence. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the dose-effects of ingestion of Maharishi <b>Amrit</b> <b>Kalash</b> 4 (MAK 4), an ayurvedic food supplement, on the immune function in female inbred BALB/c mice. Superoxide anion (O 2) production of peritoneal macrophages and the response of spleen cells to concanavalin A (Con A) were examined in mice given MAK 4 by gastric intubation of an aqueous emulsion at the dose of 10, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg once a day for 20 days. Glucose consumption of peritoneal macrophage in the MAK 4 -treated mice at the doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg after not only 24 -hour but also 48 -hour incubations were significantly high compared with the control group. Glucose consumption of peritoneal macrophages in the MAK 4 -treated mice at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg after 48 hours of incubation were significantly {{lower than that of}} the control group. O 2 production {{in the absence of a}} stimulator was significantly enhanced in the MAK 4 -treated groups at the doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg. On the other hand, O 2 production in the presence of a stimulator was significantly high in the MAK 4 -treated groups at the doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg, and was significantly low in the MAK 4 -treated groups at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg compared with that in the control group. Activities of acid phosphatase in the peritoneal macrophages were significantly low in the MAK 4 -treated groups at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg compared with those in the control group. Activities of β -glucuronidase (GLU) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the peritoneal macrophages were significantly increased in the MAK 4 -treated mice at the doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg. GLU and LDH activities of peritoneal macrophages in the MAK 4 -treated mice at the doses of 100 and 200 mg /kg were significantly low compared with those in the control group. MAK 4 did not enhance spontaneous splenic lymphocyte proliferation at any dose in mice. Stimulation indices in the MAK 4 -treated groups at all doses were significantly higher than those of the control group. These results indicate that 10 and 50 mg/kg per day might be appropriate doses to enhance not only macrophage function but also lymphocyte responsiveness for the gastric intubation of MAK 4 in mice...|$|E

These preparations {{are part of a}} natural health care system from India, known as Maharishi Ayur-Veda. MAK- 4 and MAK- 5 are each composed of different herbs and are said to have maximum benefit when used in combination. This investigation evaluated the cancer inhibiting effects of MAK- 4 and MAK- 5, in vitro and in vivo. Methods In vitro assays: Aqueous extracts of MAK- 4 and MAK- 5 were tested for effects on ras induced cell transformation in the Rat 6 cell line assessed by focus formation assay. In vivo assays: Urethane-treated mice were put on a standard pellet diet or a diet supplemented with MAK- 4, MAK- 5 or both. At 36 weeks, livers were examined for tumors, sera for oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and liver homogenates for enzyme activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and NAD(P) H: quinone reductase (QR). Liver fragments of MAK-fed mice were analyzed for connexin (cx) protein expression. Results MAK- 5 and a combination of MAK- 5 plus MAK- 4, inhibited ras -induced cell transformation. In MAK- 4, MAK- 5 and MAK 4 + 5 -treated mice we observed a 35 %, 27 % and 46 % reduction in the development of urethane-induced liver nodules respectively. MAK- 4 and MAK 4 + 5 -treated mice had a significantly higher ORAC value (P vs. 152. 2 ± 15. 7 ORAC units, respectively). The urethane-treated MAK- 4, MAK- 5 and MAK 4 + 5 -fed mice had significantly higher activities of liver cytosolic enzymes compared to the urethane-treated controls and to untreated mice: GPX(0. 23 ± 0. 08, 0. 21 ± 0. 05, 0. 25 ± 0. 04, 0. 20 ± 0. 05, 0. 21 ± 0. 03 U/mg protein, respectively), GST (2. 0 ± 0. 4, 2. 0 ± 0. 6, 2. 1 ± 0. 3, 1. 7 ± 0. 2, 1. 7 ± 0. 2 U/mg protein, respectively) and QR (0. 13 ± 0. 02, 0. 12 ± 0. 06, 0. 15 ± 0. 03, 0. 1 ± 0. 04, 0. 11 ± 0. 03 U/mg protein, respectively). Livers of MAK-treated mice showed a time-dependent increased expression of cx 32. Conclusion Our results show that a MAK-supplemented diet inhibits liver carcinogenesis in urethane-treated mice.
