5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E

The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E

5|$|By 21 July 1914, the British had {{postponed}} {{delivery of}} Reşadiye and Sultan Osman-ı Evvel as tensions flared in Europe following {{the assassination of}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June. This action prompted a protest by Djemal Pasha, the Ottoman naval minister, via France, {{in the hopes of}} securing the ships' delivery. A transport ship carrying crews for the two battleships departed Constantinople on 4 August, only to be recalled on 7 August after the Ottoman government was informed that the dreadnoughts would not be delivered. First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to detain the two ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them; two days later, British sailors boarded the ships and formally seized them. Since Britain was not yet at war, these actions were illegal; the British government nevertheless determined to present the Ottomans with <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> On 3 August, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire informed the government that Britain had seized the ships.|$|E

He explains that mankind has systematically used “the devil biscuit” to oppress his species. He vows never {{to allow the}} Crunchy Cracker to wield such power over him. Just then Veronica enters. Efforts thwarted once already, Baalthazar maneuvers Veronica into singing a burlesque interpretation of a song he knows Armitage wouldn’t suspect could “go blue” - because it’s a song that Armitage himself wrote (Paint A Rainbow). Baalthazar wagers that once they see it performed, the audience will get a taste for Veronica’s risqué “feather dance” and it will become <b>an</b> inevitable <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> that the show must “go blue”. When Armitage finally sees what’s happening on stage though, he’s mortified. As the number finishes, the Machiavellian macaw victoriously takes the spotlight. As he had predicted, the audience responds with hoots and hollers. He then reveals to the audience that the feather dance was his idea after all. Armitage takes the stage, once again expressing his deep disappointment with the conniving parrot. Impetuously Baalthazar, yet again, storms out of the theatre.

Serum is a source of chemical and experimental variability in vitro and can introduce adventitious microbial contami-nants. Serum is not an absolute in vitro requirement, since several primary cell strains and long-term cell lines can be grown continuously in serum·free culture medium. Large volumes of high-quality sera are becoming increas-inglydifficult and expensive to obtain. The need for serum, its proposed functions, and prospects for the development of biologically adequate alternatives are considered. -J Nat! Cancer Inst 53 : 1449 - 1457, 1974. MAMMALIAN CELLS undergo a variety of pheno-typic and genotypic alterations following explanta-tion and growth in vitro. Changes in morphology, karyotype, and enzyme patterns reflect both the instability of certain cell characteristics and the adaptability of the cell to its external milieu. The foregoing Symposium discussions critically evaluated tissue culture methods (1) and media (2) and assessed how these might perturb the cell in culture. Since most investigators who employ tissue culture use serum to supplement the chemically defined portion of the medium, it is appropriate to consider the use of serum, its proposed functions, and its problems...|$|R

At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia as the best way of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an Austro-Serbian war would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved not waiting to complete judicial inquiries to strike back immediately and not to strain its credibility in the coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination.

In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment, and then presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was really in Germany's favour or how significant it was.

On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally say so explicitly. Al-Tabari does say explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (wali l-'ahd) (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged.

500|$|As a Polish {{delegate}} at the Paris Peace Conference and a signatory of the Versailles Treaty, Dmowski exerted {{a substantial}} {{influence on the}} Treaty's favorable decisions regarding Poland. On 29 January 1919, Dmowski met with the Allies' Supreme War Council for the first time; his five-hour presentation there, delivered in English and French, was described as brilliant. At the meeting, Dmowski stated that he {{had little interest in}} laying claim to areas of Ukraine and Lithuania that were formerly part of Poland, but no longer had a Polish majority. At the same time Dmowski strongly pressed for the return of Polish territories with Polish-speaking majorities taken by Prussia from Poland in 1790s. Dmowski himself admitted that from a purely historical point of view, the Polish claims to Silesia were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds, especially the coal fields. Moreover, Dmowski claimed that German statistics had lied about the number of ethnic Poles living in eastern Germany and that, [...] "these Poles were some of the most educated and highly cultured in the nation, with a strong sense of nationality and men of progressive ideas". In addition, Dmowski, with the strong backing of the French, wanted to send the [...] "Blue Army" [...] to Poland via Danzig, Germany (modern Gdańsk, Poland); it was the intention of both Dmowski and the French that the Blue Army create <b>a</b> territorial <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> This proposal created much opposition from the Germans, the British and the Americans, and finally the Blue Army was sent to Poland in April 1919 via land.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} the Oslo Accords, {{the interim}} self-government agreements signed {{between the government}} of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), during the period 1993 - 1995. It suggests that the Israeli recognition of the PLO as the official representative of the Palestinian people did not translate into an acceptance that the Palestinians possessed an equal national right to the territories that both peoples claimed. The acceptance of the PLO as a strategic partner ironically served to consolidate Israel's post- 1967 settlement presence in the West Bank and Gaza strip. It provided Israel with the means to achieve a separation of peoples without a withdrawal from the occupied territories, to keep the land but not its indigenous population. Through {{the structure of the}} Palestinian interim self- governing agreements, the Rabin government sought to 'persuade' the PLO to abandon its goal of Palestinian statehood through a complex co-optation process. In this situation, Israel would control the terms and momentum of the interim period, bringing the PLO into a position of substantial authority under its aegis while simultaneously creating <b>an</b> irreversible <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> that would impel the Palestinian leadership to forego its demands for sovereignty and settle for an alternative, permanently sub-sovereign final status arrangement instead. But in contrast to preceding analyses of Oslo, this study argues that these circumstances cannot be wholly interpreted in Realist terms, as an instance of traditional power politics or an act of shrewd statecraft. It is undeniably true that the key Israeli leaders at the time, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, were manipulating the Oslo Accords to their own ends, but this deliberative process cannot be fully explained at the level of agency. It must instead be understood as reflecting a new logic of rule that has been explicated in the works of the theorists Gilles Deleuze and Michael Hardt...|$|R
