5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than mouse lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland.|$|E

500|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is nocturnal, {{sleeping}} {{during the day}} in tree holes lined with leaf litter or purpose-built spherical nests constructed from dead leaves, moss and twigs. [...] It usually forages <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> but may sleep in groups during the day, the composition of which depends on gender and season.

500|$|The midnight poem is a {{fragment}} of Greek lyric poetry preserved by Hephaestion. [...] It is possibly by the archaic Greek poet Sappho, and is fragment 168 B in Eva-Maria Voigt's edition of her works. [...] It is also sometimes known as PMG fr. adesp. 976 [...] that is, fragment 976 from Denys Page's Poetae Melici Graeci, {{a fragment}} not attributed to any author (fragmenta adespota). [...] The poem, four lines describing a woman <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> {{is one of the}} best-known surviving pieces of Greek lyric poetry. Long thought to have been composed by Sappho, the poem {{is one of the most}} frequently translated and adapted of the works ascribed to her.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{describes}} the speaker – a woman, as the adjective [...] "" [...] {{in the final}} line is feminine – lying <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> [...] Clay suggests that this was intended to allude to, and contrast with, the myth of Selene and her mortal lover Endymion, who were reunited each night. [...] Other authors, such as Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, have read the poem as describing the speaker waiting for a lover. Paula Reiner and David Kovacs note, however, that the poem says nothing explicitly about waiting. [...] Instead, they suggest, the poem might equally well {{be read as a}} generalised complaint of loneliness rather than being specifically concerned with a lover's absence; Odysseus Tsagarakis says that [...] "the feeling of loneliness is most beautifully expressed by Sappho" [...] in this fragment.|$|E
60|$|After all, {{the books}} had served his purpose, {{as well as}} kept him from {{brooding}} when he sat <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>nights</b> while the icy wind howled round his dwelling. He passed for a sage and something of a prophet with the primitive Dubokars, his Indian friends regarded him as a medicine man, and both had unknowingly made his search for the petroleum easier. Then, contrary to his expectations, he had found speculators in London willing to venture a few hundred pounds on his scheme, but the amount was insufficient and the terms were exacting. It would pay him better {{to get rid of}} his associates. He was growing old; it would be too late to return to his former life unless he could do so soon, but he must make a fair start with ample means. The man had no scruples and no illusions; money well employed would buy him standing and friends. People were charitable to a man who had something to offer them, and the blot upon his name must be nearly forgotten.|$|R

5000|$|The Crafts {{and other}} abolitionists publicized {{the history of}} Salomé Müller, a German {{immigrant}} orphaned as an infant soon after arrival in New Orleans. Though Muller (later known as Sally Miller) was completely of European descent, she had been enslaved since infancy. The threat of white girls being seized and thrown into slavery prompted Parker Pillsbury to write to William Lloyd Garrison: [...] "A white skin is no security whatsoever.

500|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is {{described}} as solitary but social, foraging <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> but frequently sleeping in groups during the day. [...] This social pattern varies by gender, season, and location. [...] Females tend to share nests with other females and their offspring, whereas males tend to sleep alone or in pairs outside of the breeding season. [...] Groups of females sharing a nest can be relatively stable, consisting of two to nine individuals, although a male may be found {{with a group of}} females outside the breeding season. [...] During the breeding season (September through October), males and females may sleep in the same tree hole. [...] Mixed sex groups can be common at this time, with single males sharing nest sites with three to seven females or single females sharing nest sites with one to three males.|$|E
500|$|Lemurs {{are social}} {{and live in}} groups that usually include fewer than 15individuals. Observed social {{organization}} patterns include [...] "solitary but social", [...] "fission-fusion", [...] "pair bonds", and [...] "multi-male group". Nocturnal lemurs are mostly solitary but social, foraging <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> but often nesting in groups during the day. The degree of socialization varies by species, gender, location, and season. In many nocturnal species, for instance, the females, along with their young, will share nests with other females and possibly one male, whose larger home range happens to overlap one or more female nesting groups. In sportive lemurs and fork-marked lemurs, one or two females may share a home range, possibly with a male. In addition to sharing nests, they will also interact vocally or physically with their range-mate while they forage at night. Diurnal lemurs exhibit many of the social systems seen in monkeys and apes, living in relatively permanent and cohesive social groups. Multi-male groups are the most common, {{just as they are}} in most anthropoid primates. True lemurs utilize this social system, often living in groups of ten or less. Ruffed lemurs have been shown to live in fission-fusion societies, and Indri forms pair bonds.|$|E

Jim, on a visit to Dwight's beet farm, finds Dwight sitting <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> contemplating Angela's cherub figurine and moaning in anguish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album is}} partly {{inspired}} {{by the death of}} Hay's father in 2010. On the album's release, Hay noted, [...] "The loss of my father last year brought an unavoidable emotional contingent to writing and recording. I don’t have a definitive belief in an afterlife, but I do feel like I had his help when I was working on this album, especially <b>alone</b> late <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> in the studio. ...

Their songs generally touch on love, romance, and failed or fleeting romance, as hinted by the band's name. Their description further reads, [...] "We have songs about walking home <b>alone</b> late <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> orange skies, tired footwear, feeling like a tv show that should be canceled, and purple umbrellas—among a vast array of other mundane/extraordinary things". The band also said it believes in the International Pop Underground Convention.|$|R

2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the title, the song is about the {{subconscious}} fears from deep within the soul which manifest themselves when the singer is <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> Written mainly by Philip Adrian Wright, {{it is based on}} his experience in trying to sleep after reading a horror novel. [...] The low synthesiser tones are designed to be haunting, are slow at the beginning, deliberately dark and melancholy. The instrumental increases tempo to a frenzy of pitch blending as the song reaches its culmination. It is a track that still contains the obvious influences of the original Human League of Oakey, Ware, Marsh and Wright.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the failure}} of Operation Dove, Ryan {{remained}} in Berlin. Between Autumn 1940 and January 1943 {{he lived in a}} [...] "large gloomy flat" [...] in Berlin with an acquaintance from Ireland, Helmut Clissmann, and Hans Ritter, both of whom were Abwehr assets. Clissmann was married to Elizabeth [...] "Budge" [...] Mulcahy of Sligo, a friend of both Ryan and Leopold Kerney. As an exchange student in Dublin in the 1930s Clissmann had known Ryan and other republicans and socialists well; before Hitler came to power, he {{had been a member of}} a left-wing student organisation. Ryan was not in good health as a result of his wound and treatment in the Spanish prison, and at one stage he had a stroke, but he remained convivial and drew around him a small circle of friends. He had to remain incognito and in general did not discuss politics. He grew increasingly deaf (though his friends suggested that he sometimes feigned deafness to avoid uncomfortable conversations with the German authorities) so that he could not be left <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> – he could not hear the anti-aircraft sirens. He later had to spend his days outdoors or in cafés (where he became friendly with Francis Stuart, whom he had known from Dublin) so that people could see him if the sirens sounded. He took Irish newspapers to Stuart and, being in a position to get extra rations, shared them generously with his friends. In return, Stuart took Ryan, who had a lot of time on his hands, on trips to the countryside and on outings with his students. Stephen Hayes, Chief of Staff of the IRA, claimed that Ryan and Stuart were carrying out propaganda work among Irish prisoners of war. This was untrue. They visited a camp for Irish prisoners, who signified their intent of joining an [...] "Irish Guard". Ryan and Clissmann also visited a camp containing some men who intended setting up this Guard. Ryan had nothing to do with this and the scheme came to nothing. Ryan regretted visiting the camp and told Stuart that the whole scheme disheartened him – he only had sympathy with men who were, like he and his comrades had been, in prison camps.|$|E
