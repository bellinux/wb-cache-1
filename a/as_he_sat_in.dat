25|$|Hoy {{arrived in}} Athens {{in the form}} of his life. His main event was the Kilo Time Trial. He was ranked No 1 and was last man off. The sea level World Record was broken four times <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the track centre waiting for his start. He had been {{involved}} in an accident in the athlete's village just a few days prior to competition where he came off his bike in front of a village bus, narrowly avoiding serious injury. As {{he came out of the}} starting gate, his scarred arms and legs showed how close he was to not competing.|$|E
500|$|Before he left, Carlton plotted to {{kill the}} {{residents}} of Taliesin. His primary target was draftsman Emil Brodelle, who had called Carlton a [...] "black son-of-a-bitch" [...] on August 12 for not following an order. Brodelle and Carlton also engaged in a minor physical confrontation two days later. He planned the assault, targeting the noon hour, when Borthwick, her children, and the studio personnel would be {{on opposite sides of}} the property awaiting lunch. Wright was away in Chicago completing Midway Gardens while Borthwick stayed at home with her two children, 11-year old John and 9-year-old Martha. On August 15, Carlton grabbed a shingling hatchet and began an attack. He started with the Borthwicks, who were waiting on the porch off the living room. Mamah Borthwick was killed by a single blow to the face, and her son John was slaughtered <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> his chair. Martha managed to flee, but was hunted down and slain in the courtyard. He then coated the bodies in gasoline and lit them on fire, setting the house ablaze.|$|E
500|$|On 8 November 2007 two RIRA members shot an off-duty PSNI officer <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> his car on Bishop Street in Derry, causing {{injuries}} {{to his face}} and arm. On 12 November another PSNI member was shot by RIRA members in Dungannon, County Tyrone. On 7 February 2008, the RIRA stated that, after experiencing a three-year period of reorganisation, it intended to [...] "go back to war" [...] by launching a new offensive against [...] "legitimate targets". It also, despite having apologised for the Omagh bombing, denied any large scale involvement with the attack and said that their part had only gone as far as their codeword being used. On 12 May 2008 the RIRA seriously injured a member of the PSNI when a booby trap bomb exploded underneath his car near Spamount, County Tyrone. On 25 September 2008 the RIRA shot a man in the neck in St Johnston, near the Derry border. The same man was targeted in a pipe bomb attack on his home on 25 October, the RIRA did not claim responsibility for the attack, but security forces believe they were responsible for it.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} {{the words of}} [...] "Your condescension has made me great," [...] to allude to Abraham.

60|$|There was a half {{reluctant}} admiration in Prince Shan's eyes <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> back <b>in</b> the dim {{recesses of}} his box and scrutinised his visitor. La Belle Nita had learnt all that Paris and London could teach her.|$|R
60|$|When Loo {{died the}} stateliness and {{stiffness}} of James Auberly gave way, and the stern man, leaning his head upon the coffin, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>in</b> the darkened room, wept <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> {{had been a}} little child.|$|R

2500|$|On September 10, 2002, in {{the course}} of a bitter custody dispute, Gilbride testified in court that MOVE had {{threatened}} to kill him.

2500|$|Police detectives {{later said}} it {{appeared}} Ferguson {{had been planning}} the shooting {{for more than a}} week. Chief Joseph Flynn of the Long Island Rail Road police said, [...] "This was the work of a deranged, maniacal person who {{for a variety of reasons}} decided to explode." [...] None of Ferguson's victims were black, although it was unclear whether any other black passengers were aboard the train. Ferguson showed no emotion <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the back of a police car, which some passengers said was as shocking and disturbing as the violence of the shooting itself. Upon seeing Ferguson, one of the victims became hysterical and shouted, [...] "How can he be sitting there so calm after everything he did?" ...|$|E
60|$|NEXT morning Jim Crow woke up hungry, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> lazily <b>in</b> his big nest, {{he remembered}} {{that he had seen}} four pretty brown eggs, {{speckled}} with white, in the nest of the oriole that lived {{at the edge of the}} forest.|$|R

50|$|Crispin Blunt {{has also}} {{encountered}} judgement for reportedly being a Muslim Brotherhood advocate, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> has <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> on {{meetings with the}} group and has spoken publicly about how the Brotherhood {{should not have been}} ousted in 2013.|$|R
2500|$|He {{was then}} {{cared for by}} his son George, his daughters, Almena and Mary Susan Gotwald, who {{were living in the}} King Homestead during the time period, and, of course, by his ever-faithful wife Mary Elizabeth for the next five years. The fact that he did recover some of this health is {{evidenced}} by photos taken of him standing and smiling and in the fact that he participated in the founding of the Calvary Lutheran Church in Springfield in 1900—the year of his death. However, he died in Springfield, Ohio later that year on September 15, 1900. As his grandson, Luther A. Gotwald, Sr. reports it, [...] "on [...] evening, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> his chair by his desk, he had just asked his wife to open the Bible and read their evening lesson together. Suddenly, as a result of another heart attack, he passed away, painlessly and quietly".|$|E
2500|$|.....while talking or even musing <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> his chair, he {{commonly}} held {{his head to}} one side towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E

She only wanted to [...] "scare" [...] Brody, but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the passenger seat and said he wouldn't stop raping girls, she ultimately crashed his car intentionally. Claire begs her father not to tell anyone, and Bennet merely says he'll take care of it. Bennet then appears in Brody's room, followed by the Haitian. He says that she is going through 'a confusing time', telling that he knows of her powers. He tells the boy that he is being given a chance to start over in life and Bennet then tells the Haitian to [...] "hollow him out" [...] and [...] "take everything" [...] (erase all of Brody's memories, including that of his own name).|$|E
