40|$|This {{investigation}} elucidates {{the load}} capacities of wooden shores and <b>adjustable</b> steel <b>tube</b> shores that {{are commonly used}} in construction. A series of loading tests was performed based on actual setups used on construction sites. Research results reveal that the load capacity of an isolated wooden or an <b>adjustable</b> steel <b>tube</b> shore declines as its length increases, and the load capacity of <b>adjustable</b> steel <b>tube</b> shores greatly exceeds that of wooden shores of the same length in isolated and multi-post shoring systems. A wooden shore fails by buckling under compression load. The failure of an <b>adjustable</b> steel <b>tube</b> shore in tests is due to buckling when the shore length exceeds 3. 96 m, and the failure will be resulted from damage of connecting tube lock if the shore length is less than 3. 96 m. When the top block of the <b>adjustable</b> steel <b>tube</b> shore is a wooden stringer, the load capacity is remarkably less than when it is a steel block. <b>Adjustable</b> steel <b>tube</b> shores will be reduced in load capacity after reuses. The load capacity of an isolated shore is reduced when the shore is placed on an inclined base. Reinforcing an isolated wooden shore with horizontal wooden bars and iron wires increases its load capacity. However, when an isolated wooden shore is reinforced with lateral cable bracings, the load capacity is not affected. Inserting the woodblock under an isolated wooden shore on an inclined plane can increase the load capacity of the shore. The multi-post shoring system that is reinforced with horizontal bracings only slightly affects the total load capacity of the system studied in this paper.

5000|$|The hot tube engine [...] is a {{relative}} of the hot bulb engine with better timing control. The hot bulb engine only ran well at one speed- and a low one at that, typically 100 RPM. The timing of a hot tube engine is controlled by means of varying {{the length of the}} Hot-tube ignitor, which is longer and thinner than the hot bulb on a hot bulb engine. Length of the tube controls when the charge ignites, and allows different operating speeds to be selected. If made variable, this makes for adjustable engine speed, but also induces a mechanical weakness in the engine which tends to lead to failure. Both engine types are now replaced by diesels, which can be made to operate over varying loads and speeds in any size with modern methods. Hot bulbs are still used in remote areas where the extreme fuel flexibility is a major advantage. Hot tube engines may also be found there, if their difficulties with the <b>adjustable</b> <b>tube</b> can be overcome, or accepted and lived with.|$|E

The true dual-exhaust with H-shaped crossover system came standard with Flowmasters and chrome exhaust tips. Power was routed to the ground through a sturdy, four-speed manual transmission with a single, dry-disc clutch. A three-speed automatic was made available as an option.

40|$|Lactic acid is an {{important}} commercial product and has been widely used for manufacturing biodegradable polymer. Current method of lactic acid isolation from fermentation broths is energy intensive and leads {{to the formation of}} large amounts of salts. Reactive liquid-liquid extraction has been reported as an alternative to isolate lactic acid. In our work, reactive extraction of lactic acid from aqueous phase using tri-n-octylamine (TOA) in n-octanol has been investigated in capillary microreactors operated under the slug flow regime. A typical microreactor setup consists of a Y-inlet junction for the generation of aqueous droplets and organic slugs, a PTFE capillary microreactor with <b>adjustable</b> <b>tube</b> lengths (with diameter of 0. 8 mm) for extraction under slug flow, and a Y-splitter at the exit for the separation of the organic and aqueous phases based on the wettability difference. The experiments were performed at a 1 to 1 flow ratio of the aqueous to organic phase, with total flow rates ranging from 5 to 25 ml/h and 15 % (V/V) TOA in n-octanol as the organic phase. Complexation of lactic acid and TOA combined with slug flow operation were found to enhance mass transfer rate significantly. The extraction of lactic acid (intake: 0. 11 and 0. 055 M) reached equilibrium after a residence time of about 1. 5 minutes without a noticeable emulsion formation. The extraction efficiency appeared to be only a function of the residence time. The physical extraction behavior of the microreactor system under slug flow operation was further studied using a model system for the extraction of acetanilide from water to n-octanol. A simple model according to the penetration theory was developed for the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient in physical extraction. The experimental results on the reactive extraction of lactic acid can be well described by this mass transfer model combined with an instantaneous reaction assumption...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Estimating {{depths of}} buried lava tubes is {{important}} for determining the thermal budgets and effusion rates of certain volcanic systems. This research uses a laboratory experiment scaled to an observed lava tube system to measure the 3 D temperature field surrounding a buried depth <b>adjustable</b> glass <b>tube</b> with hot honey flowing through it at varying conditions such as flow rate and temperature. Numerical techniques are used to model the laboratory experiment. The input parameters are then applied to non-laboratory situations. The surface thermal distributions from these models are analyzed to empirically derive a depth estimation function using regression techniques. This depth function is the first scaleable depth estimation technique which can be solved with remote sensing data alone. The minimum temperature, maximum temperature and width of a Lorentzian distribution, fit to a surface thermal transect, {{are used in the}} function to predict depth to the hot source. Sensitivity and error analysis of the function is carried out for depths ranging from 0. 01 m to ± 60 m with good results.

40|$|AbstractPneumopericardium {{is a rare}} {{clinical}} presentation and is an unusual complication of tracheostomy. Its isolated presentation without associated air in other potential space such as mediastinum or pleura causes difficulty in diagnosis especially in patient with invasive ventilation. We report a case of 72 -year-old lady who developed isolated pneumopericardium following tracheostomy. The progression into cardiac tamponade was halted by administration of fluid resuscitation and modifying ventilation mode to spontaneous setting. A flexometallic endotracheal tube was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma {{with the aid of}} fibre-optic scope while she was breathing spontaneously; and the cuff was inflated distal {{to the site of the}} tracheal wall injury.

40|$|In {{connection}} with {{measurements of the}} inactivation (destruction) of dissolved crystalline pepsin by ultraviolet light, determinations were made of the absorption spectrum of preparations of pure crystalline pepsin. From these data, the molecular extinction coefficient curve may be deduced. The pepsin used was prepared by Dr. John H. Northrop; through his kindness sufficient amounts of several preparations were made available (cf. Northrop, 1929 - 30 a, b). The crystalline pepsin in known dilutions in a suitable buffer solvent was put into 2 cm. glass photometer <b>tubes</b> or into <b>adjustable</b> micro Baly <b>tubes</b> with quartz end-plates. Corresponding control tubes were filled with the same dilution of the solvent solution. The tubes {{were placed in the}} paths of twin beams of light in a quartz sector photometer. The light source was a tungsten steel spark, 3 ram. gap, heated with a gas flame, and operated at 6600 volts from a transformer taking 17 amperes at 110 volts on the primary winding. The transmission spectra were recorded on panchromatic photographic plates, using a large quartz spectrograph (Judd-Lewis, 1919, 1922; cf. Gates, 1930 - 31). The ratio of intensities incident on the two tubes was varied by means of the photometer sector vanes, over a wide range of intensities. When the length of liquid traversed by the light is kept constant the extinction coefficient is calculated from Beer's law.

40|$|Detonation {{of a high}} {{explosive}} produces shock-blast wave, shrapnel, and gaseous products. While direct exposure to blast is a concern near the epicenter, shock-blast can affect subjects even at farther distances, which is termed as primary blast injury, which {{is the theme of}} this work. The shock-blast profile is characterized with blast overpressure, positive time duration, and impulse as shock-blast wave parameters (SWPs). These parameters in turn are a function of field factors, such as the strength of {{high explosive}} and the distance of the human subjects from the epicenter. The shape and magnitude of the profile determine the severity of injury to the subjects. As shown in some of our recent works (Chandra et al., 2011;Sundaramurthy et al., 2012;Skotak et al., 2013), the profile not only determines the survival of the animal but also the acute and chronic biomechanical injuries along with the following bio-chemical sequelae. It is extremely important to carefully design and operate the shock tube to produce field relevant SWPs. Furthermore, it is vital to identify and eliminate the artifacts that are inadvertently introduced in the shock-blast profile that may affect the results. In this work, we examine the relationship between shock <b>tube</b> <b>adjustable</b> parameters (SAPs) and SWPs {{that can be used to}} control the blast profile; the results can be easily applied to many of the laboratory shock tubes. Further, exact replication of shock profile (magnitude and shape) can be related to field explosions and can be a standard in comparing results across different laboratories. 40 experiments are carried out by judiciously varying SAPs such as membrane thickness, breech length (66. 68 to 1209. 68 mm), measurement location, and type of driver gas (nitrogen, helium).

Firstly, shock <b>tube</b> <b>adjustable</b> parameters (SAPs) such as breech length, type of gas and membrane thickness were used for controlling and producing desired blast waves by manipulating shock wave parameters (SWPs). Secondly, using a surrogate head model, the data from the laboratory experiments were compared with experimental data obtained from the field explosions data to show the validity of the laboratory experiments. Finally, effect of test section location on the fidelity of the rat model in simulating field conditions was studied. Through these steps a standardized and accurate method of replicating the field blast was established. Using the standardized methodology to model blast waves, the intracranial pressure for various incident pressures on the rat model was studied. Furthermore, to understand the mechanisms of loading and to study the influence of field variables, a finite element model of rat along with the simple ellipsoidal model was developed.

30|$|The commercially {{available}} vortex <b>tube</b> (<b>adjustable</b> cold air gun, ITW Vortec Ltd.) is a compact and simple mechanical device {{that can produce}} cold air at different temperatures and flow rates from a stream of compressed gas without any moving parts, chemical reactions, or external energy supply. The source of compressed air was either medical air cylinders supplied by L’Air Liquide Ltd. (St. Thomas, ON, CA), with a capacity of 6569  L at fill pressure of 15, 617  kPa downregulated to 344  kPa, or a hospital medical air outlet at fixed outlet pressure of 344  kPa. High-pressure compressed air from either source {{was applied to the}} inlet nozzle of an electropneumatic pressure regulator (PULSTRONIC II series 605, Numatics Inc.) to monitor and precisely regulate the pressure of compressed air before entering the vortex tube. The compressed air then passed through a generation chamber (inside the vortex tube) which created the vortices inside the tube and caused the compressed air flow to be separated into a cold and a hot stream traveling in opposite directions in the tube. The fraction of compressed air exiting as cold air (also referred as cold fraction ratio) was adjusted by a throttle needle valve via a stepper motor (IMDE 17 -M Integrated Motor/Driver, RMS Technologies Inc., NV, USA). Both temperature and flow rate of the cold air stream were controlled and monitored continuously by a microprocessor-based digital controller that included a feedback system (Atmel’s AVR Microcontroller, ATmega 64 A 8 -bit with 64 K bytes in-system programmable flash). It automatically regulated the inlet pressure and fraction ratio based on the desired cold output air temperature and flow rate from the vortex tube to tightly control the brain temperature and rewarming rate throughout the experiments. Moreover, the temperature of air exiting the cold air outlet of the vortex tube was monitored and recorded continuously with a thermometer (Thermometer/Data Logger, HH 309 A, with Four Type K Thermocouple Inputs, Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT; resolution 0.1  °C). Intranasal brain cooling was achieved by connecting two nasal catheters (made from polyvinyl chloride, PVC) to the tube from the cold air outlet of a vortex tube. The catheters were coated with 2  % lidocaine gel for local anesthesia and ensuring their better contact with turbinates in the nasal cavity and were inserted 8 – 10  cm into each nostril. A thermistor was also placed inside one of the two nasal catheters to monitor temperature inside the nasal cavity throughout the experiments.
