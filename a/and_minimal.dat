40|$|AbstractLet G=(VG,EG) be {{a simple}} {{connected}} graph. The eccentric distance sum of G is defined as ξd(G) =∑v∈VGεG(v) DG(v), where εG(v) is the eccentricity of the vertex v and DG(v) =∑u∈VGd(u,v) {{is the sum of}} all distances from the vertex v. In this paper we first characterize the extremal trees among n-vertex conjugated trees (trees with a perfect matching) having the <b>minimal</b> <b>and</b> second <b>minimal</b> eccentric distance sums. Then we identify the trees with the <b>minimal</b> <b>and</b> second <b>minimal</b> eccentric distance sums among the n-vertex trees with matching number m. Finally, we characterize the extremal tree with the second minimal eccentric distance sum among the n-vertex trees of a given diameter. Consequently, we determine the trees with the third <b>and</b> fourth <b>minimal</b> eccentric distance sums among the n-vertex trees, which is a continuance study as the results in [G. H. Yu, L. H.

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape <b>and</b> <b>minimal</b> contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, McClellan was {{nominated}} by the Democrats for Governor of New Jersey, {{an action that}} took him by surprise because he had not {{expressed an interest in}} the position. He accepted the nomination, was elected, and served a single term from 1878 to 1881, a tenure marked by careful, conservative executive management <b>and</b> <b>minimal</b> political rancor. The concluding chapter of his political career was his strong support in 1884 for the election of Grover Cleveland. He sought the position of secretary of war in Cleveland's cabinet, for which he was well qualified, but political rivals from New Jersey were able to block his nomination.|$|E
5|$|In late May and June he {{collected}} and experimented {{on a number}} of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft's agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his target, in the blind spot of the observer, and angle his guns directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much better chance of shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball's advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way. McCudden's principal tactics did stress surprise <b>and</b> <b>minimal</b> risk.|$|E

The Manual Crimsons football team, which {{had also been}} consolidated with Male's from 1915 to 1918, had great success in the 1920s, beating Male {{two years in a}} row for the first time in its history. Manual shared athletic facilities with Male for many years, but in the early 1920s alumni raised funds to construct Manual Stadium. The stadium opened in 1924 with 14,021 permanent seats. It was one of the largest high school stadiums in America at the time. The original structure was condemned and closed in 1952 after years of heavy use <b>and</b> <b>minimal</b> upkeep, and was reopened after being rebuilt in 1954. Its modern capacity is 11,463.|$|E
5|$|Now {{returning}} to its pre-Kensington route, NY33 follows a six-lane, divided Genesee Street past the airport {{on one side}} and numerous associated businesses such as hotels and fast food restaurants on the other. The large aerospace contractor Calspan has its headquarters here, and Westinghouse once operated a large industrial lathe plant on the airport side of the road (it was torn down when the airport was rebuilt in the late 1990s). Beyond the airport, the divider ends, the travel lanes are reduced to four and, after a short curve <b>and</b> <b>minimal</b> descent, NY33 intersects Transit Road (NY78) and enters the town of Lancaster. After this junction, the highway becomes a two-lane route once again through the small hamlet of Bowmansville, where it crosses Ellicott Creek near some rapids.|$|E

The zoo began to be neglected after the sale of Belle Vue in 1925, but it was rejuvenated by the appointment of Gerald Iles as zoo superintendent in 1933.

5|$|Quainton Road {{station was}} built on a curve in {{the line at the}} nearest point to the Duke's estates at Wotton. Six miles (10km) {{northwest}} of Aylesbury, it was southwest of the small village of Quainton and immediately northwest of the road connecting Quainton to Akeman Street. The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a level crossing immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway had spent most of their limited budget on the construction of the line itself. Details of the design of the original Quainton Road station are lost, but {{it is likely that the}} station had a single timber-covered earth platform <b>and</b> <b>minimal</b> buildings; it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive.|$|E

Radio was recorded during 1984 to 1985 at Chung King House of Metal in New York City and produced primarily by Rick Rubin, who provided a sparse <b>and</b> <b>minimal</b> production style. The album also features a sound punctuated by DJ scratching, often brief samples, and emphasis of the downbeat. LL Cool J's aggressive b-boy lyrics explored themes of inner city culture, teenage promiscuity, and braggadocio raps.|$|E
