Cheenu continues his futile attempts to gain her attention, and the train eventually leaves with Viji not recognising him.

25|$|This {{theory has}} been {{developed}} with great attention to local analysis, leading {{to the definition of}} the Tate-Shafarevich group. In general the approach of taking the torsor theory, easy over an algebraically closed field, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back 'down' to a smaller field is an aspect of descent. It leads at once to questions of Galois cohomology, since the torsors represent classes in group cohomology H1.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Bucharest, Moscovici {{reported}} to his party about the matter, and organized a public protest against Conservative Party rule. Joining him in this effort were other veterans of the Bulgarian campaign, including his lifelong friends Constantin Titel Petrescu and Toma Dragu, alongside the socialist physician Ecaterina Arbore. The authorities moved to organize a court-martial, but withdrew the request when faced with public outcry. In August 1913, Moscovici was in Dobreni commune, Neamț County, addressing the local peasants <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them interested in the PSDR agenda.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 2006, the German Federal Supreme Court {{ruled on}} the appeals: They {{considered}} the evidence as sufficient {{to prove that}} Motassadeq knew about and {{was involved in the}} preparation of the plan to hijack the planes and is hence guilty of accessory in 246 counts of murder. This is the number of victims that died in the planes but does not include the victims on ground. The Oberlandesgericht (state supreme court) in Hamburg then took up the trial again in order to decide on the sentencing. Two days later, the Federal Supreme Court also revoked the release order and Motassadeq was arrested again. On January 8, 2007, he was sentenced by the Oberlandesgericht Hamburg to 15 years in prison, the maximum sentence possible under German law. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany did not accept to revise his case. On May 2 the Federal Court of Justice of Germany rejected a plea for revision. His lawyers are currently thinking about both calling upon the European Court of Human Rights <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the case reopened - his two ultimate legal choices left.|$|E

Youkilis said, [...] "I'm not worried about making the error. I'm worried about trying to help the team win <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an out any way we can."

500|$|In {{his closing}} argument, Coakley {{described}} a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences, beginning at Camp Shoemaker {{shortly after the}} explosion when {{two and a half}} companies were mixed together for two weeks. Coakley stated that conspiratorial talk among the men about refusing to work <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of loading ammunition was the root of their August 9 mass refusal. Coakley described how the mutiny continued in the barge when Joe Small spoke to the men and asked them to stick together. Coakley entered into the record his definition of mutiny: [...] "Collective insubordination, collective disobedience of lawful orders of a superior officer, is mutiny." [...] He gave his opinion that men who admitted in time of war that they were afraid to load ammunition were of a low moral character and were likely to give false testimony.|$|E

Trainor told [...] MTV News, [...] "Here's me being sassy {{and other people}} dancing with me and having just a good time <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through this feeling of, Ugh he's cheating on me again". The video was commissioned by information technology corporation Hewlett-Packard. It features several [...] "influencers"—actors, dancers and set designers with large social media followings. The influencers featured in the video include set designer Bri Emery; actors Marcus Johns, Cody Johns, and Robby Ayala; YouTube star Liza Koshy; dancers Les Twins; Spanish stylist Sara Escudero; hair stylist Kristin Ess; Japanese nail artist Mei Kawajiri; American dancer Chachi Gonzales; and Pomeranian dog Barkley the Pom. Andelman suggested showcasing behind-the-scenes events occurring during a music video shoot, which {{was used as the}} video's theme.

[...] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term [...] "womanizing", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated. In his original wording, Abernathy had claimed he saw King coming out of his room with a lady when he awoke the next morning and later claimed that [...] "he may have been in there discussing and debating <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her {{to go along with the}} movement, I don't know." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{performed}} the song again on her 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, while playing an electric guitar and adding vocoder voice {{effects on the}} background harmonies.

During the performance a video backdrop portrayed American singer Britney Spears trapped in an elevator <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out, while kicking the walls. At the end of the performance, the doors opened to reveal Spears saying the phrase [...] "It's Britney, bitch", from her song [...] "Gimme More" [...] (2007). Madonna explained that she intended the video to stand as an analogy of Spears' career, saying [...] "Didn't that explain what I thought? 'I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me". On November 6, 2008 in the Los Angeles show at Dodger Stadium, Spears joined Madonna onstage halfway through the performance. Aidin Vaziri from Gibson.com was positive in his review, saying that the best moment of the tour was when Madonna picked up her black Les Paul guitar and emulated musician Slash while performing the song. Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine was negative in his review of the performance, saying that by the time the performance of [...] "Human Nature" [...] had started, [...] "it's the same as all her shows: A remixed mind-fuck". The performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release, recorded during Madonna's four shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2008.|$|E

2500|$|After {{encouraging}} legion X, Caesar went to {{the right}} wing. Things looked bad.

[...] All (six) centurions of the fourth cohort were dead, its standard bearer killed and the standard missing. [...] Of the remaining cohorts, almost all the centurions were either wounded or killed; Baculus, the legion’s primipilus, a fine soldier, had received so many minor and serious wounds that he could barely stand. The Nervii were attacking vigorously from lower ground and pressing at the front and both flanks. [...] Caesar could see some men were shirking <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the rear; others were slowly ceasing effective resistance. There were no reserves. This was the crisis-point. [...] He took a shield from a soldier at the rear and {{went to the}} first line. [...] Calling his centurions by name, he ordered them to have the soldiers advance (signa inferre) and the maniples open up and extend. [...] As he tells it, his arrival brought hope and boosted the soldiers’ morale. Every man was now keen to do well in front of his general. As a result, the enemy assault was checked slightly.|$|E
