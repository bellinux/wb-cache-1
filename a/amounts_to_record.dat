The departure was represented by the band's 1966 album Pet Sounds and reached a tipping point one year later with Smile, which was abandoned and left unfinished. At the time, Anderle was a portrait artist and talent manager who Wilson recently befriended and employed {{as the head of}} the Beach Boys' new label, Brother Records. [...] Anderle later said that his original statement about the [...] "formula" [...] was [...] "taken slightly out of context", explaining that Love was not as concerned with the [...] "artistic" [...] side of business as he was with the [...] "bottom line". On those albums, instead of collaborating with Love, Wilson sought lyrics from jingle writer Tony Asher and multi-instrumentalist Van Dyke Parks. According to various reports, some of which have been disputed, the band resisted the new direction and were worried that Wilson was going to break away as a solo artist.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{delineate}} the influence of psychoanalytic theory {{on the development of the}} culture and personality school of anthropology. Anthropology was not without psychological elements before the advent of the culture and personality school; however, no unified attempt had been made to assess people of different cultures in strictly psychological terms. There was a great deal of ad hoc psychologizing, some of which <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> the <b>recording</b> of stereotypic old wives' tales about a particular culture. Some nineteenth century theorists tended to avoid entirely the question of the mental life of the people with whom they were concerned. Others, such as Tylor, Spencer, and Frazer were interested in psychological issues as they were related to religion and the concept of the soul. The avoidance of questions about the psychology of different cultures combined with the unsystematic psychologizing of some theorists left a void in the anthropological theory of the early twentieth century which was becoming of increasing concern to anthropologists...|$|R
