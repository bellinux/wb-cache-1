Her family had thought she would take this particular news badly, but Kendall seems okay with it.

500|$|While the {{transfer}} of Iraqi sovereignty was not decided during the summit, this transfer had some connections to the summit. First of <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the unexpected transfer was made public during the summit. BBC News reports that Iraq's foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari, speaking after a breakfast meeting with Blair in Istanbul on June 28, [...] "slipped" [...] prematurely that the handover of sovereignty to his country was being brought forward {{to coincide with the}} meeting. Later that day, US National Security advisor Condoleezza Rice gave US president Bush during the summit the following note: [...] "Mr. President, Iraq is sovereign. Letter was passed from [...] Bremer at 10:26 am Iraq time - Condi". Bush scribbled in the margin of this note: [...] "Let freedom reign!". Bush then turned to British prime minister Tony Blair, seated next to him, whispered that the handover had happened, and the two men shook hands. Later that day, Bush and Blair held a joint press conference, in which they welcomed {{the transfer}}. Secondly, the news of the handover pushed the summit from the front pages.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the first}} name of 'I' is not stated {{anywhere}} in the film, {{it is widely believed}} that it is 'Peter'. This myth arose {{as a result of a}} line of misheard dialogue.

In his reply, Monty both accepts his offer and says [...] "...you must tell me <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> I haven't seen you since you finished your last film". [...] While pouring another drink, and downing his own, Withnail replies that he has been [...] "Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff". Then pointing at Marwood he says [...] "He's just had an audition for rep". Some fans hear this line as [...] "Peters had an audition for rep", although the original shooting script and all commercially published versions of the script read [...] "he's".|$|E

2500|$|Montagu's Turkish {{letters were}} to prove an {{inspiration}} to later generations of European women travellers and writers. In particular, Montagu staked a claim {{to the authority of}} women's writing, due to their ability to access private homes and female-only spaces where men were not permitted. The title of her published letters refers to [...] "Sources that Have Been Inaccessible to Other Travellers". The letters themselves frequently draw {{attention to the fact that}} they present a different (and, Montagu asserts, more accurate) description than that provided by previous (male) travellers: [...] "You will perhaps be surpriz'd at an Account so different from what you have been entertaind with by the common Voyage-writers who are very fond of speaking of what they don't know.". Montagu provides an intimate description of the women's bathhouse in Sofia, in which she derides male descriptions of the bathhouse as a site for unnatural sexual practices, instead insisting that it was [...] "the Women’s coffee house, where <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the Town is told, Scandal invented, etc". However, Montagu's detailed descriptions of nude Oriental beauties provided inspiration for male artists such as Ingres, who restored the explicitly erotic content that Montagu had denied. In general, Montagu dismisses the quality of European travel literature of the 18th century as nothing more than [...] "trite observations…superficial… boys [...] only remember where they met with the best wine or the prettyest women.".|$|E
