She married Shantanu on condition that their children inherit the throne, denying the birthright of Shantanu's eldest son (and crown prince) Bhishma. Satyavati bore Shantanu two children, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu's death, she and her prince sons with the help of Bhishma ruled the kingdom. Although both her sons died childless, she arranged for her first son, Vyasa, to father the children of the two widows of Vichitravirya through niyoga. The children, (Dhritarashtra and Pandu) became the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas respectively. After Pandu's death, Satyavati went to the forest for penance <b>and</b> <b>breathed</b> her last before witnessing the Kurukshetra War.|$|E

The group's performance was led by former chorus member Fred Knittle, who suffered from congestive heart failure <b>and</b> <b>breathed</b> with assistance from an oxygen tank. The performance was originally planned to be a duet between Knittle and Bob Salvini, another former chorus member, but Salvini died shortly before the show. Knittle performed it as a solo, {{as a tribute to}} his friend. The performance was initially recorded for a British documentary that aired on Channel 4; footage of the performance was uploaded to YouTube in November 2006 to positive response. An expanded version of the film, titled Young@Heart, debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival and was released in US theatres in 2008.|$|E

40|$|SummarySleep <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> are {{physiological}} {{processes that}} begin in utero and undergo progressive change. While the major period of change for both sleep <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> occurs {{during the months}} after birth, considered a period of vulnerability, more subtle changes continue to occur throughout childhood. The systems that control sleep <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> develop separately, but sleep represents an activity state during which <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> control is significantly altered. Infants and young children may spend up to 12 hours a day sleeping; therefore, the effects of sleep on breathing are fundamental to understanding both processes in childhood. This review summarizes the current literature relevant to understanding the normal development of sleep <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> across infancy <b>and</b> childhood...|$|R

She took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a retirement position for prominent politicians <b>and</b> <b>breathed</b> new life into the role. Robinson brought to the presidency legal knowledge, deep intellect, and political experience. She reached out to the Irish diaspora (the large number of Irish emigrants and people of Irish descent). She also changed the face of Anglo-Irish relations, when she was the first serving Irish president to visit the United Kingdom and meet Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. She welcomed visits by senior members of the British royal family, most notably the Prince of Wales, to her official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin.|$|E

By the time these younger folk singers arrived on the scene, the political climate had changed enough to provide a wide audience for protest music." [...] The passage of time may well have made the controversy moot. Writing in the British daily The Guardian, again in an obituary for Reynolds, Ken Hunt asserted that [...] " [...] helped to turn untold numbers of people on to folk music... hey put the boom in folk boom.

500|$|In the {{creation}} of Todd Manning, no one played a larger role than the remarkably talented Josh Griffith, first associate head writer, then co-head writer, during my stay at One Life. Josh loved, lived <b>and</b> <b>breathed</b> Todd and fought passionately for {{his position on the}} show. Second, Todd never would have evolved from [...] "first frat boy" [...] to the major cast member he became without the powerful talent of Roger Howarth. Because of Roger's ability to convey the complexity of Todd (the hurt as well as anger, the insecurity as well as bluster, the brains, yearning, manipulativeness, sexiness, tenderness, nastiness) we were able to explore both the deeply dark side of this character (the effort to destroy Marty to cover the rape, the attempted revenge on his lawyer Nora, the attack on Luna) {{and at the same time}} slowly uncover his growing struggle (usually a failed struggle) towards some kind of redemption. Romantic leads have often begun their careers playing villains (Valentino, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart among them). These characters appeal because they make women feel both the thrill of the [...] "bad" [...] and the lure of the hidden [...] "good": they can lead the man to change through love. [...] "I'll save him!" [...] Fans loved Todd from the beginning because he always had that appeal.|$|E

500|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics overseas. Priya Joshi of the website Digital Spy gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "The film is invested {{with a healthy}} dose of Shah Rukh, the very heart and saans of Yash Chopra and the message which he lived <b>and</b> <b>breathed</b> through his films: that love is eternal." [...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons of}} the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy will be hard to match." ...|$|E

In the same year, Novello contributed to André Charlot's revue See-Saw. In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the operette Arlette, for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by Jane Vieu and Guy le Feuvre. In the same year, Marsh {{introduced him to the}} actor Bobbie Andrews, who became Novello's life partner. Andrews introduced Novello to the young Noël Coward. Coward, six years Novello's junior, was deeply envious of Novello's effortless glamour.

[...] Sales of the 1964 Sting Ray reached 22,229 - another new Corvette record, if up only a little from banner-year 1963. Coupe volume dropped to 8304 units, but convertible sales more than compensated, rising to 13,925.|$|E
