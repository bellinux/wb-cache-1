5|$|Many governments now {{prohibit}} {{removal of}} coral from reefs, and inform coastal residents about reef protection <b>and</b> <b>ecology.</b> While local action such as habitat restoration and herbivore protection can reduce local damage, the longer-term threats of acidification, temperature change and sea-level rise remain a challenge.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology <b>and</b> <b>ecology,</b> produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E

5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and geography) is the {{comparative study of}} the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography <b>and</b> <b>ecology</b> share many of their disciplinary roots.

It continues to attract its share of visitors although the local authorities have been continually adding new restrictions on access.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior <b>and</b> <b>ecology</b> of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E
5|$|Progressively more {{sophisticated}} scientific technology has aided {{the development of}} contemporary botanical offshoots in the plant sciences, ranging from the applied fields of economic botany (notably agriculture, horticulture and forestry), to the detailed examination of the structure and function of plants and their interaction with the environment over many scales from the large-scale global significance of vegetation and plant communities (biogeography <b>and</b> <b>ecology)</b> through to the small scale of subjects like cell theory, molecular biology and plant biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Similarities that lemurs {{share with}} anthropoid primates, such as diet and social organization, {{along with their}} own unique traits, have made lemurs the most heavily studied of all mammal groups on Madagascar. Research often focuses on the link between ecology and social organization, but also on their {{behavior}} and morphophysiology (the study of anatomy in relation to function). Studies of their life-history traits, behavior <b>and</b> <b>ecology</b> help understanding of primate evolution, since they are thought to share similarities with ancestral primates.|$|E

5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is a non-fiction book by Canadian {{academic}} Thomas Homer-Dixon. It {{was written}} {{over the course}} of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf. The book argues that the nature of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex and that our ability to implement solutions is not keeping pace. Homer-Dixon focuses upon complexities, unexpected non-linear results, and emergent properties. He takes an inter-disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, <b>and</b> <b>ecology.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is {{a popular}} science book. Homer-Dixon takes an inter-disciplinary {{approach}} connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, biology, <b>and</b> <b>ecology.</b> The narrative is structured as a travelogue as the author travels to meet experts and construct his theory. His observations along the way illustrate the concepts he is explaining and supplement interviews and research. Collecting pieces of his theory from each of his interviews and destinations appears as a recurring metaphor. He includes anecdotes and social commentary.|$|E
