5|$|Carlos {{arranged}} bus and plane {{travel for}} his team and 42 of the original 63 hostages, with stops in <b>Algiers</b> and Tripoli, planning to fly eventually to Baghdad, where Yamani and Amuzegar were to be killed. All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in <b>Algiers,</b> excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to <b>Algiers.</b> With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boumédienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in {{an attack on the}} plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, then he and his comrades left the plane. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.|$|E
5|$|In 1785 Barbary pirates, {{most notably}} from <b>Algiers,</b> began to seize American {{merchant}} {{vessels in the}} Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794. The act provided funds to construct six frigates, but included a clause that if peace terms were agreed to with <b>Algiers,</b> {{the construction of the}} ships would be halted.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} United States {{declared}} war against Britain in 1812, <b>Algiers</b> {{took advantage of}} the United States' preoccupation with Britain and began intercepting American merchant ships in the Mediterranean. On 2 March 1815, at the request of President James Madison, Congress declared war on <b>Algiers.</b> Work preparing two American squadrons promptly began—one at Boston under Commodore William Bainbridge, and one at New York under Commodore Steven Decatur.|$|E
5|$|The newly {{installed}} French {{colonial government}} promptly exiled Rainilaiarivony to <b>Algiers.</b> Ranavalona and her court were initially permitted {{to remain as}} symbolic figureheads, but the outbreak of a popular resistance movement– the menalamba rebellion– and discovery of anti-French political intrigues at court led the French to exile the queen to the island of Réunion in 1897. Rainilaiarivony died that same year and shortly thereafter Ranavalona was relocated to a villa in <b>Algiers,</b> along with several members of her family. The queen, her family and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living including occasional trips to Paris for shopping and sightseeing. Despite Ranavalona's repeated requests, she was never permitted to return home to Madagascar. She died of an embolism at her villa in <b>Algiers</b> in 1917 {{at the age of}} 55. Her remains were buried in <b>Algiers</b> but were disinterred 21 years later and shipped to Madagascar, where they were placed within the tomb of Queen Rasoherina {{on the grounds of the}} Rova of Antananarivo.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the Barbary states took {{advantage}} of the weakness of the United States Navy to again capture American merchant ships and sailors. After the Treaty of Ghent was signed, the United States looked at ending the piracy in the Mediterranean which had plagued American merchants for two decades. On 3 March 1815, the U.S. Congress authorized deployment of naval power against <b>Algiers,</b> beginning the Second Barbary War. Two powerful squadrons under the command of Commodores Stephen Decatur, Jr. and William Bainbridge, including the 74-gun ships of the line , , and , were dispatched to the Mediterranean. Shortly after departing Gibraltar en route to <b>Algiers,</b> Decatur's squadron encountered the Algerian flagship Meshuda, and, in the Action of 17 June 1815, captured it. Not long afterward, the American squadron likewise captured the Algerian brig Estedio in the Battle off Cape Palos. By June, the squadrons had reached <b>Algiers</b> and peace was negotiated with the Dey, including a return of captured vessels and men, a guarantee of no further tributes and a right to trade in the region.|$|E

5|$|In September 1973, he {{returned}} to <b>Algiers</b> to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference. At the conference he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's {{close relationship with the}} U.S. and its treatment of Palestinians during the Israel–Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian territory from Israeli incursions. Leaving <b>Algiers,</b> Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|James then flew to <b>Algiers,</b> {{where he}} was {{publicly}} paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around <b>Algiers,</b> so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade {{for a few more}} days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona died {{without ever}} having {{returned}} to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on the pretext of insufficient funds in the colonial coffers.

Ranavalona was buried at the Saint-Eugene cemetery in <b>Algiers</b> at 10:00a.m. on May 25.

5|$|In 1959, the Pieds-Noirs {{numbered}} 1,025,000, {{and accounted}} for 10.4% {{of the total population}} of Algeria, a percentage gradually diminishing since the peak of 15.2% in 1926. However, some areas of Algeria had high concentrations of Pieds-Noirs, such as the regions of Bône (now Annaba), <b>Algiers,</b> and above all the area from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abbès.

5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} <b>Algiers,</b> {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in <b>Algiers,</b> Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E
5|$|The {{cumulation}} of {{all these}} events led Washington to request Congress to establish a standing navy. After a contentious debate, Congress passed the Naval Armament Act on March 27, 1794, authorizing construction of six frigates (to be built by Joshua Humphreys). These ships were the first ships of what eventually became the present-day United States Navy. Soon afterward, Congress also authorized funds to obtain a treaty with <b>Algiers</b> and to ransom Americans held captive (199 were alive at that time, including a few survivors from the Maria and the Dauphin). Ratified in September 1795, the final cost of the return of those held captive and peace with <b>Algiers</b> was $642,000, plus $21,000 in annual tribute. The president was unhappy with the arrangement, but realized the U.S. {{had little choice but}} to agree to it. Treaties were also concluded with Tripoli, in 1796, and Tunis in 1797, each carrying with it an annual U.S. tribute payment obligation for protection from attack. The new Navy would not be deployed until after Washington left office; the first two frigates completed were: United States, launched May 10, 1797; and Constitution, launched October 21, 1797.|$|E
