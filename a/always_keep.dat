5|$|The {{process of}} {{integrating}} is easiest with two rats of young age, generally {{less than six}} months old. The process of integrating is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are the least likely to accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established. Unless there is an issue integrating rats together, owners should <b>always</b> <b>keep</b> them in a group of at least three, as rats live in packs and a pack starts with three animals.|$|E
5|$|In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, {{a teacher}} from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, {{which she did}} in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The {{settlement}} included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would <b>always</b> <b>keep</b> their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.|$|E

25|$|Souls {{then begin}} cycles of reincarnation. It {{generally}} takes 10,000 {{years for a}} soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life {{three times in a}} row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and <b>always</b> <b>keep</b> its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.|$|E
25|$|She {{became a}} fan of hip hop music {{at the age of}} 14 and {{improved}} her English by listening and rapping along to famous American rappers such as Eminem. At the age of 15, she started hanging out with lots of bad guys, which made her parents worry about her and therefore <b>always</b> <b>keep</b> an eye on her. The reason she chose music to be her career is that it made her feel safe. She was also interested in skateboarding, and accepted the invitation to join a nu-metal band covering Linkin Park’s songs. She then quickly became a well-recognized and respected rapper from the Vietnamese underground scene.|$|E

25|$|After the martyrdom of Guru Arjan, his son Guru Hargobind at age eleven {{became the}} sixth guru of the Sikhs and Sikhism {{dramatically}} evolved {{to become a}} political movement {{in addition to being}} religious. Guru Hargobind carried two swords, calling one spiritual and the other for temporal purpose (known as mīrī and pīrī in Sikhism). According to the Sikh tradition, Guru Arjan asked his son Hargobind to start a military tradition to protect the Sikh people and <b>always</b> <b>keep</b> himself surrounded by armed Sikhs. The building of an armed Sikh militia began with Guru Hargobind. Guru Hargobind was soon arrested by the Mughals and kept in jail in Gwalior. It is unclear how many years he served in prison, with different texts stating it to be between 2 to 12 years. He married three women, built a fort to defend Ramdaspur and created a formal court called Akal Takht, now the highest Khalsa Sikh religious authority.|$|E

500|$|McCain's {{campaign}} {{fell into}} early debt; his wife began loaning him {{tens of thousands}} of dollars to keep it alive. [...] Donations also came in from Jim Hensley and other Hensley & Co. executives, but the amounts grew large enough that the Federal Election Commission forced some of it to be returned. [...] By the close of the primary, McCain was able to outspend his opponents; more of than half of his primary expenditures were financed by the eventual $167,000 that his wife lent to the campaign. [...] (The McCains had made a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would <b>always</b> <b>keep</b> their finances apart and file separate income tax returns. [...] In the end, $93,000 of the 1982 loan would be forgiven.) [...] The spending advantage made itself felt in television advertising, including a highly effective two-minute mini-documentary that presented him as new leader for Arizona with a record of service to the country. [...] Rival Mack later called that ad the best political commercial he had ever seen.|$|E
500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in {{bed beside}} Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} it was funny but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [...] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." [...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not <b>always</b> <b>keep</b> a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|E

The later prototypes had ailerons boosted by hydraulic power and artificial feel to the stick from a spring, as an interim measure but Brown found [...] "the second prototype was much less the pleasant aircraft to fly as the stick continually hunted either side of neutral and there was no build up of stick force with increase in speed." [...] The Spearfish lacked any sort of stall warning, which would have been a problem in operational use as the stall and approach speeds were fairly close. For the landing, the aircraft proved quite docile.|$|E

500|$|A quiet, social bird, the huia was monogamous, and pairs {{probably}} paired for life. The {{bird was}} usually found in breeding pairs, although sometimes {{groups of four}} or more were encountered. Walter Buller records that a tame pair would <b>always</b> <b>keep</b> close to each other, constantly uttering a [...] "low affectionate twitter", even when in captivity. There are records of this same pair and a further, wild pair [...] "hopping from branch to branch and fanning their tails, then meeting to caress each other with their bills" [...] and uttering these noises. The male {{is said to have}} fed the female in courtship. It is thought that these behaviours may have been a sexual display. The claim that the male fed the female while she was incubating and on the nest [...] "lacks evidence". When the male of this captive pair was accidentally killed, the female [...] "manifesting the utmost distress pined for her mate and died 10 days afterwards". A Māori man in the 19th century recalled: [...] "I was always told by my old people that a pair of huia lived on most affectionate terms... If the male died first, the female died soon after of grief". The huia had no fear of people; females allowed themselves to be handled on the nest, and birds could easily be captured by hand.|$|E
