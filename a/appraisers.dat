5|$|A {{delegation}} of landowners presented the ORD Real Estate Branch with a petition protesting {{the acquisition of}} their property on 23 November 1942, and that night over 200 landowners held a meeting at which they agreed to hire lawyers and <b>appraisers</b> to challenge the Federal government. Local newspapers and politicians were sympathetic to their cause. By the end of May 1943, agreements were reached covering 416 tracts totaling , but some landowners rejected the government's offers. The ORD Real Estate Branch invoked a procedure under Tennessee law that allowed for a jury of five citizens appointed by the Federal District Court to review the compensation offered. They handled five cases in which they proposed higher values {{than those of the}} ORD <b>appraisers,</b> but the landowners rejected them as well, so the Army discontinued the use of this method. In response to rising public criticism, O'Brien commissioned a review by the Department of Agriculture. It found that the appraisals had been fair and just, and that farmers had overestimated the size and productivity of their land.|$|E

This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent <b>appraisers,</b> the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner.|$|E

50|$|For example, an <b>appraiser</b> {{inspecting}} a {{house may}} not be qualified to detect a termite infestation without an extensive expert investigation. Depending on {{the scope of work}} expected by the users of the appraisal and the appraisal's limiting conditions, if the <b>appraiser</b> has not observed any indications of an infestation in his normal investigation, the <b>appraiser</b> may omit such an investigation and make a general assumption that the property is not infested with termites and not have to meet the analysis and reporting requirements of an extraordinary assumption. However, the limiting conditions and description of the scope of work would need to make it clear to the users of the report the extent of the <b>appraiser's</b> investigation of the subject property and that the focus of the <b>appraiser's</b> investigation was determination of characteristics relevant to valuation and not the explicit detection of termites which would be the purview of a termite or structural home inspector and probably beyond the expertise of the <b>appraiser.</b>|$|R

25|$|These {{sorts of}} {{collections}} are not enjoyed by mainstream collectors and traditional collectors, {{even though they}} themselves may {{have in the past}} or continue to have pieces which could be considered part of an aesthetic collection. One of the issues with this category is that the coins can be seen to have less perceived value to speculators and <b>appraisers.</b> Secondly the coins may be produced artificially, that is coins can be exposed to substances which can create effects similar to those sought for aesthetic collections. This means that coins which may be worth more to historians, numismatists and collectors for their purposes will be destroyed by the process.|$|E
25|$|When Winchester died, {{all of her}} {{possessions}} (apart {{from the}} house) were bequeathed to her niece and personal secretary. Her niece then took everything she wanted and sold the rest in a private auction. It supposedly took six trucks working {{eight hours a day}} for six weeks to remove all of the furniture from the home, an account disputed by Winchester's biographer. Mrs. Winchester made no mention of the mansion in her will, and <b>appraisers</b> considered the house worthless due to damage caused by the earthquake, the unfinished design and the impractical nature of its construction. It was sold at auction to a local investor for over $135,000, and subsequently leased for 10 years to John and Mayme Brown, who eventually purchased the house. In February 1923, five months after Winchester's death, the house was opened to the public, with Mayme Brown serving as the first tour guide. Harry Houdini toured the mansion in 1924 and the newspaper account of his visit (displayed in the rifle museum on the estate) called it the Mystery House.|$|E

[...] Four people were convicted and served prison time for these acts.

500|$|Although War Department policy {{maintained}} that land should be acquired by direct purchase, as time was short {{it was decided}} to proceed immediately with condemnation. This allowed access to the site for construction crews, provided faster compensation to the owners, and expedited the handling of property with defective titles. On 28 September 1942, the ORD Real Estate Branch opened a project office in Harriman with a staff of 54 surveyors, <b>appraisers,</b> lawyers and office workers. The ORD Real Estate Branch was quite busy at this time, as it was also acquiring land for the Dale Hollow Reservoir, so some staff were borrowed from the Federal Land Bank and the TVA. The next day, Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson authorized the acquisition of [...] at an estimated cost of $3.5 million. At the request of the ORD Real Estate Branch attorneys, the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee issued an order of possession on 6 October, effective the next day. Recognizing the hardship that it would cause to the landowners, it restricted immediate exclusive possession to properties [...] "essential to full and complete development of the project".|$|E
