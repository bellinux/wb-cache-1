5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight's {{personal}} pronouns distinguish three persons, and two genders. Pronouns {{appear in}} three forms: an independent form {{used in the}} subject position, a possessive suffix (and a derived independent possessive pronoun), and an object form <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> controlling verb.|$|E
5|$|In August 1649 {{a wooden}} {{staircase}} {{was built to}} the outside wall of the tower and an open iron fire grate <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top. Originally it was planned to burn coal in the lighthouse, but due to high transport costs of coal, wood was used instead.|$|E
5|$|Manchu shamans {{typically}} wore an apron, a feathered cap denoting {{their ability}} to fly to the spirit world, and a belt with dangling bells, and carried a knife, two wooden sticks with bells <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top, and a drum they used during ceremonies. These attributes could still be observed among shamans from Manchuria and Mongolia {{in the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
50|$|A clear {{difference}} with nominals is that verbs derived directly from roots, with no suffix (or only a thematic vowel), were very common. Such verbs expressed the basic verbal {{meaning of the}} root. Various suffixes were available to derive new verbs, either by <b>affixing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> root, or by <b>affixing</b> <b>to</b> an existing verbal or nominal stem.|$|R
50|$|Largely ceremonial, {{it can be}} used {{much like}} the American tomahawk, both thrown for short {{distances}} and as a melee weapon in hand-to-hand combat. It differs from the usual axe style, in that <b>the</b> blade mounts <b>to</b> looping prongs that <b>affix</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shaft.|$|R

5|$|The curse {{ended on}} October 29, 2008 when the Phillies won the World Series, {{a year and}} four months after a {{statuette}} of the William Penn figure atop City Hall was <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final beam put in place during the June 2007 topping-off of the Comcast Center, then the tallest building in the city.|$|E
5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E
5|$|Both {{boats were}} {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1909, with U-4 commissioned in August and U-3 in September. During the evaluations {{conducted by the}} Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke. To remedy the diving problems of the U-3-class, the fins were changed in size and shape several times. Eventually the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hull.|$|E

5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
5|$|The handcarts were {{modeled after}} carts used by street {{sweepers}} and were made {{almost entirely of}} wood. They were generally six to seven feet (183 to 213cm) long, wide enough to span a narrow wagon track, and could be alternately pushed or pulled. The small boxes <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carts were three to four feet (91 to 122cm) long and eight inches (20cm) high. They could carry about 500 pounds (227kg), most of this weight consisting of trail provisions and a few personal possessions.|$|E
5|$|To {{recognize}} the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. By tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east side of Jones AT Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the great}} stir raised in England about Slavery, my Brethren being anxious to {{suppress}} censure, which some are always glad <b>to</b> <b>affix</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> priesthood, have begun some years ago, and are gradually proceeding <b>to</b> emancipate <b>the</b> old population on their estates. To proceed {{at once to}} make it a general measure, would not be either humanity toward the Individuals, nor doing justice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trust, under which the estates have been transmitted and received.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Knight, helm, mantling, crest (or coronet or crown) and sword are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain {{permanently}} <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Ladies) since 1911. The entryway just outside the doors of the chapel has the names of the Order's Knights from before 1911 inscribed into the walls giving a complete record {{of the members of the}} order.|$|E
5|$|I {{found they}} begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious procession: {{a party of}} young people procure {{the head of a}} dead horse, which is affixed to a pole about four feet in length; a string is <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw; a horse-cloth is also {{attached}} to the whole, under which one of the parts gets, and by frequently pulling the string, keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied {{by the rest of the}} party, grotesquely habited, with hand-bells; they thus proceed from house to house, ringing their bells, and singing carols and songs; they are commonly gratified with beer and cake, or perhaps with money. This is called, provincially, a Hodening.|$|E
5|$|The United States, Canada and Germany, {{together}} with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful {{first day of}} competition. The protest alleged that her helmet was illegal, as ridges in it might give her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected the helmet, and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so were that the ridges in the helmet were not a separate piece <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> helmet, expressly banned by FIBT rules, but rather {{an integral part of}} the helmet, which made the helmet legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.|$|E
50|$|Aavik tried <b>to</b> {{modernize}} even <b>the</b> grammar. He {{advocated the}} usage of i-plural instead of t(d)-plural (keelis pro keeltes) and the i-superlative instead of the ordinary superlative (suurim pro kõige suurem), as well as -nd instead of -nud in active past participle. He proposed inflexional <b>affixes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ma-infinitive, but only some of them entered into popular usage. He also tried to introduce a future form of verbs and a female personal pronoun, but these got little positive response.|$|R

50|$|Initially {{there was}} {{a high degree of}} {{correspondence}} between the logical view of DASD accesses and the actual hardware, as shown in the illustration above. Three digit labels were typically <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> address of channel, control unit and device.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} the Rova's {{buildings}} possessed unique design features. The modest wood building then known as Manjakamiadana was also called Felatanambola ("Silver Hands") for the hand-shaped sculptures crafted from melted silver piastres and attached {{to each of the}} building's four tandrotrano (roof horns)—an architectural design element formed from the crossed gable beams that extended past the roof line of all traditional aristocratic Merina houses. Felatanambola's decorative silver hands were later <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof horns of Besakana. Another distinctive building from this period was called Bevato ("Many Stones") because its foundation was atypically composed of stone blocks. Manatsara was said to be the most well constructed of the many houses because it was built using ambora (Tambourissa parrifolia), an extremely durable and rot-resistant indigenous hardwood, rather than a traditional wood called hazomena (Weinmannia rutenbergii). According to oral history, Manatsara was treasured by Andrianampoinimerina and the house was quite old but still well preserved in the mid-19th century when Queen RanavalonaI decided to recover its interior walls with wood taken from Sihanaka country.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E
5|$|Postmaster General James Farley {{occupied}} two adjoining suites in {{the current}} Waldorf Astoria during his tenure {{as the chairman of}} the board of Coca-Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for over 30 years from after the end of his presidency until he died in 1964; former President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there until he died in 1969. MacArthur's widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was fond of the Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Since Hoover, every President of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not fond of the Presidential Suite.|$|E

50|$|Although not {{technically}} money, each certificate {{was intended to}} circulate with a value of one dollar. The intent of <b>the</b> program was <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> certificates circulating and discourage hoarding. To achieve this, a holder had <b>to</b> <b>affix</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of a certificate a 1-cent stamp {{before the end of}} every week, for <b>the</b> certificate <b>to</b> maintain its validity. But the hassle and expense of the stamps made the certificates unpopular with <b>the</b> public. <b>To</b> make matters worse, the tiny postage-style stamps (smaller than 1 cm²) were prone to falling off. As the program intended, possessors of <b>the</b> certificates tried <b>to</b> avoid having <b>to</b> purchase and <b>affix</b> <b>the</b> stamps, by spending the certificates before the week's validity expired. The certificates then fell into in the hands of merchants, who would then purchase and <b>affix</b> stamps <b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> notes' validity.|$|R
50|$|Luciferianism is {{a belief}} system that venerates the {{essential}} characteristics that are <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> Lucifer. <b>The</b> tradition, influenced by Gnosticism, usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a liberator, a guardian or guiding spirit or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah.|$|R
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Madagascar {{is unique in}} Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the {{architecture of}} southern Borneo from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar {{are believed to have}} emigrated. Traditional construction in this part of Borneo, also known as South Kalimantan, is distinguished by rectangular houses raised on piles. The roof, which is supported by a central pillar, is steeply sloped; the gable beams cross to form roof horns that may be decoratively carved. The central Highlands of Madagascar are populated by the Merina, peoples who bear strong physiological and cultural resemblance to their Kalimantan ancestors; here, the traditional wooden houses of the aristocracy feature a central pillar (andry) supporting a steeply sloped roof decorated with roof horns (tandro-trano). In the southeast of Madagascar, actual zebu horns were traditionally <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gable peak. Throughout Madagascar, houses are rectangular with a gabled roof as in Kalimantan, central pillars are widespread, and in all but a handful of regions, traditional homes are built on piles in a manner handed down from generation to generation, regardless of whether the feature is suited to local conditions.|$|E
5|$|The nine {{remaining}} gliders transporting {{the airborne}} troops assigned to Group Granite successfully {{landed on the}} roof of Fort Eben-Emael, using arrester-parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt. The airborne troops rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements {{on the top of the}} Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges. In the southern part of the Fort, Objective No. 18, an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge, which collapsed the casemate's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself. Objective No. 12, a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops, who then moved to Objective No. 26, a turret holding another three 75mm weapons; although explosives were detonated against this and the airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off, this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers, who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it. Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola was disabled, as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops. However, attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful; the objective, twin turrets with heavy-calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola, was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own, forcing troops from two gliders to be used. Primitive unlined shaped charges were <b>affixed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> turrets and detonated, but whilst they shook the turrets they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels.|$|E

30|$|The {{galvanic}} redox process {{described here}} is straightforward and can generate Ag–Si composite particles {{in an easy}} and controllable manner. During this process, Si particles act as mild reducing agents {{as well as the}} reaction site, which the Si particle–aqueous solutions interface. Thus we could control the Ag nuclei formation on the site and prevent random nucleus formation, which occurs during the traditional redox system of producing Ag particles. The formed bundle of Ag nuclei mainly <b>affixes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface of Si particles; therefore, an additional dispersant <b>to</b> restrict <b>the</b> Ag nuclei gathering process is not required.|$|R
50|$|Amongst land divisions, the Number 3 uniform (also {{known as}} the working dress) was {{enhanced}} with the buttons sewn on (instead of using metal rings previously) in 2004, while the name tag was changed from using a metal pin <b>to</b> Velcro for <b>affixing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uniform. In 2006, riveted buttons, which {{were considered to be}} more secure, were introduced <b>to</b> replace <b>the</b> sewn on buttons. The trousers come with additional side pockets mid-way down the thighs with the main purpose of providing a convenient location for the M-pod, a PDA-sized gadget slated to be launched. Separately, the Police Maternity Dress was also introduced.|$|R
