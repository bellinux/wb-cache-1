40|$|A novel {{screening}} {{platform for}} potential retroviral fusion inhibitors {{on the basis}} of fully functional membrane‐anchored coiled coil lipopeptide receptors has been established. The work comprises the scrutiny of lateral organization of functional lipids in phase separated bilayers and an in‐depth investigation of the biophysical properties of lipopeptide‐based receptors. Lateral sorting of lipids was detected by the recognition of streptavidin of biotinylated lipids in phase separated bilayers and by nanoscopic patterns in mixed fluorocarbon / hydrocarbon lipid bilayers, employing temperature controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM) as a versatile characterization method. Particular features of fluorocarbon bilayers were additionally investigated in great detail by means of ellipsometry and ATR‐IR spectroscopy. Lipopeptide‐receptors were synthesized {{on the basis of}} a robust and reliable in situ coupling reaction by coupling terminal cysteine modified receptor‐peptides to a maleimide functionalized lipid bilayer. Receptor functionality of the lipopeptides was visualized by specific binding of vesicles and nanoparticles tracked by a multiplicity of characterization methods, such as AFM, ellipsometry, CLSM and fluorescence spectroscopy. Finally, in situ coupling of viral peptides, originating from the fusion protein of HIV resulted in a mimic of the pre‐hairpin intermediate of gp 41.

This paper presents a 3. 75 horsepower VSD/PM motor based FCA system having sufficient compactness to fit within the space allocated for the motor and fan in a typical FCA system of this size. A significant power density is achieved in the VSD by using Current Source Converter (CSC) based interface as the front end interface to the 440 V distribution system.

50|$|A linear {{induction}} motor consists of two parts: the primary <b>coil</b> <b>assembly</b> and the reaction plate.

40|$|A {{primary goal}} in {{designing}} <b>a</b> superconducting <b>coil</b> is mechanical stability. It {{may also be}} desirable to provide some interturn insulation for coils using large ratios of copper to super-conductor. If the superconductor is in strip form for winding into edge-cooled pancakes, an organic adhesive and insulation can provide a convenient means of meeting these criteria. Such an organic system must provide enough flexibility at liquid helium temperatures to accommodate relative motions due to temperature differentials or differences in thermal expansion. Very few organic materials are known to retain any appreciable ultimate elongation at liquid helium temperatures. At liquid nitrogen temperatures fluorinated olefins (Teflons), polyimides (Kapton), polyethylene terephthalate (Mylar), and some polyurethanes retain an ultimate elongation of a few percent. Only the polyurethanes are practical adhesives for large coils and their sensitivity to moistllre is <b>a</b> problem during <b>coil</b> <b>assembly.</b> <b>A</b> practical solution is a two-component system consisting of an insulating film with good elongation properties and a strong adhesive used in a very thin layer. The elongation of the film protects the adhesive from excessive stress if the adhesive is thin enough {{that it does not}} fracture due to stress from its own high coef-ficient of thermal expansion. A two-component system corsisting of fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) film and an epoxy adhesive has been investigated for use as a cfyogenic adhesive system by Narmco for NASA.
