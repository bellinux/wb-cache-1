5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in <b>a</b> <b>bind.</b> The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E

25|$|This runestone is a runic {{inscription}} by the runemaster Öpir in {{the style}} Pr5 on a large boulder. It is located outside the railroad station in Södertälje. It was made in memory of two men {{who were in the}} east. The runic text is signed by the runemaster Öpir, and uses <b>a</b> <b>bind</b> rune to combine the a-rune and s-rune in the word hua=str, which is tentatively translated as austr ("east"). Öpir used the same a=s bind rune in inscription U 485 in Marma.|$|E
25|$|The monad {{represents}} computations with a sequential structure: a monad defines what {{it means}} to chain operations together. This enables the programmer to build pipelines that process data in a series of steps (i.e. a series of actions applied to the data), in which each action is decorated with the additional processing rules provided by the monad. A monad is defined by a return operator that creates values, and <b>a</b> <b>bind</b> operator used to link the actions in the pipeline; this definition must follow a set of axioms called monad laws, which are needed for the composition of actions in the pipeline to work properly.|$|E

25|$|Nanda was in <b>a</b> <b>bind.</b> His ministers {{warned that}} {{a failure to}} {{recapture}} Siam would trigger domino-like rebellions elsewhere in the empire. The problem was that he still did not have complete control over his vassals to raise a large enough force that had a reasonable shot at reconquering Siam. He tried to replace the vassals with his loyalists at every opportunity. In May 1584, he appointed Min Letya, son of King Tabinshwehti, as governor of Ava in place of Thado Minsaw. The office was strictly a non-hereditary governorship, not the viceroyship Thado Minsaw enjoyed. But Nanda could not replace hereditary rulers without cause. When Viceroy Minkhaung II of Toungoo died in June/July 1584, he had to accept the late viceroy's eldest son Minye Thihathu II as the rightful successor. Minye Thihathu II for his part pledged loyalty to his cousin.|$|E
25|$|The 90-minute {{pilot film}} {{initially}} aired on March 21, 1976.

In {{the end of}} the film the three women are caught in <b>a</b> <b>bind</b> and Scott attempts to save them, but to no avail, leaving them to solve the dilemma on their own (and with the help of allies made during the story). ABC executives were somewhat disappointed in this initial project, fearing there was more emphasis on light-weight fluff than serious drama. After viewing the pilot, Spelling encouraged executives to delete Scott Woodville from the series; according to The Charlie's Angels Casebook, audiences also reacted negatively to the character. Bosley was kept, made slightly less inept than depicted in the pilot, and was given many of Woodville's attributes and responsibilities. The series formally premiered on Wednesday, September 22, 1976 at 10:00pm.|$|E
500|$|Christine Love is a Canadian {{independent}} visual novel writer {{best known}} for her original works Don't Take It Personally, Babe, It Just Ain't Your Story; and Ladykiller in <b>a</b> <b>Bind.</b> Love began creating visual novels while in university, making a few small games, visual novels, and pieces of written fiction before coming into prominence with the release of Digital in 2010. She went on to work on Love and Order, a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso, as well as Don't take it personally, both released in 2011. Her first commercial project on which she was the primary developer is Analogue, released in February 2012; Love dropped out of her English degree during its development, and is currently a full-time game developer. She released an expansion to the game, titled Hate Plus in 2013. Her latest project, Ladykiller in <b>a</b> <b>Bind,</b> was released in October 2016.|$|E

500|$|That summer, Love {{began working}} on a larger, {{commercial}} game. She was beginning to believe that her games could be successful commercially, a belief supported by messages to that effect by fans of her previous works. The game, , was released in February 2012. Love dropped out of university during the game's development in her fourth year of an English undergraduate degree. She {{felt that she was}} [...] "not really learning a whole lot" [...] and was unable to balance school and work on the game. Set centuries after Digital: A Love Story, the plot of Analogue revolves around an unnamed investigator, who is tasked with discovering the reason for an interstellar ship's disappearance once it reappears 600 years after [...] "going dark". The game's themes focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues; but focus primarily on [...] "transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness and cosplay." [...] The release of Analogue, Love's first commercial game as main developer, currently fully supports her financially. Although Analogue is a sequel [...] "of sorts" [...] to Digital, the time difference between the two games means that they are connected more in spirit than directly, similar to the connections between Digital and Don't take it personally. Analogue sold over 30,000 copies by August 2012, and has inspired the release of a soundtrack album by the game's composer, Isaac Schankler, as well as a commercial expansion to the game, titled Hate Plus, which is intended to further develop the backstory of *Mute and the ship. In 2016, Love released a new visual novel, Ladykiller in <b>a</b> <b>Bind.</b> She described the game as [...] "an erotic visual novel about social manipulation and girls tying up other girls".|$|E

2500|$|This runestone {{in style}} RAK {{is located in}} Tuna. It was raised in memory of Özurr {{who was in the}} service of a king named Harald, who was {{probably}} the English king Harold Harefoot. Serving as a skipari or [...] "seaman" [...] on the king's longship was a great honour and Özurr was consequently part of the king's retinue, the þingalið. Other runestones unsing the title skipari include DR 82 in Sønder Vinge, DR 218 in Tågerup, DR 275 in Solberga, DR 363 in Sturkö, DR 379 in Ny Larsker, Sö 171 in Esta, and Sö 335 in Ärja. On this runestone, the runemaster used <b>a</b> <b>bind</b> rune to combine the s-rune and k-rune in skipari.

[...] The second set point was played out by a weakly lobbed shot by Evert was tracked down by Navratilova, and her opponent played another lob back, which Evert played horridly overhead smash shot. [...] This was still barely strong enough to force a measger return by Navratilova, which Evert volley the ball into the corner to take the opening set six games to four. [...] In the second set, Evert could not get her playing level back from the first set. [...] Evert was at one-all love-30 on Navratilova's serve, but was unable to get a break point off of her, which in the subsequent game her opponent would break her serve and the score line was one game to three instead of the other way around. [...] Evert now found herself at two games to four and love-30 down, and got lambasted by four Navratilova winners. [...] At five games to three, Evert had two break points, but could not convert, which Evert lost the second set three games to six. [...] In the decider set, Evert was quickly put on the defensive by Navratilova in the first game, which she was down 15 points to love. [...] At this juncture, Evert saved those two break point opportunities, but on deuce came to net and got passed, which set up a three-times-a-charm break point and her opponent capitalized on the opening. [...] Evert could not get back on track because of the relentless nature to Navratilova's game, which in the last game was plagued by bad line calls and lost the set two games to six.
