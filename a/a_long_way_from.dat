5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who has come <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E
5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked at dawn and late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences {{in the amount of}} time spent while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as hartebeest, topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E

5|$|The {{final scene}} {{is the story}} of Noah's drunkenness. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines. He is shown doing so, in the {{background}} of the picture. He becomes drunk and inadvertently exposes himself. His youngest son, Ham, brings his two brothers Shem and Japheth to see the sight but they discreetly cover their father with a cloak. Ham is later cursed by Noah and told that the descendants of Ham's son Canaan will serve Shem and Japheth's descendants forever. Taken together, these three pictures serve to show that Humankind had moved <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> God's perfect creation. However, it is through Shem and his descendants, the Israelites, that Salvation will come to the world.|$|E
5|$|With {{only one}} {{significant}} opencast {{in the local}} area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, {{there is a need}} for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have too high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.|$|E

25|$|It {{could be}} argued that radio was born in Cornwall. In 1901 at Poldhu on The Lizard, Guglielmo Marconi made his first trans-atlantic radio transmission.

The transmission, coming <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> Cornwall, (from the centre of the English Midlands), was crackly and barely audible at night-time, and it was a solitary listening experience, as sets were only equipped with a single earpiece, and not a loudspeaker.|$|E

25|$|The Ordovician turbidites, {{consisting}} of greywacke, feldspathic sandstone, micaceous siltstone, micaceous shale, chert, and phyllite, {{are very similar}} {{in all parts of}} the Tasman Orogen, including New Zealand and the Transantarctic Mountains. Detrital zircons from the turbidites have been isotopically dated with age ranges of 0.46 and 0.60 Gya, 1.0 and 1.2 Gya, and at ~1.8 Gya, ~2.2 Gya and ~2.7 Gya. These do not match the age of zircons from the interior of the Australian Shield, so the source of the sediments is from another continent. The other evidence from the Ordovician sediments are chemical composition indicates granitic source, with the absence of feldspar. Secondly the fine grained nature shows the sediments have been transported <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> their ultimate, source, and could have been second cycle, derived from sedimentary rocks.|$|E
25|$|Having {{been knocked}} out of the FP Trophy, the team turned to the Twenty20 Cup. Making only his fourth {{appearance}} in the tournament since 2005, Cook smashed 80 off 56 balls in a vain effort against Kent that was rained off.

Despite averaging 49 from these four games, Cook felt he was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> the international squad. In his last performance before joining with the Ashes squad, Cook scored a 57 ball century, carrying his bat through the innings as they crushed Surrey but without Cook and Bopara, the team were knocked out after two successive losses.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{recording}} mastering {{and manufacturing}} limitations, both {{high and low}} frequencies {{were removed from the}} first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.|$|E
