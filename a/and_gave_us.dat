[...] Phil Rosenthal of the Chicago Sun-Times described the arc as a [...] "lingering exit".

The Buffalo News describes the arc as [...] "a brilliant five-episode story line".|$|E

500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Letters of Transit" [...] {{the seventeenth}} best {{episode of the}} series, stating [...] "What at first seemed {{to be one of}} Fringes nutty number 19s {{turned out to be the}} episode that helped earn the series a fifth and final year. Of course, some may now {{question}} the merits of ringing out the series with a season-long story set entirely in this future dystopia ruled by oppressive Observers. But the single episode that introduced this premise was a cool jolt that opened a new front of Fringe mythology <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a character that would have a lasting impact, Etta."

Sarah Stegall enjoyed it, commenting that [...] "This {{was one of}} the more quietly brilliant episodes of Fringe to date.

Don Arden {{was at this}} point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band, as he viewed the original line-up as the most profitable. Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. [...] "They were totally different altogether", Iommi explains. [...] "Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing across the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in [...] "Iron Man". Ronnie came in <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> another angle on writing." ...|$|E

So we went to Biloxi and said, 'This is what we have learned.'" [...] Grand Forks leaders met with Biloxi city officials, and sent a list of contacts and a 24-page booklet that detailed how to coordinate volunteer agencies and how to interact with FEMA.

500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers...

500|$|Varietys Cynthia Littleton [...] "loved seeing Bernard in Grizzly Adams mode" [...] in {{the season}} five finale, while Ryan McGee from Zap2it {{compared}} Bernard's appearance to both Moses and the Gorton's Fisherman. McGee said [...] "It’s a gorgeous, gorgeous scene, even if it stands as a meta-criticism of the angst and turmoil of the show’s major characters". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it [...] "one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club thought the scene was useful as it allowed the characters to leave the show, but also it caused him to question whether opting out was the right or wrong thing to do. The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their decision not to participate [...] "all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' [...] from the caves", although this was shown {{not to be the}} case in season six. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the pair amongst her favourite characters of the series, commenting [...] "Few things made [...] happier than seeing them comfortably ensconced in their retirement cabin with Walt's dog, Vincent. They {{had the good sense to}} give up the whole island rat race, and their optimistic, straightforward attitudes and down-to-earth humor grounded Lost <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a window into normalcy, which, goodness knows, we needed sometimes".|$|E
500|$|Doug Pratt, a DVD {{reviewer}} and Rolling Stone contributor, {{thought the}} episode's story was [...] "nicely composed, so you don't {{have to recognize}} the Citizen Kane references to appreciate the effort, but it adds to the fun." [...] He also noted that it begins the exploration of Mr. Burns [...] "in earnest, {{the first of many}} characters who will receive elaborate coverage as the series advances." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk thought both Lisa's [...] "tremendous intellect" [...] and Marge's [...] "moral compass" [...] were [...] "probed" [...] in the episode, and he thought one [...] "clear highlight" [...] of the episode was Burns's attempts to explain away Blinky's mutation by turning to an actor portraying Charles Darwin who proceeds to give a speech suggesting that Blinky is merely advanced. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "The episode took an unusual approach for an early show, as it focused largely on a secondary character. One could argue that season one’s 'Krusty Gets Busted' did the same, but 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish' provided a heavier emphasis on Burns than that prior program did Krusty. This helped make it a fairly good episode. It fleshed out Burns’ character a little better <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a reasonably entertaining experience. The episode fell short of greatness, but it worked nicely for the most part." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "masterful".|$|E

500|$|Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review feeling the episode to explore [...] "Torchwoods {{bread and butter}} topic: {{the intersection of the}} human and the alien, {{and what it means to}} be human in the aftermath." [...] She stated that the episode [...] "played to its strengths, namely Eve Myles' Gwen and how she relates to both human and alien" [...] and stated it to demonstrate [...] "how perfect Rhys is for Gwen". She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me choked up, crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life was one of the most interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way to make everything all right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming for a happy ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient coincidence that the emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her not to do that to any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up". She stated that [...] "the fact that it offered no easy solutions <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> that super-bleak ending was enough to win me over".|$|E
