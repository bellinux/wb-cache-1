25|$|Traffic circles are {{typically}} larger, operate <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>speeds</b> and often {{give priority to}} entering traffic. They may control entering traffic by stop signs or traffic lights. Many older traffic circles allow entry <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>speeds</b> without deflection, or require a stop and a 90-degree turn to enter.|$|R

5|$|At the , Webber {{crashed into}} the back of Heikki Kovalainen's Lotus, sending the car flying through the air, {{collecting}} a track advertising board and landing upside down. The car then bounced back and {{crashed into the}} tyre barrier <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed.</b> Webber received only minor injuries, but retired from the race.|$|E
5|$|Stanier, the {{designer}} of the locomotives, felt that the added weight and difficulty in maintenance due to the streamlining was too high {{a price to pay}} for the actual benefits gained <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed.</b> Therefore, in 1938 a third batch of five locomotives (again named after Duchesses) was built, Nos. 6230–6234, without streamlining at an average cost of £10,659 each.|$|E
5|$|The Bonanza had {{impacted}} terrain <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed,</b> {{estimated to}} have been around , banked steeply {{to the right and}} in a nose-down attitude. The right wing tip had struck the ground first, sending the aircraft cartwheeling across the frozen field for , before coming to rest against a wire fence at the edge of Juhl's property.|$|E

5|$|Their main tunnels {{are used}} for feeding and for escape: they can dig {{themselves}} underground very rapidly, and can move along existing tunnels <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> both forwards and backwards. Their digging technique is to force the soil to either side with their powerful, shovel-like forelimbs, which are broad, flattened, toothed and heavily sclerotised (the cuticle is hardened and darkened).|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Major Schmidt decided he needed to see for himself what was {{happening}} at the bridges. He headed for the bridge in his SdKfz 250 halftrack with a motorcycle escort. Travelling <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> they unknowingly passed the forward line of 'D' Company's defence and drove onto the bridge whereupon the British company opened fire. The soldier aboard the motorcycle was killed and the halftrack was forced off the road. Schmidt and his driver were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed.</b> Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Meteor {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Germaniawerft {{shipyard}} in Kiel in 1888, and launched on 20 January 1890. Fitting-out work then commenced, and was completed by 19 May 1891, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Meteor served with the fleet only briefly; {{this was due to}} her poor handling and excessive vibration <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed.</b> In 1893, she was assigned as the dispatch vessel for the I Division of the Maneuver Squadron, which was composed of the four s.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> or the wobble mode {{at low speed}} if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E

5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed.</b> Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|Swimming animals {{including}} fish such as herrings, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all {{converged on the}} same streamlined shape. The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation {{to enable them to}} travel <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E
5|$|The 5 o'clock wave is {{a fictional}} theory on {{the reasons for}} Wagga Wagga's {{sporting}} success. According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o'clock arrives a giant wave which flushes a secret nutrient into the Murrumbidgee River following the release {{of water from the}} Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The wave is said to continue down river <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed,</b> and indeed visitors are told it is so powerful that surfers can ride it along the meandering river until it reaches the town of Narrandera.|$|E

5|$|The flotilla's second {{success was}} the night of 19/20 December 1941, again in the North Sea off the Dutch coast, when two boats engaged two R boats and one E boat. They passed twice <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> before losing contact, but twice during the night they located them and {{eventually}} carried out depth charge attacks. Both Hichens and {{the commander of the}} other boat received a MID for this action.|$|E
5|$|With {{the weather}} worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not heavy {{enough to cover}} her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed.</b> Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen to slip away.|$|E
5|$|As {{the column}} {{approached}} Villers-Bocage, an Sd.Kfz. 231 armoured car crew observed the British advance and escaped. At 08:30, having covered , the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered {{the town to}} be greeted by celebrating residents; two German soldiers were spotted leaving <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> in a Volkswagen Kübelwagen. The two Hussar regiments made contact with German forces {{on either side of}} the 22nd Brigade group route and the 8th Hussars engaged German eight-wheeler armoured cars. The Hussars reported German tanks heading towards Villers-Bocage, but Lieutenant Charles Pearce, of 4th CLY, thought that these were probably self-propelled guns.|$|E
