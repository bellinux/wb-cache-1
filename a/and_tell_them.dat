5|$|Libby accuses Zeke {{of writing}} Kyle Canning's (Christopher Milligan) essay for him, but Sunny reveals that she wrote it. Kyle was blackmailing her after he overheard Sunny telling Donna {{that her parents}} {{did not know about}} Zeke moving home. Karl and Susan make Sunny call her parents <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> about Zeke. Sunny tells them that her parents want her to come home. Zeke tells Sunny that he will go to South Korea with her. However, when Sunny realises how much Susan and Karl need him, she tells him to stay. On her last day, Zeke organises a picnic and a {{performance}} at Charlie's from The Black Skirts. A few days after her departure, Sunny texts Zeke and tells him not to contact her again.|$|E
5|$|After sending Stewie out {{for more}} paper, Paul finds several news {{articles}} in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a serial killer. Just then, the local sheriff (Joe) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a shotgun. The sheriff then complains that he will now {{have to spend the}} rest of his life in a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her in to the police <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and fondled him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a Magnum, P.I.-style credits roll.|$|E
5|$|In the House, {{desultory}} {{debate on}} Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34pm, when Fraser rose {{and announced that}} he had been commissioned as Prime Minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in him, and asked the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45pm.|$|E

Meanwhile, Tracy and Jenna receive a gift basket from Hank Hooper. The gift basket contains two of the following: MacBook Air, a watch, and a cellphone. Both are very happy with each other until they see only one Kabletown sweatshirt. Tracy unwillingly lets Jenna have it.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E
5|$|Vito Spatafore is outed as {{homosexual}} {{after running}} into {{a friend at}} a New York gay night club. The rumor spreads quickly, and once word gets to Meadow that everyone else knows, she tells Tony and Carmela about the incident between Finn and Vito with the security guard. Finn then has to {{sit in front of}} Tony's entire crew <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> what happened with the guard, solidifying their thoughts on Vito's sexuality. Tony is urged {{to deal with the problem}} by Phil Leotardo, now acting boss of New York with Johnny Sack in prison. Once Vito is outed, he runs away from the city and hides out in a New Hampshire town where he claims to be writing a book and meets with the locals. Vito also starts a romantic relationship with a male cook at a local diner. Eventually, Vito returns to New Jersey and asks Tony to allow him to return to work, albeit in Atlantic City. He continues to maintain that he is not a homosexual. Tony mulls over the decision to let him work, as well as whether to let him live. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and kills Spatafore. When one of the members of the New York family, Fat Dom Gamiello, pays a visit to the Jersey office and won't stop making jokes about Vito and his death, the two members of Tony's crime family who are present kill Fat Dom out of anger at the disrespect he has shown. Once more, it appears that the families are on the verge of all-out war.|$|E

They saw only the headlines about the lawsuit against the family who had lost a son. Before the case went to trial, she adds, her insurance company filed for bankruptcy. Her record and ticket sales fell off “in a big way,” Mandrell says.|$|E

25|$|Barbary slaves {{could hope}} to be freed through payment of a ransom. Despite the efforts of {{middlemen}} and charities {{to raise money to}} provide ransoms, they were still very difficult to come by. As European communities increased their charity funding for ransoming slaves, North African states increased the amount of ransom required. Lack of money to pay a ransom was not the only problem. Persons taken captive needed to notify their families of their status <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> the ransom price. Mail charges were often beyond the reach of ordinary captive slaves, and it could take several months for the mail to be delivered.|$|E
25|$|Held at the Kodak Theatre for {{the second}} {{straight}} year, the first day of Hollywood Week featured the 181 contestants from the auditions round (although only 172 contestants were listed on the American Idol website) singing solo with the option of playing an instrument. Ninety-six contestants advanced. The next round required the contestants to split up into groups and perform. Seventy-one advanced to the final round of Hollywood requiring a solo performance. Forty-six made it to the final round where the judges take contestants one by one <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> if they made the final twenty-four. One of the singers who was eliminated at the final cut was Lauren Daigle.|$|E

The Quagmires leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus {{so that they can}} study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach, and a fork) and makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|E

25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and {{the indignity of}} their situations was directly related to easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, she {{published}} an autobiography where she detailed how she met Constanzo and the group, her experiences {{when she was}} allegedly taken hostage by Constanzo, her mistreatment by authorities, and her versions of the story. Aldrete claimed she visited Constanzo in Mexico City and was then taken hostage after Constanzo decided to not let her go because he believed that {{she would go to}} the police <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> where they were hiding. She claimed that Constanzo {{and the rest of the}} group were unaware of the killings that occurred in Matamoros until they found out that the police was looking for them, but went into hiding nonetheless because they feared for their lives. She detailed her alleged mistreatments in jail, and how she underwent beatings, psychological torture, rape, and an unfair trial. Her version of Constanzo's death was different than the official one; she stated that Constanzo was executed by the police when they raided the apartment. She also questioned the police's decision to burn down the shack in Santa Elena, since it was crucial for the investigation and probably contained the fingerprints of the murderers.|$|E

25|$|At the Walford In Bloom competition, {{there is}} a gas {{explosion}} and Martin is panicked when he cannot find Stacey and hits a police officer, resulting in two weeks imprisonment. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, he is diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, which is hereditary. Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex {{about the possibility of}} Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. After Stacey misses Lily's dance show, she tells Lily about Arthur's condition. Stacey is annoyed with Whitney when she takes Lily and Arthur for breakfast and Lily is fed up of being ignored by an exhausted Stacey. When Lily refuses to eat her tea, Stacey physically takes Lily to go upstairs in the presence of Carmel, who refuses to leave Stacey with Lily and Arthur. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells her sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker Fiona Payne (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further home visits. Lily tells Stacey and Martin that she injured Arthur. After speaking with Lily, Fiona tells Stacey and Martin that Lily feels pushed out with Arthur and is anxious about the new baby. Kush and Carmel admit Carmel called social services, enraging Stacey, who bans them both from seeing Arthur before suffering an eclamptic seizure. She is taken to hospital, where her and Martin are told her baby will have to be delivered prematurely {{due to a lack of}} oxygen. The baby is delivered, though Martin is told that there are complications. Stacey goes to see her daughter, but changes her mind and snaps at Martin for allowing Carmel to look after Lily. Stacey later sees her daughter. Stacey and Martin's daughter is put on a ventilator. Stacey grows annoyed at Martin suggesting baby names, but confides in Max about her feelings. Stacey apologises to Martin and they name their daughter Hope.|$|E

500|$|In 1904, {{numerous}} {{newspaper articles}} and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the society.

In fact, a local newspaper reprinted a warning that had been distributed in the community: [...] "Wanted – Fifty good women, over twenty and under fifty years of age; also fifty good honest-hearted men with families, to meet upon the Square when called upon, {{and go to the}} Spirit Fruit farm <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> to take their departure at once or take the consequences, as tar is cheap and feathers plentiful." ...|$|E
