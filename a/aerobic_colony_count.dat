During the survey, 10 stores in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) were visited by student Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) who took swab samples from four surfaces: conveyor belts, long-life shopping bags, shopping trolley handles and keypads on card payment units. The swab samples were examined for the presence of the pathogens Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria. The <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Colony</b> <b>Counts,</b> as well as the levels of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae, were also determined. In addition, structured questionnaires were used with retailers to establish the storesâ€™ regimes for the cleaning of conveyor belts. Similarly, shoppers donating their long-life shopping bags for sampling were questioned about how they normally use these bags, and the results were compared with those from the microbiological survey. The results indicated that the hygiene of the surfaces sampled was good, with Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria not detected in any of the samples, and levels of both Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli were below the limits of detection in all but one sample. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Colony</b> <b>Counts</b> varied but none of the results obtained would be deemed â€˜unacceptableâ€™ or â€˜unsatisfactoryâ€™ under guidelines for ready-to-eat food...|$|R
40|$|The AOAC International {{official}} action {{procedure for}} performing <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> on hydrophobic grid membrane filters (HGMFs) uses Trypticase soy-fast green FCF agar (FGA) incubated for 48 h. Microbial growths are various {{shades of green}} on a pale green background, which can cause problems for automated as well as manual counting. HGMFs which had been incubated 24 or 48 h at 35 °C on Trypticase soy agar were flooded underneath with 1 to 2 ml of 0. 1 % triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution by simply lifting {{one corner of the}} filter while it was still on the agar and adding the reagent. Microbial growths on HGMFs were counted after color had been allowed to develop for 15 min at room temperature. With representative foods, virtually all colonies stained pink to red. Automated electronic counts made by using the MI- 100 HGMF Interpreter were easier and more reliable than control HGMF counts made by the AOAC International official action procedure. Manual counting was easier as well because of increased visibility of the microbial growths. Except in the case of dairy products, 24 -h TTC counts did not differ significantly from 48 -h FGA counts, whereas the FGA counts at 24 h were always significantly lower, indicating that for many food products the HGMF TTC flooding method permits <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> to be made after 24 h...|$|R

It harbors many potent pathogens, its microbial quality especially bacteriological {{as well as}} yeast and mold quality has always been crucially important to public health. This study was aims to access the bacteriological as well as yeast and mold quality of the pastry sold in the different markets in the Jalandhar city. Randomly 40 pastry samples were collected from the different retail shops and studied to determine the colony forming units per gram of the pastry samples. For <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> samples were classified as satisfactory, acceptable and unsatisfactory categories according to PHLS (Public Health Laboratory Services, UK) guidelines. For yeast and mold counts, WQAS (Woolworths Quality Assurance Standard) guidelines were followed. In <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts,</b> all the samples of the 10 zones selected for the study, showed heavy contamination of bacteria ranging 1. 37 * 106 cfu/g to 11. 27 * 106 cfu/g.

The zoonotic concern increases for small wild birds like house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) which are hunted {{in developing countries}} and commercialised in Italy for human consumption. From June to October 2011, 330 house sparrows and 140 starlings were hunted and slaughtered. Deepfrozen carcasses were transported to Italy and stored for 6 - 8 months at - 18 °C. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> and Salmonella detection in carcasses were assessed following standard microbiological methods (ISO 4833 : 2003 and ISO 6579 : 2004, respectively). Carcasses of house sparrows showed higher levels of aerobic bacteria in comparison to starling carcasses (5. 7 vs 3. 2 log 10 CFU/g). Moreover, 7 out of 11 lots of carcasses of house sparrows were positive for Salmonella. Among the 18 isolates of Salmonella, 14 were S. Typhimurium, 2 were S.

The results were analysed using hygiene standards, which specify 1) an <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> (ACC) > 2. 5 cfu/cm 2, and 2) presence of coagulase-positive staphylococci, as hygiene failures. Sites most often failing the standards were beds and hoist (64 %: 33 of 52 weeks), bedside lockers (62 %: 32 of 52) and overbed tables (44 %: 23 of 52). Methicillin-susceptible/resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA/MRSA) were more often recovered from lockers, overbed tables and beds. Recovery of MSSA/MRSA at any site was {{significantly associated with}} an ACC> 2. 5 cfu/cm 2 from that site (p= 0. 001; OR: 3. 35 (95 % CI 1. 79, 6. 28)).

40|$|Purpose – Many {{cases of}} food {{poisoning}} {{originate in the}} domestic environment and {{can be associated with}} improper food handling and ineffective cleaning by consumers. These practices could lead to the introduction and spread of bacterial contamination in the kitchen and if not subsequently removed could present an infection risk. This study proposes investigating changes in levels of bacterial contamination at five key sites in ten domestic kitchens during a period of 24 hours. Design/methodology/approach – Microbiological swabs were used to provide an <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> and an Enterobacteriacea count. A record was kept of cooking, cleaning and other activities within the kitchen. Findings – Results showed that contamination levels varied during the day, peaking after meal preparation and generally falling overnight. There was also indirect evidence of cross contamination, particularly from hands to other surfaces. Sites such as the refrigerator handle, kettle handle and taps, which generally only come into contact with hands, show increases in the levels of contamination recorded. Levels of microbiological contamination were lower in vegetarian than non‐vegetarian households. A variety of data showed that non‐food preparation activities also take place in the kitchen. These could also introduce bacterial contamination into the kitchen and facilitate their spread. Originality/value – The implications of these results are that the most important time for cleaning in the kitchen is immediately after food has been prepared, with attention focussing on high risk areas such as the work surface, chopping board, taps and other hand contact surfaces...|$|E

The objectives of this study were to assess the Belgian baseline of hygienic indicators and the relationship between the indicators and zoonotic agents, in order to establish hygiene indicator criteria for carcasses and meat of beef, pork and poultry. The study used the results from the official Belgian surveillance plan from 2000 to 2003, which included the monitoring of counts for E. coli (ECC), Enterobacteriaceae (EC), <b>aerobic</b> <b>colonies</b> (ACC) and Pseudomonas. The sampling method was the wet and dry swabbing technique for beef and pork carcasses, and neck skin excision for chicken and layer carcasses. The 75 th and 95 th percentiles of ECC were – 0. 20 and 0. 95 log cfu/cm 2 for beef carcasses, 1. 20 and 2. 32 log cfu/cm 2 for pork carcasses, and 4. 05 and 5. 24 log cfu/g for chicken carcasses. The <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> were between 2. 1 and 4. 5 log cfu/cm 2 or /g higher than those of ECC for cattle, pork and poultry.

Methods: Lockers, left and right bedrails and overbed tables in 30 bed spaces were screened for <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> (ACC) and staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: MSSA/ MRSA) before detergent-based cleaning. Sites were rescreened at: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after cleaning. Microbial growth was quantified as number of ACC/cm 2 and presence of MSSA/MRSA at each site. The study was repeated 3 times at monthly intervals. Results: There was a significant reduction in average ACC (360 sites) from a pre-clean level of 6. 72 ACC/cm 2 to 3. 46 ACC/cm 2 at 4 hours after detergent-based cleaning (P< 0. 0001).

There was an early and significant reduction in average ACC (360 sampled sites) from a before-cleaning level of 4. 3 to 1. 65 CFU/cm 2 at 1 hour after disinfectant cleaning (). P !. 0001 Average counts then increased to 3. 53 FU/cm 2 at 24 hours and 3. 68 CFU/cm 2 at 48 hours. Total MSSA/MRSA (34 isolates) decreased by 71 % at 4 hours after cleaning but then increased to 155 % (53 isolates) of precleaning levels at 24 hours. Cleaning with electrolyzed water reduced ACC and staphylococci on surfaces beside patients. ACC remained below precleaning levels at 48 hours, but MSSA/MRSA counts exceeded original levels at 24 hours after cleaning. Although disinfectant cleaning quickly reduces bioburden...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety of}} ready-to-eat foods is an {{important}} issue. Improper storage and handling of ready-to-eat items may lead to foodborne disease outbreaks. In this study, raw salmon finger sushi (nigiri) was selected as a target ready-to-eat food for microbiological surveillance. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the microbiological quality of take-away sushi sold in the licensed sushi shops in Hong Kong. Sushi samples were collected from 120 randomly selected licensed sushi shops in the 19 districts in Hong Kong from 1 st June to 30 th July 2014. They were tested for <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> (ACC), Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus counts as well as the presence of Salmonella spp. to evaluate their overall hygienic quality. None of the samples was found to contain Salmonella spp. and 1. 7 % of the collected samples were classified as unsatisfactory for containing more than 100 CFU/g of E. coli indicating the overall hygienic quality of take-away sushi in Hong Kong was good. There was no significant difference between samples purchased from chain stores and those from self-hosted business, suggesting that microbiological quality of take-away sushi was not affected by these two types of business models. Based on the current findings, it was suggested that the government should have more frequent routine inspections and provide food hygiene education to the workers in the sushi shops in Hong Kong so as to minimize the risk of foodborne disease outbreaks.

40|$|Upon investigation, the {{underlying}} causes of many reported laboratory associated illnesses (LAI) are often not objectively identified. The presumption among many in the biosafety community is that such illnesses stem largely from either poor laboratory technique or surface contamination in the laboratory. While training and practice can enhance laboratory technique, evaluation of the efficacy of existing laboratory cleaning procedures of laboratory surfaces is typically not performed. This is not the case for laboratories working with radioactive materials, where assessments for radioactive contamination are routinely performed using filter paper disks or cotton tipped swabs wiped on surfaces and analyzed for the amount of radioactivity collected. Industrial hygienists also conduct surface sampling for metals and hexavalent chromium contamination. In food processing industries, rapid adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence (ATB) detection wipes are regularly performed to confirm surface decontamination. The presence of ATB on surfaces is indicative of the presence of organic material that may harbor infectious organisms. The rapid ATB assay, also referred to as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is {{regarded as one of the}} few predictive diagnostic tools available to avert a major contamination incident in the food industry. The same technology holds potential for application in the biomedical research laboratory setting. ^ This research project established benchmark ATP values for five types of laboratory surfaces and also assessed the effectiveness of current laboratory cleaning practices.

This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of detergent-based cleaning on microbial load at near-patient sites on one ward over a 48 h period. Lockers, left and right bedrails and overbed tables in 30 bed spaces were screened for <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> (ACC) and staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: MSSA/MRSA) before detergent-based cleaning. Sites were rescreened at: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after cleaning. Microbial growth was quantified as number of ACC/cm 2 and presence of MSSA/MRSA at each site. The study was repeated 3 times at monthly intervals. There was a significant reduction in average ACC (360 sites) from a pre-clean level of 6. 72 ACC/cm 2 to 3. 46 ACC/cm 2 at 4 hours after detergent-based cleaning (P < 0. 0001). Average counts increased to 4. 89 ACC/cm 2 at 24 h and 5. 27 ACC/cm 2 at 48 h for all sites. Levels on bed rails and lockers, but not overbed tables, fell below a proposed standard (5 cfu/cm 2) for 24 h after cleaning. MSSA/MRSA decreased 2 – 4 h after cleaning (P = 0. 014) before increasing but failed to reach pre-clean levels. Detergent cleaning reduces ACC at near-patient sites on a hospital ward. S. aureus (including MRSA) was not completely eliminated but showed a similar pattern of decrease. Microbial burden at high-risk sites beside the patient could potentially be controlled by daily cleaning with single-use detergent wipes...|$|R

Examination of 2, 981 samples using Microbiological Guidelines criteria revealed that 66 % were of satisfactory or acceptable microbiology quality, 33 % were of unsatisfactory quality mainly due to high <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> and Enterobacteriaceae concentrations, and 1 % were of unacceptable quality due to the presence of Listeria monocytogenes at 100 CFU/g or higher (27 samples; range of 102 to 106 CFU/g) and Campylobacter jejuni (1 sample), indicating a risk to health. All samples {{at the end of the}} shelf life had satisfactory (20 CFU/g) and/or acceptable (102 CFU/g) levels of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens, four samples (1 %) had unsatisfactory levels of Escherichia coli (range of 102 to 106 CFU/g) and 5. 5 % of the samples contained L. monocytogenes at 20 CFU/g (4. 8 %) or between 20 and 100 CFU/g (0. 7 %). More samples of chicken (45 %; 224 of 495 samples), beef (43 %; 160 of 371 samples), and turkey (41 %; 219 of 523 samples) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable quality compared with ham (23 %; 317 of 1, 351 samples) or pork (32 %; 67 of 206 samples).

40|$|This {{observational}} study aims {{to investigate the}} microbiological quality of commercially prepared lightly cooked foods with {{a major component of}} food of animal origin and collected as would be served to a consumer. A total of 356 samples were collected from catering (92 %), retail (7 %) or producers (1 %) and all were independent of known incidents of foodborne illness. Using standard methods, all samples were tested for: the presence of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. and enumerated for levels of, Bacillus spp. including B. cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria spp. including L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriacea and <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> (ACC).

40|$|Hide {{contamination}} {{represents a}} {{main source of}} microbiological contamination of carcass surface. In {{order to reduce the}} potential health risks for the consumer the EU implemented measures {{in the context of the}} regulations no. 852 /-, 853 /- and 854 / 2004. These imply that only clean cattle are suitable for slaughter in order to eliminate the risk of meat contamination via hide or skin. Food business operators are responsible for ensuring that the requirements are met. One problem is, that the meaning of cleanliness is not defined clearly enough. Therefore some European states implemented regulations for the grading of hide cleanliness. The main objective of the own analysis was to point out the correlation between the level of hide contamination and the total bacteria count of the surfaces of the carcasses. Therefore an ascending hide cleanliness classification system for beef cattle was developed which is based on two vertical hide regions, an area measure as well as aspects of cleanliness and humidity based on three major-classes for hide-cleanliness. In total 180 female bovine cattle were classified by their hide, digitally photographed from four perspectives (two standing and two stunned) as well as slaughtered and examined in a group of equal or very similar level of conta- mination on test days. The sampling technique was based on stalked sponge swabs, which were pulled over four exactly defined locations of the freshly flayed carcass twice (front and back side) through a self-developed oblong template measuring 100 cm 2. The four incre- mental samples per animal were pooled and tested for the hygiene indicators <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> as well as for Enterobacteriaceae count and Escherichia coli count. Analyzing the data set statistically all logarithmized aerobic colony counts were normally distributed. Three ordinal scores for <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> were defined (Score 1 : 0 bis≤ 2 log 10 cm- 2,Score 2 : 2 bis≤ 3 log 10 cm- 2 andScore 3 :> 3 log 10 cm- 2) and tested in conjunction with the three major classes of hide contamination. The general finding was that the amount of animals with low total bacteria count (Score 1) decreased with higher major class. The amount of cattle with moderate Summary 119 ￼bacteria content (Score 2) increased slightly with the major class. The amount of animals with high total bacteria count (Score 3) increased substantially with the major class. It could be shown that major-class-I included a statistically significant lower amount of animals with high total bacteria count compared to major-class-II. The same held for the comparison of major-class-II and -III as well as of major- class-I and -III. E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae could be evidenced only on about a third of the carcasses and thus be analyzed in combination with the major-classes and the three Scores. Applying the reduced population respectively the same correlation could be confirmed approximately. Overall the described correlations can be taken as indication that the considered colony counts rise with an increasing visual level of contamination. In case of development and implementation of a regulation system in Germany the application of a maximum of three ascending classes of hide contamination appears to be justifiable. Furthermore the terms „clean“ and „cleanliness“ should be complemented with attributes as „sufficient(ly) “...|$|E

FungIn {{the food}} industry, {{coliform}} testing is traditionally {{done by the}} time consuming and labor intensive plate count method or tube enumeration methods. The TEMPO® system (bioMérieux, Inc.) was developed to improve laboratory efficiency and to replace traditional methods. It uses a miniaturization of the Most Probable Number (MPN) method with 16 tubes with 3 dilutions in one single disposable card. It utilizes two stations: the TEMPO® Preparation station and the TEMPO® Reading station. In this study, the Oxyase® (Oxyase®, Inc.) enzyme was added to TEMPO® CC (Coliforms Count), TEMPO® AC (<b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count)</b> and TEMPO® EC (E. coli Count) methods. Water samples of 1 ml with 0. 1 ml of Oxyase® enzyme were compared to samples without the Oxyase® enzyme using the TEMPO® system. Samples were spiked with different levels of coliforms (10, 102, 103 and 104 CFU/ml), stomached (20 sec), and pipetted into the three different TEMPO® media reagents (4 ml) in duplicate and then automatically transferred into the corresponding TEMPO® cards by the TEMPO® preparation station. Counts were obtained using the TEMPO® reading station after 8, 12, 16, 22 and 24 hours at an incubation temperature of 35 °C. Results from 20 replicates were compared statistically. Using TEMPO® tests, high counts in food samples (> 6 log 10 CFU/ml) can be read in 6 ± 2 hours of incubation using the time-to-detection calibration curve. The TEMPO® system reduces reading time (reading protocol should be changed). There {{is no need to}} wait for 22 hours of incubation only 12 hours is required.

40|$|Sixty calves of the Dutch Friesian (FH) breed {{were stunned}} mechanically. Without {{previously}} having been stunned, another 30 calves were stuck {{according to the}} Jewish rite. Upon opening of the skulls (1 – 2 h post mortem) brains of mechanically stunned calves were collected either conventionally (n = 30) or ‘hygienically’ (n = 30), i. e. using a fresh pair of surgical gloves during each removal to avoid cross contamination. For ritually slaughtered animals only the hygienic procedure was followed. Samples of 10 g were excised from undamaged hemispheres and in the mechanically stunned treatment group also {{from the site of}} impact of the captive bolt. After storage in polystyrene trays at 3 ± 1 °C for 7 days sampling was repeated. Bacteriological examination included the assessment of <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> at 30 °C for 3 days (ACC- 30) and 4 °C for 14 days (ACC- 4) and Enterobacteriaceae <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> at 37 °C for 20 h (ECC). In conventionally collected samples the ACC- 30 and ACC- 4 were 3. 8 and 3. 0 log 10 cfu g− 1 at day 1 and 6. 2 and 6. 4 log 10 cfu g− 1 at day 8. With hygienic collection these counts were reduced by approximately 1 log unit. Whilst by conventional practice the ECCs, at day 1 and 8 were 2. 6 and 4. 8 log 10 cfu g− 1 these counts were 1. 8 and 2. 6 log 10 cfu g− 1 for hygienic practice. In samples excised from the site of impact of the captive bolt the hygienic procedure had similar, though less marked effects. On day 1 brains from ritually slaughtered animals had a bacteriological contamination similar to that found in the hemispheres of mechanically stunned calves. However, whilst at day 8 their mean ECCs were 3. 4 and 3. 5 log 10 cfu g− 1 the percentages of plates ‘positive’ for Enterobacteriaceae were only 10 % in the ritually vs. 53 % in the mechanically stunned group. The Enterobacteriaceae in this case were composed of psychrotrophic non-pathogenic genera of environmental origin. Salmonella was not isolated from any sample...|$|R

To obtain baseline data for pies unrelated to outbreaks, 862 samples of ready-to-eat meat pies were collected at retail or from catering facilities in England in 2013 and examined to enumerate food-poisoning bacteria and indicator organisms using Organization for Standardization (ISO) methods for Listeria spp. including L. monocytogenes (ISO 11290), Clostridium perfringens (ISO 21528), coagulase-positive staphylococci including Staphylococcus aureus (ISO 6888), Bacillus spp. including B. cereus (ISO 1737), Escherichia coli (ISO 16649), Enterobacteriaceae (ISO 21528), and <b>aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> (ACCs; ISO 4833). Microbiological quality was satisfactory in 94 % of samples, borderline in 5 %, and unsatisfactory in 1 %. The proportion of pies from markets that were borderline or unsatisfactory significantly increased, {{and the proportion}} of borderline or unsatisfactory pies from supermarkets significantly decreased. Among the refrigerated (0 to 15 °C) pies, microbiological quality significantly decreased in pies stored at > 8 °C and further significantly decreased at in pies stored at ambient temperature (> 15 to 25 °C). Samples collected at 25 to 40 °C had the highest proportion of borderline or unsatisfactory results, but results improved in pies stored at > 40 °C. The most common cause for borderline or unsatisfactory results was elevated ACCs (5 % of all samples). Within the individual microbiological parameters, borderline or unsatisfactory results resulted from elevated Enterobacteriaceae or Bacillus levels (10 samples for each), C. perfringens levels (2 samples), and S. aureus or E. coli levels (1 sample each). L. monocytogenes was recovered from one pie at < 10 CFU/g.

40|$|Singeing {{improves}} the visual quality of rind in pig slaughterhouses. In addition, the thermic inactivation allows the bacterial contamination of carcass surfaces to be reduced. However, the thermal image of pig carcasses shows temperature differences along the carcasses. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop a method to analyze a thermal image. After defining an imaging protocol adapted to pig slaughterhouses, image analysis was carried out with the free software: ImageJ©. Three methods were developed in order to preserve the spatial arrangement and time information for each measurement: (1) Method by line profile, (2) Method by mouse over, (3) Method by mouse over and line profile. Moreover, the method had to be simple and accurate. After a statistical comparison (mean, variance, distribution) between the three methods on 20 carcasses, the method by line profile was validated to analyze the characteristics of heat treatment in four pig slaughterhouses during process. This validated method of image acquisition and analysis was a tool used to measure the temperature variability on carcasses. The reference temperature was the temperature of carcasses after 90 minutes of continuous process. This method confirmed temperature differences on carcass surfaces (the top part of the carcass is warmer than the bottom part within a range of 2 - 7 °C) and within a production day; the lowest temperatures were observed when the process started or re-started (after breaks), on average 4 °C. These temperature variations along the working day were observed in every slaughterhouse studied. Bacterial contamination was evaluated on carcasses prior and following singeing for two heating settings. Results were similar to the literature (reduction of 3 Log 10 CFU/cm² of the <b>Aerobic</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts).</b> With this pragmatic method, companies could have access to a measurement tool not only for characterizing, checking, optimizing and qualifying the efficiency of singeing, but also for investigating all thermic treatments on meat in slaughterhouses...|$|R
