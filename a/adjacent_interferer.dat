40|$|The {{intermodulation}} (IM) {{distortion of}} the PLL FM demodulator {{in the presence of}} FM interference is evaluated using the Monte Carlo simulation. Both the desired signal and the interferer are considered to be frequency modulated by Gaussian random signals. The simula-tion is based on solving the nonlinear integrodif-ferential equation of the PLL FM demodulator in consideration of the amplitude and the distorted phase modulation of the filtered FM signals. The IM {{distortion of the}} second-order loop PLL FM demodulator with Butterworth and Bessel input bandpass filters is given for co-channel and <b>adjacent</b> channel FM <b>interferers.</b> Bessel filters of order greater than two are shown to compare favourably with Butterworth filters in front of the PLL FM demodulator in the presence of <b>adjacent</b> channel FM <b>interferer...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of having two radio networks sharing {{a common set}} of frequencies is investigated for regular hexagonal cell layouts. While for a single network a hexagonal symmetry of the co-channel lattice is optimum, it turns out, that a monoclinic symmetry is attractive for coexisting networks. Characteristic distances of frequency patterns belonging to different symmetry classes are calculated. Based on the analysis of the influence of <b>adjacent</b> channel <b>interferers</b> and the calculation of SIR distributions in two symmetrical coexisting networks it is shown, that the outage probability can be reduced and smaller reuse factors are possible, if the proposed alternative patterns are used instead of those optimum for single networks...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} {{nonlinear}} simulation methods intended {{to evaluate the}} impact of mixer nonidealities {{on the performance of}} a wireless system. Behavioral models capable of accurately describing the mixer’s nonlinear dynamic features at the system level are currently unavailable. The possibility of using alternative circuit analysis techniques to reach this goal is discussed. After a brief review of existing mixer analysis methods, the focus is directed to the techniques amenable to efficiently handling periodic carriers modulated by complex stochastic signals. In particular, it is shown how multi-envelope transient methods coupled with a three-dimensional harmonic-balance engine can model a nonlinear dynamic mixer excited by a modulated RF signal accompanied by a strong <b>adjacent</b> channel <b>interferer</b> and with a local oscillator corrupted by phase noise. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Abstract — To enable {{reliable}} transmission, UWB receivers have to {{cope with}} interference from several existing wireless services. Based on spectrum analyzer measurements we will show that stationary or quasi-stationary noise can be handled using a high pass filter. For a narrowband interferer (NBI) in close vicinity such a filtering is not sufficient since the receiver may be clipping. This can happen especially in wireless body area networks (BAN) where a number of different NBIs are placed in close vicinity to the UWB receiver. Since most NBIs transmit their data burst-wise, as, e. g., GSM or Bluetooth (BT), we propose UWB transmission between <b>adjacent</b> <b>interferer</b> bursts to avoid the UWB receiver’s clipping. Based on extensive time domain measurements where GSM, BT, and IEEE 802. 11 b WLAN are all active at the same time, it will be shown that reasonable data rates can be achieved and that strict latency time requirements can be met with such a temporal cognitive medium access.

40|$|Recent atttempts {{to reduce}} the cost and size of {{wireless}} transceivers feature higher levels of transistor integration in alternative architectures {{to reduce the}} need for the off-chip, high-Q passives used in present-day super-heterodyne transceivers. Unfortunately, removal of off-chip passives often comes at the cost of increased power consumption in circuits preceding and including the analog-todigital converter (ADC), which must have higher dynamic ranges to avoid desensitization caused by larger <b>adjacent</b> channel <b>interferers.</b> A selectivity (Q) versus power trade-off is seen here. This device makes possible a paradigm-shifting transceiver architecture that, rather than eliminate high-Q passive components, attempts to maximize their role with the intention of harnessing the above Q versus power trade-off. One example of this architecture, shown in Figure 4. 7. 1, uses an extremely high-Q RF filter to select the desired channel up at RF, rejecting not only out-of-band interferers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} usage of {{established}} interference cancellation techniques applied to the simultaneous reception of geostationary satellite broadcast signals from two or more satellites. In particular the reduction of interference from adjacent satellites is of interest, which would allow a reduction of the antenna size and the requirements on the directivity of the installation. The rejection of unwanted <b>adjacent</b> satellite <b>interferers</b> can imply a large equivalent parabolic reflector size to achieve the required spatial separation of the signals. The usage of small and cheap reception antennas at the end-user premises can be facilitated by {{the reduction of the}} requirements on the antenna characteristics in terms of adjacent satellite interference rejection, in particular for the joint reception of signals from two or more simultaneous geostationary orbital locations. In this study the novel approach of using simple decision directed interference reduction techniques at the symbol detection level is considered to relax the requirements on the reception system front-end...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{efforts in}} the design of {{wireless}} RF transceivers focus on high integration and multi-standard operation. Higher integration can be obtained by using receiver architectures, such as wide-band IF with double conversion (WIF), that perform channel select filtering on-chip at baseband. Performing this baseband channel select filtering in the digital domain allows for the programmability necessary to adapt to the different channel bandwidths, sampling rates, and CNR requirements of multiple communication standards. At the back of a wide-dynamic range sigma-delta modulator, a decimation filter can select a desired channel in the presence of both strong <b>adjacent</b> channel <b>interferers</b> and quantization noise from the digitization process. A low-power decimation filter that performs channel select filtering for the GSM (European cellular) and DECT (European cordless) standards is presented. Automatic gain control is used within the filter to reduce the dynamic range and power consumption. Since the two standards have different blocking profiles and CNR...|$|R
40|$|In {{cellular}} mobile radio systems, multiple access is causing interference that limits capacity of the networks. The GSM system with multiple users {{can be interpreted as}} MIMO system with a desired user and (cochannel and <b>adjacent</b> channel) <b>interferers.</b> Using a multiple [...] input multiple [...] output (MIMO) multiuser joint detection approach for desired signal and one or more (strongest) interferers, network capacity can be significantly increased. In this paper, we compare different multiuser detection methods that can be applied to GSM/EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) systems with Gaussian minimum [...] shift keying (GMSK) modulation in up- and downlink and 8 [...] ary phase [...] shift keying (8 PSK) in the uplink, respectively. Since an optimal solution is not feasible in these applications, joint MIMO reduced [...] state sequence estimation (RSSE) with adaptive thresholds in metric computations is applied to reduce computational complexity. The M-algorithm is explored as a second method for joint detection with reduced complexity. Algorithms for multiuser detection are compared with interference rejection methods, where interferers are suppressed by filtering. A performance comparison is done by simulations for the GSM/EDGE equalizer test (EQ) and typical urban (TU) channel profiles with known channel impulse responses at the receiver...|$|R
40|$|The channel {{assignment}} problem for cellular systems using FDMA requires that transmitters be assigned channels such that users receive adequate signal. Traditionally, the `single inter ferer assumption' {{has been used}} to encapsulate the situation in binary channel separation constraints. Such constraint generation considers interference from one source in isolation, not account ing for interfering signals emanating from multiple non-serving sources simultaneously, which will occur in real radiocommuni cations scenarios. In this paper the single and multiple interferer assumptions are investigated in detail; quantifying not only the to tal effects of additional sources of interference on downlink cov erage, but also the proportion caused by interferers which are co channel with the server or separated from it by a certain number of channels. We analyse the performance, when multiple interfer ers operate, of {{channel assignment}}s which are zero-violation for single source interference, over a range of test problems. Results show that a significant coverage reduction can be experienced in these circumstances, largely due to the combined effects of co channel and first <b>adjacent</b> channel <b>interferers,</b> even when a small number of non-serving transmitters are active. Our conclusions are valuable towards developing solution techniques and models to resolve the problem in channel assignment...|$|R
40|$|Suppression of co-channel interferers in a TDMA {{cellular}} phone system {{by the use}} of an antenna array is studied. Especially the problem of suppressing co-channel interferers that appear outside the training sequence is addressed. It is observed that if a cochannel interferer is present during the data sequence but not during the training sequence of a frame, then it will be present during the training sequence of an <b>adjacent</b> frame. The <b>interferer</b> plus noise spectrum of adjacent frames is utilized in order to suppress such co-channel interferers. The effect on the performance is illustrated with an example scenario for the GSM system. 1 Introduction The problem addressed in this paper is the suppression of co-channels interferers in a TDMA system, {{by the use of}} an antenna array. The GSM system is used as an example. Here data is transmitted in frames, with a known training sequence in the middle.
