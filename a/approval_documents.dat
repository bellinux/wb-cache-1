The first part of the work is devoted to the theoretical analysis of the <b>approval</b> <b>document.</b> The aim of this part is to explore the literature of the problem area and define the concepts and tools used in practical part of this bachelors thesis. The first part identifies the process of <b>document</b> <b>approval</b> and methods of RACI matrix and the EPC diagram. The second part is analysis of the current state of approval process in the bank, whose aim is to describe the companys internal statutes, on which are organizations operations based in the approval process and modeling the EPC diagram of the actual state by using information provided by bank. The third part is the evaluation of the actual state of approval process through utilization of questionnaires and determination of hypotheses. The aim is to illustrate the problem areas of organization. The last part is about projecting changes. This part is about removing the unnecessary elements, realizing transformation of internal statutes, categorizing existing documents and allocating the role to the approvers of the process based on internal data analysis, results from the questionnaires and using RACI matrices. Solution to the problem of <b>approval</b> <b>document</b> in organization was proceeded on banks demand. Optimization of approval process has a practical usage for the bank...|$|R

40|$|The sole {{effective}} and approved drug to treat acute isch-emic stroke (AIS) can be offered {{only to a}} minority of patients, in part, because of the short therapeutic time window of alteplase, as well as numerous additional contraindications.

A post hoc subgroup analysis of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) thrombolysis trial encouraged no further subselection of AIS patients, such as by age or stroke severity. 5 Nevertheless, regulatory <b>approval</b> <b>documents</b> contain several contraindications and warnings that may provide little to no safety benefit.

40|$|This brief essay aims to {{demonstrate}} the fundamental importance {{of the cost of}} producing and managing urban space from a developing country perspective. It also indicates, based upon vast literature, that the price of urban investments ends up to have an expelling trend to citizens away from the benefits which they cannot afford. This fact suggests a vice cycle in which the more the City invests the more expensive it becomes to its citizens who, helplessly, move out into unserviced neighborhoods. Furthermore, it analyses the production of space in a middle-sized city in Brazil based on parcel <b>approval</b> <b>documents</b> from the 1930 s to the 1990 s. It also uses Kevin Lynch’s city landscape theoretical framework to help interpret the evolution of urban space in Timoteo.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} application of a previously developed indexing methodology to ongoing NASA programs. These programs are comprehended by the NASA Program <b>Approval</b> <b>Documents</b> (PADS). Each PAD contains a technical plan for the area it covers. It was proposed that these could be used to generate an index to the complete NASA program. To test this hypothesis two PADS were selected by the NASA Technology Utilization Office for trial indexing. Twenty-five individuals indexed the two PADS using NASA Thesaurus terms. The results demonstrated the feasibility of indexing ongoing NASA programs using PADS as the source of information. The same indexing methodology could be applied to other documents containing {{a brief description of the}} technical plan. Results of this project showed that over 85 % of the concepts in the technology should be covered by the indexing. Also over 85 % of the descriptors chosen would be accurate. This completeness and accuracy for the indexing is considered satisfactory for application in technology transfer...|$|E

These Master Thesis will exanimate possible amendments for a change to the current system. In order to get a perspective to the South African regulation and processes, a comparison is done to the Swedish similarities.
