40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the National Pilot Programme for the Education of Health Care Assistants in Ireland. This evaluation covered the period from the beginning of the programme (November 2001) through to the completion of year one (August 2002). The terms of reference of the study were as follows: To examine the processes, content, delivery, and evaluation of the programme in practice at each pilot site; To determine the degree of congruence between the programme and the emerging role of the Health Care Assistant; To establish whether or not the programme meets the objectives as specified in the 2001 Report of the Review Group on Health Service Staff; To determine whether or not the findings derived from an evaluation of the pilot sites are representative of the spectrum of health care agencies likely to employ Health Care Assistants in the immediate future; To make recommendations based on the findings with particular reference to (i) the role and personal profile of the Health Care Assistant and (ii) extension of the programme across the health services. The aims of the study were achieved through a mixed methodological approach using quantitative and qualitative approaches. The study had three distinct phases that were completed over a period of 10 months. Participants involved in the study included trainee health care <b>assistants,</b> <b>co-ordinators,</b> teaching staff, clinical assessors and relevant health care agencies. KEY FINDINGS The key findings of this study are based on interviews with trainee Health Care <b>Assistants</b> (HCAs), <b>co-ordinators,</b> teaching staff and clinical assessors and survey questionnaires with trainee HCAs undertaking the programme and health care agencies across Ireland likely to employ HCAs. Demographic Findings • The majority of trainees were female (89. 2...|$|R
40|$|This Newsletter is {{dedicated}} to the memory of Ágnes Tímár Balászy First of all, I would like to excuse me for the prolonged bud unwonted silence due to unexpected happenings and conditions. After the Triennial Meeting in Lyon, with my <b>assistant</b> <b>co-ordinators,</b> Patricia Dal Prà, Lynda Hillyer and Dinah Eastop, I had lined out the essential themes to deepen in these three years. Unfortunately a serious disease occurred to ICR’s director, Michele Cordaro, a dear friend and colleague of mine since many years, ending with his death last March 2000. With him we all have lost a faithful supporter of what we intend is the real restoration/conservation, always involved in the studying and understanding of the works of art and its conservative history that could have changed its original appearance and further the ways of transmission of the intrinsic message of the piece of art. He was the first that made me interested in the world of textiles, always supporting my activities in Italy, but most of all my work for ICOM, sustaining particularly the Newsletter editions. He has always been a brave champion of inter-disciplinarity, {{not to be confused with}} multi-disciplinarity, and in this he reassembled Ágnes Tímár Balászy, to whom we dedicate thi...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} question arose though the lead practitioner’s professional practice, which is focused upon the transfer {{and retention of}} Traveller children from primary to secondary school. The research project involved two contrasting areas of Cambridgeshire; rural south Cambridgeshire and urban Cambridge City. These areas have the lowest numbers of Traveller children transferring and staying on at secondary school in the county. The aim of this research project was to explore how integrated working could improve secondary transition rates for Traveller children in two specific areas of Cambridgeshire. The project invited a variety of professionals {{who were involved in}} transition work in Cambridge City and South Cambridgeshire to become involved in the project. Three of these professionals were then engaged to carry out the research and came together only at group meetings. The professionals worked separately on their own chosen research areas for their contribution to the research. There were 12 professionals and 36 children and young people involved in the research; these included four teaching <b>assistants</b> one transition <b>co-ordinator</b> two teachers four transition social workers one transition worker 36 pupils. A literature review was completed, which along with data from the first interviews, provided the thematic analysis and contextualization of themes. The research also used ethnographic case studies to observe the characteristics, developments and findings of the different groups involved. Data was initially analysed per professional, and then compared for overall similarities and recommendations. There were then final interviews with professionals. Findings include: • Work with Traveller parents was paramount to changing the current trend of low transition and retention. • Work needs to pay particular attention to the transition of female Traveller students and the retention of male Traveller students. • Home–school relationships and community cohesion strategies need to be strengthened and secondary schools need to adopt a proactive approach towards this. • A professionally integrated, co-ordinated approach that recognizes the need for extra input for Travellers’ transition and retention is essential. The research project therefore enabled a more informed approach to professionals’ transition work. They had a clearer understanding of the issues involved and ideas about how these might be tackled. Integrated working was found to be very informative and supportive in this process and further meetings have been planned...|$|R
