5|$|Highly {{energetic}} {{chemistry is}} thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of <b>all</b> <b>life</b> existed. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions. The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E

5|$|In {{the long}} term, the {{greatest}} {{changes in the}} Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter {{at a rate of}} ten percent every 1.1billion years. In one billion years' time, as the Sun's radiation output increases, its circumstellar habitable zone will move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, <b>all</b> <b>life</b> on land will become extinct. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending <b>all</b> <b>life</b> on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today.|$|E
5|$|Partial classifications {{exist for}} many {{individual}} groups of organisms and are revised and replaced as new information becomes available, however comprehensive treatments of most or <b>all</b> <b>life</b> are rarer; two recent examples are that of Adl et al., 2012, which covers eukaryotes only {{with an emphasis}} on protists, and Ruggiero et al., 2015, covering both eukaryotes and prokaryotes to the rank of Order, although both exclude fossil representatives.|$|E

5|$|The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' {{applies to}} animals and <b>all</b> <b>life</b> forms. This precept isn't {{found in the}} oldest verses of Vedas, but {{increasingly}} becomes {{one of the central}} ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD. In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{literature of}} Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, Tirukkuṛaḷ, written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and {{sometimes called the}} Tamil Veda, {{is one of the}} most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. Tirukkuṛaḷ dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book 1 to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, vegetarianism, non-harming, and non-killing, respectively. Tirukkuṛaḷ says that Ahimsa applies to <b>all</b> <b>life</b> forms.|$|E
5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and {{presence or absence}} of sunlight. Nearly <b>all</b> <b>life</b> forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E

5|$|According to Schwarz et al., seven traits unite K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, and {{separate}} them from other species referred to Theriosuchus. These include {{the presence of}} only two unique tooth morphotypes; the choanae being placed in shallow grooves rather than a bowl-like depression; the relatively wide top of the skull; the presence of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in <b>all</b> <b>life</b> stages; and the relatively limited contact between the lacrimal and nasal. Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs from other species in lacking teeth with low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest {{on the side of}} the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and the front of the squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E
5|$|As {{the police}} chase the rapidly {{transforming}} Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses {{samples of the}} mutated creature in a laboratory, and realises that it {{has the ability to}} end <b>all</b> <b>life</b> on Earth if it spores. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in to destroy it in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species were}} {{formerly}} recognized {{as belonging to}} Theriosuchus; K. guimarotae was initially named as T. guimarotae, and specimens of K. langenbergensis were initially referred to T. pusillus upon their discovery. Schwarz and colleagues recognized a number of characteristics that united these two taxa {{to the exclusion of}} other species of Theriosuchus; in particular, Knoetschkesuchus only has two distinct types of teeth, lacking the leaf-shaped teeth seen in other atoposaurids. Other distinguishing traits include the relatively wide skull, and the presence of the antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in <b>all</b> <b>life</b> stages.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, {{phosphorus}} and sulfur {{are sometimes}} referred to or categorised as organogens, CHONPS elements or biogens. Collectively these six nonmetals are required for <b>all</b> <b>life</b> on Earth. They are further distinguished—in comparison to the halogens (F, Cl, Br, I, At) and noble gases—by their general capacity (or potential) to form allotropes; high atomisation energies; intermediate electron affinities; reactivity combined with low toxicity; ability to form alloys with metals; and the weak or neutral acid-base character of their group hydrides.|$|E
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, ordered <b>all</b> <b>life</b> rafts {{and boats}} launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E

5|$|Dana discovers Em {{was killed}} by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a {{physical}} trainer who was convinced his fitness regime would extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten <b>all</b> <b>life</b> on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E
5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} <b>all</b> <b>life</b> on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of life}} rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed. The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting. Oceanography has established that not <b>all</b> <b>life</b> is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|E
