In this study professionals were invited to a hands-on assessment of the AUKOTON MDE approach for factory process control engineering.

Together with the channel access demand vector D and the CQI values for each resource unit of each user, the user serving vector is used to perform the adaptive and non-adaptive resource allocation according to the following strategy: First, the resource units of the adaptively served users are allocated, i.e., WPFS is applied over all Nru resource units taking into account only the UA <b>adaptive</b> <b>users.</b> By doing so, the diversity of all Nru resource units is exploited in the adaptive resource allocation process. However, the non-adaptively served users demand WNA resource units which have to be re-allocated from the <b>adaptive</b> <b>users.</b> As for non-adaptive users it is not important which resource units are allocated to them since the non-adaptive mode works independent from any CQI, WNA out of the Nru selected resource units with the lowest ratio between weighted instantaneous SNR and average SNR are re-allocated from the <b>adaptive</b> <b>users</b> to the non-adaptive users. By doing so, the best WA out of Nru resource units are selected for the <b>adaptive</b> <b>users</b> while the non-adaptive users still obtain their demanded number of resource units.

40|$|Clustering is an {{essential}} data mining task with numerous applications. However, data in most real-life applications are high-dimensional in nature, and the related information often spreads across multiple relations. To ensure effective and efficient high-dimensional, cross-relational clustering, we propose a new approach, called CrossClus, which performs cross-relational clustering with <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance.</b> We believe that <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance,</b> even likely in very simple forms, could be essential for effective high-dimensional clustering since a user knows well the application requirements and data semantics. CrossClus is carried out as follows: a user specifies a clustering task and selects one or a small set of features pertinent to the task. CrossClus extracts the set of highly relevant features in multiple relations connected via linkages defined in the database schema, evaluates their effectiveness based on <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance,</b> and identifies interesting clusters that fit user’s needs. This method takes care of both quality in feature extraction and efficiency in clustering. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this approach. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Inefficient and {{error-prone}} {{interaction between}} human operators and technical systems {{was the reason}} for various catastrophic accidents in the past. User interfaces implement the communication between a human user and a technical system which is the reason why inaccurate design of user interfaces has been identified as one major factor for those errors. The use of <b>adaptive</b> <b>user</b> interfaces is one possible solution to reduce inefficient interaction by adapting the user interface to a specific user, task, or context. However, currently no self-contained formal approach exists that allows for the creation of <b>adaptive</b> <b>user</b> interfaces despite various advantages of formal methods: interaction becomes verifiable, formal methods close the gap between modeling and implementation by using executable formal languages, and they allow for using existing rewriting concepts making formal models adaptable. This paper introduces a new approach to a formal rule generation concept, which enables a flexible creation of <b>adaptive</b> <b>user</b> interfaces. This concept is based on a formal modeling and reconfiguration approach for the creation and adaptation of user interfaces. The applicability of this approach will be shown through an implementation of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>user</b> interface for <b>adaptive</b> automation. The main contribution of the presented work is a new concept for rule generation that is capable of adapting formally modeled user interfaces...|$|R
