50|$|On the {{occasion}} of Brother Hussar's death, 8 February 1996, and burial at Doumia, thousands of people from Israel and abroad gathered at NSWAS. Hussar was nominated in successive years (1988, 1989) for the Nobel Peace Prize. Until 1989, the village lacked recognition as an Israeli village, but in September of that year the Israeli Ministry of the Interior finally granted it that legal status. Difficulties arose in the increasingly conflicted years that followed, esp. during the <b>Al</b> <b>Aqsa</b> <b>Intifada,</b> as NSWAS found itself isolated, unable to forge significant connections with either Israeli or Palestinian society. His friend of long-standing Dubois, went on record as stating that both he and Hussar, in embarking on a naive adventurous Zionism, had 'completely denied the Palestinian tragedy'.|$|E

Iron Dome, a system to intercept short-range rockets, was developed by Israel and first deployed in the spring of 2011 to protect Beersheba and Ashkelon, but officials and experts warned {{that it would not be}} completely effective. Shortly thereafter, it intercepted a Palestinian Grad rocket for the first time.In the cycle of violence, rocket attacks alternate with Israeli military actions. From the outbreak of the <b>Al</b> <b>Aqsa</b> <b>Intifada</b> (September 30, 2000) through March 2013, 8,749 rockets and 5,047 mortar shells were fired on Israel, while Israel has conducted several military operations in the Gaza Strip, among them Operation Rainbow (2004), Operation Days of Penitence (2004), Operation Summer Rains (2006), Operation Autumn Clouds (2006), Operation Hot Winter (2008), Operation Cast Lead (2009), Operation Pillar of Defense (2012), and Operation Protective Edge (2014).|$|E

In March 2011 [...] "Israel vs. Iran - War of Shadows", co-authored by Hendel with Jerusalem Post military correspondent Yaakov Katz, was published in Hebrew, followed by the English translation a year later. The book evaluates the threat to Israel’s security posed by a nuclear Iran since the Second Lebanon War of 2006, and analyzes Israel’s military and diplomatic options as well as intelligence analysis, future military measures, the Israeli Air Force attack in Syria, Operation Cast Lead, technological advances, cyberspace battles, assassinations and warfare smuggling by sea. The authors argue that Israel's war against Lebanon in 2006 and Operation Cast Lead against the Gaza Strip in 2008/09 were surrogate wars against Iran.|$|E
50|$|In {{protest against}} the Balfour Declaration, which {{proposed}} Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people, and its implementation under a League of Nations Mandate for Great Britain, Palestinians, both Muslim and Christian, from November 1918 onwards, began to organize in opposition to Zionism. By the end of Ottoman rule, the Jewish population of Palestine was 56,000 or one-sixth of the population. Hostility to Jewish immigration led to incidents, such as the riots of April 1920, the Jaffa riots of 1921, the 1929 Palestine riots, until a general Arab revolt broke out for three years, in 1936-1939, which was crushed, {{with the loss of}} 5,000 lives, by the British army. After the passing of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947 which called for the establishment of independent Arab and Jewish States, a Palestinian Civil War broke out. On the declaration of the state of Israel, 15 May 1948, a full-scale war, involving also the intervention of neighbouring Arab states, took place, with casualties of 6,000 Israelis and, according to the 1958 survey by Arif al-Arif, 13,000 Palestinians and the exodus, through expulsion, or panicked flight, of approximately 700,000 Arab Palestinians who subsequently became refugees. In the Six Day War, a further 280,000-360,000 Palestinians became refugees, and the remaining Palestinian territories were also occupied from Jordan and from Egypt, and later began to be settled by Jewish and Israeli settlers, while the Palestinians were placed under military administration. While historically, Palestinian militancy was fragmented into several groups, the PLO led, and eventually united, most factions, while conducting military campaigns that varied from airplane hijackings, militant operations and civil protest. In 1987, a mass revolt, of predominantly civil resistance, called the First Intifada, exploded, leading to the Madrid Conference of 1991, and subsequently to the Oslo I Accord, which produced an interim understanding allowing a new Palestinian authority, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to exercise limited autonomy in 3% (later 17%) of the West Bank, and parts of the Gaza Strip not used or earmarked for Israeli settlement. Frustration over the perceived failure of the peace talks to yield a Palestinian state led to the outbreak of the <b>Al</b> <b>Aqsa</b> <b>Intifada</b> in September 2000, which ended in 2005, coincident with the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The rise of Hamas, the use of Palestinian rocketry and Israel's control of Gaza's borders, has led to further chronic violence, culminating in a further two conflicts, the Gaza War of 2008-09 and Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012. It is estimated that since 1920, when the first riots against Jews broke out, 90,785 Arabs including Palestinians have died, and some 67,602 been wounded in all wars and conflicts between Israel and its neighbors. On the other hand, 24,841 Jews and Israelis have died and 35,356 have been wounded during the same period. Since 1967, some reports estimate that some 40% of the male population of the West Bank and Gaza have been arrested or detained in Israeli prisons for political or military reasons.|$|E

40|$|Instead of {{representing}} collective political empowerment, the second Palestinian uprising, the <b>al</b> <b>Aqsa</b> <b>Intifada,</b> generally foregrounds {{the fragmentation of}} the Palestinian national movement and the de-democratisation and militarisation of Palestinian resistance. Although the perceived crisis of the Palestinian national movement has generated a wealth of research and political analyses, existing research on the <b>al</b> <b>Aqsa</b> <b>Intifada</b> tends to be policy oriented or governed by the paradigm of nationalism. Critical reflection on the very framework within which the 'crisis' of intifada is identified and examined remains surprisingly rare. Addressing this gap in scholarship, the present thesis critically assesses the role that hegemonic discourses of the <b>al</b> <b>Aqsa</b> <b>Intifada</b> might have in its current production as a crisis, and expands the theoretical and conceptual framework within which politics in Palestine might be examined and explored. Drawing on Foucault's theorisations of the subject and on Lyotard's philosophy of the differend, the research argues that rather than being seen as a crisis of Palestinian political subjectivity and nationalism per se, the <b>al</b> <b>Aqsa</b> <b>Intifada</b> needs {{to be understood as}} a crisis of representation, one calling for new ways of understanding, conceptualising and representing politics and political subjectivity in Palestine. Towards this end, the thesis suggests an alternative analytical approach that explores the crisis of the <b>al</b> <b>Aqsa</b> <b>Intifada</b> in relation to the wider political problematic of postcolonial late modernity and centres on a notion of the late modem subject of colonial occupation. This approach expands the conceptual and theoretical framework of Palestine studies beyond the discourses of anticolonial nationalism and contributes to a more complex and nuanced understanding of the subject, resistance, and the politics of representation in Palestine...|$|E

Predictors of probable PTSD in a multivariate model for Jews were refusal to report income, being traditionally religious, economic and psychosocial resource loss, greater traumatic growth, and lower social support.
