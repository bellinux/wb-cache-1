5|$|Observations {{show that}} nuptial flight {{does not occur}} before February. This is based on larvae {{spinning}} into cocoons by November, and by January, these cocoons could not produce adult workers or reproductive males and females. Queens are most likely fertilised by males sometime between February and April; however, scientists have seen alates engage in nuptial flight during March. Before emerging from their parent nest, queens will shed their wings inside the nest and mate with low-flying males nearby. After nuptial flight, <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> will isolate herself and form a small chamber underground, where she remains for seven to eight months. However, it is improbable that <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> can survive on her own storage of fat and wing-musculature for that long. During this time, the queen may emerge from her nest occasionally, but she will only lay eggs from October to November {{when there is a}} rich supply of food. While this may be the case, some queens will lay eggs after a month of isolation during winter. M.regularis is a semi-clasutral ant, meaning that <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> will go out and forage in order to feed her young. Queens will emerge from their nests from time to time, during which they will capture insects for their young or feed on sweet substances. If food sources are deprived, <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> will only rely on her fat to feed the larvae until she perishes or finds food, but the larvae will not be cannibalised, and remain alive until a week after the queen's death. An individual ant may take eight months to develop from an egg to an adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{begins with}} {{scenes from the}} X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, with Madonna featured as <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> sitting beside a coyote. The intro {{is followed by the}} singer recording vocals with music director Stuart Price and auditioning dancers for the Re-Invention World Tour.|$|E
5|$|The king grows only {{slightly}} larger after initial mating {{and continues to}} mate with the queen for life (a termite queen can live between 30 to 50years); this {{is very different from}} ant colonies, in which <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> mates once with the male(s) and stores the gametes for life, as the male ants die shortly after mating. If <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> is absent, a termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called <b>a</b> <b>queen,</b> and a juvenile cat {{is referred to}} as a kitten. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
5|$|After being invaded, <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> may {{be forced}} to leave her nest. If a {{satellite}} has not been established, the queen may usurp another queen in a different nest. Thus not having to invest any valuable resources, the queen can then use these resources on reproducing a new brood.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just <b>a</b> <b>Queen</b> high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing <b>a</b> <b>Queen</b> in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E

5|$|In 751 Ruler Z {{erected a}} stela {{that was never}} finished, paired with another with the {{portrait}} of <b>a</b> <b>queen.</b> A hieroglyphic stairway mentions someone called B'olon K'awiil {{at about the same}} time. B'olon K'awiil was king by 771 when he raised two stelae and he was mentioned at Toniná in 789. Sites to the north of Calakmul showed a reduction in its influence at this time, with new architectural styles influenced by sites further north in the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite. The writers created the role of <b>a</b> <b>Queen</b> Amphitrite especially for Beckham. The former Spice Girl accepted the role because her sons, Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz, love the show, were excited when their mother told them of the role, and looked forward to watching the episode with her.|$|E
5|$|K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was {{watching}} a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote {{a story on the}} theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves <b>a</b> <b>queen.</b> He fights 100 warriors and dies in his attempt to re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that the relationship between <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.|$|E

5|$|One {{of these}} two queens might have been Reptynub, the only known consort of Nyuserre. Her {{existence}} and relation to Nyuserre are attested by a fragmentary alabaster statuette of her discovered in the valley temple of Nyuserre's pyramid complex. Pieces of relief from the tomb of vizier Ptahshepses give the titles of <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> and while her name is lost, these titles {{are the same as}} those that Reptynub bore, leading Egyptologists to propose that these refer to her.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona's European contemporaries {{generally}} condemned her {{policies and}} characterized {{her as a}} tyrant at best and insane at worst. These negative characterizations persisted in foreign scholarly literature until the mid-1970s. Recent academic research has recast Ranavalona's actions as those of <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> attempting to expand her empire while protecting Malagasy sovereignty against the encroachment of European cultural and political influence.|$|E
5|$|Stela 88 {{may have}} been paired with Stela 62. The {{monument}} has the image of <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> but her name is unknown. B'olon K'awiil {{also appears to be}} mentioned on the stela. It dates to around 751 and stands on the stairway of Structure 13. Stela 91 is another very late monument probably dating to the early 10th century. Like Stela 84, it bears an inscription that is a meaningless imitation of hieroglyphic writing.|$|E

5|$|Temnothorax unifasciatus, a myrmicinid ant, {{has been}} shown not to have {{collective}} worker policing. However, when <b>a</b> <b>queen</b> is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by dominance hierarchies. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.|$|E
