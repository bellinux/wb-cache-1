5|$|The novel {{begins with}} the {{character}} of Harriet Byron leaving the house of her uncle, George Selby, to visit Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, her cousins, in London. She is an orphan who was educated by her grandparents, and, though she lacks parents, she is heir to a fortune of fifteen thousand pounds, which causes many suitors to pursue her. In London, she is pursued by three suitors, Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Orme. This courtship is followed by more suitors: Mr. Fowler, Sir Rowland Meredith and Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. The final one, Pollexfen, pursues Byron vigorously, which causes her to criticise him over a lack of morals <b>and</b> <b>decency</b> of character. However, Pollexfen does not end his pursuits of Byron until she explains that she could never receive his visits again.|$|E

25|$|Partisanship, {{more than}} any other factor, appears to be the divider in the {{controversy}} surrounding Garcia Moreno’s legacy. Liberal opposition did and does continue to portray him as a tyrant by emphasizing the more authoritarian policies of his regime. Under Garcia Moreno’s presidency, his beliefs and goals alone directed government policies, an easily undermined structure for a stable government, and the legislature often was reduced to a rubber stamping body. Even when confronted with evidence of the good which was done under his presidency, most opponents then and now still would likely argue that the end does not justify the means, and further point out the morally ambiguous ways in which Garcia Moreno retained control: a secret police, the installation of political puppets, etc. In more modern times, particularly in modern republics, another complaint would be voiced as well, that being the establishment of a state religion, instead championing the individual's right to religious liberty. In Garcia Moreno’s defense, as conservative supporters point out, however, there are three factors which lessen this criticism. First, Garcia Moreno, unlike many rulers throughout history, made this move not for the sake of power, but rather in order to build a new moral identity for the nation; second, he believed, based on a career of watching warfare within Ecuador, that only a shared spiritual identity of Latin American-style Catholicism could bring peace to a land ravaged by strife between Liberals and Conservatives as well as former Spanish socioracial classes, and in many ways it worked during his regime; third, Article 10, the section of the 1869 constitution which restricted religious practice to Catholicism was, strictly speaking, a comparative continuity with the past, even though it is morally questionable, for Ecuador already was overwhelmingly Catholic {{with the exception of a}} Jewish minority and foreign Protestants living in the land. (Nevertheless, the liberal objector still could point out the ends do not justify the means and that Garcia Moreno simply could have appealed to the history of Ecuador, as separated from other former colonies in South America, for this goal.) Furthermore, the 1869 constitution also assured citizens’ right to innocence until proven guilty, prohibited arrests without warrants, and ensured the people’s rights to free speech and assembly (though one may question how well this was carried out), so long as it respected religion, morality <b>and</b> <b>decency.</b>|$|E

500|$|Although {{defeated}} in the election, Henderson remained the [...] party leader while Lansbury headed the Labour group in parliament—the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). In October 1932 Henderson resigned and Lansbury succeeded him. In most historians' reckonings, Lansbury led his small parliamentary force with skill and flair. He was also, says Shepherd, an inspiration to the dispirited Labour rank and file. As leader he began the process of reforming the party's organisation and machinery, efforts which resulted in considerable by-election and municipal election successes—including control of the LCC under Herbert Morrison in 1934. According to Blythe, Lansbury [...] "represented political hope <b>and</b> <b>decency</b> to the three million unemployed." [...] During this period Lansbury published his political credo, My England (1934), which envisioned a future socialist state achieved by a mixture of revolutionary and evolutionary methods.|$|E

However, he emphasized the caveat of [...] "opening up more choices for citizens, without imposing on the whole of society". Civic participation may be engaged through debates on policies and national issues, but criticism which [...] "scores political points and undermines the government's standing, {{whether or not this is}} intended" [...] will not be treated lightly.

500|$|On its website, PTC {{states that}} its {{mission is to}} [...] "promote and restore {{responsibility}} <b>and</b> <b>decency</b> to the entertainment industry in answer to America's demand for positive, family-oriented television programming."

It therefore believes that television is harming children through a perceived [...] "gratuitous" [...] amount of sex, violence, and profanity. Its activism has influenced the removal of potentially objectionable content from certain shows, such as the fourth season of the popular CBS crime drama [...] Increased government regulation of broadcasting is another viewpoint supported by PTC. PTC considers itself nonpartisan; others have considered the PTC to be bipartisan or socially conservative. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times called the PTC [...] "the Gladys Kravitz of public advocacy" [...] in a column of hers and believed the PTC supported a federal policy on broadcast decency she called [...] "Big Nanny run amok".|$|E

500|$|In the 1950s, the Supreme Court of the United States issued two key rulings {{clarifying}} {{the constitutionality of}} physical intrusions into the human body by police and other government agents. In Rochin v. California, police officers broke into the home of an individual suspected of selling narcotics and observed him place several small objects into his mouth. Officers were unable to force his mouth open, so they transported him to a local hospital where his stomach was pumped against his will. A unanimous Supreme Court held the involuntary stomach pump was an unlawful violation of substantive due process because it [...] "shocked the conscience", and was so [...] "brutal" [...] and [...] "offensive" [...] {{that it did not}} comport with traditional ideas of fair play <b>and</b> <b>decency.</b> In 1957, the Court held in Breithaupt v. Abram that involuntary blood samples [...] "taken by a skilled technician" [...] neither [...] "shocked the conscience" [...] nor violated substantive due process. In Breithaupt, police took a blood sample from a patient suspected of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} while he lay unconscious in a hospital. The Court held that the blood samples were justified, in part, because [...] "modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection." [...] Additionally, the Court mentioned in dicta that involuntary blood samples may violate the constitution if officers do not provide [...] "every proper medical precaution" [...] to the accused.|$|E

Fans may, however, disagree with the closing assessment that Morrison may be running out of themes and ideas to express." [...] Publishers Weekly was critical of the book's tone, commenting: [...] "Turner is more adulatory than probing." [...] The review noted: [...] "A complete discography makes this book a necessity for fans of the Irish Rover." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Thomas C. Palmer Jr. called the book [...] "a coffee-table biography that fills an extensive void, both for those hungry for gossip and for those who have wondered at the source of the creativity in this prolific producer of often stunningly original – if difficult to categorize – music". Palmer commented on the book's value: [...] "The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison's music has featured, subtly or otherwise (but never as blatantly as Dylan in his [...] "Saved" [...] period): religion and spirituality." [...] Robert Sandall reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Steve Turner has performed his task as a biographer diligently enough in Too Late To Stop Now, but the really interesting story here is told by the photographs." [...] Sandall commented: [...] "Thirty years of constant rowing with anybody who has ever tried to get close to him, and a fitful and irritable hankering after religion (any religion) have left him looking bloated, sad and, as Turner has the courage <b>and</b> <b>decency</b> to point out, not as great a musician now as his current reputation would suggest.

500|$|The Coen {{brothers}} {{first met}} Sam Raimi when Joel Coen {{worked as an}} assistant editor on Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981). Together, they began writing the script for The Hudsucker Proxy in 1981, and continued during the filming of Crimewave (1985), and post-production on Blood Simple (1985), in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi. The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of Preston Sturges, such as Christmas in July (1940) and the Hollywood satire, Sullivan's Travels (1941). The sentimental tone <b>and</b> <b>decency</b> of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of Frank Capra, like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). The dialogue is an homage to Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday (1940), while Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as fast-talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn, in both the physical and vocal mannerisms. Other movies that observers found references to include Executive Suite (1954) and Sweet Smell of Success (1957). The brothers had no intention commenting on or parodying such movies, instead as Ethan said [...] " [...] It's the case where, having seen those movies, we say ' They're really fun - let's do one; as opposed to 'They're really fun- let's comment upon them." [...] Raimi describes the script as [...] " [...] "big-business comedy. It's {{a return to the}} very large love story comedies they used to make in the forties and early fifties." [...] So the brothers started to pace around their apartment, taking turns on the typewriter, and when they found themselves stuck at a point, Raimi would do all sorts of tricks to get the boys back up. For example, while Ethan is pacing around, he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off, he even said he threw firecrackers at them.|$|E
500|$|Four days later, the DA {{submitted}} a complaint to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) about censorship {{by the public}} broadcaster after the SABC informed the DA it would not continue broadcasting a DA television advert titled [...] "ANC Ayisafani", meaning [...] "the ANC's not the same", and five DA radio adverts aired on 8 and 9 April 2014. According to the DA's Mmusi Maimane, who appears in the television advert, the SABC banned all DA adverts from 11 public radio stations {{as well as the}} television advert. ICASA announced that it would hold public hearings on the matter on Thursday the 17th, 6 days after the DA lodged their complaint. Following the DA's announcement that it would submit an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court requesting a ruling on the adverts before the long Easter weekend commencing Good Friday, the day after ICASA's proposed public hearing date, the ICASA hearings commenced 2 days earlier than originally scheduled. On the day after the hearing, the ban was lifted temporarily as the SABC had failed to provide reasons for the ban during the ICASA hearings and requested more time to prepare a response. The DA also objected to the SABC not allowing the national official opposition party to participate in a televised election debate on land reform on SABCin the first 2 weeks of April. On 25 April, ICASA upheld the SABC's ban on the television advert finding that it contravened ICASA's regulations on party election broadcasts. ICASA ordered that a photograph taken by The Citizen photographer Alaister Russell of a police officer firing rubber bullets at unarmed residents during the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest be removed from the advert as [...] "the police should not be seen {{as a threat to the}} community". In the advert, Maimane says [...] "We've seen a police force killing our own people" [...] while the photograph is shown on the screen. The South African Police Service had earlier {{submitted a}} complaint to ICASA that this footage would incite violence against police officers.On 15 April 2014, a protest campaign against corruption with the slogan [...] "Vukani! Sidikwe! (Wake up! We are Fed up!) Vote No", supported by over 100 ANC veterans, was launched by former government ministers Ronnie Kasrils and Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. The IEC has requested a legal opinion on whether the campaign contravenes the Electoral Act. The campaign urges ANC supporters to either spoil their votes or vote for a smaller party. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu welcomed the campaign, and human rights activist and cleric Barney Pityana describes it as [...] "a campaign to bring rationality, order, morality <b>and</b> <b>decency</b> back into our electoral system" [...] in a Mail & Guardian opinion piece.|$|E
