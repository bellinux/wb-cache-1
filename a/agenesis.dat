5|$|Cervical <b>agenesis</b> {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} {{condition in}} which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop. Other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and uterus. The cervix may be duplicated in situations such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.|$|E
5|$|Dodd is a Grade IV equestrian competitor, {{coached by}} Peter Turner. Due to her sacral <b>agenesis,</b> when she rides her horse, she dislocates several bones every time, {{but as a}} result of {{anti-doping}} rules, she has had to find alternative ways of coping with pain associated with riding.|$|E
5|$|Gauci {{was born}} on 1 January 1985. She was born with lumbar sacral <b>agenesis,</b> meaning that she is missing {{the lower part of}} her spine. In 2008 and 2009, she was the Australian Paralympic Committee's New South Wales Assistant. As of 2012, she lives in Rooty Hill, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{seen with}} the syndrome include developmental delay, growth retardation, pulmonary stenosis (an obstruction of blood-flow from the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery) with associated dyspnea (shortness of breath), and renal <b>agenesis</b> (failure of the kidneys to develop during the fetal period). Undescended testes, hyperactivity and aggressive behavior have also been noted.|$|E
5|$|Hannah Dodd {{was born}} on 27 April 1992, and is from Arcadia, New South Wales. She has sacral <b>agenesis</b> and spina bifida with upper limb dystonia, and is missing four {{vertebrae}} in her back. When she was about a year old, her kidneys started failing. Her entire renal system needed to be reconstructed. She has two older brothers. She can walk with the aide of a caliper, and also uses a wheelchair. , she is a horse riding teacher and student at the University of Western Sydney where she is majoring in sports and exercise science.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral renal <b>agenesis</b> (BRA) {{was first}} {{recognized}} as a defect of human fetal development in 1671 by Wolfstrigel.|$|E

25|$|Tracheal <b>agenesis,</b> {{is a rare}} {{birth defect}} in which the trachea fails to develop. The defect is usually fatal though {{sometimes}} surgical intervention has been successful.|$|E
25|$|Classic Potter {{sequence}} {{occurs when}} the developing fetus has bilateral renal <b>agenesis,</b> which also presents with <b>agenesis</b> of the ureters. BRA has been estimated to occur at a frequency of approximately 1:4000 to 1:8000 fetuses and neonates. However, recent analysis has estimated that the condition may occur at a much greater frequency. The condition {{has been reported to}} occur twice as commonly in males as in females, suggesting that certain genes of the Y chromosome may act as modifiers. However, no candidate genes on the Y chromosome have yet been identified.|$|E
25|$|Disorders of {{the seminal}} vesicles include seminal vesiculitis, {{acquired}} cysts, abscess, congenital anomalies (such as <b>agenesis,</b> hypoplasia and cysts), amyloidosis, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, hydatid cyst, calculi (stones) and tumours.|$|E
25|$|MODY4: Homozygous IPF1 {{results in}} {{failure of the}} {{pancreas}} to form. Congenital absence of the pancreas, termed pancreatic <b>agenesis,</b> involves deficiency of both endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|Research has linked certain genetic {{mutations}} {{to be the}} cause of BRA, ARPKD, ADPKD and possibly MRD. For more information about the genetic causes regarding BRA and URA see renal <b>agenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megalencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and <b>agenesis</b> of the corpus callosum.|$|E
25|$|There {{can be a}} vaginal obstruction, such as one {{caused by}} <b>agenesis,</b> an {{imperforate}} hymen or, less commonly, a transverse vaginal septum; these cases require differentiation because surgery for them significantly varies. When there is a lump obstructing the vaginal opening, it is likely a Bartholin's cyst.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{abnormalities}} {{of the brain}} are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include microcephaly (small head size) {{of two or more}} standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., <b>agenesis</b> of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia).|$|E
25|$|Renal <b>agenesis.</b> Failure of one kidney to form {{occurs in}} {{approximately}} one in 750 live births. Failure of both kidneys to form {{used to be}} fatal; however, medical advances such as amnioinfusion therapy during pregnancy and peritoneal dialysis {{have made it possible}} to stay alive until a transplant can occur.|$|E
25|$|Oligohydramnios is {{the cause}} of Potter {{sequence}} but {{there are many things that}} can lead to oligohydramnios. It can be caused by renal diseases such as bilateral renal <b>agenesis</b> (BRA), atresia of the ureter or urethra causing obstruction of the urinary tract, polycystic or multicystic kidney diseases, renal hypoplasia, amniotic rupture, toxemia, or uteroplacental insufficiency from maternal hypertension.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Dr. Clarren {{described}} a second infant whose {{mother was a}} binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus, abnormal neuronal migration, and a small corpus callosum (which connects the two brain hemispheres) and cerebellum. FAS has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes, <b>agenesis</b> of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, neuronal migration errors, absent olfactory bulbs, meningomyelocele, and porencephaly.|$|E
25|$|The size, colour, {{and shape}} of labia vary significantly, and may change {{as a result of}} childbirth, aging and other events. Conditions {{addressed}} by labiaplasty include congenital defects and abnormalities such as vaginal atresia (absent vaginal passage), Müllerian <b>agenesis</b> (malformed uterus and fallopian tubes), intersex conditions (male and female sexual characteristics in a person); and tearing and stretching of the labia minora caused by childbirth, accident and age. In a male-to-female sexual reassignment vaginoplasty {{for the creation of a}} neovagina, labiaplasty creates labia where once there were none.|$|E
25|$|Classical lissencephaly, {{also known}} as type I or {{generalized}} agyria-pachygyria, is a severe brain malformation of a smooth cerebral surface, abnormally thick (10-20mm) cortex with four layers, widespread neuronal heterotopia, enlarged ventricles, and <b>agenesis</b> or malformation of the corpus callosum. Classical lissencephaly can range from agyria to regional pachygyria and is usually present along with subcortical band heterotopia (known as ‘double cortex’ to describe the circumferential bands of heterotopic neurons located beneath the cortex). Subcortical band heterotopia is a malformation slightly different from lissencephaly that is now classified under the agyria-pachygyria-band spectrum because it consists of a gyral pattern consistent with broad convolutions and an increased cortical thickness.|$|E
25|$|He is {{best known}} for {{performing}} the first successful human fetal heart and kidney transplants in immunocompromised rats. Gu was the first to discover a method of lowering the mean arterial pressure of the blood entering the transplanted fetal organ within the animal host to the appropriate physiological level seen in a fetus, thus allowing the transplants to be successful. The heart and kidneys not only survived but grew larger in size and could function to support the life of the host animal. This may have important implications for the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, bilateral renal <b>agenesis,</b> and other congenital diseases of the heart and kidney.|$|E
500|$|Victoria [...] "Tori" [...] Pendergast {{was born}} in Gosford, New South Wales on 25 January 1991. She has sacral <b>agenesis,</b> and was born missing {{the lower part of}} her spine. She {{attended}} Loreto Normanhurst, and in 2013 she graduated with a degree in business and marketing from the University of Technology, Sydney. In early 2014, she was working as a telemarketer. She is an F58 classified shot put competitor who finished 8th in the Girls Shot Put Disability Open at the 2004 Schools Athletics Championships.|$|E
2500|$|Physical {{examination}} of the seminal vesicles is difficult. Laboratory {{examination of}} seminal vesicle fluid requires a semen sample, e.g. for semen culture or semen analysis. Fructose levels provide a measure of seminal vesicle function and, if absent, [...] <b>agenesis</b> or obstruction is suspected.|$|E
2500|$|NGF-R {{is present}} in the {{condensing}} ectomesenchymal cells of the dental papilla in the early cap stage tooth germ [...] and plays multiple roles during morphogenetic and cytodifferentiation events in the tooth. There is a relationship between tooth <b>agenesis</b> and absence of the peripheral trigeminal nerve (see Hypodontia).|$|E
2500|$|Uterine unicornis a {{condition}} in which the female cat is missing a uterine horn. [...] A rare discovery by veterinarians, the condition can be detected by x-ray or ultrasound prior to spaying if the patient has a family history of the medical condition. [...] There is no known scientific study to prove that uterine unicornis is a hereditary genetic disorder. [...] In some cases, the patient may also be missing a kidney on the same side as its missing uterine horn. [...] This phenomenon is also called unilateral renal <b>agenesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The main {{differentials}} for CAIS {{are complete}} gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome) and Müllerian <b>agenesis</b> (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome or MRKH). [...] Both CAIS and Swyer syndrome {{are associated with}} a 46,XY karyotype, whereas MRKH is not; MRKH can thus be ruled out by checking for the presence of a Y chromosome, which can be done either by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis or on full karyotype. [...] Swyer syndrome is distinguished by poor breast development and shorter stature. [...] The diagnosis of CAIS is confirmed when androgen receptor (AR) gene sequencing reveals a mutation, although up to 5% of individuals with CAIS do not have an AR mutation.|$|E
2500|$|Cleckley concludes {{from his}} {{clinical}} {{experience that the}} cause of the disorder of psychopathy is probably not, in general, demonstrably psychodynamic or even psychogenic, although life influences {{may play a role in}} some cases and he notes the progression of the disorder can seem like a kind of social and spiritual (but not actual) suicide, or [...] "semi-suicide". He suggests rather that a subtle yet profound defect at a fundamental biological level, probably inborn in some sense but not hereditary (gives the example of <b>agenesis</b> of the embryo) could be the main cause. He admits [...] "This, too, is still a speculative concept and is not supported by demonstrable evidence." [...] Having called it a defect, he notes that it would be [...] "one that affects complex mechanisms of integration in a subtle and abstruse manner", and as such could actually sometimes be a positive trait or ability which could nevertheless end up bringing about personal problems in society.|$|E
2500|$|BRA {{appears to}} have a {{predominantly}} genetic etiology and many cases represent the most severe manifestation of an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. There are several genetic pathways that could result in this condition. In 2017 researchers identified heritable autosomal dominant mutations in the gene GREB1L in two unrelated families as being the cause of both BRA and URA utilizing Exome Sequencing and direct sequence analysis. [...] This is the first reported genetic lesion implicated in the activation of Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Targets that has been associated with renal <b>agenesis</b> in humans. The majority of other possible candidate genetic pathways are autosomal recessive in nature and do not coincide with the frequency or penetrance at which BRA typically occurs in the human population. Additionally, candidate genetic pathways would be expected to involve genes expressed in the developing urogenital system (UGS). Often, these same genes and/or pathways of interacting genes are also expressed in the developing UGS as well as the central nervous system (CNS), gut, lung, limbs, and eyes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the metanephros to develop in cases of BRA and some cases {{involving}} unilateral renal <b>agenesis</b> (URA) is due primarily to the {{failure of the}} mesonephric duct to produce a ureteric bud capable of inducing the metanephric mesenchyme. The failed induction will thereby cause the subsequent degeneration of the metanephros by apoptosis and other mechanisms. The mesonephric duct(s) of the agenic kidney(s) will also degenerate and fail to connect with the bladder. Therefore, the means by which the fetus produces urine and transports it to the bladder for excretion into the amniotic sac has been severely compromised (in the cases of URA), or completely eliminated (in the cases of BRA). The decreased volume of amniotic fluid causes the growing fetus to become compressed by the mother's uterus. This compression can cause many physical deformities of the fetus, most common of which is Potter facies. [...] Lower extremity anomalies are frequent in these cases, which often presents with clubbed feet and/or bowing of the legs. [...] Sirenomelia, or [...] "Mermaid syndrome" [...] (which occurs approximately in 1:45,000 births) can also present. In fact, nearly all reported cases of sirenomelia also be present with BRA.|$|E
2500|$|Peek {{was born}} in Salt Lake City, Utah with macrocephaly, damage to the cerebellum, and <b>agenesis</b> of the corpus callosum, a {{condition}} in which the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is missing; in Peek's case, secondary connectors such as the anterior commissure were also missing. There is speculation that his neurons made unusual connections due to the absence of a corpus callosum, which resulted in an increased memory capacity. According to Peek's father, Fran (Francis) Peek, Kim was able to memorize things from the age of 16–20 months. He read books, memorized them, and then placed them upside down on the shelf to show that he had finished reading them, a practice he maintained all his life. He could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read, memorizing vast amounts of information in subjects ranging from history and literature, geography and numbers to sports, music and dates. Peek read by scanning the left page with his left eye, then the right page with his right eye. [...] According to an article in The Times newspaper, he could accurately recall the contents of at least 12,000 books.|$|E
50|$|Penile <b>agenesis</b> is a {{birth defect}} in humans, {{occurring}} about once in 5-6 million male births, {{in which a}} male child is born without a penis.A partner condition is testicular or gonadal <b>agenesis.</b> This is when a male child is born without gonads and consequently develops no testes. Penile <b>agenesis</b> occurs often {{as a consequence of}} Testicular <b>agenesis,</b> but the reverse is never the case.
