5|$|Pernick and Wilder {{highlight}} eight major {{clean technology}} sectors: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration. Six major forces, which {{they call the}} six C’s, <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> clean technology into the mainstream: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology.|$|E
5|$|Manila is also {{famed for}} its Art Deco theaters. Some {{of these were}} {{designed}} by National Artists for Architecture such as Juan Nakpil and Pablo Antonio. Unfortunately most of these theaters were neglected, {{and some of it}} have been demolished. The historic Escolta Street in Binondo features many buildings of Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts architectural style, many of which were designed by prominent Filipino architects during the American Rule in the 1920s to the late 1930s. Many architects, artists, historians and heritage advocacy groups <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> for the revival of Escolta Street, which was once the premier street of the Philippines.|$|E

50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped onto the embedded stack, the pushing and popping of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded stack <b>is</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped, the current stack <b>is</b> optionally <b>pushed</b> back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> both {{above and below the}} current stack.|$|R

25|$|Local {{people and}} {{institutions}} <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> {{the provincial government}} for a law, or even a constitutional reform, that grants Rosario the status of Autonomous City, {{in a manner similar}} to Buenos Aires. This would allow the city to organize its government independently, to pass laws, to enact its own tax regulations, etc. The idea of municipal autonomy was expounded and elaborated on by Rosario-born politician Lisandro de la Torre in the first years of the 20th century, and incorporated into the Argentine Constitution as part of the 1994 reform.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Brazil is {{currently}} the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States, mostly for livestock feed, and as prices for soybeans rise, the soy farmers <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> northwards into forested areas of the Amazon. As stated in the Constitution of Brazil, clearing land for crops or fields is considered an ‘effective use’ of land and is the beginning towards land ownership. Cleared property is also valued 510 times more than forested land {{and for that reason}} valuable to the owner whose ultimate objective is resale. The soy industry is an important exporter for Brazil; therefore, the needs of soy farmers have been used to validate many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the Amazon.|$|E

500|$|In Turkey, [...] "many {{believe that}} Armenia's {{territorial}} claims {{are the main}} reason why the Armenian administration and lobbyists <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> for global recognition" [...] of the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism credits the idea of [...] "Great Armenia" [...] to Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. According to Prof. İdris Bal [...] "Turkey considers Armenian policy (and the activities of its powerful diaspora groups) since 1989 to be against its national security interests and territorial integrity. Armenia's failure to recognize the Kars Agreement, along with the frequent public references to eastern Turkey as 'Western Armenia,' provides a serious irritant to Turkey. The Turkish Mt. Ararat is pictured in the official Armenian state emblem, which Turkey interprets {{as a sign that}} the 'greater Armenia' vision is still very much alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Digital rights advocates, {{including}} the Free Software Foundation, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle, {{have criticized the}} iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with GigaOM, was quoted by National Public Radio as saying, [...] "With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands. ... It offers [...] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you." [...] But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart {{the feeling of a}} safe neighborhood, saying, [...] "Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too." [...] Laura Sydell, the article's author, concludes, [...] "As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community." [...] The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns.|$|E
500|$|In early 1835, as the Mexican {{government}} transitioned from a federalist {{model to}} centralism, wary colonists in Texas began forming Committees of Correspondence and Safety. A central committee in San Felipe de Austin coordinated their activities. The Texians staged a minor revolt against customs duties in June; these Anahuac Disturbances prompted Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna to send additional troops to Texas. In July, Colonel Nicolas Condelle, led 200men to reinforce Presidio La Bahía. The following month, {{a contingent of}} soldiers arrived in Béxar with Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea. Fearing that stronger measures were needed to quell the unrest, Santa Anna ordered his brother-in-law, General Martín Perfecto de Cos to [...] "repress with strong arm all those who, forgetting their duties to the nation which has adopted them as her children, <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> forward {{with a desire to}} live at their own option without subjection to the laws". Cos landed at Copano Bay on September 20 with approximately 500soldiers. Cos briefly toured the port at Copano Bay and the small garrison at nearby Refugio and left small groups of soldiers to reinforce each of these locations. The main body of soldiers arrived in Goliad on October 2.|$|E

500|$|Slow {{progress}} {{has led to}} frustration, expressed by {{the executive director of}} the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark Dybul: [...] "we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but we are not doing it." [...] Several international organizations <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government, although adherence is often sketchy. Commercial treatment providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further regulations. The government of Brazil provides universal TB-care, which reduces this problem. Conversely, falling rates of TB-infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates but may be tied to increased level of education, income, and health of the population. Costs of the disease, as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed 150 billion USD per year in [...] "high burden" [...] countries. Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250M rural migrants in China.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} called The Return of the King [...] "bigger and better" [...] than The Two Towers. [...] "In The Two Towers {{the player}} would occasionally run into 10 or 15 enemies," [...] said lead game designer Chris Tremmel, [...] "in The Return of the King there are {{areas where the}} player faces up to 40 orcs [...] Fans familiar with The Two Towers will find that the combat experience in The Return of the King feels familiar but much deeper." [...] Before creating levels, the developers would initially look at the script and determine what parts from the film to highlight in that particular level, and how to structure that event as a mission. They would then write in-depth level designs out on paper, going into details such as combat setup, special props and enemy types, all the while using the film as their main reference point. They would then create an animatic of the level, working out problems and fine-tuning design concepts. The levels would then be created in the game environment. The game is also graphically improved over The Two Towers. According to Neil Young, [...] "we've developed some new lighting techniques to allow the characters to look richer. We <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> 2x the number of polys & 2x the texture density [...] we also stream our geometry and textures from the disc so the game has a much higher density of imagery." [...] Enemy AI was improved, and developers also {{spent a lot of}} time working on the sound of the game, which was THX certified.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the highest}} level of Fire Style jutsu {{exclusive}} to Itachi and Sasuke's Mangekyō Sharingan, said to be the [...] It is the antipode of Tsukuyomi. Amaterasu produces black flames at {{the focal point of the}} user's vision. Once created, it can continue burning for seven days and seven nights. The flames cannot be extinguished with water or any other normal method; only the user can put the flames out. Said to be [...] "the fires from hell" [...] and to burn as hot as the sun itself, Amaterasu burns virtually any material, including other flames, until nothing but ash remains. However, the flames cannot burn through chakra or materials infused with chakra, as they fail to burn into Naruto's Kurama chakra cloak or through Gaara's chakra-infused sand. This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person. Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks. For more advanced users, they can shape Amaterasu into more specialized configurations. Use of Amaterasu puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed. For all its lethal potential, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body parts before it spreads. Other defensive options <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> the flames away, absorbing them, certain space–time ninjutsu, or being the host of the Ten Tails.|$|E
