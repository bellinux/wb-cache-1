5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as <b>a</b> <b>garden</b> hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Chesham {{also had}} {{extensive}} goods facilities, particularly for coal; the goods yard was initially {{equipped with a}} mobile 5-ton crane, replaced by a fixed 8-ton crane between 1898–1900.

During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was equipped with a bay platform for passenger trains, {{to allow it to}} accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously. This bay platform was closed on 29 November 1970 and is now <b>a</b> <b>garden.</b>|$|E

Warwick Castle withstood the siege and was later used to hold prisoners taken by the Parliamentarians.|$|E
50|$|The {{gardens are}} named after Thelma and Charles Mercer, who {{purchased}} 14.5 acre {{in the late}} 1940s for their home and garden.

5|$|In the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was {{replaced}} by Decimus Burton, whose plans for Bournemouth included the construction of <b>a</b> <b>garden</b> alongside the Bourne stream, an idea first mooted by Granville. The fields south of the road crossing (later Bournemouth Square) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks. Many of these paths, including the Invalids' Walk, remain in the town today. A second suggestion of Granville's, a sanatorium, was completed in 1855 and greatly raised Bournemouth's profile as a place for recuperation.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} bird, in {{particular}} honeyeaters, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to bushfire varies. Some populations are serotinous: they {{are killed by}} fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy and are released after a fire. Others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots. Although {{it has been used}} for timber, Banksia marginata is most commonly seen as <b>a</b> <b>garden</b> plant, with dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold.|$|E
5000|$|The Stirling-Maxwells created <b>a</b> {{considerable}} <b>garden</b> [...] - [...] <b>a</b> sub-alpine <b>garden,</b> <b>a</b> wild <b>garden</b> {{beside the}} loch, <b>a</b> rhododendron <b>garden</b> <b>a</b> mile {{away on the}} south shore. Stirling-Maxwell used seeds and plants from the plant expeditions he sponsored to Himalaya, China and Frank Kingdon-Ward's expedition to Assam in 1935. Mountain pine and rhododendrons provided shelter.|$|R
50|$|The {{plants are}} {{arranged}} in distinct collections, including <b>an</b> alpine <b>garden,</b> <b>a</b> fernery, hebe and flax cultivars, <b>a</b> large rock <b>garden,</b> grass and sedge species, and <b>a</b> coastal <b>garden.</b>|$|R
