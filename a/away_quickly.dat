5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains <b>away</b> <b>quickly,</b> preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim <b>away</b> <b>quickly,</b> the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, the 54th Battalion's 1st Company {{attacked}} the area around Isdud's railway station, but was outgunned and had to retreat with four wounded. According to the company's report, the food {{that was given to}} them was rotten and further deteriorated the soldiers' ability to fight. On May 31, the Egyptian radio described the attack as a victory, and claimed hundreds of dead Israelis. The 3rd Company was unsuccessful, as intelligence on precise Egyptian positions was sparse, while the company gave its position <b>away</b> <b>quickly.</b> An Egyptian mortar scored a direct hit on one of the company's squads, which caused casualties and panic. One of the soldiers ran for cover, but lost direction, and ended up in Isdud. He walked around the village unnoticed and found a chance to return to Givati, and provided the command with invaluable information for the operation.|$|E

25|$|The plant {{develops}} a woody, vertical rootstock {{of up to}} 4cm in diameter, at the surface usually covered by the remains of old leaves. The leaves are sessile or decurrent at their base with spiny wings, and alternate set along the stems. The lowest leaves are usually 7–30cm long and 4–16cm wide, pinnately dissected and the sections of the larger leaves may be pinnately parted themselves, and have a dentate or serrate margin, all tipped with spines. The midvein and sideveins are prominent, whitish, sometimes tinged purple. The leaf surface may be covered in spiderweb-like hairs, that tend to wither <b>away</b> <b>quickly.</b>|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1973, {{while he}} was out on patrol in the park, Sullivan saw a storm cloud forming and drove <b>away</b> <b>quickly.</b> But the cloud, he said later, seemed to be {{following}} him. When he finally thought he had outrun it, he decided {{it was safe to}} leave his truck. Soon after, he was struck by a lightning bolt. Sullivan stated that he actually saw the bolt that hit him. The lightning set his hair on fire, moved down his left arm and left leg and knocked off his shoe. It then crossed over to his right leg just below the knee. Still conscious, Sullivan crawled to his truck and poured the can of water, which he always kept there, over his head, which was on fire.|$|E
25|$|Di Grassi forced Engel into {{committing}} {{an error}} and passed {{him to take}} over sixth place. Vergne had now drawn close to race leader Rosenqvist and took advantage of Rosenqvist lifting and coasting. This hindrance allowed Vergne to overtake Rosenqvist easily for first place heading towards turn three on the 29th lap. Vergne's higher top speed enabled him to pull <b>away</b> <b>quickly</b> from Rosenqvist. Prost entered the pit lane because his car had a problem. However, he recorded the race's fastest lap beforehand, completing a circuit in one minute and 23.444 seconds on the previous lap. This earned Prost one point. Bird lost third place to teammate López after a closely contested battle which saw both drivers make contact. Both Audi Sport ABT drivers continued and drew closer to Heidfeld. With two laps remaining in the event, Frijns attempted to pass Duval but both drivers made contact and Duval ended his race in the barrier. Yellow flags were waved in the area but the safety car was not deployed. López caught Rosenqvist in the race's final laps but could not pass him.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Carlton swiftly {{fell from}} {{being one of}} the most {{successful}} clubs, both on-field and off-field, to one of the least successful. The club had been much slower than others to embrace the AFL Draft as a means for recruitment, so when its champion players from the 1990s began to retire in the early 2000s, on-field performances fell <b>away</b> <b>quickly,</b> and in 2002, the club won the wooden spoon for the first time in its VFL/AFL history; it was the last of the twelve Victorian clubs to win the wooden spoon. At the same time, the club was starting to struggle financially, due to unwise investments under John Elliott – most significantly, building a new grandstand at Princes Park during the 1990s, at a time when other clubs were finding it more profitable to play at the higher-capacity central venues. Then, at the end of 2002, it was revealed that Carlton had been systematically cheating the league salary cap during the early 2000s. The scandal resulted in the loss of draft picks and a fine of $930,000, which exacerbated the club's poor on-field and off-field positions.|$|E
25|$|Mugdock Moot Hill – Prior to {{the early}} 18th century, the Moot Hill was an island on Mugdock Loch. The loch was drained between 1710 and 1714 to claim land and {{construct}} avenues for the newly developing Craigend Estate. Gallowhill is nearby. Before 1747 prisoners of Mugdock Castle's barony jail were rowed out to Moot Island for the trial, {{en route to the}} gallows at Gallowhill if they were convicted. Gallowhill is located close to the Visitor Centre. In the SW trench the rock fell <b>away</b> <b>quickly</b> into deep peat deposits. A drystone revetment ran alongside the edge of the mound, which had been interpreted as a landing place or quay. Excavation and survey revealed that this was a stock-proof dyke, probably of 19th-century date. The island was renamed Moot Hill when the loch was drained and became a feature for residents and visitors to Craigend House as it was, and still is, situated close to the main avenue. Excavation work at Moot Hill carried out by Glasgow University in 2003 confirmed that Moot Hill is made of solid rock and has deposits of dark coloured peat covering it.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks <b>away</b> <b>quickly.</b> Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E

500|$|Though Chivers {{built up}} a mild {{reputation}} during his lifetime, counting Algernon Charles Swinburne among his admirers, his fame faded <b>away</b> <b>quickly</b> after his death. Other writers that acknowledged his influence included Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti. Others, however, were more critical. One anonymous reviewer, possibly Evert Augustus Duyckinck, joked that Chivers was formulaic and suggested the formula included 30% Percy Bysshe Shelley, 20% Poe, 20% [...] "mild idiocy", 10% [...] "gibbering idiocy", 10% [...] "raving mania" [...] and 10% [...] "sweetness and originality".

The {{rest of the family}} call him from outside and Lisa tells him that he can use a secret tunnel that Sir Walter Raleigh built to escape. However, the tunnel leads straight into the Queen's bedroom, and she calls her guards. Homer pleads with the Queen to find it in her heart to forgive him and she allows him to leave the country on the condition that he take Madonna back to America with him. As they prepare to leave, Edwina appears and introduces Abe to her daughter Abbie Simpson, who looks and sounds like a British female version of Homer. Fearing that he is most likely the father, Abe runs <b>away</b> <b>quickly</b> to the plane, while Homer appears smitten by his possible half-sister.|$|E

[...] Oxford came back into contention {{and by the time the}} crews shot Hammersmith Bridge there was [...] "little or no daylight between the boats." [...] The other side of the bridge the crews hit rough water and as Cambridge had the advantage of shelter on their side of the river, they pulled <b>away</b> <b>quickly</b> to be three lengths clear by Chiswick. [...] As the bend of the river began to favour the Dark Blues, they drew up once again and were almost level by Barnes Bridge when their number seven Douglas McLean broke his oar in two, effectively ending his participation in the race. Cambridge pulled away again and won by two-and-a-half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 52 seconds. [...] It was their second consecutive victory and their fastest time since the 1876 race. The win took the overall record to 2320 in Oxford's favour.|$|E
500|$|Closely {{following}} Victory as {{she passed}} through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship Bucentaure, Harvey was forced to sheer <b>away</b> <b>quickly,</b> just missing Victorys stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking raking fire from two French ships, the 80-gun Neptune and the 74-gun Redoutable, as she did so. Redoutables broadside carried away Temeraires mizzen topmast. While avoiding a broadside from Neptune, Temeraire narrowly avoided a collision with Redoutable. Another broadside from Neptune brought down Temeraires fore-yard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. Harvey now became aware that the Redoutable had come up alongside the Victory and swept her decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board the Victory. Temeraire was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across Redoutables stern, Temeraire discharged a double-shotted broadside into her. Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, captain of the Redoutable, recorded that [...] "...the three-decker – who had doubtless perceived that the Victory had ceased fire and would inevitably be taken – ran foul of the Redoutable to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It {{would be impossible to}} describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it." ...|$|E
500|$|Drawing {{attention}} to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably mise en abyme and recursions) to stimulate the viewer to ask themselves why his films are put together in such ways and why the films provoke particular responses. He sometimes uses editing {{as a way to}} represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience. For example, in Memento the fragmented sequential order of scenes is to put the audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In The Prestige, the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film. His writing style incorporates a number of storytelling techniques such as flashbacks, shifting points of view and unreliable narrators. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting <b>away</b> <b>quickly</b> from the money shot (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and crosscutting several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax. In 2017, noted film theorist and historian David Bordwell wrote about Nolan's fascination with subjective storytelling and crosscutting, [...] "It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques ... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He seems to me a very thoughtful, almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities." ...|$|E
