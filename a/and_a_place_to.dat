The Vichy France gendarmerie used the documentation made in the passports of its citizens to monitor their movements for which a threshold was set, along with imprisonment for violations This adversely affected the Romani. Lundi uses her powers as a clerk, and forges their passports, removing the documentation about their movements.|$|E

500|$|In the Herald Sun, Leigh Paatsch {{gave the}} film one star. He criticised the casting, {{describing}} {{the main characters}} as [...] "supposed to be aged about 20 [...] played by blokes who all look as if they’re 30-plus, and carry on as if they’re not yet 10", and also found the film misogynistic, saying [...] "the derogatory manner in which women are spoken of (and often depicted) is relentlessly, callously crass. Sometimes even hateful". A mixed review from Philippa Hawker of the Sydney Morning Herald concluded [...] "The Australian elements seem hastily inserted and incidental: the movie could have been set in any country that had a water park <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> get lost. But as a hymn to male bonding, and {{an exploration of the}} comic possibilities of what happens when a turd hits a water slide, The Inbetweeners 2 is a precisely crafted, assured piece of work".|$|E

500|$|While British and {{international}} media covered punk intensively, the new grassroots metal movement remained underground until 1978, largely ignored by popular music magazines such as New Musical Express, The Face and Melody Maker and by radio stations. News about the bands and music circulated by word-of-mouth and fanzines, or through interested DJs, who travelled {{the country from}} club to club. Neal Kay {{was one of those}} DJs; he started to work in 1975 at a [...] called The Bandwagon in Kingsbury, North West London, housed in the back-room of the Prince of Wales pub and equipped with a massive sound system. He transformed his nights at The Bandwagon into The Heavy Metal Soundhouse, a spot specialising in hard rock and heavy metal music <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> listen to albums of established acts and to demos of new bands, which circulated among fans through cassette trading.|$|E
500|$|The {{crowd that}} {{gathered}} in St Peter's Field arrived in disciplined and organised contingents. Each village or chapelry {{was given a}} time <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> meet, from where its members were to proceed to assembly points in the larger towns or townships, and from there on to Manchester. Contingents were sent {{from all around the}} region, the largest and [...] "best dressed" [...] of which was a group of 10,000 who had travelled from Oldham Green, comprising people from Oldham, Royton (which included a sizeable female section), Crompton, Lees, Saddleworth and Mossley. Other sizeable contingents marched from Middleton and Rochdale (6,000 strong) and Stockport (1,500–5,000 strong). Reports {{of the size of the}} crowd at the meeting vary substantially. Contemporaries estimated it from 30,000 to as many as 150,000; modern estimates are 60,000–80,000. Scholar Joyce Marlow describes the event as [...] "The most numerous meeting that ever took place in Great Britain" [...] and elaborates that the generally accepted figure of 60,000 would have been six per cent of the population of Lancashire, or half the population of the immediate area around Manchester.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Veitch told Brown {{that she}} {{believed}} that the JC's Girls ministry needed to move to Las Vegas, and he responded supportively. By 2008, Veitch had moved to Las Vegas and based the new chapter of JC's Girls at Central Christian Church in nearby Henderson, Nevada, leaving {{the leadership of the}} Riverside chapter to Albee. That year, Veitch collaborated with Annie Lobert, a former call girl working with Hookers for Jesus, an organization similar to JC's Girls. The organizations were both represented at that year's AVN Adult Entertainment Expo. The PussyCat Preacher, a documentary film about Veitch's experiences starting JC's Girls, was released that February. The following month, pornographic film actor Sophia Lynn left the sex industry after becoming a Christian; she underwent {{more than a year of}} counselling with Veitch through JC's Girls. Veitch had flown to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to spend a weekend educating Celebrate Community Church about the sex industry.

Obsle is the commensal of the Sekeve District, and was once the head of the Orgota Naval Trade Commission in Erhenrang, where he became acquainted with Estraven. Estraven describes him as the nearest thing to an honest person among the politicians of Orgoreyn. Yegey is the commensal who first finds Estraven during his exile, and who gives Estraven a job <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live in Mishnory.

Although Obsle and Yegey support Ai's mission, they see him more as a means of increasing their own influence within the council; thus they eventually betray him to the Sarf, in order to save themselves. Their Open Trade faction takes control of the council after Ai's presence in Karhide becomes known at the end of the novel.|$|E
500|$|... 4chan {{was started}} in 2003 in the bedroom of Christopher Poole, a then-15-year-old student from New York City whose 4chan handle is [...] "moot". Prior to {{starting}} 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the Something Awful forums. He intended 4chan to be an American counterpart to the popular Japanese Futaba Channel ("2chan") imageboard <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> discuss manga and anime. Upon the creation of 4chan, Poole encouraged users from the Something Awful subforum titled [...] "Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse", who also happened to be dissatisfied with the forum, to discuss anime on his website. Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked {{the concept of a}} message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the source code for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using Altavista's Babelfish online translator. During 4chan's earliest days, it had only two boards: [...] "/a/ – Anime/General" [...] and [...] "/b/ – Anime/Random" [...] (the very first board to be created); more boards were created over time, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply [...] "/b/ – Random".|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Beck {{caught a}} bus to New York City {{with little more than}} eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the summer {{attempting}} to find a job <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side and stumbled upon {{the tail end of the}} East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. [...] "The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones," [...] said Beck of his New York years. [...] "Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure." [...] Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. [...] "I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up," [...] he later remarked. [...] "It was hard to be in New York with no money, no place I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me." ...|$|E

Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded the lead acting performances of Swank, Sevigny, Saarsgard, and Sexton III, writing, [...] "It {{may be the}} best-acted film of the year". Online film reviewer James Berardinelli gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four; he highlighted the performances of Swank and Sevigny as the film's greatest success and likened the film's intensity to that of a train wreck. Berardinelli wrote that Swank [...] "gives the performance of her career" [...] and that [...] "Sevigny's performance is more conventional than Swank's, but no less effective. She provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film." [...] Emanuel Levy of Variety called the acting [...] "flawless" [...] and concluded that the [...] "stunningly accomplished" [...] and [...] "candid" [...] film could be [...] "seen as a Rebel Without a Cause for these culturally diverse and complex times, with the two misfits enacting a version of the James Dean—Natalie Wood romance with utmost conviction, searching, like their '50s counterparts, for love, self-worth <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> call home". Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post said the performances are of such [...] "luminous humanity that they break your heart". Premiere listed Swank's performance as one of the [...] "100 Greatest Performances of All Time". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called Swank a [...] "revelation" [...] and wrote, [...] "by the end, her Brandon/Teena is beyond male or female.
