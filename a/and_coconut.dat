5|$|Daily life in Mau's {{village on}} Satawal {{involved}} harvesting taro and gathering breadfruit <b>and</b> <b>coconut.</b> The Satawalese people also raised chicken and pork and caught fish, their {{primary source of}} protein. A freshwater pond served as bathing facilities. Local materials were used to construct outrigger canoes called proa. The island's isolation helped preserve the lifestyle of the Satawalese people and Mau's role as a navigator. Even {{with the arrival of}} the Germans (1890) and the Japanese (1914) in Micronesia, Satawalese culture remained intact. American missionaries who arrived after World War II built the first church and school on Satawal.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} the empire was largely {{dependent}} on agriculture. Sorghum (jowar), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane, rice, and wheat thrived in rainy areas. Betel leaves, areca (for chewing), <b>and</b> <b>coconut</b> were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.|$|E
5|$|The only deadly {{storm of}} the season was Elinah, which formed on January9 in the Mozambique Channel. It moved to the {{southwest}} and was intensifying when it struck Comoros on January11. There, high winds and waves heavily damaged banana <b>and</b> <b>coconut</b> crops, and the storm damaged or destroyed 4,357buildings. High waves knocked 40people off a pier on Anjouan, killing 33 of them. Damage in Comoros totaled $23.1million (1983USD). Elinah intensified before brushing the coast of Mozambique, and it dissipated on January9. Aside from a weak storm classified by the JTWC in February, there was minimal activity for several months. The final storm {{of the season}} was Tropical Depression Fely, which dropped moderate rainfall in eastern Madagascar in late June.|$|E

5|$|The willie wagtail {{is at home}} in a {{wide variety}} of habitats, but avoids densely forested areas such as rainforest. It prefers semi-open {{woodland}} or grassland with scattered trees, often near wetlands or bodies of water. In New Guinea, it inhabits man-made clearings and grasslands, as well as open forest and mangroves. On Guadalcanal, it was reported from open areas <b>and</b> <b>coconut</b> groves. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and can often be seen hunting in open, grassed areas such as lawns, gardens, parkland, and sporting grounds. The species spread into the Western Australian Wheatbelt after the original vegetation had been cleared for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cosme caused minor, but widespread, {{damage on}} {{mainland}} Mexico. Unstable structures, {{such as those}} made of wood <b>and</b> <b>coconut,</b> suffered the most damage {{as a result of}} the storm. Flooding and multiple landslides also left damaged and caused road blockages. Heavy rains were reported in southwest and south central Mexico, particularly in Michoacan. High waves were reported along the coast from Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, to Acapulco, Guerrero. In Guerrero, rain caused at least 24landslides, blocking state highways in several locations. Precipitation {{as a result of the}} storm system also resulted in flooding in the port city of Acapulco. Storm flooding damaged 50homes, mainly due to the overflown streams of the Tlapa River. In Colima, coastal flooding induced by a storm surge damaged 34 tourist facilities, according to the Secretary of State Economic Development. Most of these facilities were located in the municipalities of Tecomny and Armory.|$|E
5|$|Making {{landfall}} {{near the}} border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony's Corozal and Orange Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was {{expected to have a}} 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, <b>and</b> <b>coconut</b> experienced the most severe damage of any crop.|$|E

5|$|Remains of Pennatomys nivalis {{come from}} several Amerindian archeological sites {{on each of}} the three islands where it has been found; it was eaten by the native Amerindian population. The oldest site is Hichmans' Shell Heap on Nevis, which is from the Archaic age and is dated to 790 to 520BCE. The youngest, Sulphur Ghaut (900–1200 CE), is also on Nevis, and is from the post-Saladoid period. Other sites on Nevis include Hichmans (Saladoid, 100 BCE – 600 CE), Indian Castle (post-Saladoid, 650–880 CE), <b>and</b> <b>Coconut</b> Walk (post-Saladoid, no {{absolute}} dates known). The only site on Sint Eustatius is the Saladoid and post-Saladoid site Golden Rock (80 BCE – 980 CE). Each of the three sites yielding Pennatomys on Saint Kitts is from the post-Saladoid period: Sugar Factory (700–1000 CE), Bloody Point (660–1115 CE), and Cayon (undated).|$|E
5|$|The Roce (anointing) ceremony, {{conducted}} one or {{two days}} before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of the bride and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of the bride and groom, who are anointed with roce, a mixture of coconut milk <b>and</b> <b>coconut</b> oil, while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (betel leaves) during the marriage ceremony, which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The bride is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns). Some non-marriage traditions include Novemjeevon (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and Novem (blessing of new harvests).|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries the British {{recruited}} {{large numbers}} of South Indians, primarily Indian Tamils, to work in tea, coffee, rubber <b>and</b> <b>coconut</b> plantations in Ceylon. Ceylon's majority Sinhalese viewed Indian Tamils with deep suspicion, fearing that they would dominate the island's central highlands and ally themselves with the indigenous Ceylon Tamils, increasing the latter's political strength. Following independence from Britain in February 1948, Ceylon's Sinhalese dominated government introduced the Ceylon Citizenship Bill which {{had the effect of}} denying citizenship and making stateless the country's Indian Tamils, who by now accounted for 11% of the population. The bill provided for citizenship by descent or registration but both required documentary proof, something that was difficult for most Indian Tamils, many of whom were illiterate. The ACTC opposed the bill which was passed by Parliament at its second reading on 20 August 1948. Shortly afterwards Ponnambalam decided to join the United National Party (UNP) led government which caused a split in the ACTC. Eventually the ACTC dissidents, led by Chelvanayakam, E. M. V. Naganathan and C. Vanniasingam formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK, Federal Party) on 18 December 1949.|$|E

5|$|Later, Mitag passed near several {{islands in}} Yap State, first {{affecting}} Woleai. On the island, high wind gusts of around 170km/h (105mph) knocked out power and downed breadfruit <b>and</b> <b>coconut</b> trees. The winds destroyed a few houses, forcing residents to evacuate {{to a local}} school. Mitag dropped heavy rainfall while passing by Yap state, peaking at 255mm (10.05in) on Ngulu Atoll. On Yap, the typhoon produced sustained winds of 56km/h (35mph), with gusts to 141km/h (87mph). The winds also caused an islandwide power outage that lasted for about two days, and damaged {{the roof of the}} Yap International Airport terminal. High waves and storm surge damaged coastal structures and flooded areas up to 150m (500ft) inland. The seawall at the capital city of Colonia was damaged, and portions of the town were flooded 1.5m (5ft) deep. The storm destroyed over 150houses on Yap, leaving hundreds staying in shelters. Across the island, the winds knocked down trees onto roads, and saltwater intrusion caused severe crop damage; most of the taro and banana crops were destroyed. Damage in the FSM totaled $150million, of which $100million from crop damage.|$|E
