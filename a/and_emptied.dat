5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure <b>and</b> <b>emptied</b> {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E

25|$|Now, however, new {{scholarly}} research {{printed in}} the 2010 issue of JEA clearly establishes that Queen Tyti was in fact Ramesses III's wife based on certain copies of parts of the tomb robbery papyri (or Papyrus BM EA 10052)—made by Anthony Harris—which discloses confessions made by Egyptian tomb robbers who broke into Tyti's tomb <b>and</b> <b>emptied</b> it of its jewellery. Tyti is named as a queen of pharaoh Ramesses III which means that she was most likely king Ramesses IV's own mother since Ramesses VI {{is known to be}} the son of another queen of Ramesses III named Iset Ta-Hemdjert. Even the Egyptologist Aidan Dodson who doubted Grist's theory on the identity of Tyti's royal husband now accepts this new evidence since it comes from newly deciphered notes of this tomb robbery papyrus made by Anthony Harris.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14December 1952, Christie strangled Ethel in bed. She had last been seen in public two days earlier. Christie invented several stories to explain his wife's {{disappearance}} and to help mitigate the possibility of further inquiries being made. In reply to a letter from relatives in Sheffield, he wrote that Ethel had rheumatism and could not write herself; to one neighbour, he explained that she was visiting her relatives in Sheffield; to another, he {{said that she had}} gone to Birmingham. Christie had resigned from his job on 6December and had been unemployed since then. To support himself, Christie sold Ethel's wedding ring, watch, and furniture. Every week he went to the Labour Exchange to collect his unemployment benefit. On 26 January 1953 he forged his wife's signature <b>and</b> <b>emptied</b> her bank account.|$|E
25|$|Another MiG-21 {{trying to}} make its way away from the battle zone was being chased by Avraham Salmon. Having spotted Salmon on his tail, Vladimir Zhuravlev was {{maneuvering}} hard to deny Salmon the opportunity to shoot him down. Salmon had already fired a missile that failed to cause any damage, when Spector's 101 Squadron Mirage joined the fight and fired another pair at the MiG. Although at least one struck home, these too failed to bring the aircraft down, and it continued to fly away to the northwest. Salmon continued to give chase to the vicinity of Helwan, where he managed to close {{the distance to the}} MiG <b>and</b> <b>emptied</b> his cannon into the aircraft. With both his ammunition and fuel exhausted, he departed the scene. Only years later (see below) was it revealed that Zhuravlev's aircraft had in fact crashed and its pilot killed. Spector and Salmon were both credited with a shared kill, the fifth and last of the battle.|$|E

The soldiers at one double slipway, he discovered, had plotted with bandits to wreck heavy imperial barges {{so that they}} could steal the spilled grain. In 984 Qiao installed a pair of sluice-gates two hundred and fifty feet apart, the entire structure roofed over like a building. By siting two staunch gates so close by one another, Qiao had created a short stretch of canal, effectively a pound-lock, filled from the canal above by raising individual wooden baulks in the top gate <b>and</b> <b>emptied</b> into the canal below by lowering baulks in the top gate and raising ones in the lower.|$|E

U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors Jean Hillery, 56, and Thomas Quadros, 52, and state Department of Food and Agriculture Inspector William Shaline, 57, were killed. One California State Inspector, Earl Willis, 51, managed to escape into a nearby bank located there on Washington Street as a now fuming Alexander chased after him down the block, which was recorded on camcorder by the proprietor {{of one of the}} nearby businesses. After Alexander's failed attempt to shoot Willis, he immediately went back to his linguisa factory lobby <b>and</b> <b>emptied</b> three more shots into the heads of the victims, making sure that they were dead.

25|$|The Palace of Lausus was renowned {{throughout}} Constantinople for {{the vast}} collection of heroic and mythological statues that its owner housed within its walls. Lausus amassed this huge collection from eastern temples that were being sacked <b>and</b> <b>emptied</b> {{during the reign of}} Theodosius – and, as such, his collection was likely the most diverse to have existed in Constantinople at the time. Lausus' collection of pagan statues was the first that was dispassionately assembled on purely aesthetic and historical grounds, even though he was reportedly a devout Christian. Foremost amongst his collection was the statue of Zeus from Olympia carved by Phidias in circa 500 BC and Praxiteles' Aphrodite of Cnidus. Lausus is also known to have owned the Hera of Samos and the Athena of Lindos, as well as statues of both Eros and Kairos. Reports indicate that Lausus had arranged his collection in a certain order. The aforementioned statue of Zeus was located in an apse {{at the far end of}} the hall, with Eros and Kairos at his side. One wall was dedicated to sculptures of goddesses, the other of animals.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match of}} Triplemanía XIX saw Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans {{defending}} the AAA World Tag Team Championship in a steel cage match against TNA X Division Champion Abyss and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Mr. Anderson. The team whose both members {{managed to escape}} the cage would be declared the winner. Abyss and Anderson dominated the match early, but eventually Extreme Tiger {{was able to get}} away from Abyss and escape the cage. In a two–on–one advantage the TNA team was even more dominant and after more double–teaming, Mr. Anderson eventually climbed out of the cage. Left in the cage with Abyss, Evans managed to dodge his attack, use his speed to take him down and hit him with a 450° splash. Evans attempted to escape the cage, but Abyss stopped him, opened the bag he had entered the cage with <b>and</b> <b>emptied</b> its contents, thumbtacks, on the mat. Abyss attempted to chokeslam Evans off the ropes, but Evans escaped the hold by biting his fingers and then powerbombed him onto the tacks. Evans {{climbed to the top of}} the cage, but, instead of escaping, dove back into the ring onto Abyss with a crossbody. Immediately afterwards, Evans climbed back up and escaped the cage to successfully defend the AAA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
