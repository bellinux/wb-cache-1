50|$|Between 1905 and 1913, the British Army Officer and {{aeronaut}} J. W. Dunne {{developed a}} series of tailless aircraft characterised by swept wings with <b>a</b> conical <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

50|$|Terete is a {{term used}} in botany to {{describe}} a cross section that is circular, or like a distorted circle, with a single surface wrapping around it. This is usually contrasted with cross-sections that are flattened, with a distinct upper surface {{that is different from}} the lower surface. The cross-section of a branch in a tree is somewhat round, so the branch is terete. The cross section of a normal leaf has <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>surface,</b> and a lower surface, so the leaf is not terete. However, the fleshy leaves of succulents are sometimes terete. Fruticose lichens are terete, with a roughly circular cross section and a single wrap-around skin-like surface called the cortex, compared to foliose lichens and crustose lichens, which have a flattened cross section with <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> that is distinct from the lower surface.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} paper mulches and two different biodegradable plastic mulches on the yield of field-grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) was examined. The studies were conducted during two climatically different growing seasons 2011 and 2012 in Southern Finland.  All the mulches increased the yield {{as compared to}} bare ground. In 2011, cucumbers on all the mulches with <b>a</b> dark <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> produced higher yields than those on kraft paper alone. In 2012, when the average temperatures were lower than in 2011, {{there were no differences}} in yield between different types of mulches. Soil temperatures of the experimental plots were monitored throughout the growing seasons. The mulches with <b>a</b> dark-colored <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> increased the soil temperature more than the ones with <b>a</b> light-colored <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b> The soil warming effect of the mulches was greater during early season and diminished when the plants grew larger and their leaves covered most of the mulch surface. There was no need for weed control except in uncovered plots. In conclusion, during both years dark-colored paper mulch was comparable to biodegradable film in yield production and could replace it as a mulch material in cucumber production...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a normal}} laccolith the intruded {{material}} has a flat lower <b>surface</b> and <b>a</b> convex <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> {{so that it}} is more like half a lens in shape. However, because of the collapse of the volcanic material combined with subsequent surface erosion, the Prospect Hill laccolith had <b>a</b> concave <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> until modern times, when quarrying altered its shape. This has given rise to its description as [...] "caldera-like" [...] although it is not a true caldera, and explains why the Hill, although a laccolith (which is normally dome-shaped), is in fact dish-shaped. Thus Prospect Hill is neither a volcanic crater nor a caldera, since no volcanic material reached the surface of the earth. In a caldera, the collapse of the roof occurs during the volcanic period and is normally a much more explosive event.|$|R

Round-trip gravity measurements at a lower and <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of <b>a</b> tripod with about 0. 97 m height difference using four SCINTREX CG 5 gravimeters were conducted. Estimated gravity gradient were 0. 285 to 0. 290 mGal/m. These values were smaller than the Free-air gradient of 0. 3086 mGal/m, which is usually referred.
