Back in Melbourne, Spry employed Carole West to organise a publicity shoot for TV and press to display his band having their long hair done at a women's hair salon in South Yarra.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{national}} survey indicate that each year several hundred <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers</b> in the United Kingdom suffer from dermatitis of the hands {{as a result of}} excessive exposure to shampoos. Dry skin, eczema or psoriasis are sometimes predisposing causes, by lessening the tolerance of shampoos. Preventive measures are outlined which, if implemented, could sharply reduce the incidence and severity of sham-poo dermatitis among <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers.</b> THE Hindi word shampna, with its imperative of shampo—press, was originally applied to the sub-jection of the body to kneading or massage after a hot bath; today it refers to lathering, washing and rubbing of the scalp and hair. According to Harry (1955) shampoos are "pre-parations of a surfactant (i. e. surface action material) in suitable form—liquid, solid or powder —which when used under the conditions specified will remove surface grease, dirt and skin debris from the hair shaft and scalp without adversely affecting the hair, scalp or health of the user. " We are concerned with the harmful effects that may occur on the skin of the hands of <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers</b> as a result of repeated exposure to shampoos. As representatives of the British Medical Associ-ation and of the Royal College of Physicians on the Hairdressing Council we have felt it our duty to investigate the incidence of shampoo dermatitis in <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers</b> and to make recom-mendations designed to reduce the incidence of the condition...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES - The role of atopic constitution, contact sensitization, transepidermal water loss, and {{dry skin}} in the {{development}} of hand dermatitis was investigated in a prospective study of 74 <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers</b> and 111 <b>apprentice</b> nurses. METHODS - Base-line measurements included a questionnaire on personal characteristics and anamnestic information, examination of hand skin, measurements of transepidermal water loss, patch tests, and prick tests. The condition of the hands, previous exposure, and transepidermal water loss were followed at intervals of four to six weeks. Cox proportional hazard models were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS - The average incidence rate of hand dermatitis was 32. 8 cases per 100 person-years for the hairdressers and 14. 5 cases per 100 person-years for the nurses. The rate ratio of having a dry versus normal skin type was 7. 3 for the hairdressers [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 2. 2 - 24 - 3] and 1. 7 for the nurses (95 % CI 0. 5 - 6. 4). Apprentice nurses with a history of (atopic) mucosal symptoms had a 3. 4 -fold increased incidence rate of hand dermatitis (95 % CI 1. 05 - 11. 2). The rate ratio of mucosal atopy for the <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers</b> was 2. 2 (95 % CI 0. 7 - 6. 7). Graphic display of the results suggested an increased risk of hand dermatitis among the <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers</b> with transepidermal water loss on the hand greater than 15 g. m- 2. h, but the relative risk of increased transepidermal water loss was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS - The most important endogenous risk factors for hand dermatitis among the <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers</b> and nurses were the presence of dry skin and a history of mucosal atopy. No relationship between increased transepidermal water loss and the risk of hand dermatitis was observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to compare the {{protective}} action of a new barrier cream (Excipial Protect, Spirig Pharma AG, Egerkingen, Switzerland) to its vehicle in the context of hand irritation of <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers</b> caused by repeated shampooing and exposure to hair-care products. This was a double-blind cross-over comparing Excipial Protect (containing aluminium chlorohydrate 5 % as active ingredient) against its vehicle alone. The efficacy of the creams was evaluated taking into account: (1) clinical scores by researchers, (2) biometric measurements, (3) subjective opinions of the subjects. An analysis of variance was performed considering order of application, degree of atopy, and reported number of shampoos. We observed very little difference in efficacy between the protective cream and its vehicle. The presence, however, of aluminium chlorhydrate in the protective cream was shown to have a positive effect against work-related irritation. The cosmetic qualities of the creams seemed, to the participants, to be as important as their real protective and hydrating properties, an important factor in compliance issues...|$|R

40|$|This trial adapted paper based {{resources}} into eBooks and tested various eReaders {{on a group}} of <b>apprentice</b> <b>hairdressers.</b> Hair and beauty learning resources have traditionally been paper-based, providing the individual learner with a self directed and self-paced approach to learning. The learners in this context are apprentices working in widely distributed small to micro sized enterprises. Skill development occurs {{both on and off the}} job and seamless resources that support this model are highly sought after by industry as they can reduce the time apprentices spend in training off the job. The emergence of a generation that is comfortable with technology requires innovative solutions that are supportive and inclusive of specific learning styles. Current resources are seen by learners as rather ‘dry’, uninteresting and physically cumbersome. Additionally there is a growing awareness among learners that continually disposing of paper-based resources as updates occur is not environmentally responsible. In response, this trial explored how to convert and adapt print-based resources to a format that can be converted to a range of eBooks; and investigated the opportunities and challenges presented by a range of e-readers...|$|R
