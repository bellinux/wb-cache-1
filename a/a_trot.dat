5|$|The Narragansett Pacer {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the creation of the American Saddlebred, the Standardbred and the Tennessee Walking Horse. The breed was also combined with French pacers to create the Canadian Pacer, a breed especially suited to racing over ice and which also contributed substantially to the creation of the Standardbred. In the early 19th century, Pacer mares were bred to stallions of the fledgling Morgan breed. However, the Morgan breed was selected for <b>a</b> <b>trot</b> as an intermediate gait, and thus ambling horses were frowned upon, so most Narragansett/Morgan crosses were sold to Canada, the Caribbean, and South America, so the bloodlines did not remain within the Morgan breed. Other breeds indirectly influenced by the Narragansett Pacer include the Rocky Mountain Horse, a gaited breed started in Kentucky, and the Tiger Horse, a gaited breed with Appaloosa patterning.|$|E
5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} United States that was {{developed}} by crossing Spanish-American type gaited pinto ponies with gaited horse breeds, such as the Tennessee Walking Horse. The result was a colorful, smooth-gaited horse, used in the show ring and for pleasure and trail riding. Two registries have been created for the breed, one in 1979 {{and the other in}} 1985. The two have similar registration requirements, although one has an open stud book and the other is slightly more strict with regard to parentage requirements, having a semi-closed stud book. The Spotted Saddle Horse is a light riding horse, always pinto in color. Solid-colored foals from registered parents may be registered for identification purposes, so their pinto-colored foals have documented parentage. They always perform an ambling gait, rather than <b>a</b> <b>trot,</b> in addition to the gaits of walk and canter, performed by all breeds.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} gait of a Rottweiler is <b>a</b> <b>trot.</b> Therefore, the Rottweiler is a trotter. Trotting in this breed is by {{no means}} a fault and is required. This movement comes naturally to the Rottweiler and should appear as such; any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler's legs, both front and hind, should move in a straight forward and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the Rottweiler moves in should also be straight. The Rottweiler's gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today.|$|E
25|$|As the British {{war machine}} pushed on across the Sinai Peninsula the {{infrastructure}} and supporting British garrisons strongly held all the territory they occupied. By {{the end of}} February 1917, 388miles of railway (at a rate of 1 kilometre a day), 203miles of metalled road, 86miles of wire and brushwood roads and 300miles of water pipeline had been constructed. The pipeline required three huge pumping plants working 24hours a day at Kantara, near a reservoir of 6,000,000 gallons. For local use, the pumps forced the water through 5inch pipe to Dueidar, through a 6inch pipe to Pelusium, Romani and Mahemdia and through a 12inch pipe the main supply was pushed across the desert from pumping station to pumping station. At Romani a concrete reservoir contained a further 6,000,000 gallons, at Bir el Abd 5,000,000 and at Mazar 500,000 and another of 500,000 at El Arish. And with railhead at Rafa, Gaza was by then just twenty miles away, five to six hours for infantry and mounted units at a walk and 2hours distant for horses at <b>a</b> <b>trot.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{head has}} a {{straight}} profile, broad forehead, large eyes and small ears. The chest is deep and wide and the croup long and level. The feet and legs are clean and heavily muscled. The overall {{impression of the}} Percheron is one of power and ruggedness.

500|$|All horses move {{naturally}} {{with four}} basic gaits: the four-beat walk, which averages the two-beat trot or jog at [...] (faster for harness racing horses); the canter or lope, a three-beat gait that {{is and the}} gallop. The gallop averages , but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is [...] Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot. There also are several four-beat [...] "ambling" [...] gaits that are approximately the speed of <b>a</b> <b>trot</b> or pace, though smoother to ride. These include the lateral rack, running walk, and tölt {{as well as the}} diagonal fox trot. Ambling gaits are often genetic in some breeds, known collectively as gaited horses. Often, gaited horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits.|$|E
500|$|Cats, like dogs, are digitigrades. They walk {{directly}} on their toes, with {{the bones of}} their feet making up {{the lower part of}} the visible leg. Cats are capable of walking very precisely because, like all felines, they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a [...] "pacing" [...] gait; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with camels and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into <b>a</b> <b>trot,</b> a cat's gait changes to be a [...] "diagonal" [...] gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as lizards): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of Moonraker in 1979, the Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, while clearly expressing his {{approval}} of the advanced special effects and Ken Adam's extravagant production sets, criticised the pace in which {{the locations of the}} film evolved, remarking that, [...] "it's so jammed with faraway places and science fiction special effects that Bond has to move at <b>a</b> <b>trot</b> just to make it into all the scenes". Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said of the film: [...] "Most rational observers agree that Moonraker is without a doubt the most absurd James Bond movie, definitely of the Roger Moore era and possibly of all time". However, while he criticised the extravagance of the plot and action sequences, he believed that this added to the enjoyment of the film, and particularly approved of the remark [...] "I think he's attempting re-entry!" [...] by [...] "Q" [...] during Bond and Goodhead's orbiting of the Earth which he described as [...] "featuring what might be the best double entendre ever".|$|E
500|$|Like other hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus {{is thought}} to have been a facultative biped, meaning that it mostly moved on four legs, but could adopt a bipedal stance when needed. It {{probably}} went on all fours when standing still or moving slowly, and switched to using the hind legs alone when moving more rapidly. Research conducted by computer modeling in 2007 suggests that Edmontosaurus could run at high speeds, perhaps up to [...] Further simulations using a subadult specimen estimated as weighing [...] when alive produced a model that could run or hop bipedally, use <b>a</b> <b>trot,</b> pace, or single foot symmetric quadrupedal gait, or move at a gallop. The researchers found to their surprise that the fastest gait was kangaroo-like hopping (maximum simulated speed of [...] ), which they regarded as unlikely based {{on the size of the}} animal and lack of hopping footprints in the fossil record, and instead interpreted the result as indicative of an inaccuracy in their simulation. The fastest non-hopping gaits were [...] galloping (maximum simulated speed of [...] ) and running bipedally (maximum simulated speed of [...] ). They found weak support for bipedal running as the most likely option for high-speed movement, but did not rule out high-speed quadrupedal movement.|$|E
500|$|Arriving {{with his}} corps at Friedland on 13 June after nightfall, Lannes found the {{position}} already occupied by Russian forces. Very early on 14 June, Lannes intrepidly attacked {{with an almost}} symbolic force (between 11,000 and 13,500 men) against the might of a massed enemy army of 85,000. His goal was to prevent the enemy from crossing the Alle and to give Napoleon enough time to arrive with {{the remainder of his}} forces. Nansouty's division arrived on the field of battle at Friedland after the first engagements and was directed towards the strategic village of Heinrichsdorf. This village needed to be held, as it protected Lannes's communications with the rest of Napoleon's army. Grouchy also directed his dragoon division towards the village and was shocked to find it in enemy hands and Nansouty's men retreating at <b>a</b> <b>trot,</b> without even attempting to contain the enemy or to cover the route that represented the corps' communication line. In fact, Nansouty had arrived not long before and had been instructed to place himself at Heinrichsdorf, without further instructions and without being informed of what was happening on the right. As Russian infantry and cavalry were boldly pressing him, he became concerned with his own lines of communication and thus ordered his men back, to avoid being cut off.|$|E

500|$|The regulars soon {{reached a}} point in the road now {{referred}} to as the [...] "Bloody Angle" [...] where the road rises and curves sharply to the left through a lightly-wooded area. [...] At this place, the militia company from Woburn had positioned themselves on the southeast side of the bend in the road in a rocky, lightly-wooded field. Additional militia flowing parallel to the road from the engagement at Meriam's Corner positioned themselves on the northwest side of the road, catching the British in a crossfire, while other militia companies on the road closed from behind to attack. Some [...] further along, the road took another sharp curve, this time to the right, and again the British column was caught by another large force of militiamen firing from both sides. [...] In passing through these two sharp curves, the British force lost thirty soldiers killed or wounded, and four colonial militia were also killed, including Captain Jonathan Wilson of Bedford, Captain Nathan Wyman of Billerica, Lt. John Bacon of Natick, and Daniel Thompson of Woburn. The British soldiers escaped by breaking into <b>a</b> <b>trot,</b> a pace that the colonials could not maintain through the woods and swampy terrain.
