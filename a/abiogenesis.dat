5|$|Astronomers Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe {{have argued}} {{in favor of}} cosmic ancestry, and against <b>abiogenesis</b> and evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of lipids into protocell membranes represents a key step in models of <b>abiogenesis,</b> {{the origin of}} life.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as <b>abiogenesis,</b> the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about <b>abiogenesis</b> or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, <b>abiogenesis,</b> amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Abiogenesis</b> and {{the origin}} of life {{sometimes}} employ alife methodologies as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{time periods}} between such devastating {{environmental}} events give time windows for the possible {{origin of life}} in the early environments. If the deep marine hydrothermal setting was the site for the origin of life, then <b>abiogenesis</b> could have happened as early as 4.0 to 4.2Ga. If the site was at the surface of the Earth, <b>abiogenesis</b> could only have occurred between 3.7 and 4.0Ga.|$|E
25|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} field encompasses {{research on}} the origin and evolution of planetary systems, origins of organic compounds in space, rock-water-carbon interactions, <b>abiogenesis</b> on Earth, planetary habitability, research on biosignatures for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space.|$|E
25|$|Life {{functions}} {{through the}} specialized chemistry of carbon {{and water and}} is largely based upon four key families of chemicals: lipids (fatty cell walls), carbohydrates (sugars, cellulose), amino acids (protein metabolism), and nucleic acids (self-replicating DNA and RNA). Any successful theory of <b>abiogenesis</b> must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of life without reproduction {{is the subject}} of some speculation. The biological study of how the origin of life produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called <b>abiogenesis.</b> Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the last universal ancestor to all present life on Earth lived about 3.5 billion years ago.|$|E
25|$|The NASA {{strategy}} on <b>abiogenesis</b> {{states that it}} is necessary to identify interactions, intermediary structures and functions, energy sources, and environmental factors that contributed to the diversity, selection, and replication of evolvable macromolecular systems. Emphasis must continue to map the chemical landscape of potential primordial informational polymers. The advent of polymers that could replicate, store genetic information, and exhibit properties subject to selection likely was a critical step in the emergence of prebiotic chemical evolution.|$|E
25|$|The Seventh-day Adventist {{doctrine}} of creationism {{is based on}} believing that the opening chapters of Genesis should be interpreted as literal history. Adventist belief holds that all Earthly life originated during a six-day period some 6000 years ago, and a global flood destroyed all land based animals and humans except for those saved on Noah's Ark. Traditional Adventists oppose theories which propose interpreting the days of creation symbolically. Adventists reject the naturalistic views of <b>abiogenesis</b> and evolution.|$|E
25|$|Ross {{obtained}} his Ph.D. in astrophysics {{from the}} University of Toronto and his B.Sc. degree in physics from the University of British Columbia. He {{is known for}} establishing his own ministry in 1986, called Reasons to Believe that promotes progressive and day-age forms of old Earth creationism. Ross accepts the scientific age {{of the earth and}} the scientific age of the universe, however he rejects unguided evolution and <b>abiogenesis</b> as explanations for the history and origin of life.|$|E
25|$|The {{premises}} of Hovind's offer have been rejected both by scientists and fellow creationists as fundamentally flawed. Hovind's conditions {{would require a}} claimant to not only prove the theory of evolution, but also <b>abiogenesis,</b> astrophysics and cosmology, and additionally prove that no gods could possibly exist. The judges would be hand-picked without assurances {{that they would be}} unbiased or qualified to assess the merit of claims, and it is possible that no panel was convened when a claim was submitted. Some forms of evidence would be excluded prior to judging.|$|E
25|$|And {{thus the}} {{hypothesis}} that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, {{a right to be}} considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of Biogenesis; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that living matter may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of <b>Abiogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{studies of}} mantle-derived rocks from many places {{have shown that}} {{hydrocarbons}} from the mantle region can be found widely around the globe. However, the content of such hydrocarbons in such rocks are extremely low and seem to lack accumulation in concentrations that would render them feasible for exploitation. Scientific consensus {{on the origin of}} oil and gas is that all natural oil and gas deposits on Earth are fossil fuels and are, therefore, biogenic. Globally significant amounts of abiotic oil in the crust can even be ruled out. Yet, <b>abiogenesis</b> of small quantities of oil and gas remains an area of ongoing research in limited, mostly just laboratory, scale.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, The Mystery of Life's Origin {{was first}} published. It was co-authored by chemist and creationist Charles B. Thaxton with Walter L. Bradley and Roger L. Olsen, the {{foreword}} written by Dean H. Kenyon, and {{sponsored by the}} Christian-based Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE). The work presented scientific arguments against current theories of <b>abiogenesis</b> and offered an hypothesis of special creation instead. While the focus of creation science had until that time centered primarily on the criticism of the fossil evidence for evolution and validation of the creation myth of the Bible, this new work posed the question whether science reveals that even the simplest living systems were far too complex to have developed by natural, unguided processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} life, known as <b>abiogenesis,</b> {{distinct}} from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. Oparin and Haldane postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive {{to the formation of}} organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the panspermia hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, a hypercycle is an {{abstract}} model of organization of self-replicating molecules connected in a cyclic, autocatalytic manner. It {{was introduced in}} an ordinary differential equation (ODE) form by the Nobel Prize winner Manfred Eigen in 1971 and subsequently further extended in collaboration with Peter Schuster. It was proposed {{as a solution to}} the error threshold problem encountered during modelling of replicative molecules that hypothetically existed on the primordial Earth (see: <b>abiogenesis).</b> As such, it explained how life on Earth could have begun using only relatively short genetic sequences, which in theory were too short to store all essential information. The hypercycle is a special case of the replicator equation. The most important properties of hypercycles are autocatalytic growth competition between cycles, once-for-ever selective behaviour, utilization of small selective advantage, rapid evolvability, increased information capacity, and selection against parasitic branches.|$|E
25|$|Astrobiology is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{that uses a}} combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or <b>abiogenesis,</b> is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at {{the origin of life}} necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Mars is of {{particular}} interest {{for the study of the}} origins of life because of its similarity to the early Earth. This is especially so since Mars has a cold climate and lacks plate tectonics or continental drift, so it has remained almost unchanged since the end of the Hesperian period. At least two thirds of Mars's surface is more than 3.5 billion years old, and Mars may thus hold the best record of the prebiotic conditions leading to <b>abiogenesis,</b> even if life does not or has never existed there. In May 2017, evidence of the earliest known life on land on Earth may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. These findings may be helpful in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem in}} most {{scenarios}} of <b>abiogenesis</b> {{is that the}} thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is {{in the direction of}} separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of polyphosphates. Polyphosphates are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions PO4−3. Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate (apatite), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.|$|E
25|$|A word of {{explanation}} seems necessary {{with regard to}} the introduction of the new term Archebiosis. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word Biogenesis to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word Biogenesis has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist , who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word <b>Abiogenesis.</b> I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced {{the use of the word}} Biogenesis, and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.|$|E
25|$|Mircea Eliade's {{earliest}} works, most {{of which}} were published at later stages, belong to the fantasy genre. One of the first such literary exercises to be printed, the 1921 Cum am găsit piatra filosofală, showed its adolescent author's interest in themes that he was to explore throughout his career, in particular esotericism and alchemy. Written in the first person, it depicts an experiment which, for a moment, seems to be the discovery of the philosophers' stone. These early writings also include two sketches for novels: Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii ("The Wonderful Journey of the Five Beetles into the Land of the Red Ants") and Memoriile unui soldat de plumb ("The Memoirs of a Lead Soldier"). In the former, a company of beetle spies is sent among the red ants—their travel offers a setting for satirical commentary. Eliade himself explained that Memoriile unui soldat de plumb was an ambitious project, designed as a fresco to include the birth of the Universe, <b>abiogenesis,</b> human evolution, and the entire world history.|$|E
25|$|Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called soft panspermia, {{molecular}} panspermia or quasi-panspermia) {{proposes that}} the organic molecules used for life originated {{in space and}} were incorporated in the solar nebula, from which the planets condensed and were further —and continuously— distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged (<b>abiogenesis).</b> From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of organic molecules. The first suggestion came from Chandra Wickramasinghe, who proposed a polymeric composition based on the molecule formaldehyde (CH2O). Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with cosmic rays. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
25|$|Evolution {{does not}} attempt to explain {{the origin of life}} (covered instead by <b>abiogenesis),</b> but it does explain how the {{extremely}} simple early lifeforms evolved into the complex ecosystem that we see today. Based on the similarities between all present-day organisms, all life on Earth originated through common descent from a last universal ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution. All individuals have hereditary material in the form of genes that are received from their parents, then passed on to any offspring. Among offspring there are variations of genes due to the introduction of new genes via random changes called mutations or via reshuffling of existing genes during sexual reproduction. The offspring differs from the parent in minor random ways. If those differences are helpful, the offspring is more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that more offspring in the next generation will have that helpful difference and individuals will not have equal chances of reproductive success. In this way, traits that result in organisms being better adapted to their living conditions become more common in descendant populations. These differences accumulate resulting in changes within the population. This process is responsible for the many diverse life forms in the world.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been noted that {{arguments}} against some form of life arising [...] "by chance" [...] are really objections to nontheistic <b>abiogenesis,</b> not to evolution. Indeed, arguments against [...] "evolution" [...] {{are based on the}} misconception that <b>abiogenesis</b> is a component of, or necessary precursor to, evolution. Similar objections sometimes conflate the Big Bang with evolution.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead {{believed}} that when {{asking questions about}} the basic facts of existence, questions about value and purpose can never be fully escaped. [...] This is borne out in his thoughts on <b>abiogenesis,</b> or the hypothetical natural process by which life arises from simple organic compounds.|$|E
500|$|In 2014 NASA {{announced}} a [...] for tracking {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) in the universe. More than 20% of the carbon in the universe {{may be associated with}} PAHs, complex compounds of carbon and hydrogen without oxygen. These compounds figure in the PAH world hypothesis where they are hypothesized to have a role in <b>abiogenesis</b> and formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed [...] "a couple of billion years" [...] after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.|$|E
500|$|Another {{hypothesis}} for {{the colored}} regions {{is that they}} are composed of abiotic organic compounds collectively called tholins. The morphology of Europa's impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from the fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place. In order to generate colored tholins on Europa there must be a source of materials (carbon, nitrogen, and water) and a source of energy to make the reactions occur. Impurities in the water ice crust of Europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body, and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust. Tholins bring [...] important astrobiological implications, as they {{may play a role in}} prebiotic chemistry and <b>abiogenesis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Flew {{continued}} in many subsequent publications {{to maintain the}} falsifiability criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless. [...] Drawing specifically on the emerging science of molecular genetics (which had not existed {{at the time of}} his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion [...] "that there is no creator God" [...] might be falsified; [...] "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of <b>abiogenesis</b> to get the job done." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{is fundamentally}} an argument {{by lack of}} imagination, or argument from incredulity: a certain explanation is seen as being counterintuitive, and therefore an alternate, more intuitive explanation is appealed to instead. Supporters of evolution generally respond by arguing that evolution {{is not based on}} [...] "chance," [...] but on predictable chemical interactions: natural processes, rather than supernatural beings, are the [...] "designer." [...] Although the process involves some random elements, it is the non-random selection of survival-enhancing genes that drives evolution along an ordered trajectory. The fact that the results are ordered and seem [...] "designed" [...] is no more evidence for a supernatural intelligence than the appearance of complex natural phenomena (e.g. snowflakes). It is also argued that there is insufficient evidence to make statements about the plausibility or implausibility of <b>abiogenesis,</b> that certain structures demonstrate poor design, and that the implausibility of life evolving exactly as it did is no more evidence for an intelligence than the implausibility of a deck of cards being shuffled and dealt in a certain random order.|$|E
500|$|A common {{objection}} to evolution {{is that it}} is simply too unlikely for life, in its complexity and apparent [...] "design," [...] to have arisen [...] "by chance." [...] It is argued that the odds of life having arisen without a deliberate intelligence guiding it are so astronomically low that it is unreasonable not to infer an intelligent designer from the natural world, and specifically from the diversity of life. A more extreme version of this argument is that evolution cannot create complex structures (see the Creation of complex structures section below). The idea that it is simply too implausible for life to have evolved is often wrongly encapsulated with a quotation that the [...] "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a Boeing 747"—a claim attributed to astrophysicist Fred Hoyle and known as Hoyle's fallacy. Hoyle was a Darwinist, atheist and anti-theist, but advocated the theory of panspermia, in which <b>abiogenesis</b> begins in outer space and primitive life on Earth is held to have arrived via natural dispersion.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Abiogenesis</b> (British English: , [...] ), biopoiesis, or informally {{the origin}} of life, is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. On Earth, the {{transition}} from non-living to living entities {{was not a single}} event but a gradual process of increasing complexity. <b>Abiogenesis</b> is studied through a combination of paleontology, chemistry, and extrapolation from the characteristics of modern organisms, and aims to determine how pre-life chemical reactions gave rise to life on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} <b>abiogenesis</b> can be geophysical, chemical, or biological, with more recent {{approaches}} attempting {{a synthesis of}} all three, as life arose under conditions that are strikingly different from those on Earth today.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{approaches}} to <b>abiogenesis</b> investigate how self-replicating molecules, or their components, came into existence. It is generally thought that current life on Earth is descended from an RNA world, although RNA-based life {{may not have}} been the first life to have existed.|$|E
