5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity</b> called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5000|$|A concha bullosa is a pneumatized (<b>air-filled)</b> <b>cavity</b> {{within a}} turbinate in the nose. (Concha is another term for turbinate.) Bullosa {{refers to the}} <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity</b> within the turbinate. It is a normal {{anatomic}} variant seen in up to half the population. Occasionally, a large concha bullosa within a turbinate may cause it to bulge sufficiently to obstruct the opening of an adjacent sinus, possibly leading to recurrent sinusitis. [...] In such a case the turbinate can be reduced in size by endoscopic nasal surgery (turbinectomy). The presence of a concha bullosa {{is often associated with}} deviation of the nasal septum toward {{the opposite side of the}} nasal cavity. Although it is thought that sinusitis or sinus pathology has relation to concha bullosa, no strong statistical correlation has been demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|A book lung {{is a type}} of {{respiration}} organ {{used for}} atmospheric gas exchange that is found in many arachnids, such as scorpions and spiders. Each of these organs is found inside an open ventral abdominal, <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity</b> (atrium) and connects with the surroundings through a small opening for the purpose of respiration.|$|E
50|$|The sinuses {{similar to}} other <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities</b> are {{susceptible}} to barotrauma if their openings become obstructed. This can result in pain as well as epistaxis (nosebleed).|$|R
30|$|The {{thousands}} of small, <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities</b> give {{the two types}} their strength and thermal insulation properties. The base material was waste clay and was fired up to 1100  °C. Finally, the clay materials were mixed and molded to form lightweight concrete block products.|$|R
25|$|From about 1870 onwards {{scientists}} have {{generally agreed that}} the post-cranial skeletons of many dinosaurs contained many <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities</b> (postcranial skeletal pneumaticity, especially in the vertebrae. Pneumatization of the skull (such as paranasal sinuses) is found in both synapsids and archosaurs, but postcranial pneumatization is found only in birds, non-avian saurischian dinosaurs, and pterosaurs.|$|R
5000|$|Most glacier caves are {{started by}} water running through {{or under the}} glacier. This water often {{originates}} on the glacier’s surface through melting, entering the ice at a moulin and exiting at the glacier’s snout at base level. Heat transfer from the water can cause sufficient melting to create an <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity,</b> sometimes aided by solifluction. Air movement can then assist enlargement through melting in summer and sublimation in winter.|$|E
50|$|A pneumatocele {{results when}} a lung laceration, a cut or tear in the lung tissue, fills with air. A rupture {{of a small}} airway creates the <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity.</b> Pulmonary {{lacerations}} that fill with blood are called pulmonary hematomas. In some cases, both pneumatoceles and hematomas exist in the same injured lung. A pneumatocele can become enlarged, for example when the patient is mechanically ventilated or has acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which case it may not go away for months.|$|E
50|$|The hyomandibula of fish {{migrated}} upwards {{from its}} jaw supporting position, and was reduced {{in size to}} form the stapes. Situated between the tympanum and braincase in an <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity,</b> the stapes was now capable of transmitting vibrations from {{the exterior of the}} head to the interior. Thus the stapes became an important element in an impedance matching system, coupling airborne sound waves to the receptor system of the inner ear. This system had evolved independently within several different amphibian lineages.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} and theoretical predictions of steady-state heat transfers {{to or from}} horizontal single or double pipelines enclosed in horizontal circular or rectangular enclosures have been collated. The optimal configurations of the pipelines to achieve maximum thermal resistances of the <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities</b> are identified. A recommended correlation for predicting the combined convective/conductive resistances provided by the contained air in a horizontal concentric annuli is presented. ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the inner}} (2) and outer (4) {{sides of this}} insulation, semi-conducting layers are fused to the insulation. The {{function}} of these layers is to prevent <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities</b> between the metal conductors and the dielectric so that little electric discharges cannot arise and endanger the insulation material. The outer conductor or sheath (5) serves as an earthed layer and will conduct leakage currents if needed.|$|R
50|$|Aerenchyma is a spongy {{tissue that}} forms spaces or air {{channels}} in the leaves, stems and roots of some plants, which allows exchange of gases between the shoot and the root. The channels of <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities</b> (see image to right) provide a low-resistance internal pathway for {{the exchange of}} gases such as oxygen and ethylene between the plant above {{the water and the}} submerged tissues. Aerenchyma is also widespread in aquatic and wetland plants which must grow in hypoxic soils.|$|R
50|$|The {{impedance}} matching ear {{had to meet}} certain conditions to work. The stapes had to be perpendicular to the tympanum, small and light enough to reduce its inertia, and suspended in an <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity.</b> In modern species that are sensitive to over 1 kHz frequencies, the footplate of the stapes is 1/20th {{the area of the}} tympanum. However, in early amphibians the stapes was too large, making the footplate area oversized, preventing the hearing of high frequencies. So it appears they could only hear high intensity, low frequency sounds—and the stapes more probably just supported the brain case against the cheek.|$|E

50|$|Glanosuchus {{represents}} {{an early stage}} {{in the development of}} the mammalian middle ear. Modern mammals have three bones in the middle ear (the malleus, incus, and stapes) that transfer sound energy from the eardrum to the fluid of the inner ear. The malleus and incus of mammals developed from the articular and quadrate of early therapsids. Studies of the bones of Glanosuchus show that it had a very thin plate of bone that acted as an eardrum, receiving sounds and transferring them to a small <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity.</b> The stapes and vestibular foramen (the hole that connects the middle and inner ears) are preserved in one specimen of Glanosuchus that was examined by grinding away cross sections of the skull. The anular ligament, a ring-like structure that forms a seal between the end of the stapes and the rim of the vestibular foramen, was probably held in place by cartilage. The transfer of sound between the thin bony plate and the vestibular foramen in Glanosuchus was not as effective as it is in mammals, meaning that the animal had a less acute sense of hearing.|$|E
50|$|The large <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities</b> {{provide a}} low-resistance {{internal}} pathway for {{the exchange of}} gases between the plant organs above {{the water and the}} submerged tissues. This allows plants to grow without incurring the metabolic costs of anaerobic respiration. Some of the oxygen transported through the aerenchyma leaks through root pores into the surrounding soil. The resulting small rhizosphere of oxygenated soil around individual roots support microorganisms that prevent the influx of potentially toxic soil components such as sulfide, iron, and manganese.|$|R

An accurately segmented skull from computed tomography (CT) images, including spongy and compact bones {{as well as some}} <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities,</b> was used as a reference model. The simplified models approximated the skull as a homogeneous compartment with: (1) isotropic, and (2) anisotropic conductivity.

40|$|International audienceNatural {{convection}} in a cavities without radiation {{has been}} the subject of many investigations with many practical applications and it became a benchmark problem for testing CFD codes. Although surface radiation is far from negligible in natural convection in <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities,</b> studies including the interaction between the two phenomena remain still sparse. The main purpose of this work is the development of accurate numerical methods for the study of the coupling of natural convection with surface radiation in <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavities,</b> in view also of providing a benchmark problem and reference solutions. Since the standard radiosity method using view factors can yield only second-order spatial accuracy, a new formulation using pointwise radiosity and integration by parts is proposed. The numerical implementation of the new formulation is based on appropriate quadratures for numerical integration and differentiation and is tested in a spectral Chebyshev collocation method and a fourth-order finite-difference method. Results obtained at RaH = 10 ^ 4 and 10 ^ 5 show respectively spectral and fourth-order convergence for the convective and radiative Nusselt numbers. The spectral implementation also confirms that a much coarser mesh can be employed for surface radiation compared to the one used for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, without decreasing the accuracy of the numerical results. This is an important observation for future 3 D simulations in which the large number of surface elements becomes a major stumbling block...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the thermal regulation of electronic circuits confined in a closed cubical <b>air-filled</b> <b>cavity.</b> The hot active wall, which represents the electronic equipment, is composed of three parallel discrete heat source bands subjected to a constant heat flux, separated by two adiabatic bands. The second active wall is an isothermal cold plate and is facing the hot wall. The cavity channel is considered adiabatic. Transient heat exchanges through 2 D natural convection are analysed for several configurations obtained through varying the inclination angle of the active wall with respect to gravity. The numerical approach conducted with the finite volumes method allowed the derivation of the thermal and dynamic characteristics of the cavity. The thermal evolution of the sources does not show any local temperature peaks that could exceed the maximum allowable temperature set by the electronic components manufacturers. This guarantees the normal operation of the equipment. The numerical analysis is complemented by experimental measurements that validate the used model and allow the correct sizing of the airborne electronic circuits.

Solutions were obtained for a range of Rayleigh numbers of the air flow, and an optimal location of the inner pipe (corresponding to its minimum rate of heat loss) was predicted. Good agreement with previously-obtained experimental observations was achieved. ...|$|E
