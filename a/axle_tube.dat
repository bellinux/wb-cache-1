2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the driving axle. The trailing carrying axle passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight carrying axle rather than a cranked driving axle, the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6". This is the condition in which she was exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|E

50|$|At high mileages, this {{is prone}} to wear of the axle {{mounting}} bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly. The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
5000|$|Bolt-on Portals (or drop boxes) are {{a housing}} {{with a set}} of gears which bolts onto the final flange of the <b>axle</b> <b>tube.</b> This {{approach}} allows existing vehicles to be converted to portals without modifying the axles (Volvo C303 or Unimog 404).|$|E
50|$|Portal axles (or portal gear) are an offroad {{technology}} {{where the}} <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> {{is above the}} center of the wheel hub and where there is a reduction gearbox in the hub. This gives two advantages: ground clearance is increased, particularly beneath the low-slung differential housing of the main axles; and secondly the hub gearing allows the axle halfshafts to drive the same power but at reduced torque (by using higher shaft speed). This reduces load on the axle crownwheel and differential.|$|E
50|$|In mid-1985, a two-wheel-drive {{version of}} the Cherokee {{was added to the}} lineup. This marked the first time any Jeep product was offered with two-wheel drive since 1967, and was done in the hopes of {{attracting}} a few more buyers who did not need (or want to pay for) four-wheel drive. When the XJ Cherokee-based Comanche (MJ) truck was introduced, it was also available in two- and four-wheel drive. The new two-wheel-drive models shared the front suspension (from the track bar, control arms, ball joints) with four-wheel-drive models. Jeep simply used a single <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> from hub to hub with no differential between, resulting in an inexpensive front suspension.|$|E

5000|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 60 is an {{automotive}} axle {{manufactured by}} Dana Holding Corporation {{and used in}} OEM pickup and limited passenger car applications by Chevrolet, Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, Ford and Land Rover. Various construction companies use this axle. There are front and rear versions of the Dana 60. It can be readily identified by its straight <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> 10 bolt asymmetrical cover, and a [...] "60" [...] cast in to the housing. Gross axle weight ratings are often lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons. They are also lowered to reduce loads on other powertrain components such as transmissions and transfer cases.Dana 60 Axles are also increasingly swapped into many custom offroad applications to accommodate larger tires and deep compound gearing with locking differentials.|$|R
5000|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 70 is an {{automotive}} axle {{manufactured by}} Dana Holding Corporation {{and has been}} used in OEM heavy duty applications by Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford. It can be identified by its straight <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> 10 bolt asymmetrical cover, and a [...] "70" [...] cast in to the housing and is visually similar to the Dana 60. The majority of the Dana 70s are rear axles, however Dana 70 front axles do exist. Both front and rear axle variations were first offered in 1957. The Dana 70 is generally regarded to have more strength than a Dana 60 {{but not as much as}} a Dana 80. Gross axle weight ratings are often lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal single axis {{trackers}} {{are typically}} used for large distributed generation projects and utility scale projects. The combination of energy improvement and lower product cost and lower installation complexity results in compelling economics in large deployments. In addition the strong afternoon performance is particularly desirable for large grid-tied photovoltaic systems so that production will match the peak demand time. Horizontal single axis trackers also add {{a substantial amount}} of productivity during the spring and summer seasons when the Sun is high in the sky. The inherent robustness of their supporting structure and the simplicity of the mechanism also result in high reliability which keeps maintenance costs low. Since the panels are horizontal, they can be compactly placed on the <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> without danger of self-shading and are also readily accessible for cleaning.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1960s, Jeep used {{a unique}} Dana 44 IFS setup, that was short lived. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ford used {{a form of}} IFS known as [...] "Twin Traction Beam" [...] (TTB). This Dana 44 had no <b>axle</b> <b>tubes</b> but {{attached}} to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had [...] "open air" [...] axles which traveled through the beams to the spindles. The axles had u-joints {{to allow for the}} independent action of the beams. Individual pivot points for the beams at greater than center made each beam longer than half the overall width crossing in the middle. This allowed for an independent front suspension design. Ford TTB Dana 44 axles all utilized locking hubs. The TTB set-up is based on Ford's highly successful Twin I-beam design on two-wheel-drive pick-up truck models.|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s the Dana 70HD was offered. The <b>axle</b> <b>tubes</b> were {{increased}} to 4 inches diameter and carrier bearings were larger and thicker, the axle shafts were 35 spline only. These upgrades gave the Dana 70HD a gross axle rating of 10,000 lbs. The Dana 70 front drive axles {{used in the}} Chevrolet Kodiaks and GMC Topkicks also had these features. This axle was standard for the Big Three (automobile manufacturers) dual rear wheel trucks until 1985, when Ford started using the Sterling 10.25 rear axle. However Ford still kept the Dana 70HD an option until the Dana 80 was made available. The axle was available or optional for the Big Three until 1994 when Dodge used the Dana 80 for its dual rear wheel trucks instead. The Dana 70HD is still seen in commercial applications today. In the UK the 70HD Dana axles were license built by Salisbury Engineering in an early 10/23 spline version with a 4.3 metric tonne (9500lbs) rating for the Ford A-series truck with a European 6x205mm DIN standard hub bolt pattern.|$|R
50|$|The {{familiar}} {{range of}} PSA powertrains drove {{the front wheels}} of a conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard MacPherson strut layout with anti-roll bar, while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-Citroën independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up that was first introduced on the Peugeot 305 estate. However, PSA's chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear wheel steering, though less than on the ZX, (by means of specially designed compliance bushes in the rear suspension), and in-house developed and constructed shock absorbers. At high mileages this is prone to wear of the axle mounting bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly.

5000|$|The 11.5 AAM rear {{differential}} {{replaced the}} [...] "14 bolt" [...] {{in many of}} the General Motors [...] "heavy duty" [...] light trucks in 2001 models, however the [...] "14 bolt" [...] is still in production. Besides trucks, it is used in commercial van applications. AAM continues to manufacture this axle for GM, as well as Dodge Ram trucks. Dodge discontinued running Dana Holding Corporation axles after model year 2002 trucks. This is the main axle used in 3rd Generation Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks. The GM version uses a paper gasket and the Ram version uses a re-usable rubber gasket. This attribute also makes the Dodge and GM axles appear very different, because of the different cover used. The GM AAM <b>axle</b> <b>tubes</b> are a smaller diameter then the AAM dodge's. GM also opted to have a vibration dampener installed on the yoke, while dodge opted to place the dampener on the drive shaft.

Dana 80's are made as full floating, rear axles only and are step up in overall strength compared to the Dana 70. 1988 Ford was the first company to use the Dana 80. The Dana 80 has a GAWR up to 11000 lb, however it is common practice among manufacturers to derate Dana 80's. Gross axle weight ratings are lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons. The OEM Limited slip differential originally was a [...] "Power Lok" [...] until 1998 when the [...] "Trac Lok" [...] phased it out. Trac Loks are currently a $350.00 USD option with Ford Super Duty trucks. [...] The Dana 80 Trac Lok is unique being it is a 4 pinion unit, unlike other Dana Trac Lok units with 2 pinions. This was the only rear axle available for the 2nd generation Dodge Ram 3500 trucks.|$|R
