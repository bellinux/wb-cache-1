5|$|In early September Nichols {{appointed}} a production control committee, headed by Major A.V. (Pete) Peterson. Peterson's staff tried various combinations, using mechanical calculating machines, {{and decided that}} the S-50 production should be fed to K-25 rather than Y-12, which was done in April 1945. The charts also showed that the proposed top stages for K-25 should be abandoned, as should Lawrence's recommendation to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> alpha stages to the Y-12 plant. Groves accepted their proposal to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> base units to the K-27 gaseous-diffusion plant and one more Beta stage track for Y-12. These additions were estimated to cost $100 million, with completion in February 1946. Soon after Japan surrendered in August 1945, Peterson recommended that S-50 be shut down. The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September. The last uranium hexafluoride was sent to K-25, and the plant had ceased operation by 9 September. S-50 was completely demolished in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The great {{advantage}} Campbell's filters {{had over the}} RL circuit and other simple filters of the time was {{that they could be}} designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or steepness of transition between pass band and stop band. It was only necessary to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> filter sections until the desired response was obtained.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese {{government}} plan to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> slots at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport by 2020, Japan Airlines {{intends to}} order more widebodies for growth in 2018 or 2019: it could exercise its 25 options on Airbus A350s {{on top of}} its 31 firm orders, due for delivery from 2019, and study others like the proposed Boeing New Midsize Airplane or the 787-10 to add to its 787-9 with 10 remaining to be delivered.|$|E
50|$|The {{game has}} been updated three times since its release. The first update <b>added</b> <b>more</b> {{achievements}} and costumes, {{while the second}} and third <b>added</b> <b>more</b> areas and villains (Harley Quinn in Update 2 and Poison Ivy in Update 3). Each of these updates also <b>added</b> <b>more</b> skins and achievements, and raised the level cap.|$|R

5|$|During the {{planning}} of NG Life, Mizuho Kusanagi discussed with her editor about having a female lead protagonist allowing the readers to relate more to the protagonist. However, a male lead was settled for and the story was written in a romantic-panic comedy style. Kusanagi planned to end the series in its fourth volume, but wanted to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> to the story as it progressed resulting in more volumes. She also commented that even though she struggled with the plot, she enjoyed drawing {{the characters in the}} end. In the final chapter, the author revealed she had planned to pair Keidai with Mii since the beginning.|$|E
5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> options for {{travelers}} in Roanoke, the airport added non-stop service to Orlando in May 2006 and Tampa in December 2006 with Allegiant Air. This is largely seen {{as the product of}} an effort by local leaders to bring new and improved service to the airport through both existing and new carriers. Earlier attempts to lobby AirTran Airways and the now defunct Independence Air to serve the airport were unsuccessful.|$|E

30|$|We will {{restrict}} {{our analysis}} to this case, since lower values of α {{can be easily}} allowed by <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> doors, and higher values {{can be obtained by}} <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> doors and then opening more than one with goats. This general case follows in almost the same way.|$|R

5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> details {{to the character}} designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Some Scout Groups offer special Scouting {{programmes}} called Air Scouts and Sea Scouts. Both programmes {{follow the}} same core programme in all sections but can <b>add</b> <b>more</b> aeronautical or nautical emphasis depending on the programme, with some Groups choosing to be recognised by the Royal Air Force or Royal Navy. In the United Kingdom there are approximately 400 Sea Scout Groups, of which about 25% (101 Groups) are Royal Navy recognised, whilst of 117 Air Scout Groups, 43 are recognised by the RAF.|$|E
5|$|Summer Hill has {{a mix of}} Federation-era houses, with medium density {{apartment}} blocks near the railway station. Local independent business people run most of the shops. The local council has defined a village character for the suburb. Summer Hill is a suburb rich in heritage. More than one hundred properties are heritage listed, and the strong feelings of some residents of the suburb towards protecting the local architecture has seen {{the introduction of a}} heritage review, which is expected to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> properties to the heritage register.|$|E

The same faulty estimations emerge when people are asked to {{estimate}} savings in patients’ waiting time when <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> physicians to a health care center (Svenson, 2008, Experiment 2) or when estimating an increase in the productivity of a manufacturing line by <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> workers (Svenson, 2011).|$|R
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is an action-adventure game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Wii and GameCube home video game consoles. It is the thirteenth installment in The Legend of Zelda series. Originally planned for release on the GameCube in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, <b>add</b> <b>more</b> content, and port it to the Wii. The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was also released worldwide in December 2006, and was the final first-party game released for the console.|$|E
5|$|The Shanghai outlet houses nearly 75 wax {{figures of}} local and internationally known celebrities to date, and will <b>add</b> <b>more</b> in its second and third phases. The museum opens all year round from 10 am to 10 pm daily and it is divided up into seven themed sections: Glamour, Behind the Scenes, History and Heroes, Music, Film, Speed and Sport. Admission fee is RMB 135 (US$20) for adults and RMB 100 for students. Madame Tussauds Shanghai is the Tussauds Group's sixth waxwork museum after London, Amsterdam, Las Vegas, New York City and Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not <b>add</b> <b>more</b> than 5GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5GB of additional free space without having to wait for the TRIM command to come from the OS.|$|E

5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that the Soviets had no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} <b>add</b> <b>more</b> for some time.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had tried}} to remain {{anonymous}} at first, but he was soon identified, {{and within a few}} days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with the primary Task Force behavioral analyst, Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, whom he met many times in Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.|$|E

The game also <b>adds</b> <b>more</b> Force powers, such as [...] "Mind Trick" [...] and [...] "Force Rage".|$|R
5|$|Florida International University has {{seventeen}} varsity sports teams, {{named the}} Panthers. The Panthers' athletic colors are blue and gold, and {{compete in the}} NCAA Division I as part of Conference USA in all sports. Three main sports facilities serve as home venues for Panther athletics. The Panthers football team plays at FIU Stadium ("The Cage"), the men and women's basketball and volleyball teams play at the FIU Arena, and the men's baseball team plays at FIU Baseball Stadium. Other athletics venues include the Aquatic Center, Tennis Complex, softball fields, and various other recreational fields. FIU Arena underwent expansion to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> seating and a modernization of the exterior that was completed in late 2011. On July 1, 2013, FIU {{became a member of}} Conference USA.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{construction}} of the building began, with a design by Der Scutt, of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, and development by Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company (renamed the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company in 2004). Although it is in one of Midtown Manhattan's special zoning districts, the tower was approved because {{it was to be}} built as a mixed-use development. Trump was permitted to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> stories to the tower because of the atrium on the ground floor. There were controversies during construction, including the destruction of historically important sculptures from the Bonwit Teller store; Trump's alleged underpaying of contractors; and a lawsuit that Trump filed because the tower was not tax-exempt.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall, an {{employee}} at Bohemia working on ARMA 3, released a massively popular mod for Arma II named DayZ, which includes zombies as the game's main enemies. Its popularity led to a resurgence in ARMA 2s sales, with registered players count being raised from 500,000 to one million. Impressed {{with the success of}} DayZ, Bohemia appointed Hall to fully capitalize on it by leading the development of a standalone DayZ video game, which ensured {{that he would not be}} limited by the restraints of Arma 2. While the main goal is to transit the mod into an entirely new game, the team also intended to <b>add</b> <b>more</b> content such as base-building and improved crafting. Hall eventually left Bohemia in 2014, and the game remained in early access more than four years after its release in December 2013.|$|E
