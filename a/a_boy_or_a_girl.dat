25|$|Perin Thomas: A {{student at}} AEHS. At first, Mia can't {{figure out whether}} Perin is <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> She {{turns out to be}} a girl and becomes friends with Mia. She is again mistaken for a boy in Grandmère's musical, in which she is given a male role. Perin is a very nice person, as she asked if Mia was alright after Michael announces he is moving to Japan, and, though shocked by Mia's new haircut in book eight, says nothing about it. She is also {{surprisingly}} strong and well-mannered. In book ten, it is continually implied that Perin and Ling Su are romantically involved with each other, though this is not confirmed but in the eleventh book Perin and Ling Su become a couple and together run The Frank Gianini Community center.|$|E

2500|$|DearSD, or Dear Super Dollfie, is {{the latest}} {{available}} Super Dollfie model. It was first released in 2015, in commemoration of the 16th anniversary of Super Dollfie. [...] The DearSD is very similar in height to the MSD, standing at 43cm tall. However, the proportions of a DearSD are more childlike since the DearSD is meant to depict a toddler. The DearSD body is asexual, allowing owners of this doll to customize it into <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> [...] The DearSD is currently a limited model, made available for sale in small batches to collectors in Japan. It will be sold again in limited runs, but a date for the next sale {{has yet to be}} announced.|$|E

The next morning, he took the film from his Leica camera to the offices of China Press, where he showed enlargements to Malcolm Rosholt, saying, [...] "Look at this one!" [...] Wong later wrote that the next morning's newspapers reported that some 1,800 people, mostly women and children, had been waiting at the railway station, and that the IJN aviators had likely mistaken them for a troop movement. The Shanghai papers said that fewer than 300 people survived the attack. In October, Life magazine reported about 200 dead.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{of whether to}} raise an individual with PAIS as <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> may not be obvious; grades 3 and 4 in particular present with a phenotype that {{may be difficult to}} classify as primarily male or female, and some will be incapable of virilization at puberty. [...] Parents of an affected newborn should seek immediate help at a center with an experienced multidisciplinary team, and should avoid gender assignment beforehand. [...] Gender assignment should thereafter be expeditiously decided; current guidelines advise against waiting for the child to decide for his / herself. [...] Key considerations involved in assigning gender include the appearance of the genitalia, {{the extent to which the}} child can virilize at puberty, surgical options and the postoperative sexual function of the genitalia, genitoplasty complexity, potential for fertility, and the projected gender identity of the child. [...] The majority of individuals with PAIS are raised male.|$|E
2500|$|Scharnhorst {{writes that}} Alger [...] "exercised a certain {{discretion}} in discussing his probable homosexuality" [...] and {{was known to}} have mentioned his sexuality only once after the Brewster incident. In 1870 the elder Henry James wrote that Alger [...] "talks freely about his own late insanity—which he in fact appears to enjoy as a subject of conversation". Although Alger was willing to speak to James, his sexuality was a closely guarded secret. According to Scharnhorst, Alger made veiled references to homosexuality in his boys' books, and these references, Scharnhorst speculates, indicate Alger was [...] "insecure with his sexual orientation". Alger wrote, for example, {{that it was difficult}} to distinguish whether Tattered Tom was <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> and in other instances he introduces foppish, effeminate, lisping [...] "stereotypical homosexuals" [...] who are treated with scorn and pity by others. In Silas Snobden's Office Boy, a kidnapped boy disguised as a girl is threatened with being sent to the [...] "insane asylum" [...] if he should reveal his actual sex. Scharnhorst believes Alger's desire to atone for his [...] "secret sin" [...] may have [...] "spurred him to identify his own charitable acts of writing didactic books for boys with the acts of the charitable patrons in his books who wish to atone for a secret sin in their past by aiding the hero". Scharnhorst points out that the patron in Try and Trust, for example, conceals a [...] "sad secret" [...] from which he is redeemed only after saving the hero's life.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disparity}} in the gender ratio at birth increases dramatically {{after the first}} birth, for which the ratios remained steadily within the natural baseline over the 20 year interval between 1980 and 1999. Thus, {{a large majority of}} couples appear to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy, whether it is <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> If the first child is a girl, and they are able to have a second child, then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy. If a couple already has two or more boys, the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction. This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring, a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play. [...] reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys. [...] A study by [...] found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province: a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys. [...] This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister, who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males, it was also much {{more likely to engage in}} [...] "stopping behavior", i.e., to stop having more children.|$|E
