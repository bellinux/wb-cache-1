5|$|During the Interregnum, Portland Castle {{continued}} to be garrisoned and used a prison, with a unit of 103 men attached to it in 1651. It was used to defend the Portland Roads during the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1653, seeing <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> three-day long naval battle between English and Dutch forces. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660, he reduced the garrison to its pre-war levels but repaired the fortifications {{in the light of}} the continuing Dutch threat; in 1676 the castle was equipped with 16 guns.|$|E

5|$|Open world, 3D action-adventure games {{existed for}} {{years prior to}} the release of any similar game from the Scottish {{developer}} DMA Design. Mercenary (1985) {{has been described as a}} major ancestor to the Grand Theft Auto series, because it featured an open world which the player could explore freely. The Terminator, released in 1990, was a free-form, open world game that set its <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> modern-day city that extended for miles, and included the ability to fire at civilians and steal cars. This game was also among the first American-developed games to feature these elements.|$|E
5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> court of equity for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the court of equity may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously {{been able to do}} so.|$|E

5|$|The Second Avenue Subway was {{supposed}} to be the flagship project of the Program for <b>Action.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 1964 report, it was given top priority on a list of projects to be completed. Prior attempts to build the line had failed, and the city wished to have a Second Avenue subway line to alleviate overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. Twenty-two blocks of tunnel were ultimately constructed, excluding seven blocks in the East Village that were prepared for tunneling operations, but never excavated.|$|E
5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting married}} in the offseason, Gromek entered the 1946 Cleveland Indians season {{as one of the}} four primary {{starting}} pitchers alongside Allie Reynolds, as well as Bob Feller and Red Embree who had returned from the war. Gromek started the season by pitching in the home opener against Detroit. In a 7–0 loss, the Tigers allowed two hits, one of which was a single by Gromek, who allowed five runs in six innings. After losing his first three games of the season, he won his next three in May, which included two complete game shutouts against the Athletics and Browns. He followed that up with a four-game losing streak, which went through the end of June. After his June 28th win, however, Gromek fell in a slump, and Indians management reduced his role to that of a part-time starter who would only see <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few innings at a time. Gromek lost seven straight games between June 28 and September 10 before breaking the streak in his second-to-last appearance of the season, a 4–2 victory against the Yankees. Gromek finished the season with a 5–15 record and a 4.33 ERA in 29 games.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland {{with the emergence}} of the Solidarity mass movement. By the end of October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military <b>action.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Raid on Griessie was a British {{attack on}} the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed Gresik) on Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars. The raid was the final <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of engagements fought by the British {{squadron}} based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed {{the destruction of the}} Dutch squadron with the scuttling of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron—under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew—sought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia raid however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had ordered his ships of the line to sail eastwards, where they took shelter at Griessie, near Sourabaya.|$|E

5|$|The {{cessation}} of diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar prompted immediate French military <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> campaign that {{became known as}} the Second Franco-Hova War. The expedition ended eleven months later in September 1895 when a French military column reached Antananarivo and bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, blasting a hole through the roof of the queen's quarters and inflicting heavy casualties among the numerous courtiers gathered in the palace courtyard. Rainilaiarivony sent an interpreter to carry a white flag to the French commander and entreat his clemency. Forty-five minutes later he was joined by Radilifera, the Prime Minister's son, to request the conditions of surrender; these were immediately accepted. The following day Queen Ranavalona signed a treaty accepting the French protectorate over Madagascar. She and her court were permitted to remain at the palace and administer the country according to French dictates.|$|E
5|$|The patrolling British {{warships}} first sighted Junon in the Virgin Islands on 8 February. They then chased her {{north into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{for two days}} until the frigates HMS Horatio and HMS Latona were able to bring her to <b>action.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> bitterly contested running engagement, Junon was badly damaged and suffered heavy casualties before surrendering to the numerically superior British force. She was later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name and remained in the Caribbean. Less {{than a year after}} her capture, a French convoy to Guadeloupe recaptured and destroyed Junon; the British subsequently intercepted and defeated the convoy in turn.|$|E
5|$|From 1870 until 1901, {{each of the}} six colonial governments was {{responsible}} for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s—including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units—they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China.|$|E

5|$|He was fit for {{the start}} of 2005–06 and set up two of Chesterfield's goals in the 3–1 opening day victory over Blackpool. He went on to score his first goals for Chesterfield with a brace after coming on as a half-time {{substitute}} against Yeovil Town; he scored from a pass from Paul Hall after Yeovil goalkeeper Chris Weale was left stranded after being lobbed, and then scored his second after gaining the ball from Mark Allott, which helped his team to a 3–1 victory. An 89th-minute goal from Smith against Bradford City on 7 January 2006 saw his team earn a 1–0 victory. He agreed to a new two-year contract at Chesterfield in March and finished 2005–06 with 29 appearances and scoring three goals. His recurring knee injury was confirmed to be severe patella tendinitis, which resulted in him being un{{fit for the}} start of 2006–07. He made his return to <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> friendly against Staveley Miners Welfare in August and made his first league appearance of the season in a 4–0 defeat to Nottingham Forest on 2 September 2006 after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute. He scored the winner for Chesterfield in the Football League Trophy against Oldham Athletic with a diagonal shot from distance. Smith suffered from a knee injury in March 2007, which resulted in him undergoing surgery that ruled him out {{for the remainder of the}} 2006–07 season; in which he made 17 appearances and scored one goal, while Chesterfield were relegated to League Two. His severe tendinitis affected him in September, and eventually made his return in a 2–1 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup first round on 10 November. He was sent out on loan at League Two club Lincoln City for a month on 4 January 2008 and made his debut for the team a day later, helping set up the first goal in a 2–0 victory over Rochdale, after Jamie Forrester scored from goalkeeper Sam Russell's parry of a Smith effort. He made four appearances during his stay at Lincoln, all as a substitute, which was concluded after Lincoln decided against extending his loan at the club.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> court of law.|$|E
