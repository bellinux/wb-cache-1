50|$|Cuban {{women writers}} {{have been able}} to change Cuban {{national}} discourse by reexamining themes that many people thought the Cuban Revolution of 1959 had put to rest. Their writing is diverse, and no one perspective, technique, or medium can be said to be characteristic of women’s literature in Cuba. Poetry {{is by far the most}} widely used genre for Cuban women writers, followed by the short story, although they work within genres such as testimonial literature, <b>autobiography,</b> <b>essay,</b> and the novel as well. Their subject matter and treatment of such are exceptionally varied. They do, however, hold in common several themes especially prevalent in their works.|$|E

The result of this is hybrid texts that com-bine <b>autobiography,</b> <b>essay,</b> case study, fiction, comedy and poetry. In their theoretical work, Anzieu and Bollas have examined creativity and processes of thinking, predomi-nantly from the perspective of object-relations psychoanalysis, although both are known as eclectic thinkers, who do not belong to just one school of psychoanalysis.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{influential}} and insightful thinkers of her generation, Audre Lorde (1934 – 1992) inspired readers and activists through her poetry, <b>autobiography,</b> <b>essays,</b> and her political action. Most scholars have situated her work {{within the context of}} the women’s, gay and lesbian, and black civil rights movements within the United States. However, Lorde forged coalitions with women in Europe, the Caribbean, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa, and twenty years after her passing, these alliances remain largely undocumented and unexplored. Audre Lorde’s Transnational Legacies is the first book to systematically document and thoroughly investigate Lorde’s influence beyond the United States. Arranged in three thematically interrelated sections—Archives, Connections, and Work—the volume brings together scholarly essays, interviews, Lorde’s unpublished speech about Europe, and personal reflections and testimonials from key figures throughout the world. Using a range of interdisciplinary approaches, contributors assess the reception, translation, and circulation of Lorde’s writing and activism within different communities, audiences, and circles. They also shed new light on the work Lorde inspired across disciplinary borders. In addition to the volume editors, contributors include Sarah Cefai, Cassandra Ellerbe-Dueck, Paul M. Farber, Tiffany N. Florvil, Katharina Gerund, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Gloria Joseph, Jackie Kay, Marion Kraft, Christiana Lambrinidis, Zeedah Meierhofer-Mangeli, Rina Nissim, Chantal Oakes, Lester C.

40|$|This essay investigates how Norman Mailer’s “true-life” novel The Executioner’s Song {{may also}} be read as an autobiography. The novel {{contains}} strong traces of Mailer’s existential philosophy as related to sexuality, non-conformity and death. The essay discusses {{the nature of the}} relationship between truth as defined by the author and the function of autobiography to tell the truth about a life. The discussion centres around Mailer’s conviction that the novel is a better, i. e. more accurate vehicle for truth than is the <b>autobiography.</b> The <b>essay</b> argues that the truth which Mailer imparts is less the “true” story of Gary Gilmore and more the “true” story of Norman Mailer...|$|R

40|$|Alan Marshall's {{work has}} either been {{neglected}} or {{has been discussed}} {{in the context of}} its contribution to the Australian identity or as an example of Australian <b>autobiography.</b> This <b>essay</b> examines his early novel and his three directly autobiographical works to argue that he uses his studies of popular Australian values to develop a basis for an inclusive Australian democracy. The argument of the essay is that the socialist realist doctrines of the Realist Writers Group and his bush background influence his choice of voice and form, but that the politics of his work has been overlooked. This, as well as his reputation as a popular author, accounts for the unjust critical neglect of his work...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} an attempt at a methodological {{rehabilitation}} of semiotically conceived biography of the writer which is very often received by the readers parallelly to the fundamental writings - more or less legible "text".

Literature as a form of social therapy - at this point both Canetti's "texts": the poetic and existential one converge...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{concerned}} with the resonances of idleness and repose in Coetzee’s Life & Times of Michael K. It brings two contexts to bear on the novel.

The second is Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s ‘Eolian Harp’, a poem alluded to by Coetzee in the ‘Idleness’ essay as well as in Youth, his second semi-fictional <b>autobiography.</b> The <b>essay</b> argues that acts of ventriloquism and what Coetzee calls ‘the scandal of idleness’ are central to Michael K’s politics, and that a correct consideration of these issues exposes a dark side to the novel that has not been observed by its criticism to date...|$|R
