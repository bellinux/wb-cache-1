The performances were well received by passengers, with fans even forming groups to catch <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musicians at various stations.|$|E
5|$|Toniná had a {{particularly}} active Early Classic presence, although the Early Classic remains lie entirely buried under later construction. Due to this, early texts are scarce and only offer <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{early history of}} the site. An 8th-century text refers to a king ruling in AD 217, although it only mentions his title, not his name.|$|E

5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted {{by the sound of}} a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home to catch <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E
5|$|By war's end, Black Hawk and {{nineteen}} {{other leaders}} of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks. Most of the prisoners were released in the succeeding months, but in April 1833, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, Neapope, and three others were transferred to Fort Monroe in Virginia, which was better equipped to hold prisoners. The American public was eager to catch <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captured Indians. Large crowds gathered in Louisville and Cincinnati to watch them pass. On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in Washington, D.C., before being taken to Fort Monroe. Even in prison they were treated as celebrities: they posed for portraits by artists such as Charles Bird King and John Wesley Jarvis, and a dinner was held in their honor before they left.|$|E

5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train is not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is {{not the end of the}} novel.|$|E
5|$|The film is {{considered}} to be a breakthrough film for both Rama Rao and Ranga Rao. Rama Rao later starred in other folklore films like Chandirani (1953), Rechukka (1954) and Jayasimha (1955); all of which were commercially successful. When the film's unit was travelling by train to attend the 100thday celebrations of Pathala Bhairavi at Bellary, the then Union Home Minister C. Rajagopalachari was travelling in Madras Mail. When both the trains happened to halt at Guntakal, people who had come to greet Rajagopalachari rushed to the other platform to have <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's unit, which left Rajagopalachari amazed by the popularity that the film had attained.|$|E

5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E
5|$|Before their {{collaboration}} on the Diary, {{the brothers}} each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated {{nine of the}} principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote {{a large number of}} songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the Diary were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past that it became fashionable to imitate.|$|E
5|$|Father John {{returns to}} the red-light {{district}} and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) might know about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the archbishop concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.|$|E

50|$|Early in 1999 the 6 ft 3 in defender was {{recruited}} by Gordon Strachan, manager of English Premiership side Coventry City {{for a fee}} of around £2 million.

40|$|Apart {{from work}} in the mining {{industry}} during the 1950 s, the first real Operations Research (OR) group in South Africa was established at CSIR in the early 1960 s.

The OR group at CSIR did, however, continue and today the group still exists. This paper presents a brief history of this group and endeavours to provide <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> projects conducted over the many years since its establishment...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and to get <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E

25|$|Les Joueurs de {{football}} is testament to <b>the</b> close association <b>of</b> two artists, Metzinger and Gleizes, {{and to their}} shared social, cultural and philosophical conviction that painting represented more than <b>a</b> fleeting <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world in which they lived, that indeed by showing multiple facets of a subject captured at successive intervals in time simultaneously, a truer more complete image would emerge.|$|R
