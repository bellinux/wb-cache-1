5|$|Lobates {{have eight}} comb-rows, {{originating}} at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond {{the body to}} the lobes; in species with (four) <b>auricles,</b> the cilia edging the <b>auricles</b> are extensions of cilia {{in four of the}} comb rows. Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although Leucothea has long and active <b>auricles</b> whose movements also contribute to propulsion. Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly. Unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids. This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg-like.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two <b>auricles</b> {{receiving}} blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the <b>auricles</b> of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E

5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} fairly small spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses {{most of the other}} internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (<b>auricles),</b> which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.|$|E
5|$|The Lobata have {{a pair of}} lobes, {{which are}} muscular, cuplike {{extensions}} {{of the body that}} project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes {{on either side of the}} mouth, many species of lobates have four <b>auricles,</b> gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.|$|E

500|$|The {{shell of}} the Antarctic scallop grows to about [...] long and 7 {{centimetres}} wide and has a nearly circular outline. The two purplish-red valves are paper thin [...] and only slightly convex and are attached by a long, slightly sinuous, hinge. Near the hinge there is an umbo or beak on each valve, a raised hump from which the ribs radiate. The umbones are not very prominent and {{on either side of}} them are irregular winged processes, the <b>auricles.</b> In smaller specimens there are around 12 shallow ribs diverging from the umbones and further low ridges appear between these as the shell grows larger. There is a fine sculpturing of concentric lines {{on the outside of the}} valves. The <b>auricles</b> are also finely sculpted with the annual growth lines visible. The interior of the valves is pink. A fringe of numerous small tentacles project from the mantle between the two valves and there are a number of simple eyes in a row around the rim. The valves are held closed by powerful adductor muscles which work in opposition to an elastic ligament that lies just behind the umbones and which tends to open the valves. The flanges of the <b>auricles</b> provide a wide attachment for this ligament. The Antarctic scallop could be confused with other scallops, other bivalves or lamp shells.|$|E

The leaf undersurface is covered with white hair. Successive leaves become more obovate and are [...] long and [...] wide, with dentate margins and mucronate tips. Seedling stems are hairy.|$|E
40|$|Auricular {{reconstruction}} {{is often}} required for an auricular defect following tumor excision or trauma. It {{is important for}} the reconstructed <b>auricle</b> to maintain a complicated three-dimensional structure and to have structural strength against scar contracture. Many reconstruction methods for an auricular defect have ever been reported in the literature. Reconstruction methods using only soft tissues were common in early reports, but these methods cause postoperative deformity due to scar contracture. Therefore, reconstruction methods with a cartilage graft or using a chondrocutaneous flap are now preferred. Reconstruction using local flaps has an advantage over reconstruction using skin grafts because good color and texture match of the reconstructed <b>auricle</b> can be obtained. With elucidation of the hemodynamics of the <b>auricle,</b> various local flaps around the <b>auricle</b> have been developed, and the stability of blood supply of the flaps has improved. In this report, we classify the reconstruction methods and discuss the utility of each method, and we present our strategy for partial reconstruction of the <b>auricle...</b>|$|R

These arise from a stocky seedling stem, known as the hypocotyl, which is reddish and covered in short hairs. The <b>auricles</b> of the cotyledons are 2mm long. Seedling leaves arise 0.6 to 0.8cm beyond the cotyledons and are oppositely arranged. Linear, they are 1.4 to 1.6cm long with recurved margins and are covered in white hair. The stem remains reddish.

The cotyledon leaves sit atop the stout hypocotyl, which is green and smooth. The seedling leaves are crowded above the cotyledons. Resembling those of B. coccinea, they {{are lined with}} triangular lobes or [...] "teeth" [...] (with a u- or v-shaped sinus) and obovate to broadly lanceolate in shape. The first set of leaves measure [...] in length and around [...] in width, {{with three or four}} lobes in each margin. Both upper and lower seedling leaf surfaces are covered in spreading hairs, as is the seedling stem. Juvenile leaves are obovate to truncate or mucronate with triangular lobes and measure [...] long by [...] wide. These lobes are smaller toward the petiole and apex of the leaf.|$|E
500|$|The {{shell of}} the spiny scallop is {{slightly}} shaped like a fan {{and is able to}} grow to a height of about [...] though a more normal adult size is [...] The shell is composed of two valves, each of which is convex and has a small number of broad ribs covered with blunt spines. These radiate from the umbone, the rounded protuberance near the hinge, and between them are fine etched striations. The background colour is white with radial bands of pale purple and the right valve, which is usually underneath, is paler than the left. The annual growth rings are visible, often as concentric bands of a different hue. Beside the hinge are two irregular shell flaps or <b>auricles</b> with the anterior one normally being much larger than the other. This provides an attachment for the single strong adductor muscle that closes the shell. On either side of the long hinge there are some little ridges and grooves known as teeth. Their function is to prevent the valves moving sideways with regard to each other. Some bivalve shells have large [...] "cardinal" [...] teeth on the hinge immediately below the umbone, but the spiny scallop does not. Instead it has 5 or 6 lateral teeth lying {{on either side of the}} hinge. Lining the inside of the valves is the mantle, a membrane that covers the gut and other internal organs. It can be seen round the margins of the valves as a thick layer like a sandwich filling. It is fringed with numerous short tentacles and there is a row of tiny simple eyes close to each of the valves. The animal usually lies on its right valve and its exposed, left valve often has a colonial sponge growing on it.|$|E

The <b>auricle</b> is united to it behind, {{a little on the}} left side. The <b>auricle</b> is delicate in comparison with the ventricle, but is nevertheless abundantly supplied with muscular fibres; it lies diagonally in the pericardium, having the left side advanced almost to the front of that organ where it receives a trunk-vein from the skin. The right side of the <b>auricle</b> stretches backward, and receives a similar trunk-vein from the skin of this side almost at the posterior extremity of the pericardium.|$|R
