5|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{eleventh}} century BC, Mari became part of Hana whose king Tukulti-Mer took the title king of Mari and rebelled against Assyria, causing the Assyrian king Ashur-bel-kala to attack the city. Mari came firmly under the <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and was assigned {{in the first half of}} the 8th century BC to a certain Nergal-Erish to govern under the <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> king Adad-Nirari III (reigned 810–783 BC). In c. 760 BC, Shamash-Risha-Usur, an autonomous governor ruling parts of the upper middle Euphrates under the nominal <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> Ashur-dan III, styled himself the governor of the lands of Suhu and Mari, so did his son Ninurta-Kudurri-Usur. However, by that time, Mari was known to be located in the so-called Land of Laqe, making it unlikely that the Usur family actually controlled it, and suggesting that the title was employed out of historical reasons. The city continued as a small settlement until the Hellenistic period before disappearing from records.|$|E

5|$|Lugal: {{while in}} Mesopotamia a lugal {{designated}} a king, in Ebla it designated a governor who was {{directly under the}} <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> the capital.

Pettinato counted 14 different lugals in the Eblaite administrative texts and deduced that the kingdom was divided into fourteen departments; two of them in the capital itself and the remaining twelve spanned the rest of the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The Stewart dynasty, {{founded by}} King Robert II in 1371, {{was defined by}} the growing {{authority}} {{and power of the}} Scottish Kings in matters of law and the development of existing legal institutions. In 1469, the parliament of Scotland affirmed the ultimate <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> James III and rejected the <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> imperial notaries in Scottish civil matters. The recognition of the sovereign <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish Kings was connected to the influence of the common law in Scots law. Customary laws, such as the Law of Clan MacDuff, came under attack from the Stewart Dynasty, which consequently extended the reach of Scots common law.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> the United States.

We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

5|$|Although {{subject to}} all {{national}} laws and government, the Antakarana are also {{united in their}} recognition of the <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> a king (Ampanjaka) who is the living descendent {{of a line of}} Antankarana royalty going back nearly four centuries. The <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> this king is reaffirmed every five years at the village of Ambatoharaña in a ritual mast-raising ceremony called the tsangantsainy. Although some accounts date the ritual back to the origins of Antankarana kingship, the specific features of the ceremony as practiced today are rooted in historical events of the 19th century. The ceremony includes a pilgrimage to Nosy Mitsio to commemorate the flight of Antankarana refugees to the island in the 1830s to escape the advancing armies of the Kingdom of Imerina and to visit the tombs of ancestors who died there; until recently, it has sometimes also included raising both French and Antankarana banners to honor the 1841 treaty signed with the French. The king is selected by a council of elder {{members of the royal family}} in the ruling line. He is responsible for reciting joro (ancestral invocations) at ceremonies where the ancestors' blessings are requested. Another important social role is that of the Ndriambavibe. The Antankarana community selects a single noble woman to hold this position, which has similar authority and importance to that of the king. She is not his wife; rather, she has a separate leadership role to fulfill. The Antankarana are recognized among Malagasy as one of the few remaining ethnic groups in Madagascar that continues to reassert the ancestral <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> their king through continued practice of traditional kingship rituals.|$|E
