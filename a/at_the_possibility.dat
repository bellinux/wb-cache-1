5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, who believed {{that at least some}} of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, why had he flown all the way from London to deal with them? Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards—although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, the Yakovlev Yak-38, {{then the}} Soviet Navy's only {{operational}} carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, {{was found to}} be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's Project 1143 carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier {{would have been able to}} operate the MiG-23s and Su-24s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier, which would have accommodated the Su-25s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for Yak-141, MiG-29K and Su-27K operations.|$|E
5|$|Having not {{featured}} for Cardiff {{during the}} opening months of the 2010–11 season, Comminges joined League One side Carlisle United on a short-term loan deal until 31 December 2010. Carlisle manager Greg Abbott hinted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a permanent deal, should the loan be a success. However, Comminges failed to make a league appearance during his three-month loan spell, playing just 45 minutes in a 3–2 win over Conference National side Tamworth in the FA Cup. The adverse weather conditions during his loan agreement had resulted in a spate of postponements, and Comminges returned to his parent club earlier than agreed. On returning to Cardiff, {{he was told he}} was free to find a new club with his contract expiring {{at the end of the}} season. He left the club by mutual consent, and subsequently joined League Two side Southend United on a free transfer in January 2011.|$|E

5|$|Lillehammer Municipal Council, Oppland County Council and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{rejected}} the location {{because of the}} environmental impact. These institutions instead proposed that the track be built at Huseskogen at Hunderfossen. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee initially disapproved of the location and in 1990 started looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of constructing the track at Holmenkollen in Oslo. Two routes were considered, one in the same route as Korketrekkeren and one which would run from Gratishaugen at Holmenkollbakken to Midtstuen. Internationally there was support from the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation to build Norway's track in the capital. Concerns about {{the environmental impact of}} a Hunderfossen location were raised, particularly regarding visual pollution. However, Hunderfossen was confirmed along with a grant issued by the Parliament of Norway on 24 August 1990.|$|E
5|$|Almost immediately, {{the company}} began looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of {{converting}} {{all or part of}} the system into railways. W A Povis, their engineer, was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around half the cost of building a new line. The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing bits of the inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left. Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate, to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament. The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Although some would be converted to railways, the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was part of the system that would be retained as a waterway, on which salt was a major source of revenue. The plans resulted in the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846. The new company could raise £3.3 million of new capital, in addition to that already in existence, with another £1.1 million if necessary. They prompted new railways, but before any of the existing canals were converted, the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway, who took control in June 1847. They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently, and by 1849, the idea of conversion had been dropped, as the canals could still operate profitably.|$|E
