50|$|The helmet fitting process starts by {{measuring}} the player's head with calipers. Based on measurements taken, a helmet shell of the appropriate size and style is chosen. Then, padding is added {{to ensure that the}} helmet fits the player's head. Padding consists of both foam rubber <b>pads</b> and inflatable (<b>air)</b> <b>pads.</b> Both the top and side padding include inflatable bladders that customize the fit. Once the helmet is in place on the player's head, the inflater bulb is applied to two points {{on the outside of the}} helmet. The jaw pads are fitted to ensure that the lower part of the helmet is snug against the player's face. The helmets that most NFL teams use are remarkably light, and once the pads are in place, there is no movement or shifting on the player's head.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of a horse riding program on balancing ability in children with cerebral palsy. Eleven children (five males and six females) diagnosed with cerebral palsy participated. The horse riding exercises (walking and trotting) were conducted twice per week for 30 minutes during 24 weeks. Balancing ability was measured three times at pre, mid, and post-test using an <b>air</b> <b>pad</b> by the same physical therapist. The data were analyzed using a two-way repeated-measures analysis of covariance with time (0, 12, and 24 weeks) using SPSS version 18. 0. A comparison of horse riding between patients with hemiplegia and paraplegia was conducted with the Willcoxon signed-ranktest at a predetermined probability rate of 5 %. The results showed a significant increase in balancing ability after horse riding than that before horse riding (p< 0. 01). The average balancing score increased greater in males (54. 59 ± 84. 05) than that in females (27. 84 ± 12. 67) after the horse riding exercise program compared to that before the program (p < 0. 05). Thus, horse riding exercise was considered an effective to improve balance in children with cerebral palsy. These results provide useful basic data for horse riding for the disabled.

40|$|Stability boots {{can protect}} the ankle ligaments from {{overloading}} after serious injury and facilitate protected movement {{in order to}} aid healing of the surrounding soft tissue structures. For comparing different stability shoe designs and prototypes, a reliable and fast testing method (FTM) is required. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the reliability of a novel custom-built device. Six different stability boots were tested in a novel device that allowed body weight to be taken into account using a pneumatic actuator. The fixation of the boots was controlled using two <b>air</b> <b>pad</b> pressure sensors. The range of motion (RoM) was then assessed during 5 trials at physiological ankle joint torques during flexion/extension and inversion/eversion. Furthermore the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC was determined to assess the repetitive reliability of the testing approach. The measured ankle angles ranged from 3. 4 ° to 25 ° and proved to be highly reliable (ICC= 0. 99), with standard deviations < 9. 8 %. Comparing single trials to one another resulted in a change of 0. 01 ° joint angle, with a mean error of 0. 02 °.

40|$|The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) solar arrays {{are placed}} into orbital {{configuration}} by a complex deployment system. Its two wings each comprise twin seven square solar panels located by a twelve foot articulated boom. The four spring-driven hinge lines per wing are rate-limited by viscous dampers. The wings are stowed against the spacecraft kinematically, and released by five pyrotechnically-actuated mechanisms. Since deployment failure would be catastrophic, {{a total of}} 17 deployment tests were completed to qualify the system for the worst cast launch environment. This successful testing culminated in the flawless deployment of the solar arrays on orbit, 15 minutes after launch in November 1997. The custom gravity negation system used to perform deployment testing is modular to allow its setup in several locations, including the launch site in Japan. Both platform and height can be varied, {{to meet the requirements}} of the test configuration and the test facility. Its <b>air</b> <b>pad</b> floatation system meets tight packaging requirements, allowing installation while stowed against the spacecraft without breaking any flight interfaces, and avoiding interference during motion. This system was designed concurrently with the deployment system, to facilitate its installation, to aid in the integration of the flight system to the spacecraft, while demonstrating deployment capabilities. Critical parameters for successful testing were alignment of deployment axes and tables to gravity, alignment of table seams to minimize discontinuities, and minimizing pressure drops in the air supply system.

40|$|Objective: Defibrillation pads {{are used}} {{routinely}} at both cardiac arrests and cardioversion procedures. There are currently no evidence-based guidelines on how often pads should be replaced, {{although it has}} been suggested that they should be changed as often as every three shocks to maintain optimal performance. Previously, we have shown that on exposure to <b>air,</b> <b>pad</b> mass diminishes over time due to evaporation—an effect likely to lead to poorer conduction between skin and paddle. This prospective study was designed to determine if evaporation is accelerated by the passage of a defibrillation current and to formulate evidence-based guidelines for defibrillation pad replacement. Materials and methods: 3 M defibrillation pads (2346 N) were collected from acute wards and emergency departments in two hospitals in the UK over a 2 month period. The duration of exposure to air, number and energy of shocks, and type of procedure were recorded. When no longer required, pad masses were determined and the loss of pad mass due to evaporation calculated. Results: 26 pairs of pads were collected from 14 cardiac arrests and 12 cardioversions. The total defibrillation energy used ranged from 150 to 5080 J and evaporative drying time from 4 to 38 min. The rate of evaporation from these pads (86. 1 mg min? 1) was not significantly different from pads previously studied on volunteers in the absence of a defibrillation current (99. 4 mg min? 1). Of the defibrillation pads exposed to air for less than 30 min, in only one of 49 pads was the loss of mass due to evaporation consistent with a significant increase in transthoracic impedance (TTI). Correspondingly, of two pads used for more than 30 min, both attained a mass consistent with a significant increase in TTI. Conclusions: Defibrillation pads can be used for up to 30 min without evaporation causing a clinically significant increase in TTI. The passage of a defibrillation current across pads does not further accelerate water loss...|$|E

For the mechanical simulation of space, the small drag of the bladder type <b>air</b> <b>pads</b> is much more than can be coped with, and the practicality of large floor areas being machined for precision air bearings is nonexistent.

The bladder is inflated with air which then escapes through passages into a cavity {{in the center of the}} bladder to produce the lifting energy. As the air escapes about the perimeter of the bladder, a certain degree of balance and equilibrium is imparted to the pad as it is able to move a limited weight across slightly uneven surfaces...|$|R
