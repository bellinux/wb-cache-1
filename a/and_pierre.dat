5|$|Polonium was {{discovered}} in 1898 by Marie <b>and</b> <b>Pierre</b> Curie, when it was extracted from uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: {{it was the first}} element to be so discovered. Polonium was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. Polonium has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in space probes, antistatic devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Polonium's intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic.|$|E

5|$|Curium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Cm and atomic number 96. This {{element of the}} actinide series was named after Marie <b>and</b> <b>Pierre</b> Curie – both were known for their research on radioactivity. Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley. The discovery was kept secret and only {{released to the public}} in November 1945. Most curium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 20grams of curium.|$|E

The coup may have had French involvement, since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France. Houphouët-Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November, the PDCI asked the government to ban the sale of Jeune Afrique following its allegations of Houphouët-Boigny's participation. The Ivorian president would have greatly benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government. He contacted Blaise Compaoré, the second-most powerful man in the regime; it is generally believed that they worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona Fologo, Robert Guéï <b>and</b> <b>Pierre</b> Ouédraogo to overthrow the Sankara regime.|$|E
