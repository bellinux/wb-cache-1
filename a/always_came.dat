5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke <b>always</b> <b>came</b> in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E

Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and <b>always</b> <b>came</b> in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|The Bideford District Association of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (as it {{was then}} known) {{introduced}} a lifeboat service in February 1825. The boat was kept in the King's Watch House at Appledore. In 1831 the work {{was taken over by}} the Devon Humane Society and they built a new boat house at Watertown, half a mile nearer the sea. This was large enough for two boats and a second one arrived in December that year but in 1848 was transferred to a second boat house at Braunton Burrows {{on the opposite side of}} the estuary. It was easier to launch from here to help ships on that side of the water but crews for lifeboats at Braunton Burrows <b>always</b> <b>came</b> from Appledore. A third station was built at Northam Burrows to the west of Appledore in 1851. This was expanded to house a second boat in 1856 and the old boat house at Watertown eventually lost its boats.|$|E
25|$|In June 1974, {{six years}} into the car's UK introduction, Ford {{announced}} {{the completion of the}} two millionth Ford Escort, a milestone hitherto unmatched by any Ford model outside the US. It was also stated that 60% of the two million Escorts had been built in Britain. In West Germany cars were built at a slower rate of around 150,000 cars per year, slumping to 78,604 in 1974 which was the last year for the Escort Mark I. Many of the German built Escorts were exported, notably to Benelux and Italy; from the West German domestic market perspective the car was cramped and uncomfortable when compared with the well-established and comparably priced Opel Kadett, and it was technically primitive when set against the successful imported Fiat 128 and Renault 12. Subsequent generations of the Escort made up some of the ground foregone by the original model, but in Europe's largest auto-market the Escort sales volumes <b>always</b> <b>came</b> in well behind those of the General Motors Kadett and its Astra successor.|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{failed to}} win a Stanley Cup over the 22 seasons he was a general manager with Philadelphia, Minnesota, and Florida. During his 19 seasons as Flyers manager over two stints, the Flyers reached the Stanley Cup finals three times and amassed a regular season record of 714–443–199, but {{for one reason or}} another <b>always</b> <b>came</b> up short of a Cup title. Clarke's Flyers in 1985 and 1987 were {{considered}} underdogs to the powerhouse Edmonton Oilers, as were his North Stars to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991. In his second tenure as Flyers manager, the team lost in the postseason, frequently to lower-seeded teams. While goaltending was a strength during his first tenure with two Vezina Trophy winners between the pipes (Pelle Lindbergh and Ron Hextall), only Hextall in 1995, a combination of Hextall and Garth Snow in 1997, Brian Boucher in 2000, and Robert Esche in 2004 got the Flyers past the second round of the playoffs during his second stint. By contrast the New Jersey Devils, their Atlantic Division rivals, were stable in net with Martin Brodeur and beat the Flyers in the Conference Finals en route to Stanley Cups in 1995 and 2000.|$|E

500|$|Over eleven years, Tubman {{returned}} {{repeatedly to}} the Eastern Shore of Maryland, rescuing some 70 slaves in about thirteen expeditions, including her three other brothers, Henry, Ben, and Robert, {{their wives and}} some of their children. She also provided specific instructions to 50 to 60 additional fugitives who escaped to the north. Tubman's dangerous work required tremendous ingenuity; she usually worked during winter months, to minimize the likelihood that the group would be seen. One admirer of Tubman said: [...] "She <b>always</b> <b>came</b> in the winter, when the nights are long and dark, and people who have homes stay in them." [...] Once she had made contact with escaping slaves, they left town on Saturday evenings, since newspapers would not print runaway notices until Monday morning.|$|E
500|$|Ferguson had, on {{numerous}} occasions during his playing and managerial career, served as a substitute umpire, but did not start doing it full-time until after his departure from Philadelphia. In 1888, he became a full-time professional umpire, working in the American Association, {{and later in the}} Players' League in 1890. By the end of the 1890 season he had passed Kick Kelly to take over the record for career games as an umpire with 650; John Gaffney surpassed his final total of 786 in 1893. Ferguson officially umpired 804games if his National Association games are taken into account, and his career came to a close after the 1891 season. On his umpiring philosophy, he once stated [...] "Umpiring <b>always</b> <b>came</b> as easy to me", he said, [...] "as sleeping on a featherbed. Never change a decision, never stop to talk to a man. Make 'em play ball and keep their mouths shut, and never fear but the people will be on your side and you'll be called the king of umpires." ...|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack for Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was {{composed}} by Kenji Yamamoto, Minako Hamano and Masaru Tajima. The game {{took advantage of}} the increase in the amount of RAM that took place when the series switched from the GameCube to the Wii; this allowed for higher quality audio samples to be used and thus allowing a better overall audio quality. Yamamoto used Hirokazu Tanaka's musical design of the original Metroid in Corruption, by keeping the music and themes dark and scary until the very end, when uplifting music is played during the credits. Corruption is the first Metroid game to feature a significant amount of voice acting, compared to previous games in the series in which Samus [...] " [...] alone [...] <b>always</b> <b>came</b> across as a lone wolf". The producers decided to include voices to create a stronger connection between players and the characters. The characters' voices were performed by Timothy Patrick Miller, Lainie Frasier, Christopher Sabat, Edwin Neal, Claire Hamilton, Brian Jepson, Gray Haddock, Clayton Kjas and Ken Webster.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{also contributed}} {{significantly}} to children's literature. His publication of Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79) spawned {{a revolution in the}} newly emerging genre. Its plain style, mother-child dialogues, and conversational tone inspired a generation of authors, such as Sarah Trimmer. Johnson encouraged other women to write in this genre, such as Charlotte Smith, but his recommendation <b>always</b> <b>came</b> with a caveat of how difficult it was to write well for children. For example, he wrote to Smith, [...] "perhaps you cannot employ your time and extraordinary talents more usefully for the public & your self , than in composing books for children and young people, but I am very sensible it is extreamly [...] difficult to acquire that simplicity of style which is their great recommendation". He also advised William Godwin and his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, on the publication of their Juvenile Library (started in 1805). Not only did Johnson encourage the writing of British children's literature, but he also helped sponsor the translation and publication of popular French works such as Arnaud Berquin's [...] (1782–83).|$|E
500|$|An 1855 {{paper on}} the [...] "introduction" [...] of species, written by Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that {{patterns}} in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species <b>always</b> <b>came</b> into existence near an already existing, closely related species. Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed {{that he did not}} want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a [...] "sketch" [...] account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species as his [...] "big book" [...] on Natural Selection. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray [...] a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas.|$|E

2500|$|Ideological demands <b>always</b> <b>came</b> first: the Patriots viewed {{independence}} as a {{means to}} gain freedom from British oppression and taxation and, above all, to reassert what they considered to be their rights as English subjects.

2500|$|One {{theory about}} the {{etymology}} {{of the word}} testis is based on Roman law. The original Latin word [...] "testis", [...] "witness", {{was used in the}} firmly established legal principle [...] "Testis unus, testis nullus" [...] (one witness [...] no witness), meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another. This led to the common practice of producing two witnesses, bribed to testify the same way in cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives. Since such [...] "witnesses" [...] <b>always</b> <b>came</b> in pairs, the meaning was accordingly extended, often in the diminutive (testiculus, testiculi).|$|E
2500|$|Like {{his contemporaries}} in The Five, Balakirev {{believed}} {{in the importance of}} program music—music written to fulfill a program inspired by a portrait, poem, story or other non-musical source. Unlike his compatriots, the musical form <b>always</b> <b>came</b> first for Balakirev, not the extramusical source, and his technique continued to reflect the Germanic symphonic approach. Nevertheless, Balakirev's overtures {{played a crucial role in}} the emergence of Russian symphonic music in that they introduced the musical style now considered [...] "Russian." [...] His style was adapted by his compatriots and others to the point of becoming a national characteristic. The opening of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov bears a close resemblance to the first theme of Balakirev's Second Overture, while Borodin's In the Steppes of Central Asia begins with a dominant pedal extending over 90 bars in the upper register of the violins, a device Balakirev used in his First Overture. The opening of Tchaikovsky's Little Russian Symphony in its original form also shows Balakirev's influence.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{spotted by}} Geoff Cook, Durham's coach, Onions made his second XI debut {{for the club}} {{at the age of}} 18. He was offered a {{contract}} with the club and opted to become a professional cricketer rather than take a sports science choice at university, which was his other option. Onions started in the team as the fourth bowler. Looking back on his early career, he felt that he tried too hard early on. On one occasion he recalled how [...] "I remember being thrown the ball at an important stage of a game at Scarborough, and Phil Jaques hit me for four successive fours. I was thinking 'I'm not sure I can do this.' But Dale Benkenstein was a huge influence as captain, and you have to learn from all those experiences. Otherwise I could not have done what I did in my first season of Test cricket. I often went for 15 to 20 runs in my first three overs, but <b>always</b> <b>came</b> back strongly." [...] In 2006, Onions regularly opened the bowling for Durham with Ottis Gibson.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Connell (Nikki Cox) is {{the special}} events {{director}} at the casino.

A Las Vegas native, her father sexually abused her when she was a child, and Danny <b>always</b> <b>came</b> to her rescue. In season three, Mary is rehired and promoted to hotel manager. In season four, she helps her stepmother and half sisters testify against her father – a case which is lost because of his connections. In the episode [...] "Bare Chested in the Park", she is shown purchasing a revolver to shoot her father in the season-four finale. She is involved in a relationship with Danny, who proposes to her in season two – she accepts, then later calls off the engagement. Mary is hiding from the law for her part in her father's murder, but is apparently safe, as she sends Danny a photo with a house and white picket fence (her dream house).|$|E
2500|$|The series {{began at}} a time when {{violence}} on television was under intense scrutiny. As a result, Wonder Woman was less frequently seen punching or kicking people the way she did in the early episodes. She would usually be shown pushing and throwing enemies or using creativity to get them to somehow knock themselves out (such as jumping high into the air to cause pursuers to collide). Despite the wartime setting, she almost never resorted to deadly force. The only exception occurs in the pilot episode when she sinks a German U-boat by crashing an airplane into it, presumably killing everyone aboard. [...] Wonder Woman herself was occasionally overpowered by chloroform and poison gas, but she <b>always</b> <b>came</b> {{back in the second half}} of the show to save the day. In some episodes, her enemies learn the secret of her superhuman strength – her magic belt – and temporarily steal it, leaving her with average human strength. Her indestructible lasso and bracelets were stolen or taken away in one episode (leaving her defenseless against gunfire), but Wonder Woman recovered them by the end of the episode. (In the comics, Wonder Woman's bracelets were welded onto her forearms, and she would lose most of her strength if men were to join them forcibly with metal.) ...|$|E
