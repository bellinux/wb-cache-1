The undersea tunnel of the Øresund Bridge-Tunnel provides for navigation of large ships {{into and out}} of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is the main trade route for export of Russian petroleum. Many of the countries neighboring the Baltic Sea have been concerned about this, since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker would be disastrous for the Baltic—given the slow exchange of water. The tourism industry surrounding the Baltic Sea is naturally concerned <b>about</b> <b>oil</b> pollution.|$|E
25|$|Most cars {{in use in}} the 2010s are {{propelled}} by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the deflagration (rather than detonation) combustion of hydrocarbon fossil fuels, mostly gasoline (petrol) and diesel, {{as well as some}} Autogas and CNG. Hydrocarbon fuels cause air pollution and contribute to climate change and global warming. Rapidly increasing oil prices, concerns <b>about</b> <b>oil</b> dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. Efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.|$|E

25|$|Meetings {{and other}} events will officially {{commence}} on this day. 23,000 delegates had registered on this day to attend the meetings. The Singapore Changi Airport officially completes renovations at Terminal 2 {{after three years of}} upgrading. The IMF chief Rodrigo de Rato has criticised attempts made by the United States, People's Republic of China and some other nations to depress fuel prices, and advocated raising prices, instead of tax breaks or subsidies at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries seminar {{on the first day of}} the conference. He added that domestic pricing policies for refined fuel should reflect the scarcity of the resource, and high world crude oil prices. He acknowledged there would be some political resistance to raise the oil prices, but he mentioned successful experiences in Indonesia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. He called for adequate investment in the oil industry to ease concerns <b>about</b> <b>oil</b> supply in the later years, and appealed oil producing countries to balance the spending and savings for future generations. The IMF warned that the global markets faces a risk of a major setback, including an economic downturn in the United States, falling home prices, further surge in oil prices, interest rate rises to contain inflationary pressures, which the IMF said in its twice a year report on global financial stability.|$|E

2500|$|After his {{graduate}} studies, {{he was hired}} in 1920 as a geologist for the American Oil Engineering Corporation, and in 1921 he conducted the first surveys {{of the potential for}} oil exploration in eastern Ecuador with Joseph Sinclair, a consulting geologist. He was hired as the chief geologist with the Pure Oil Company in 1922, a position he held until 1952, when he became a senior geologist for that company. He worked for Pure Oil in Tulsa, OK, Columbus, OH, and finally in Chicago, IL. He excelled at finding new oil and gas fields—he was called [...] "Pure's top oil hunter"—and {{was one of the first}} petroleum geologists to use geophysical survey data. He was credited with finding major oil fields in Venezuela in 1922, in Michigan in 1927, in southern Illinois in 1936, and the Cumberland Field in Oklahoma in 1940. In 1927, he and his staff used geophysical data to find the large Van oil field in Texas, and in 1937 it was also used by him and his staff (working with Superior Oil) to find the Creole field in Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico, which was the first offshore oil well in the world in tidal waters; see also Offshore oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico and Oil platform history. He was profiled in National Petroleum News in 1929, was called [...] "one of the leading geologists of the world" [...] in a 1940 article <b>about</b> <b>oil</b> reserves, and was quoted as an [...] "authority on oil reserves" [...] in Popular Mechanics in 1944.

40|$|One of the {{commonly}} used methods for ozone therapy is ozonated oils. Most prominent type of used oils is {{extra virgin olive}} oil.

2500|$|It was {{suggested}} in 1923 that the Great Barrier Reef contains a major oil reservoir. After the Commonwealth Petroleum Search Subsidies Act of 1957, hydrocarbon exploration increased in Queensland, including a well drilled at Wreck Island {{in the southern}} Great Barrier Reef in 1959. In the 1960s, drilling {{for oil and gas}} was investigated throughout the Great Barrier Reef, in the Torres Strait, along [...] "the eastern seaboard of Cape York to Princess Charlotte Bay" [...] and along the coast from Cooktown to Fraser Island. In the late 1960s, more exploratory oil wells were drilled near Wreck Island in the Capricorn Channel, and near Darnley Island in the Torres Strait, but with no results. In the 1970s, responding to concern <b>about</b> <b>oil</b> spills, the Australian government forbade petroleum drilling on the GBR. Yet oil spills due to shipping accidents are still a threat to environment, with a total of 282 spills between 1987 and 2002.|$|E
