40|$|International carbon offsets {{have been}} {{promoted}} since the Kyoto Protocol {{and an increasing}} number of countries have implemented or proposed cap-and-trade schemes with international trading, even though with quantitative or qualitative restrictions. Those limits reflect the trade-off between economic efficiency, distributional issues, and the need for <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> foreign mitigation <b>measures.</b> Ceilings are also justified on the ground that international offsets undermine the capability of climate policy to induce and diffuse technological change. This paper addresses these issues in a second-best setting that explicitly considers the interplay between multiple externalities. We evaluate numerically how limits to the size, the timing, and the participation in an international carbon market affect the macroeconomic costs of climate policy, international financial transfers, and the incentive to carry out innovation. Results indicate that when constraints on international offsets are moderate, such as limiting their use to at most 15 % of regional abatement, efficiency losses are small because they are partly compensated by more technological change and energy market effects, although specific regional patterns are identified. Regarding financial outflows from OECD countries, already a 15 % ceiling would limit financial transfers significantly. Provisions of this kind are in line {{with some of the most}} recent policy proposals in OECD countries. Energy-economy Modelling, Climate Policy, Technology Spillovers...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{explores the}} Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) which creates carbon credits from {{emission}} abatement projects in developing economies. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to examine the operation of the CDM with specific reference to fraud vulnerabilities regarding the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> a project. An examination of the process of establishment, certification and verification <b>of</b> <b>additionality</b> (confirmation that emissions post-implementation of the CDM project are lower than those that would have occurred under the most plausible alternative scenario) is used to highlight the need for particular vigilance in respect to sustaining and improving the integrity of future market-based mechanisms post-Kyoto. Design/methodology/approach: The study takes a case study approach, examining the CDM project cycle and associated key entities. Findings: The study posits that the processes associated with establishing and verifying <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> a project are potentially key areas of systemic weakness that must be addressed. This case study explores the design features of the CDM that may afford greater opportunities for fraudulent or deceptive practices. Originality/value: The CDM takes a project-by-project approach to establishment, verification and certification <b>of</b> <b>additionality.</b> Whilst conceptually this design may be appropriate from an operational perspective, it potentially provides opportunities for fraudulent outcomes. The individualised approach is, by its very nature, highly resource-intensive and inherently difficult to verify.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between competition and innovations. Making use of growth models where the incentive effects of competition on innovation, and consequently growth, are considered, the effect of competition on technological progress is examined. The interplay between competition and corporate governance and their combined effect on innovations are also examined. Furthermore, the interaction between R&D subsidies and competition and the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> an R&D subsidy are analytically elaborated as an extension to the already formulated model of an inverted U-shape relationship between competition and innovations. The three key hypotheses analyzed in this study are: 1) competition policy has important complementarities with R&D policy in the fostering of an innovative environment; 2) R&D subsidies should in all cases be carefully monitored; 3) the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> R&D subsidies tends to be strongest at moderate degrees of competition. The findings are that the degree of competition within the industry should be taken into account in the granting of R&D subsidies. A policy mix of R&D policy and competition policy may increase the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> an R&D subsidy. As for the monitoring of subsidies, the findings are that all forms of subsidies to R&D ventures should be carefully monitored. Finally, an R&D subsidy tends to have strongest additionality at moderate degrees of competition. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|We {{first study}} how {{participation}} in the Norwegian R&D tax credit scheme affects the probability of receiving other R&D and innovation subsidies. We find no evidence suggesting that using the R&D tax credit increase the probability of receiving direct R&D subsidies in the future, but we cannot exclude {{the possibility of an}} immediate positive effect. At the individual firm level, direct subsidies and the tax credit seem to be complements, while at the innovation system level they seem to be substitutes, as the probability of receiving direct subsidies has fallen after the introduction of the tax credit scheme. Next, we compare the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> the R&D tax credit with direct R&D subsidies. Our preferred estimate suggests that each public krone spent on tax credits for firms investing below the 4 million cap on intramural R&D increases private intramural R&D by 2. 68 kroner. This estimate builds on an assumption <b>of</b> zero <b>additionality</b> for firms above the 4 million cap. We find that the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> subsidies awarded through the Research Council and Innovation Norway is 2. 07 and 1. 53 respectively. The <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> grants awarded by ministries and other public agencies is 0. 64, and the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> R&D subsidies from the EU is 0. 75. We stress the potential for both positive and negative biases in these estimates. Direct R&D subsidies are intended for projects with low private return and high social return. We find that projects funded through direct grants have essentially zero returns. Although surprisingly low, this is consistent with a high quality grant allocation process. Our estimate for the return to R&D projects financed by tax credits is just slightly below the return to R&D projects financed by own funds. This is to be expected as this type of R&D has a lower marginal price. The estimated returns are 16 % and 19 % respectively. All estimates are likely to be downward biased by measurement errors in the R&D variables.

40|$|The {{value of}} credit {{guarantee}} programs {{has recently been}} called into question. Credit guarantees are important marketing tools in the world wheat market, both to develop new markets and to compete in existing markets. This study examines the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> export credit guarantees. Empirical demand models were developed and estimated using pooled data among importing countries. Models were estimated {{for each of the}} principal exporting countries providing export credit guarantees: the United States, Canada and France. <b>Additionality</b> <b>of</b> credit guarantees were also contrasted to the Export Enhancement Program. Positive additionality was found for CCC guarantees, indicating that the GSM programs have resulted in additional exports that would not have occurred without the programs. Additionality was not constant across exporters. Additionality was estimated at 12. 6 MMT for credit guarantees and 19 MMT for EEP. The U. S. results, when considering costs of the programs, indicate that the CCC subsidy (from guarantees), on a per dollar of subsidy basis, provides about four times more additionality than EEP. These results cast doubt on the price subsidy equivalence of guarantees. The subsidy implied in Canadian credit has a significant and negative effect on U. S. wheat exports. The magnitude of the coefficient is larger than the magnitude of the CCC guarantee subsidy. In the Canadian demand model, the effect of the CCC subsidy is insignificant. The results suggest that Canada's guarantee program does more to displace U. S. sales than it does to help Canadian sales. Further, as a whole CCC guarantees offset Canadian guarantees and outperform COFACE guarantees.

The present paper evaluates the <b>additionalities</b> <b>of</b> several of such schemes from the UK and the Netherlands.

Nonetheless, opening up automotive SMEs for cooperative and multiparty innovation practises appears is for many cases a question of long breath, and will require sustained action to really institutionalise multi-party innovation practises into their behavioural patterns. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|R
