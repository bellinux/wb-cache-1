30|$|At {{the end of}} an <b>available</b> <b>session,</b> if {{the user}} is {{connected}} to VLC, it must decide whether to switch to WiFi or not. If the VLC-LoS blocking occurs frequently, it can lead to unnecessary handovers and the ping-pong effect. For a D-VHO scheme, a dwell time will be set in anticipation of link recovery to reduce unnecessary handovers. However, if the recovery time is greater than the dwell time, the unnecessary delay will largely degrade system performance. In our work, we utilize the average duration of blocking and non-blocking events, in the event of blocking of LoS optical link, to compute the dwell time. If the VLC link is still unavailable after the dwell time, handover is executed from VLC to WiFi; otherwise, MT remains connected to VLC. On the other hand, when the MT is connected to WiFi and an <b>available</b> <b>session</b> begins, the communication link is switched immediately to VLC.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—End-users {{who want}} to receive {{real-time}} streaming data on the Internet must first obtain the session information. A session information distribution system that distributes the <b>available</b> <b>session</b> information to all potential receivers must be scalable and work with low latency. We present the design and implementation of a session information distribution system using multiple session agents. This system distributes the session infor-mation to the Internet users effectively, and can limit information distribution to specified users by labeling. We evaluated the actual implementation on the PlanetLab and OpenDHT to measure the session information distribution delay and retrieval time. The experimental results {{have shown that the}} session agent can distribute session information to the entire Internet with good scalability and end-users can retrieve the information with low latency.

40|$|Response {{inhibition}} plays {{a critical}} role in adaptive functioning and can be assessed with the Stop-signal task, which requires participants to suppress prepotent motor responses. Evidence suggests that this ability to inhibit a motor response that has already been initiated (reflected as Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT)) is a quantitative and heritable measure of interindividual variation in brain function. In order to examine the reliability of this measure, we pooled data across three separate studies and examined the influence of multiple SSRT calculation methods and outlier calling on reliability (using Intra-class correlation). Our results suggest that an approach which uses the average of all <b>available</b> <b>sessions,</b> all trials of each session, and excludes outliers based on predetermined lenient criteria yields reliable SSRT estimates, while not excluding too many participants. Our findings support the reliability of SSRT as an index of inhibitory control, and provide support for its continued use as a neurocognitive phenotype...|$|R

50|$|Music {{therapy has}} {{multiple}} benefits which {{contribute to the}} maintenance of health and the drive toward rehabilitation for children. Advanced technology that can monitor cortical activity offers a look at how music engages and produces changes in the brain during the perception and production of musical stimuli. Music therapy, when used with other rehabilitation methods, has increased the success rate of sensorimotor, cognitive, and communicative rehabilitation.Music therapy intervention programs can include an average of 18 sessions of treatment. The achievement of a physical rehabilitation goal relies on the child's existing motivation and feelings towards music and their commitment to engage in meaningful, rewarding efforts. Regaining full functioning also confides in the prognosis of recovery, the condition of the client, and the environmental resources <b>available.</b> <b>Sessions</b> may consist of either active techniques, where the client creates music, or receptive techniques, where the client listens to, analyzes, moves and responds to music. Both techniques use systematic processes where the therapists assist the client by using musical experiences and connections that collaborate as a dynamic force of change toward rehabilitation.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims at supporting {{hospital management}} in making prompt Operating Room (OR) planning decisions, when either unpredicted events occur or alternative scenarios or configurations {{need to be}} rapidly evaluated. We design and test a planning tool enabling managers to efficiently analyse several alternatives to the current OR planning and scheduling. To this aim, we propose a decomposition approach. More specifically, we first focus on determining the Master Surgical Schedule (MSS) on a weekly basis, by assigning the different surgical disciplines to the <b>available</b> <b>sessions.</b> Next, we allocate surgeries to each session, focusing on elective patients only. Patients are selected from the waiting lists according to several parameters, including surgery duration, waiting time and priority class of the operations. We performed computational experiments to compare the performance of our decomposition approach with an (exact) integrated approach. The case study selected for our simulations {{is based on the}} characteristics of the operating theatre (OT) of a medium-size public Italian hospital. Scalability of the method is tested for different OT sizes. A pilot example is also proposed to highlight the usefulness of our approach for decision support. The proposed decomposition approach finds satisfactory solutions with significant savings in computation time...|$|R
