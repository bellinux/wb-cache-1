500|$|According to {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine, {{the album}} title refers to stereotypical rock stars. When {{asked about the}} matter, and an earlier comment about Axl Rose having killed the traditional rock star image, Mustaine explained that [...] "People want heroes. Most bands look like average Joes, wearing gas-station shirts, have funky hair-dos <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> wanna {{be able to go}} 'they may not be popular, but they're MY band.'" [...] Mustaine {{went on to say that}} many of contemporary rock music groups looked and sounded the same, and that the music industry needed a hero. He then proceeded to contrast a perceived lack of image of then current music scenes with the image of 1980s metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.|$|E
500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> [...] that I was an artist on a project. Octagon wasn't my life...I've {{done a lot of}} things that were totally around different things other than Octagon. Are some people just afraid to venture off into my life and see that I do other things which are great? I think people stuck me with something." ...|$|E

[...] "There's been a lot going on , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that.

500|$|Once {{she became}} Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve {{dramatically}} among the American public and {{become one of}} a respected world figure. She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal), and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure. A 2012 Internet meme, [...] "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics. Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.

500|$|Though Wenger has {{established}} Arsenal as UEFA Champions League regulars, {{he has yet}} to win the European Cup, or translated his domestic success in other continental competitions – often considered a blemish on his managerial career. Writer Michael Calvin argues despite the European failings, Wenger should still be considered one of the greats in football: [...] " [...] has been the best, most influential manager of the modern era. His job has involved managing change, and all the hypocrisy which comes with that. In a world where incoherence is routinely hailed as innovation, he has been a true visionary". Wenger's stubbornness to follow his idealistic vision of football has been heavily criticised during his second decade at Arsenal. In 2016, Henry Winter reasoned the Frenchman's methods no longer gave him an advantage over others, and he needed to adapt or resign. Winter also suggested the club was content with lucrative top-four finishes, and the manager needed tough individuals to challenge him. Ferguson however expressed admiration in Wenger's consistency and obstinate nature: [...] "He stays with what he believes in. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> who do that are outstanding coaches".|$|E

2500|$|This line-up {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Introducing the Whitlams, in August 1993 on Black Yak/Phantom Records. The album {{was recorded in}} January and March 1993 at the Skyhigh Studios in Newcastle; for the recording sessions they used Louis Burdett and Nick Cecire on drums, with Rob Taylor producing. The album features a mix of original and cover songs, including tracks written by Justin Hayes a.k.a. Stanley Claret (Plunder's brother). The album comprises three studio tracks, five live takes and two songs from their first demo, including a tribute song to the band's namesake, [...] "Gough", which was written by Freedman. The lead single, [...] "Woody", detailed Woody Allen's break up with Mia Farrow and was followed by their second single, [...] "Gough". Plunder described their sound to Naomi Mapstone of The Canberra Times, [...] "There'd been lots of rap and lots of thrash and that's all very good, but {{we just have a}} different style of music <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> appreciated hearing something a bit different [...] sort of happy, sensitive, not that loud... much more accoustic." [...] The Canberra Times reporter, Nicole Leedham felt it was [...] "sublime and ridiculous, the band's bluesy, country, jazzy, punky, folky pop swings from bleeding sensitivity to drunken hilarity." [...] Oz Music Project described the album as being [...] "very different to later recordings, with the band sounding a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. A far cry from the lush orchestration of recent recordings." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded.

2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies.

The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E
