5|$|In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff {{including}} more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. There are also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and <b>allowances.</b> These fees and <b>allowances</b> were removed in May 2010, and prescriptions are entirely free, although dentists and opticians may charge if the patient's household earns over a certain amount, about £30,000 per annum.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} period the Mahdi's family became wealthy from cotton {{production}} based on irrigation and migrant laborers, mainly their Baggara followers from Darfur and Kordofan. These western tribes {{had been the}} backbone of the original Mahdist movement. The riverine tribes were more inclined to side with the rival Khatmiyya movement. The government supported Abd al-Rahman in these commercial enterprises. Abd al-Rahman's economic activity, and the resulting wide range of contacts with merchants and owners of pump-schemes for irrigating cotton fields, gave him influence among Sudanese engaged in commerce. As of 1 January 1922 the government suspended payment of <b>allowances</b> to Mahdist notables other than the old and those whose movements were restricted. The allowance of Abd al-Rahman was increased somewhat, but only so that he could support old women and other incapable people whose <b>allowances</b> had been stopped.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic <b>allowance.</b> There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special <b>allowance</b> for disability, special tax <b>allowance</b> for pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s <b>allowance,</b> fishermen’s <b>allowance,</b> special <b>allowance</b> for self-employed within agriculture, special <b>allowance</b> for high expenses linked to illness, <b>allowance</b> for payments to individual pension schemes, <b>allowance</b> for travel between home and work, <b>allowance</b> for donations to voluntary organisations, <b>allowance</b> for paid union fees, <b>allowance</b> for home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental <b>allowance</b> for documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|R

50|$|Income tax in Hungary is levied at a {{flat rate}} of 15%. A tax <b>allowance</b> is given through a family <b>allowance</b> (családi adókedvezmény), which {{is equal to}} the <b>allowance</b> multiplied by the number of “beneficiary {{dependent}} children”. For the first children the <b>allowance</b> is HUF 66,670, while the second dependent children the <b>allowance</b> is HUF 100,000, in case of 3 or more children the <b>allowance</b> is HUF 220,000 per beneficiary dependent child. The amount of tax <b>allowance</b> can be split between spouses or life partners.|$|R
5|$|Only {{very small}} <b>allowances</b> {{were made by}} the {{government}} to families of POWs, which was not sufficient to offset the economic difficulties caused.

5|$|After {{the change}} in organisation, Chetham's {{could no longer afford}} to provide {{education}} based on scholarships and other <b>allowances,</b> and began charging fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, opening in 1955. By 1960 the numbers of boys admitted had increased significantly, particularly among day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.|$|E

5|$|Brown's 2000 Spending Review {{outlined}} a major expansion of government spending, particularly {{on health and}} education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3billion in pension <b>allowances,</b> an increase in the child tax credit, and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1billion of support for increases in the child tax credit.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Skeen Committee {{was set up}} {{to examine}} the options for the Indianisation of the Indian Army's officer ranks. As Cariappa {{was one of the most}} senior Indian {{officers}} with about 19 years of service, the committee held several discussions with him. He expressed his displeasure at the treatment of Indian officers in the Army. He stressed the discrimination shown toward Indian officers in terms of appointments, promotions, benefits and <b>allowances</b> to which British officers were entitled but Indians were not.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent.

Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E

50|$|Married Man's <b>allowance</b> was the <b>allowance</b> for {{a legally}} married couple. The <b>allowance</b> was {{given at the}} man's highest rate of tax. During the early 1990s the then Chancellor Norman Lamont {{overhauled}} the <b>allowance</b> and introduced the 10% <b>allowance,</b> which meant that all men had {{the same amount of}} money in their pocket, irrespective of highest tax rate. The <b>allowance</b> was scrapped from April 2000, first being announced in Gordon Brown's 1999 budget, with the exception of people married or in civil partnerships where one spouse was born before 6 April 1935.|$|R
5|$|Louis {{brought his}} wife and queen, Marie Joséphine, from {{mainland}} Europe in 1808. Louis's stay at Gosfield Hall did not last long; he soon moved to Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire, where over one hundred courtiers were housed. The King paid £500 in rent each year to the proprietor, Sir George Lee. The Prince of Wales (the future George IV of Great Britain) was very charitable to the exiled Bourbons. As Prince Regent, he granted them permanent right of asylum and extremely generous <b>allowances.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 1987, the Australian Cabinet {{approved}} the final design: Kockums' Type471 submarine, fitted with the Rockwell system. The contract {{for construction of}} six submarines was signed on 3 June and valued at A$3.9 billion in 1986 prices, with <b>allowances</b> for inflation and the changing value of the Australian dollar. The submarine acquisition project {{was at the time}} the most expensive project ever undertaken by the Australian Defence Force, but was unseated from this title by the Anzac-class frigate project a few years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{breathing}} gas mixtures {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the maximum depth and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the time spent at each depth.

5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads <b>allowances</b> were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road <b>allowances</b> were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
5|$|Douglas and Jean MacArthur {{spent their}} last years {{together}} in the penthouse of the Waldorf Towers, {{a part of the}} Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He was elected {{chairman of the board of}} Remington Rand. In that year, he earned a salary of $68,000 (equivalent to $612,000 in 2016), in addition to $20,000 pay and <b>allowances</b> as a General of the Army. The Waldorf became the setting for an annual birthday party on 26 January thrown by the general's former deputy chief engineer, Major General Leif J. Sverdrup. At the 1960 celebration for MacArthur's 80th birthday, many of his friends were startled by the general's obviously deteriorating health. The next day, he collapsed and was rushed into surgery at St. Luke's Hospital to control a severely swollen prostate.|$|E
5|$|In addition, at {{some time}} between {{the date of the}} writ of {{election}} and 12:00 noon on nomination day, the potential candidate or someone on his or her behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8% of the total <b>allowances</b> payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500. At the 2017 presidential election, the deposit was $43,500. The deposit is returned if the person is not nominated as a candidate, withdraws his or her candidature, or is eventually elected. If the candidate is unsuccessful at the election, the deposit is only repaid if he or she polled more than one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled, not including rejected votes.|$|E
30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation for takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the <b>allowance</b> allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the <b>allowance</b> on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % <b>allowance</b> through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> for free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> for the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> for the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> for the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> for the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free for the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R
