It became American Fly Tyer, then <b>American</b> <b>Angler</b> & Fly Tyer, and finally <b>American</b> <b>Angler.</b> In 1990, under more successful business management, the magazine increased to a bimonthly (six issues a year) printing schedule.|$|R

Norris set about defining the gentle <b>American</b> <b>angler</b> by using negation and denial to slip past ambiguities; the lion's share of his introduction was devoted to a homily filled with proscriptions.

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, <b>American</b> <b>anglers,</b> such as Theodore Gordon in the Catskill Mountains of New York, began using fly tackle to fish the region’s brook trout-rich streams {{such as the}} Beaverkill and Willowemoc Creek. Many of these early <b>American</b> fly <b>anglers</b> also {{developed}} new fly patterns and wrote extensively about their sport, increasing the popularity of fly fishing {{in the region and}} in the United States as a whole. Albert Bigelow Paine, a New England author, wrote about fly fishing in The Tent Dwellers, a book about a three-week trip he and a friend took to central Nova Scotia in 1908.|$|R
50|$|Fly Tyer {{was started}} in 1978. It was relaunched as a {{quarterly}} magazine by Abenaki Publishers in 1995, {{when it became clear}} that the market would support a fly-tying specific publication.

Stewart chose a title that reflected a commitment to the average American fly fisher." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In a {{memorial}} piece written for Fly Tyer, Dick Stewart described Dick Surette, the founding publisher, as 'democratic to a fault, publishing articles submitted by professional and amateur alike.'

50|$|Grey left Australia on 19 August {{claiming}} {{it was the}} greatest country he had visited. He reportedly offered Nola Warren a film contract and announced he would return in 1938 to make another film.
