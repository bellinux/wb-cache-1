25|$|The Dalai Lama, Kalu Rinpoche, {{and others}} have stated that the public {{exposition}} of this tantra is necessary in the current degenerate age.

25|$|After the Torah reading, three {{prayers for}} the {{community}} are recited.

25|$|Another {{divisive}} {{issue was}} that of Ireland's relationship with Britain. The United Irishmen from the onset sought a fully independent and representative parliament for Ireland free from the interference of the British establishment, however retaining the Union of Crowns—ideals that followed those of the Patriot Party. Some such as Tone however thought that complete separation would be <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>for</b> Ireland, yet refrained from mentioning anything of the sort in the society's resolutions. The silence Tone showed at this time on the issue was no doubt shared by others, yet {{there were those who}} opposed such an idea. By the time the society had resolved to establishing an all out republic and instigated the Irish Rebellion of 1798 to achieve it, there were still members who sought the retention of a shared monarch as long as Ireland had a free parliament.|$|E

Reich feels it is a less than perfect jazz music venue because of its [...] "cavernous" [...] size and high rental cost ($4,750 in 2008, plus costs for stagehands). Nonetheless, Delacoma describes it as [...] "an astonishingly beautiful place to listen to music. Its acoustics cradle sound like a velvet-lined jewel box." ...|$|E
500|$|Zduhaći were {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>for</b> their home and village, as guardians of the prosperity and well-being of their region, and as good, honest, just, and law-obeying people.

However, a zduhać could ally himself with the Devil, and use his innate power {{in accordance with the}} Devil's directions. That zduhać was doomed to turn into a vampire, unless he confessed and repented. Some influential historical persons were believed to have been zduhaći, such as warrior and writer Marko Miljanov, and Petar I Petrović-Njegoš, who was the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro from 1784 to 1830.|$|E
500|$|... "White" [...] {{is derived}} from an Old English word meaning clean or pure, and the village of Whitwell {{is likely to take}} its name from a well or spring with a {{reliable}} supply of fresh water. The original White Well, located towards {{the south end of the}} village was once a place of veneration as a 'holy well' and a site of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages. The waters of the well were believed to contain healing powers for the infirm. The tradition of Well Dressing was started and now occurs annually at the site of the well.

25|$|One <b>blessing</b> over <b>a</b> {{particular}} food {{is sufficient}} for the entire meal and {{does not need to}} be repeated. A communal meal only needs one set of blessings for the entire group, but individuals dining together (albeit not as a group) must say the blessings individually. The food of primary importance is the one which <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> is said <b>for.</b> However, if one is eating <b>a</b> sandwich, the <b>blessing</b> <b>for</b> the bread would be said rather than the <b>blessing</b> <b>for</b> the sandwich's contents, since bread is never considered being of secondary importance. One who drinks water should make <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> over the water with the pie blessing.|$|R

Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it."

2500|$|A.J. Jacobs of Entertainment Weekly did {{not enjoy}} the book's more [...] "meta" [...] conceits, and gives the novel a 'C'.

2500|$|When Abudirham {{wrote his}} book on the liturgy, the Sephardim were still {{faithful}} to the Talmudic rule that [...] "a man must not ask for his worldly necessities" [...] {{in the first three}} benedictions; hence Abudirham distinguishes the additional service for the Eighth of the Feast only by having the reader proclaim [...] "He causeth the wind," [...] etc., before the silent prayer. But the modern Sephardic service-books give a poetic prayer after [...] "Shield of Abraham," [...] and another which leads up to the distinctive words of the season; these words being added: [...] "For <b>a</b> <b>blessing,</b> <b>for</b> grace, for joy," [...] etc.|$|E
