It is a facsimile of the Sun temple of Konark, Orissa <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>this</b> sun temple is one among the significant pilgrimage centres in Gwalior. The temple {{is located in a}} serene ambiance and a well-maintained garden within the temple premises is very attractive.

It makes one astounded that a shrine of comparatively modern origin is held in such high regard, and became one among the most sought after pilgrimage centres in the city.|$|E

500|$|After the 1814 battle, George Armistead took {{possession}} of the large flag, and {{after his death in}} 1818 his widow, Louisa Hughes Armistead, kept it. [...] During her four decades of ownership, she allowed it to be displayed on a few occasions, and also removed pieces of it to be given as gifts, a common practice of the day. [...] Following her death in 1861 the flag went to her daughter, Georgiana Armistead Appleton, and then later to her grandson, Eben Appleton. [...] The flag was moved to various locations over a 40-year period until 1907 when Eben Appleton loaned it to the Smithsonian. [...] In 1912 the loan became permanent, and the flag underwent a variety of restorations. [...] Beginning in December 1998, the flag began an $18 million conservation treatment (not a restoration) <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>this</b> flag that was hand crafted by Pickersgill and her helpers in 1813 {{is one of the most}} important artifacts, and the centerpiece of the redesigned National Museum of American History.|$|E

2500|$|But as the {{prominent}} theologian at the Council Karl Rahner pointed out, by the 1960s the Church had made its second major transition. The first had been from Jewish to Western-Gentile. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>this</b> Western church {{had become a}} world church. With Vatican II's decision to allow the liturgy in the vernacular, not everything would be so [...] "Roman" [...] anymore. The word [...] "Roman" [...] would be used mainly to designate the liturgy in Latin with its Roman origins. And by fifty years after Vatican II, with only {{one third of the}} Catholic church's 1.2 billion members living in the Western world, the large contingent of the hierarchy from the non-Western world was making it truly a world church.|$|E
2500|$|In Moltmann's opinion, {{all should}} be seen from an eschatological perspective, looking toward the days when Christ will make all things new. [...] "A proper {{theology}} would therefore have to be constructed {{in the light of}} its future goal. Eschatology should not be its end, but its beginning." [...] This does not, as many fear, 'remove happiness from the present' by focusing all ones attention toward the hope for Christ's return. Moltmann addresses this concern as such: [...] "Does this hope cheat man of the happiness of the present? How could it do so! For it is itself the happiness of the present." [...] The importance of the current times is necessary for the Theology of Hope because it brings the future events to the here <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> <b>This</b> theological perspective of eschatology makes the hope of the future, the hope of today.|$|E

2500|$|The {{staff at}} Variety {{magazine}} gave the film a mixed review and wrote {{that it was}} over the top: [...] "To Live and Die in L.A. looks like a rich man's Miami Vice. William Friedkin's evident attempt to fashion a West Coast equivalent of his 1971 The French Connection is engrossing and diverting enough on a moment-to-moment basis but is overtooled ... Friedkin keeps dialog to a minimum, but what conversation there is proves wildly overloaded with streetwise obscenities, {{so much so that}} it becomes something of a joke". Another mixed review came from Janet Maslin in The New York Times, who wrote [...] "On its own terms, it's a considerable success, though it's a film that sacrifices everything in the interests of style." [...] In his scathing review for the Washington Post, Paul Attanasio wrote, [...] "To Live and Die in L.A. will live briefly and die quickly in L.A., where God hath no wrath like a studio executive with bad grosses. Then again, perhaps it's unfair to hold this overheated and recklessly violent movie to the high standard established by Starsky and Hutch". Jay Scott, in his review for the Globe and Mail, wrote, [...] "Pity poor Los Angeles: first the San Andreas fault <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>this.</b> The thing about it is, To Live and Die in L.A., for all its amorality and downright immorality, is a cracker-jack thriller, tense and exciting and unpredictable, and more grimy fun than any moralist will want it to be". Time criticized its [...] "brutal, bloated car-chase sequence pilfered from Friedkin's nifty The French Connection", and called it [...] "a fetid movie hybrid: Miami Vile".|$|E
