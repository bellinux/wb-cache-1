Profanities pop like a string of firecrackers in Mr. Vavrek's libretto, yet its poetry is indelible and affecting. Mr. Little responded with music of emotional insight and charm, suggesting pop-music modes at times without ever resorting to pastiche. Harsh, <b>angular</b> lines and <b>abrasive</b> textures cede to wistful melodies and touches of hymnody; unorthodox instrumental techniques enhance mood without distracting."

40|$|Abstract—Materials {{added to}} the matrix help {{improving}} operating properties of a composite. This experimental study has targeted to investigate this aim where Silicon Oxide particles were added to glass fibre and epoxy resin at an amount of 15 % to the main material to obtain a sort of new composite material. Erosive wear behavior of epoxy-resin dipped composite materials reinforced with glass fibre and Silicon Oxide under three different impingement angles (30 °, 60 ° and 90 °), three different impact velocities (23, 34 and 53 m/s), two different <b>angular</b> Aluminum <b>abrasive</b> particle sizes (approximately 200 and 400 μm) and the fibre orientation of 45 ° (45 /- 45) were investigated. In the test results, erosion rates were obtained as functions of impingement angles, impact velocities, particle sizes and fibre orientation. Moreover, materials with addition of Silicon Oxide filler material exhibited lower wear as compared to neat materials with no added filler material. In addition, SEM views showing worn out surfaces of the test specimens were scrutinized. Keywords—Erosive wear, fibre orientation, GF/EP, silicon oxid...|$|R
40|$|Smallbodies such as asteroids and Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos have {{relatively}} unknown regolith environments. It is hypothesized that dust {{preserved in the}} regolith on the surfaces will have similar mechanical properties to lunar dust because of similar formation processes from micrometeorite bombardment, low relative gravity for slow settling times, and virtually no weathering {{because there is no}} atmosphere. This combination of processes infers that smallbody dust particles will be highly <b>angular</b> and retain <b>abrasive</b> properties. The focus of this paper uses the mission architecture and engineering design for an asteroid hopper known as Hedgehog, a spherical spacecraft with several symmetric spikes used to aid with tumbling mobility in a low gravity environment. Dust abrasion considerations are highlighted throughout the paper relating to the lead authors' previous work, but act as an example of one of many important dust or regolith physical properties that need to be considered for future exploration. Measurable regolith properties are summarized in order to identify technologies that may be useful for exploration in terms of scientific return and spacecraft design. Previous instruments are summarized in this paper that could be used on the Hedgehog. Opportunities for hardware payloads are highlighted that include low mass solutions or dualpurpose instruments that can measure regolith or dust properties. Finally, dust mitigation suggestions are made for vehicles of this mobility profile...|$|R
