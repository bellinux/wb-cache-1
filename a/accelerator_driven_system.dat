40|$|The <b>accelerator</b> <b>driven</b> <b>system</b> is an {{innovative}} reactor {{which is being}} considered as a dedicated high-level waste burner. The function of the spallation target in <b>accelerator</b> <b>driven</b> <b>system</b> is to convert the incident high-energy particle beam to low-energy neutrons. One of the quantities of most interest for practical purposes {{is the number of}} neutrons produced per proton in a spallation target. However, this vital value depends not only on the material, but {{on the size of the}} target as well, due to the internuclear cascade. The MCNPX 2. 4 code can be used for spallation target computation. Some benchmark results have been compared with MCNPX 2. 4 simulations to verify the code's potential for calculating various parameters of an <b>accelerator</b> <b>driven</b> <b>system</b> target. Using the computation method, neutron interaction processes such as loss, capture and (n, xn) into a spallation target have been studied for W, Ta, Pb, Bi, and LBE spallation targets in different target dimensions. With relative errors less than 10 %, the numerical simulation provided by the MCNPX code agrees qualitatively with other simulation results previously carried out, qualifying it for spallation calculations. Among the studied targets, W and Ta targets resulted in a higher neutron spallation yield using lesser target dimensions. Pb, Bi, and LBE spallation targets behave similarly regarding the accessible leaked neutron yield on the outer surface of the spallation target. By use of a thicker target, LBE can compete with both W and Ta targets regarding the neutron yield parameter...|$|E
