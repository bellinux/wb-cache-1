2500|$|To see David Campese in seven-a-side {{play was}} another delight. The {{abbreviated}} version {{seemed to be}} made for him. Of course it was invented near my home area of the Scottish border country at Melrose and there was massive interest in the appearance of David Campese in a Randwick squad who were special guests in 1990 at the ‘Blue Riband’ of the spring sevens series, the Melrose tournament. Came the day and the rain simply teemed down on a pitch that was treacherous to say the least. The local players rubbed their hands in gleeful anticipation. Here was the weather and ground conditions to which they were accustomed and in which they could revel. Such hazardous conditions would cut the famous Wallaby down to size. The Borderers would show the great man how it should be done. Some hope! He was the star of the show, the tournament’s top try-scorer and points-scorer with 44 of Randwick’s 92 points. Not only that but he was like a duck in water, completely at home, fizzing about in the ‘glaur’, the Border name for cloying mud, as to the manner born. He had been preparing himself for water sports having previously asked that his Melrose billet should have a swimming pool! He saved Randwick from semi-final defeat with a typical touch of Campese magic. Randwick were 15-12 in arrears to Melrose with time almost up when he received the ball at halfway and took off like an inebriated skater. Some metres short of the goal line he produced a dive that would have dome credit to an Olympic swimmer and slithered his way to a momentous try that took Randwick to the final in which they beat the renowned sevens artistes from Kelso who included the famous ‘White Shark’, John Jeffrey. David admitted afterwards that he was grateful for the rain and mud: ‘I wouldn’t have scored that try on a dry day because I {{would not have been able}} to <b>aquaplane</b> into the corner.’ ...|$|E

You stand on a board, holding the rope, and the boat tows you along. And {{every now and then}} you lose your grip on the rope and plunge into the sea and have to swim to your board again.|$|E
50|$|There is no precise {{equation}} {{to determine}} {{the speed at which}} a vehicle will <b>aquaplane.</b> Existing efforts have derived rules of thumb from empirical testing. In general, cars <b>aquaplane</b> at speeds around 45-58 mph (72-93 kph).|$|E
50|$|<b>Aquaplaning</b> is a {{condition}} that can exist when an aircraft is landed on a runway surface contaminated with standing water, slush, and/or wet snow. <b>Aquaplaning</b> can have serious adverse effects on ground controllability and braking efficiency. The three basic types of <b>aquaplaning</b> are dynamic <b>aquaplaning,</b> reverted rubber <b>aquaplaning,</b> and viscous <b>aquaplaning.</b> Any {{one of the three}} can render an aircraft partially or totally uncontrollable anytime during the landing roll.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Future {{active safety}} systems will require more {{accurate}} information {{about the state of}} a vehicle and the operating conditions of an individual tyre. <b>Aquaplaning</b> is a dangerous situation in which the contact between the tyre and the road is partially or completely lost. In this paper, the movements of the inner liner of the tyre during <b>aquaplaning</b> are measured optically and exploited to estimate <b>aquaplaning.</b> The results from proving-ground tests are shown and compared with those of the conventional approach of estimating <b>aquaplaning</b> from wheel speeds. The proposed method performs reliably in real time and can detect several different levels of <b>aquaplaning.</b> The results support the future development of production-capable tyre sensors. An optical tyre sensor also provides a research tool for attaining an in-depth understanding of the <b>aquaplaning</b> phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented in this report has been to develop a numerical method for the investigation of water-lubricated soft elastohydrodynamic (EHD) conjunctions {{as it relates to}} the problem of car tyre <b>aquaplaning.</b> Whereas the problem of <b>aquaplaning</b> on very thick water films is very well-studied, the aspects of a tyre sliding on thin water layer is much less investigated. Considering fluid flow in very thin layers, one can find that the relative importance of viscosity of the fluid increases over the mass inertia effects. Therefore it is suggested in the present investigation to distinct between two different regimes of <b>aquaplaning</b> and refer them as dynamic <b>aquaplaning</b> and viscous <b>aquaplaning.</b> The subject of the present investigation is viscous <b>aquaplaning</b> on thin fluid layer. Considering flow in a thin fluid layer allows a number assumptions to be made, which brings this problem close to the problem of fluid lubrication of machine elements. This makes it possible to apply advanced numerical methods originally developed for the lubrication theory to the <b>aquaplaning</b> of a pneumatic car tyre on a thin layer of water. Numerical results were produced for 20, 40, 60, 120, and 200 km/h. No fluid films were detected separating the surfaces in this range of velocities...|$|R

50|$|The best {{strategy}} is to avoid contributors to <b>aquaplaning.</b> Proper tire pressure, narrow and unworn tires, and reduced speeds from those judged suitably moderate in the dry will mitigate the risk of <b>aquaplaning,</b> as will avoidance of standing water.|$|R
40|$|Vehicle tire <b>aquaplaning</b> is a {{dangerous}} phenomenon, characterized in its hydrodynamic form by the tire to ground separation and the cancellation of steering or braking control possibilities. Its occurence is generally suspected only for high speeds in presence of water but the phenomenon can appear for rather low speeds. This work aim is to characterize <b>aquaplaning</b> occurence. Tests was carried out on a LCPC track comprising a water retention zone. An instrumented vehicle equipped with worn tires rolled through this zone for different stabilized speeds. As relevant indicators of the <b>aquaplaning</b> occurence we retained the rotation rates and forces of the traction wheels. At low speed, the wheel transmission moments increase while through the puddles because of the water hydrodynamic reaction. Conversely, starting from {{the realization of the}} process of <b>aquaplaning</b> these moments decrease whereas the rotation rates of the driving wheels increase simultaneously. With under-inflated tires the critical speed of <b>aquaplaning</b> was lowered to approximately 19 m/s while it is increased to more than 30 m/s in the event of over-inflation. Finally, phenomenon parameter have been verified by developing a visco-hydrodynamic model. The overall study confirms the risk of <b>aquaplaning</b> at low speed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Aquaplaning</b> or {{hydroplaning}} by {{the tires}} {{of a road}} vehicle, aircraft or other wheeled vehicle occurs when a layer of water builds between {{the wheels of the}} vehicle and the road surface, leading to a loss of traction that prevents the vehicle from responding to control inputs. If it occurs to all wheels simultaneously, the vehicle becomes, in effect, an uncontrolled sled. <b>Aquaplaning</b> is a different phenomenon from when water {{on the surface of the}} roadway merely acts as a lubricant. Traction is diminished on wet pavement even when <b>aquaplaning</b> is not occurring.|$|R

40|$|The tread of a tyre {{consists}} of a profile (pattern of grooves, sipes, and blocks) mainly designed to improve wet performance and inhibit <b>aquaplaning</b> by providing a conduit for water to be expelled underneath the tyre as it makes contact with the road surface. Testing different tread profile designs is time consuming, as it requires fabrication and physical measurement of tyres. We propose a supervised machine learning method to predict tyres’ <b>aquaplaning</b> performance based on the tread profile described in geometry and rubber stiffness. Our method provides a regressor from the space of profile geometry, reduced to images, to <b>aquaplaning</b> performance. Experimental results demonstrate that image analysis and machine learning combined with other methods can yield improved prediction of <b>aquaplaning</b> performance, even using non-normalised data. Therefore this method has can potentially save substantial cost and time in tyre development. This investigation is based on data provided by Continental Reifen Deutschland GmbH...|$|R
50|$|If {{the rear}} wheels <b>aquaplane</b> and cause oversteer, the driver should steer in the {{direction}} of the skid until the rear tires regain traction, and then rapidly steer in the other direction to straighten the car.|$|E
50|$|If {{the drive}} wheels <b>aquaplane,</b> {{there may be}} a sudden audible rise in engine RPM and {{indicated}} speed as they begin to spin. In a broad highway turn, if the front wheels lose traction, the car will suddenly drift towards the outside of the bend. If the rear wheels lose traction, {{the back of the car}} will slew out sideways into a skid. If all four wheels <b>aquaplane</b> at once, the car will slide in a straight line, again towards the outside of the bend if in a turn. When any or all of the wheels regain traction, {{there may be a}} sudden jerk in whatever direction that wheel is pointed.|$|E
5000|$|Vehicle type: Combination {{vehicles}} like semi-trailers {{are more}} likely to experience uneven aquaplaning caused by uneven weight distribution. An unloaded trailer will <b>aquaplane</b> sooner than the cab pulling it. Pickup trucks or SUVs towing trailers also present similar problems.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic <b>aquaplaning</b> is a {{relatively}} high-speed phenomenon that occurs {{when there is a}} film of water on the runway that is at least 1/10 inch (2.5 mm) deep. As the speed of the aircraft and the depth of the water increase, the water layer builds up an increasing resistance to displacement, resulting in the formation of a wedge of water beneath the tire. At some speed, termed the <b>aquaplaning</b> speed (Vp), the upward force generated by water pressure equals the weight of the aircraft and the tire is lifted off the runway surface. In this condition, the tires no longer contribute to directional control, and braking action is nil. Dynamic <b>aquaplaning</b> is generally related to tire inflation pressure. Tests have shown that for tires with significant loads and enough water depth for the amount of tread so that the dynamic head pressure from the speed is applied to the whole contact patch, the minimum speed for dynamic <b>aquaplaning</b> (Vp) in knots is about 9 times the square root of the tire pressure in pounds per square inch (PSI). For an aircraft tire pressure of 64 PSI, the calculated <b>aquaplaning</b> speed would be approximately 72 knots. This speed is for a rolling, non-slipping wheel; a locked wheel reduces the Vp to 7.7 times the square root of the pressure. Therefore, once a locked tire starts <b>aquaplaning</b> it will continue until the speed reduces by other means (air drag or reverse thrust).|$|R
50|$|<b>Aquaplaning</b> {{may reduce}} the {{effectiveness}} of wheel braking in aircraft on landing or aborting a takeoff, when it can cause the aircraft to run {{off the end of}} the runway. <b>Aquaplaning</b> was a factor in an accident to Qantas Flight 1 when it ran off the end of the runway in Bangkok in 1999 during heavy rain. Aircraft which can employ reverse thrust braking have the advantage over road vehicles in such situations, as this type of braking is not affected by <b>aquaplaning,</b> but it requires a considerable distance to operate as it is not as effective as wheel braking on a dry runway.|$|R
50|$|Reverted rubber (steam) <b>aquaplaning</b> {{occurs during}} heavy braking {{that results in}} a {{prolonged}} locked-wheel skid. Only a thin film {{of water on the}} runway is required to facilitate this type of <b>aquaplaning.</b> The tire skidding generates enough heat to change the water film into a cushion of steam which keeps the tire off the runway. A side effect of the heat is it causes the rubber in contact with the runway to revert to its original uncured state. Indications of an aircraft having experienced reverted rubber <b>aquaplaning,</b> are distinctive 'steam-cleaned' marks on the runway surface and a patch of reverted rubber on the tire.|$|R

50|$|Aquaplaning is {{a surface}} water sport which {{involves}} riding a board (<b>aquaplane)</b> {{over the surface}} of a body of water towed behind a motorboat.

50|$|When {{confronted with}} the {{possibility}} of <b>aquaplaning,</b> pilots are advised to land on a grooved runway (if available). Touchdown speed should be as slow as possible consistent with safety. After the nosewheel is lowered to the runway, moderate braking should be applied. If deceleration is not detected and <b>aquaplaning</b> is suspected, the nose should be raised and aerodynamic drag utilized to decelerate to a point where the brakes do become effective.|$|R

50|$|However {{this can}} be {{prevented}} by grooves on runways. In 1965, a US delegation visited the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough to view their grooved runway for reduced aquaplaning and initiated {{a study by the}} FAA and NASA. Grooving has since been adopted by most major airports around the world. Thin grooves are cut in the concrete which allows for water to be dissipated and further reduces the potential to <b>aquaplane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Viscous {{aquaplaning}} {{is due to}} the viscous {{properties of}} water. A thin film of fluid no more than 0.025 mm in depth is all that is needed. The tire cannot penetrate the fluid and the tire rolls on top of the film. This can occur at a much lower speed than dynamic <b>aquaplane,</b> but requires a smooth or smooth-acting surface such as asphalt or a touchdown area coated with the accumulated rubber of past landings. Such a surface can have the same friction coefficient as wet ice.|$|E
