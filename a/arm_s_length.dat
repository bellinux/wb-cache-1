40|$|<b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> is an idiomatic English phrase {{which refers}} to a metaphor that uses the human body as a measure. The hand is not {{directly}} joined to the body, it maintains an undeniable distance from the body, equivalent {{to the length of}} an arm. In this sense, the metaphorical meaning of being at <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> means to be at a certain distance, not too close and not too far away. The expression is often used in contract law, and a contract concluded between parties at <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> will ensure that the parties are independent and on equal footing when concluding the agreement. The National Credit Act applies to every credit agreement between parties dealing at <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length.</b> <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> is a novel concept in the South African credit vocabulary and not defined in the Act.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three chapters. In Chapter I (Price Caps with Capacity Precommitment), we study the effectiveness of price cap regulation in a monopolistic setting under demand uncertainty. In our model, a monopolist facing an uncertain demand. In the absence of capacity precommitment, price caps remain an effective regulatory instrument, {{just as they are}} when demand is deterministic. Price caps are also an effective instrument to regulate a monopoly that makes irreversible capacity investments ex-ante, and then chooses its output up to capacity upon observing the realization of demand. In this scenario, however, the optimal price cap must trade off the incentives for capacity investment and capacity withholding, is well above the unit cost of capacity and, when the unit cost of capacity is low, is below the price cap that maximizes capacity. Moreover, a price cap alone cannot eliminate inefficiencies. Under standard regularity assumptions on the demand distribution, the comparative static properties of price caps above the optimal price cap are analogous to those they have in the absence of capacity precommitment. The Chapter II and Chapter III are aimed at analyzing the competitive consequences of imposition of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle (ALP, henceforth) requirements for international transfer pricing. In order to discourage tax shifting activities by multinational fi rms, most countries follow taxation policies that are based on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, which recommend that, for tax purposes, internal pricing policies be consistent with ALP (i. e., that transfer prices between companies of multinational enterprises for tax purposes be established on a market value basis, thus comparable to transactions between independent, unrelated, parties). Moreover, ALP puts associated and independent enterprises on a more equal footing for tax purposes, it avoids the creation of tax advantages that would otherwise distort the relative competitive positions of either type of entity. The failure to comply with the ALP may result in a penalty. The OECD s recommendation that transfer prices between parent firms and their subsidiaries be consistent with the ALP for tax purposes does not restrict internal pricing policies. In Chapter II (Strategic Incentives for Keeping One Set of Books under the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle), we show that under imperfect competition parent rms accounting policies determine the properties of market outcomes: if parents keep one set of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices are consistent with the ALP), then competition in the external (home) market softens (intensi es) relative to an equilibrium where parent fi rms and subsidiaries are integrated. In contrast, if rms keep two sets of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices differ from those used for tax purposes) or maintain asymmetric accounting policies, then competition intensi es in both markets. Keeping one set of books turns out to be an equilibrium for most of the parameter space. In Chapter III (The Non-Neutrality of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle with Imperfect Competition), we show that under imperfect competition the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle is non-neutral: a strict (lax) application of the ALP softens competition among subsidiaries (parents). Thus, under imperfect competition regulating transfer pricing optimally requires trading off its impact on market outcomes and tax revenue...|$|E
40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that firm s investment depend on future growth opportunities, measured for example by price-earnings ratios, but might be dampened by inefficient financial markets. This paper tests these hypotheses using an unbalanced panel of 9, 000 listed firms from 41 developed and developing markets, from 1990 to 2006. The empirical results confirm that managers use {{the information contained in}} the price-earnings ratios to make investment decisions. Moreover, stock market development and the specialization of the financial system towards <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> instead of bank financing has a positive effect on firms investment decisions. Taken together, these results suggest that firms with higher growth opportunities accumulate more capital and that the stock market has a key role in channelling funds toward investment projects. filomena. pietrovito@unimol. i...|$|E

40|$|Many studies into {{construction}} procurement methods reveal {{evidence of}} a {{need to change the}} culture and attitude in the construction industry, transition from traditional adversarial relationships to cooperative and collaborative relationships. At the same time there is also increasing concern and discussion on alternative procurement methods, involving a movement away from traditional procurement systems. Relational contracting approaches, such as partnering and relationship management, are business strategies that align the objectives of clients, commercial participants and stakeholders. It provides a collaborative environment and a framework for all participants to adapt their behaviour to project objectives and allows for engagement of those subcontractors and suppliers down the supply chain. The efficacy of relationship management in the client and contractor groups is proven and well documented. However, the industry has a history of slow implementation of relational contracting down the supply chain. Furthermore, there exists little research on relationship management conducted in the supply chain context. This research aims to explore the association between relational contracting structures and processes and supply chain sustainability in the civil engineering construction industry. It endeavours to shed light on the practices and prerequisites for relationship management implementation success and for supply sustainability to develop. The research methodology is a triangulated approach based on Cheung. s (2006) earlier research where questionnaire survey, interviews and case studies were conducted. This new research includes a face-to-face questionnaire survey that was carried out with 100 professionals from 27 contracting organisations in Queensland from June 2008 to January 2009. A follow-up survey sub-questionnaire, further examining project participants. perspectives was sent to another group of professionals (as identified in the main questionnaire survey). Statistical analysis including multiple regression, correlation, principal component factor analysis and analysis of variance were used to identify the underlying dimensions and test the relationships among variables. Interviews and case studies were conducted to assist in providing a deeper understanding as well as explaining findings of the quantitative study. The qualitative approaches also gave the opportunity to critique and validate the research findings. This research presents the implementation of relationship management from the contractor. s perspective. Findings show that the adaption of relational contracting approach in the supply chain is found to be limited; contractors still prefer to keep the suppliers and subcontractors at <b>arm.</b> <b>s</b> <b>length.</b> This research shows that the degree of match and mismatch between organisational structuring and organisational process has an impact on staff. s commitment level and performance effectiveness. Key issues affecting performance effectiveness and relationship effectiveness include total influence between parties, access to information, personal acquaintance, communication process, risk identification, timely problem solving and commercial framework.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{subjective}} straight-ahead {{direction is}} a very basic perceptual reference for spatial orientation and locomotion. The perceived straight-ahead along the horizontal and vertical meridian is largely determined by both otolith and somatosensory inputs which are altered in microgravity. The Straight Ahead in Microgravity (SAM) experiment will be conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) to examine how this spatial processing changes {{as a function of}} spaceflight. METHODS Data will be collected before the flight, at one-month intervals during long-duration stay (180 days) on board ISS, and after return to Earth. Control studies will also be performed during parabolic flights. Three different protocols will be used in each test session: (1) Fixation: The subject will be asked to look at actual targets (normal vision) and then to imagine these same targets (occluded vision) in the straight-ahead direction. Targets will be located at near distance (<b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length,</b> ~ 0. 5 m), medium distance (~ 1 m), and far distance (beyond 2 m). This task will be successively performed with subject s body aligned with the spacecraft interior, and with subject s body tilted forward and backward by an operator. (2) Saccades: The subject will be asked to make horizontal and vertical saccades, first relative to the spacecraft interior reference system, and then relative to the subject s head reference system. This task will be successively performed with subject s body aligned with the spacecraft interior, and with subject s body tilted in roll or in pitch by an operator. (3) Linear Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) : The subject will be asked to stare at actual visual targets (normal vision) at various distances (near, medium, far) in the straight-ahead direction. Vision will then be occluded, and the subject will be asked to continue staring at the same imagined targets while he/she is passively translated forward-backward, up-down, or side-to-side. The subject's body motion will be performed by the restrained operator while the subject is free-floating. EXPECTED RESULTS The coupling of downward gaze with vergence eye movements observed on Earth is expected to increase in microgravity. Saccadic eye movements made in darkness along perceived axes are expected to be more closely aligned with the body s longitudinal axis in 0 g compared to 1 g, as the reference system for spatial orientation moves from an allocentric (gravitational) to an egocentric (idiotropic) vector. Changes in the linear VOR will reflect adaptive changes in otolith-ocular reflex contributions to the perceived straight-ahead. DISCUSSION A change in an individual's egocentric reference might have negative consequences on evaluating the direction of an approaching object or on the accuracy of reaching movements or locomotion. Consequently, investigating how microgravity affects the egocenter is important for understanding the problems associated with long-term effects of microgravity on astronauts' and how they re-adapt to the return of gravitational forces on Earth or other planetary surfaces.

40|$|Internal signals like one’s heartbeats are {{centrally}} processed via specific pathways {{and both}} their neural representations {{as well as}} their conscious perception (interoception) provide key information for many cognitive processes. Recent empirical findings propose that neural processes in the insular cortex, which are related to bodily signals, might constitute a neurophysiological mechanism for the encoding of duration. Nevertheless, the exact nature of such a proposed relationship remains unclear. We aimed to address this question by searching for the effects of cardiac rhythm on time perception by the use of a duration reproduction paradigm. Time intervals used were of 0. 5, 2, 3, 7, 10, 14, 25, and 40 <b>s</b> <b>length.</b> In a framework of synchronization hypothesis, measures of phase locking between the cardiac cycle and start/stop signals of the reproduction task were calculated to quantify this relationship.

40|$|In recent {{articles}} in the Yale Law Journal and the Stanford Law Review, Professor Lynn M. LoPucki has sparked much academic discussion arguing that recent developments in corporate law have led to an erosion in the system of corporate liability, such that it might one day prove impotent. LoPucki has argued that transactions such as asset securitizations, sale-leasebacks, and corporate structures in which liabilities are placed in asset-poor subsidiaries are driving this change. One early critic to the LoPucki thesis, Professor James J. White, has argued that empirical data show no evidence of increasing use of judgement proofing techniques. In this Article, Professor Steven L. Schwarcz joins this debate, arguing that an economic analysis of these transactions suggests that widespread use of these judgement proofing techniques is unlikely. A key distinction in the analysis, Schwarcz argues, is between arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> and non-arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> transactions. <b>Arm</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> transactions are unlikely to lead to judgement proofing because corporations will receive value [...] often cash [...] for the assets they sell.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (S), a multitargeted {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor, {{is the standard}} of care for first-line systemic treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Everolimus (E) is a potent inhibitor of mTOR, a pathway frequently activated in HCC. Preclinical {{data suggest that the}} combination S + E has additive effects compared with single-agent S. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC and Child-Pugh ≤ 7 liver dysfunction were randomized to receive daily S 800 mg alone or with E 5 mg until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival at 12 weeks (PFS 12). The secondary end points included response rate, PFS, time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), duration of disease stabilization (DDS), safety, and quality-of-life (QoL) assessments. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were randomized: 46 patients received S and 60 patients received S + E. Ninety-three patients were assessable for the primary end point and 105 patients for the safety analysis. The PFS 12 rate was 70 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 54 - 83] and 68 % (95 % CI 53 - 81) in patients randomized to S and S + E, respectively. The RECIST (mRECIST) response rate was 0 % (23 %) in the <b>S</b> <b>arm</b> and 10 % (35 %) in the <b>S</b> + E <b>arm.</b> Median PFS (6. 6 versus 5. 7 months), TTP (7. 6 versus 6. 3 months), DDS (6. 7 versus 6. 7 months), and OS (10 versus 12 months) were similar in the S and <b>S</b> + E <b>arms,</b> respectively. Grade 3 / 4 adverse events occurred in 72 % and 86 % of patients in <b>arm</b> <b>S</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>S</b> + E, respectively.

40|$|The Óbidos Lagoon is {{the largest}} shallow coastal lagoon in Portugal. Like any other {{brackish}} water system, it has been potentially exposed to different sources of contamination (e. g. livestock farming, domestic and industrial sewage).

Also, it is classified as a priority substance according to the European Union Water Frame directive. In this context, a seasonal environmental monitoring program was implemented in the intertidal water margins of the Óbidos Lagoon to assess the presence of Cadmium. In 2009 and 2010, eight sampling stations (S) distributed on the shores of the Óbidos Lagoon were chosen and water and sediments were seasonally collected. In all samples, cadmium concentrations were analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, with Graphite Furnace Technique. Cadmium dissolved in the water samples was only detected during summer months, with the highest values in the Barrosa’s <b>arm</b> (<b>S</b> 3 : 0. 35 mg/l) in 2009, and at the station further downstream (S 1 : 0. 19 mg/l) in 2010.

40|$|An {{opportunistic}} array is {{an integrated}} ship-wide digital phased-array radar, where antenna elements are placed at available open areas {{over the entire}} shipâ <b>s</b> <b>length.</b> Such an array {{has the potential to}} fulfill many of the Navyâ s missions, including ballistic missile defence (BMD) where the radar mission encompasses exo-atmospheric surveillance, tracking and preliminary discrimination. Advantages of opportunistic arrays include enhanced stealth â since low-profile antennas reduce the shipâ s RCS; high angular resolution â as the entire shipâ <b>s</b> <b>length</b> forms the â apertureâ and produces a narrow beamwidth; and potentially lower costs â through the use of COTS technology and a flexible digital antenna architecture that reduces the number of distinct radar systems required. This research first investigated the opportunistic array concept in the context of BMD. A system level tradeoff was performed to size the system and verify that detection ranges greater than 1000 km could be achieved. Next, the research focused on designing a low-profile, broad-band U-slot microstrip patch antenna. Theoretical calculations and parametric studies were performed to develop an antenna element that could operate in the upper VHF/lower UHF frequencies. A set of simple design procedures is proposed to provide approximate rules that result in a good â first-passâ design with prescribed characteristics that require minimal tuning...|$|R

This system is developed on opencv platform using ubuntu as an operating system. This system {{will work in}} two mode auto and manual. In auto mode as soon as pedestrian get detected break will be applied if pedestrian is in high risk area. And for manual mode there is alarm or buzzer will sound to alert driver. This system gives low false positive as well as low false negative rate. This system is low cost system as compare with state of art...|$|R
