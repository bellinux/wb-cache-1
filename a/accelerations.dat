5|$|In {{the case}} of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high <b>accelerations,</b> as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} {{proportionality}} of acceleration to {{force and the}} inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. <b>Accelerations</b> can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E

It {{was found that the}} existing <b>acceleration</b> length will affect truck drivers’ <b>acceleration</b> behavior. At the taper type ramp that has limited <b>acceleration</b> distance, <b>acceleration</b> profile indicated a decreasing trend with distance.

Field data show that the truck <b>acceleration</b> performance data documented in the ITE’s (Institute of Transportation Engineers) “Traffic Engineering Handbook” are much lower than the field collected data. Also, based on the regression analysis of speed versus distance profiles, it was found that the AASHTO’s (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) Green Book <b>acceleration</b> length design guidance is insufficient to accommodate trucks at metered on-ramps.

25|$|In any {{analysis}} of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative <b>accelerations</b> of two bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.5‑1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational {{field of the}} Earth, exhibit tidal <b>accelerations</b> due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal <b>accelerations</b> that these particles exhibit with {{respect to each other}} do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described them in terms of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal <b>accelerations</b> are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the appearance of a gravitational force acting at a long range from Earth.|$|E
