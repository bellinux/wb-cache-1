40|$|Site Specific Crop Management is a {{technique}} by which agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilizer and herbicides are adjusted to match the requirements of specific field areas. Agricultural machines must apply the correct application rate at each field location. One possibility is to add a controller to obtain variable rate capability from conventional metering mechanisms for uniform application. ^ Two control systems for variable rate capability with conventional grain drills were evaluated in this study. Both were operator controlled open loop systems. ^ One system used a set of rate switches. An electric linear actuator moved the meter <b>adjustment</b> <b>lever</b> and contacted limit switches for each rate setting of external fluted wheel meters. The other system used a rheostat to control the speed of an electric motor driving internal fluted wheel meters. ^ Seeding rate and rate change response were determined by operating the drills over a course of artificial turf mats. A four-parameter sigmoid model described the distribution profile. ^ The linear actuator system response time averaged 5. 6 s for a 20 kg/ha rate increase. The response time varied considerably for a 10 kg/ha increase and was inconsistent for decreased rates. ^ For rotary actuation, response times varied from 3 to 9 s depending upon the rate change magnitude. This control system performed well for rate increases and decreases. ^ Finally, theoretical guidelines were developed to characterize the transition area accompanying a change from one application rate to another. Response time was divided into (1) actuation lag and (2) actuator mechanical response. Actuation lag was greater for the linear actuator. Generally, the mechanical response was longer for decreasing rates. For a 10 kg/ha rate change, the 68 % confidence interval lower limit of the final rate overlapped the 68 % confidence interval upper limit of the initial rate. With a 20 kg/ha change, no rate overlap occurred. More variability {{was associated with the}} estimation of the inflection point of the sigmoid curve for 10 kg/ha than for 20 kg/ha. This indicates that the metering systems were less suitable for smaller rate changes. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} redistributive state {{generally}} focuses on the proper trade-offbetween more income equality and more total income. The questions are familiar. What is the optimal distribution of income? How much inequality should a just society accept? How much economic growth should we sacrifice in order to promote the welfare ofthe poor and disadvantaged? Of course, trans-fer programs go well beyond the poor. They are aimed variously at farmers whose crops have failed or whose crops “should ” sell for more, at governments of nations whose people are worthy of aid, at corporations that employ many workers and are in financial trouble, and at innumerable other entities. The proposition that transfer policies promote the welfare of tar-geted groups is generally accepted. Taxes, transfers, and regulatory policies are perceived to be <b>adjustment</b> <b>levers</b> available to fine-tune the economic machine that grinds out goods and services. If we do not like the allocation of economic benefits, corrective action can be undertaken by moving the levers via the political process. We believe this view of the transfer society is naive. Taxpayers and transfer recipients are human beings, not sheep who can be shorn at will, their wool automatically growing back for the next shearing season. People will adjust their actions for individual advantage, in response to governmental changes in the rules of the game. Similarly, since the political process, like the market, results from individual choices, it mayor may notyield its stated goals, Thus, it is not obvious that income transfers emanating from the political process will pro-mote economic equality or even help the targeted groups...|$|R
50|$|The company {{announced}} a hydraulic disc brake {{version of its}} wireless road group called SRAM RED eTap HRD in May 2016. The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both <b>lever</b> reach <b>adjustment</b> and <b>lever</b> contact point <b>adjustment,</b> a first for road disc brakes. In May 2016 SRAM also released their new 1x12 drivetrain technology dubbed Eagle™ in both XX1 and X01 variants. It has received many awards globally {{in its first year}} of public availability from cycling publications due to its simplicity, versatility, and usable rider benefits. The new 1x12 drivetrain has a 500% gear range that is comparable to many 2x drivetrains on the market today. In October 2016 SRAM released the WiFLi version of its eTap rear derailleur to give eTap users wider cassette range options, including compatibility with cassettes with up to a 32-tooth large cog.|$|R

50|$|In August 2015 SRAM Corporation {{announced}} its wireless shifting system, eTap. The system had been extensively developed and secretly tested {{over several years}} from initial design to a stage win in the 2015 Tour de France. The front and rear derailleurs use direct-mount batteries and communicate wirelessly with the shifters through a proprietary wireless protocol developed by SRAM called, Airea (pronounced: area). A set of small satellite shifter buttons, called Blips, can {{be connected to the}} shift levers or aero shift module (BlipBox) and placed anywhere along the handlebars as part of the system. A maximum of four Blips can be used per bike. The company also took the opportunity to introduce a new shifting convention with this system. The right lever shifts the rear derailleur outboard, the left lever shifts the rear derailleur inboard, and pressing both levers together shifts the front derailleur. SRAM made the groupset available for purchase on complete bikes and as aftermarket components sold through dealers from Spring 2016. Eventually, extension of the system is expected to the company's lower group sets, such as SRAM Force. In May 2016 the company announced a hydraulic disc brake version of its wireless road group called SRAM RED eTap HRD. The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both <b>lever</b> reach <b>adjustment</b> and <b>lever</b> contact point <b>adjustment,</b> a first for road disc brakes.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the risk-adjusted performance of Private Equity (PE) investments on {{a sample of}} 133 transactions completed in the United States between 1984 and 2004. The benchmark for the risk <b>adjustment</b> is a <b>levered</b> mimicking strategy of investments in the S&P 500 Index. To set up the strategy, initial and final equity betas of the sample transactions were calculated, based on information usually not available to academic researchers. In calculating the betas, we specify the risk of debt and determine a method for “unlevering ” and “relevering”. We conduct a sensitivity analysis and {{investigate the}} role of debt and operating risk {{on the performance of}} the mimicking strategy. Our results emphasize the necessity of correctly specifying the risk borne by lenders and in assessing PE investment performance. We find superior performance of the Private Equity investments expressed by significant positive Jensen alphas in some cases of the sensitivity analysis. The alphas are large and significant if Private Equity funds structure deals transferring a substantial part of the risk to the lenders. In general, it is not adequate to measure the performance of Private Equity investments without adjusting for leverage risks, nor it is possible to easily track Private Equity investments with public market securities...|$|R
5000|$|In {{this letter}} Becker criticized also the {{incorrect}} {{execution of the}} gassings:The application of gas usually is not undertaken correctly. In order {{to come to an}} end as fast as possible, the driver presses the accelerator to the fullest extent. By doing that the persons to be executed suffer death from suffocation and not death by dozing off as was planned. My directions now have proved that by correct <b>adjustment</b> of the <b>levers</b> death comes faster and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully. Distorted faces and excretions, such as could be seen before, are no longer noticed.Becker continued sending messages to Rauff regarding the efficacious use of the gas vans through the middle of 1942. On 5 June 1942 Becker reported that [...] "for an example, since December 1941, three vehicles were used to process 97,000, with no down-time on the vehicles.". [...] In September 1942, following his return to Berlin, Becker criticized the untidy means by which the murders were carried out to Rauff's deputy Pradel:I described the function of the gas cars to Pradel in an hour long personal discussion and offered criticisms, because the subjects (people to be murdered) were suffocated and not gassed since the operating crew didn't follow proper instructions. I told him that the subjects vomited and defecated upon themselves prior to death instead of falling asleep first. Pradel thoughtfully nodded, without saying a word.|$|R
