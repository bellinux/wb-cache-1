25|$|The {{capital of}} Wallonia is Namur {{but the city}} with the {{greatest}} population is Charleroi. Most of Wallonia's major cities and two-thirds of its population lie along the Sambre and Meuse valley, the former industrial backbone of Belgium. To the north lies the Central Belgian Plateau, which, like Flanders, is relatively flat and agriculturally fertile. In the south-east lie the Ardennes, hilly and sparsely populated. Wallonia borders Flanders and the Netherlands in the north, France to the south <b>and</b> <b>west,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Germany</b> and Luxembourg to the east. Wallonia {{has been a member}} of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie since 1980.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, IUPAC was {{affiliated}} with the Allied powers, but had little involvement during the war effort itself. After the war, East <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> were eventually readmitted to IUPAC. Since World War II, IUPAC {{has been focused on}} standardizing nomenclature and methods in science without interruption.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{to future}} {{development}} aircraft, such as swept wings {{and more powerful}} Pegasus engines, {{led to the development}} of the Kestrel. The Kestrel was evaluated by the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron, made up of military pilots from the United Kingdom, the United States, <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany.</b> Later flights were conducted by the U.S. military and NASA.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Stalin {{repeatedly}} {{proposed a}} plan to unify East <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations if the new Germany were {{to stay out of}} Western military alliances, but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers. Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known fortifications {{might be}} pre-Celtic, but {{they reached a}} high point in terms of size and elaboration around the 6th or 5th century BC. They remained in use until the 2nd or 1st century BC. Their extent and dimensions mark the Glauberg {{as one of a}} network of fortified sites (or oppida) that covered most of south <b>and</b> <b>west</b> central <b>Germany.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Bregenz (...) is {{the capital}} of Vorarlberg, the westernmost federal state of Austria. The city is on the eastern shores of Lake Constance, the third-largest {{freshwater}} lake in Central Europe, between Switzerland in the <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>Germany</b> in the northwest.|$|R
50|$|Jacobus van Deventer {{worked on}} this monumental project {{until his death in}} 1575. In the course of fifteen years, he created between 250 and 260 city maps, {{covering}} an area from Friesland to what is today the north of France, and reaching into Luxembourg <b>and</b> the <b>west</b> of <b>Germany.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Panavia Tornado is {{a family}} of twin-engine, variable-sweep wing multirole combat aircraft, which was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom, <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany.</b> There are three primary Tornado variants: the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) fighter-bomber, the suppression of enemy air defences Tornado ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) and the Tornado ADV (air defence variant) interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|De Gaulle {{decided that}} France, though {{formally}} remaining a member, {{would no longer}} participate in the NATO military organization. This caused a rift between France <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany,</b> which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.|$|E
5|$|EUA, FRG, GDR. For the Games of 1956–1964, Germany participated as a Unified Team (EUA), {{representing}} the National Olympic Committees of both West Germany and East Germany. Retrospectively, the IOC uses the country code EUA for this team. After the NOC for the German Democratic Republic was granted full recognition by the IOC in 1968, East Germany (GDR) <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> (FRG) participated as two distinct teams at the Games of 1968-1988.|$|E
50|$|The entire of {{the area}} enjoys {{protected}} status; the hills in Hesse form part of the Meißner-Kaufungen Forest Nature Park, while those in Lower Saxony belong to the Münden Nature Park. However, {{the southern part of}} the range may be affected by the planned extension of the A44 autobahn from its present end in Kassel to Eisenach. The controversial extension, which has been delayed and rerouted several times on environmental grounds, is part of a national strategy to improve communications between the east <b>and</b> <b>west</b> of <b>Germany,</b> in the wake of reunification.|$|R
50|$|The league {{was formed}} from clubs from six {{different}} leagues: One club from the Oberliga Nordost, the former DDR-Oberliga, fourteen clubs from the NOFV-Liga A and B, the former East German second division, and one each {{from the three}} Verbandsligas, the new state leagues. The league accommodated therefore a wide mix of clubs from the east <b>and</b> <b>west</b> of <b>Germany.</b> Unlike the two other NOFV-Oberligas, it contained no clubs from Berlin, due to geographical reasons, and therefore {{was the only one}} of the three to have no West German clubs in it.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{highways}} in Bellingwedde. The nearest {{highway is}} the A7 (E22) directly {{north of the}} municipality and which is connected to Groningen in the <b>west</b> <b>and</b> Leer (<b>Germany)</b> in the east; its nearest access point is exit 48 (Oudeschans).|$|R
5|$|The exact {{date of the}} war's end is {{also not}} universally agreed upon. It was {{generally}} accepted {{at the time that}} the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945). A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.|$|E
5|$|After the Berlin Wall {{was built}} in 1961, Zoologischer Garten became the West Berlin and Ostbahnhof the East Berlin de facto central station. The station Friedrichstraße now was the {{terminal}} point of the separated West and East Berlin S-Bahn lines and departure point for the Interzonenzug (Inter-zone train) services between West Berlin <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany.</b> Friedrichstraße station was separated into Eastern and Western parts with steel walls, and enabled West Berliners to change to S-Bahn trains running on the Nord-Süd-Bahn and the U6 line of the Berlin U-Bahn without passing through GDR border controls. The station also featured a border crossing into East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> and the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In Germany the 21st Army Group {{offensive}} {{towards the}} Rhine began in February. The Second Army pinned down the Germans, while the Canadian First and the U.S. Ninth Armys made pincer movements piercing the Siegfried Line. On 23 March, the Second Army crossed the Rhine, {{supported by a}} large airborne assault (Operation Varsity) the following day. The British advanced onto the North German Plain, heading towards the Baltic sea. The Elbe was crossed by VIII Corps and the Elbe bridgehead expanded, Bremen fell on 26 April, Luebeck and Wismar on 2 May and Hamburg 3 May. On 4 May, all German forces in Denmark, Netherlands, <b>and</b> north <b>west</b> <b>Germany</b> surrendered to Montgomery.|$|R
50|$|The 16.7 hz {{traction}} current line between Oebisfelde and Rathenow, which {{was brought into}} service on 14 March 1995, was the first {{traction current}} connection established between <b>west</b> <b>and</b> east <b>Germany.</b> The last viaduct was finished in October 1997 with the bridge over the Havel Canal.|$|R
50|$|The highway A7 (E22) {{connects the}} {{municipality}} {{to the city}} of Groningen in the <b>west</b> <b>and</b> Leer (<b>Germany)</b> in the east. The Harlingen-Nieuweschans railway runs through the municipality with train stations in Scheemda, Winschoten, and Bad Nieuweschans. The trains are currently operated by Arriva and the busses by Qbuzz.|$|R
5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany.</b> These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} {{following}} his junior year, Farmer {{was named to}} the Kentucky Junior All-Star Team, which played exhibition games throughout Europe, including stops in Iceland, the Netherlands, <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany.</b> After the European trip, he helped lead Clay County to a 150 record in Amateur Athletic Union play. It was the first AAU season which recognized the three-point field goal, and Farmer made 53 of his 73 three-point attempts. In July 1987, the Kentucky Junior All-Stars finished second to a team from South Carolina in the Kentucky Prep All-Star Festival at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington; Farmer sat out the championship game with a hand injury he suffered in the previous game.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stadion, often known {{simply as}} Stadion before the {{construction}} of Swedbank Stadion between 2007 and 2009, is a multi-purpose stadium in Malmö, Sweden. As of 2015, it {{is the home of}} association football club IFK Malmö, presently of Division 4, and athletics club MAI. The stadium served as the home ground for Malmö FF, an association football team in Sweden's top flight, Allsvenskan, from its opening in 1958 until 2009, when the club moved to the newly constructed Swedbank Stadion, built beside Malmö Stadion, in 2009. Malmö FF still use the stadium for training purposes and youth matches. Besides being used for sports, the stadium has also hosted various concerts and other events. The ground's record attendance, 30,953, was set in the very first match played at the ground, a 1958 FIFA World Cup match between Argentina <b>and</b> <b>West</b> <b>Germany.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 27 BC or 16-13 BC - Gallia Belgica (Holland {{south of}} the River Rhine, Belgium, Luxembourg, part of {{northern}} France <b>and</b> <b>Germany</b> <b>west</b> of the Rhine; there is uncertainty {{as to whether it}} was created with Augustus’ first visit and the first census on Gaul or during Augustus’ visit in 16-13 (imperial proconsular province).|$|R
5000|$|The Diocese of Gaul (Latin: Dioecesis Galliarum, [...] "{{diocese of}} the Gaul provinces") was a diocese {{of the later}} Roman Empire, under the praetorian {{prefecture}} of Gaul.
