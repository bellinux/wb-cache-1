Indirect calorimetric measurements showed an increased metabolic flexibility in mice supplemented with META 060. In addition, glucose tolerance was improved, comparable to the effects of rosiglitazone treatment.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} remediating soils {{contaminated}} by heavy metals and oil, experimental research was conducted to evaluate the optimal design factors for remediation in terms of efficient soil washing methods and processes. The experiments employed <b>absorptiometric</b> <b>analysis</b> and gas chromatography methods to reduce the concentration of heavy metals such as cooper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in contami-nated soils. The experimental processes consisted of deciding on the washing solution, washing time, and dilution ratio for contaminated soils. A dissolution analysis of heavy metals was then performed {{by the addition of}} surfac-tant, {{based on the results of}} the decision experiments, and the injection processes of microbes and hydrogen per-oxide were selected. The experimental results revealed that reduction effects in contaminated soils under the experimental conditions were most efficient with hydrochloric acid 0. 1 mole, washing time 1 hour, and dilution ratio 1 : 3, individually. Additional reduction effects for heavy metals and TPH were found with the addition of a washing solution of 1 % of surfactant. The addition of microbes and hydrogen peroxide caused a reduction in TP...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{outline the}} {{conceptual}} development of dual-energy <b>absorptiometric</b> (DXA) region-free <b>analysis,</b> quantify its precision, and evaluate {{its application to}} quantify the change in longitudinal femoral periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) in patients during the 12 months after total hip arthroplasty. Materials and Methods: All subjects had undergone total hip arthroplasty for idiopathic arthritis, and the scans were collected as part of previous ethically approved studies (1998 – 2005) for which informed consent was provided. Contemporary image processing approaches were used to develop a region of interest–free DXA analysis method with increased spatial resolution for assessment of proximal femoral BMD. The method was calibrated, and its accuracy relative to a proprietary algorithm was assessed by using a hip phantom. The precision of the method was examined by using repeat DXA acquisitions in 29 patients, {{and its ability to}} allow spatial resolution of localized periprosthetic BMD change at the hip was assessed in an independent group of 19 patients who were measured throughout a 12 -month period. Differences were evaluated with t tests (P <. 05). Results: The method allowed spatial resolution of more than 10 000 individual BMD data points on a typical archived prosthetic hip scan. The median data point–level error of the method after calibration was − 1. 9...|$|R
