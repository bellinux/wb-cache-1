5|$|Edwin {{was the son}} of Ælle king of Deira <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{have had}} (at least) two siblings. His sister Acha was married to Æthelfrith, king of {{neighbouring}} Bernicia. An otherwise unknown sibling fathered Hereric, who in turn fathered Abbess Hilda of Whitby and Hereswith, wife to Æthelric, the brother of king Anna of East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus japonensis, {{described}} by Gmelin in 1788, includes kleinschmidti, pleskei, and harterti, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> refer to intergrades with calidus. It is found from northeast Siberia to Kamchatka (though it is possibly replaced by pealei {{on the coast}} there) and Japan. Northern populations are migratory, while those of Japan are resident. It is similar to peregrinus, but the young are even darker than those of anatum.|$|E
25|$|Jasmonates — are {{produced}} from fatty acids <b>and</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> promote {{the production of}} defense proteins {{that are used to}} fend off invading organisms. They are believed to also have a role in seed germination, and affect the storage of protein in seeds, <b>and</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> affect root growth.|$|R

5|$|In New Orleans, Jeb Larold Dukes {{is fired}} from his job. After {{he leaves the}} office, Jeb {{witnesses}} a car chase which ends in a fiery crash. A burning figure that only Jeb can see emerges from the wreck <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> merge with him. Jeb, now possessed by the being, returns to his office to fatally shoot his boss and co-workers.|$|E
5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position might mean that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.|$|E
5|$|The western tomb {{was built}} {{subsequently}} {{to the eastern}} one <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have served to bury another woman. Builders graffiti uncovered during the Czech excavations demonstrate in all likelihood that the monument was built under Nyuserre, its owners possibly amongst the last members of the broader royal family {{to be buried in}} Abusir, the necropolis being abandoned by Nyuserre's successor Menkauhor.|$|E
60|$|In a few moments, {{the frenzy}} fit <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> pass off; she rose slowly, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> collect herself.|$|R
60|$|She {{paused for}} a few seconds, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be {{thinking}} deeply.|$|R
60|$|She paused, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> reflect, still {{outwardly}} as calm as ever.|$|R
5|$|This first castle {{was used}} only briefly <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been {{abandoned}} {{by the middle of}} the 12th century. The grain stores were destroyed by fire, but the reason for this is uncertain. By this period, the town of Lydford as a whole was also in serious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|This {{research}} has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the Amanita genus. DNA analysis has shown that a group of species in the subsection Vittadiniae (which includes S.thiersii) has few derived characteristics. This clade has a single ancestor (or a very small number) <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have come into being at a very early stage {{in the evolution of the}} genus.|$|E
5|$|A man, Cutter (Pablo Coffey), visits an {{open house}} viewing, where he is given a tour by the estate agent, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> take an {{interest}} in the bedroom of a young girl. That night, the owners have returned home, and are settling down for the evening when their daughter, Patricia, begins screaming. Later, a security guard for the family's alarm company finds the bodies of the parents hacked to death on the first floor, but Patricia is nowhere to be seen.|$|E

5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be the only person}} in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E
5|$|After {{settling}} {{down at the}} landlady's house, Vanaja gets invited {{to play a game}} of ashta chamma (a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady. Knowing that losing isn’t the mistress’s forte, she deliberately gives up her game. This gesture, in turn, eventually secures her the landlady’s mentorship, first in music and then in dance. Vanaja excels at these art forms <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government. Sexual chemistry is ignited between Shekhar and Vanaja (still a minor at 15) when flirtation and sexual innuendo bloom.|$|E
5|$|Baba is Amir's {{father and}} a wealthy {{businessman}} who aids the community by creating businesses for others and building a new orphanage. He is the biological father of Hassan, a fact he hides from both of his children, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> favor him over Amir. Similar to Hosseini's father, Baba does not endorse the religiosity demanded by the clerics in the religion classes attended by Amir in school. In his later years, after fleeing to America, he works at a gas station. He dies from cancer in 1987, shortly after Amir and Soraya's wedding.|$|E

5|$|Hugh was {{a keeper}} of the king's seal, serving as deputy to Simon of Wells, the Archdeacon of Wells who was Keeper of the Great Seal from around 1199 to 1204. Simon was also a {{relative}} of Hugh's, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have helped secure positions for both Hugh and Jocelin in the royal administration. Hugh was a royal clerk in the chancery, the royal secretariat, and was named Archdeacon of Wells sometime before 25 April 1204. He held prebends in the diocese of Lincoln and diocese of London as well. His service in the chancery would have involved him in Hubert Walter's administrative innovations during his term as Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|In 1297 he {{accompanied}} Edward I on {{a campaign}} to Flanders, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been knighted by this time. With his French connections {{he was in the}} following years a valuable diplomat in France for the English King. He also served as military commander in occupied Scotland. In 1298 at Blackearnside, a forest of alders, to the east of the village of Newburgh in Fife, he suffered an ignominious defeat from a force commanded by Wallace, Guardian of Scotland. In 1306 at the Battle of Methven, he won the day over Robert the Bruce only to be soundly defeated by Bruce at Loudoun Hill the next year.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which the}} figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E

25|$|The natives, {{although}} all Mahammadans, {{have a strong}} predilection for the Chinese, <b>and</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> like their manners and customs, <b>and</b> never <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> resent this behaviour to their womankind, their own manners, customs, and morals (?) being of the very loosest description.|$|R
5|$|Robert died {{fighting}} the Scots {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn and the region around the castle was attacked in 1314 and 1319, causing significant damage to neighbouring Church Brough. Around this time the village of Market Brough was established along the road overlooked by the castle, in an attempt by the Cliffords to maximise the possibilities for profits from trade along the valley. Market Brough acquired a royal charter in 1330 <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have rapidly overtaken Church Brough as the main settlement in the area.|$|E
5|$|The M. {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) {{includes four}} other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti. M. africanum is not widespread, {{but it is}} a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa. M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E
5|$|The first {{city had}} the {{characteristics}} of large urban centers, such as monumental buildings, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been ruled by a kinship based assembly, headed by elders. The pre-Akkadian kingdom was decentralized, and the provincial center of Nabada was ruled by a council of elders, next to the king's representative. The Nagarite monarchs had to tour their kingdom regularly in order to assert their political control. During the early Akkadian period, Nagar was administrated by local officials. However, central control was tightened {{and the number of}} Akkadian officials increased, following the supposed environmental event that preceded the construction of Naram-Sin's palace. The post-Akkadian Nagar was a city-state kingdom, that gradually lost its political importance during the early second millennium BC, as no evidence for a king dating to that period exists.|$|E
