5|$|The 2014 {{season was}} <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> season for Hughes, {{pitching}} to a 3.52 ERA in 209 2/3 innings. On September 24, 2014 Hughes ended {{the season with}} the best strikeout-to-walk ratio ratio in a single season in MLB history (11.625).|$|E
5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Harold Oliver played {{every game}} for the year. He was part of Port Adelaide's un{{defeated}} 1914 team that held North Adelaide to a single goal in the 1914 SAFL Grand Final and defeated VFL premiers Carlton in the 1914 Championship of Australia match at the Adelaide Oval. A game played between Port Adelaide and a composite team of the best SAFL players {{was held in the}} post season with Port Adelaide coming out as the victors with Harold Oliver awarded the best on ground with <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> players of the competition taking to the field on that day.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Rogan {{took over}} from José Méndez {{as manager of}} the Kansas City Monarchs. In that season's NNL playoffs against the Chicago American Giants, he pitched and lost both games of a series-deciding doubleheader to the younger Bill Foster. As late as 1928 {{at the age of}} 34, Bullet Rogan was the best hitter (.358) and <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> pitcher (10–2) on the Monarchs. That year he slammed three home runs in a game against the Detroit Stars.|$|E
5|$|Many Soviet {{citizens}} {{believed that}} the outcome may {{have been different if}} Anatoli Firsov and Vitaly Davydov had not sat out the series to protest a coaching change. In response, some offer that Canada was without Bobby Orr due to his knee injury as well as Bobby Hull (due to his departure from the NHL to the newly formed WHA league). These were <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Canadian players at the time (along with Phil Esposito), so neither team had all of its greatest talent on the ice. The Soviet team also had the obvious advantage of playing year-round. Meanwhile, the Canadian team was picked and prepared in only a few months and most players were out-of-shape. At the time, NHL players did not regularly train during the summer months, using the period for a holiday or other activities.|$|E
5|$|Other {{sports at}} MSU include golf, {{gymnastics}} and tennis. Golf {{has had a}} long tradition at MSU. Hall of Fame Coach Bruce Fossum helped carry MSU to its first Big Ten title in 1969. The Big Ten title would elude the Spartans until 2005, when <b>arguably,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> team ever assembled, took home the rings in stellar fashion. Not only did the Spartans win the Big Ten Championship in 2005, but they captured two other titles along the way and rose all the way to #5 in the U.S. Casey Lubahn coaches the men's golf team. A former assistant coach at Stanford University, this is his fourth year as a head coach.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arguably</b> <b>the</b> Cardinal's <b>best</b> {{season to}} date has come in 1989 under the {{leadership}} of legendary coach Jesse Longhofer. After losing the season opener, the Cardinals rallied to an eight-game win streak to finish the season 8-1 (one game was canceled).|$|R
50|$|It is <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> third <b>best</b> team in <b>the</b> {{country after}} Sparta Prague and Slavia Prague, having ranked 3rd in all six seasons from 2005 to 2011. Slovácko was the championship's runner-up in 2001 and 2002, {{and reached the}} {{national}} Cup's final in 2009.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} a generally positive critical response and {{a score of}} 75% on Rotten Tomatoes. Emanuel Levy of Variety wrote: [...] "Teaming {{for the first time}} Kevin Spacey and Samuel L.

5|$|The 2013 {{season was}} <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> season of Durant's career. He set career highs in touchdowns, with 31, while {{limiting}} his interceptions to only 12. He began the year having attempted 212 consecutive pass attempts without being intercepted joining Dave Dickenson and later Ricky Ray {{as the only}} quarterback in CFL history to start 7 consecutive games without throwing an interception. He also set a career-high for passer rating with 95.7 (excluding his 2006 season in which he only completed one pass). He led the Riders to an 11-7 record and home-field in the Western Semi-Finals against the BC Lions where several of his rushing plays won the game for the Riders. After beating Calgary in the Western Final, Durant led the Riders to their fourth Grey Cup championship on their home turf at Mosaic Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of basketball players like LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tyreke Evans and Harrison Barnes, Miller was the 201011 high school diary keeper for SLAM Magazine. Once Miller and Bello were united, they were described as <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> high school basketball tandem in the country. Entering his senior season, Miller was a first team All-Southeast Region team selection by ESPN HS. At the time he was listed in third in the 2010-2011 Preseason ESPNHS Mr. Basketball USA voting (behind Austin Rivers and Mike Gilchrist). The team was preseason #32 in the POWERADE FAB 50 ESPNHS Boys' basketball team rankings. In December 2010, Miller suffered a torn ACL, ending his senior season, and high school career. As a senior, he was ineligible for the McDonald's All-American Game, but was an honorary All-American selection for the Jordan Brand Classic game. He did not play in the game, but participated in drills. His Jordan Brand workouts refueled Durant comparisons. He was also a first team All-American selection by SLAM Magazine (along with Gilchrist, Rivers, Bradley Beal, Anthony Davis and Marquis Teague).|$|E
5|$|Zito faced {{off against}} the Reds in Game 4 of the National League Division Series (NLDS) on October 10 and struggled, being pulled {{in the third}} inning after {{allowing}} two runs. However, the Giants went on to win 8–3. The Giants, after losing the first two games of the series, became the first team to rally from a 2–0 deficit in an NLDS, winning the series in five games. On October 19, 2012, Zito rebounded and pitched <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> game of his career, tossing 7 shutout innings against the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), earning the win. It was his first postseason win since 2006 and according to Zito himself, was the biggest win of his career. That same day, Zito inspired the Twitter hashtag #rallyzito, which, behind the efforts of Giants fans, was trending worldwide on the social networking site. The Giants, after trailing 3–1 in the series, prevailed in seven games.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 tournament {{became an}} {{exceptional}} show as many teams such as América de Cali, River Plate, Grêmio, Cobreloa, and Racing, among others, brought their best sides in generations and unexpected teams such as Independiente Medellín and Paysandu became revelations in what was, <b>arguably,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Copa Libertadores in history. The biggest {{news of the}} competition was previous champion Santos. Qualifying to the tournament as Brazilian champion, coached by Emerson Leão and containing marvelous figures such as Renato, Alex, Léo, Ricardo Oliveira, Diego, Robinho, and Elano, the Santásticos {{became a symbol of}} entertaining and cheerful football that resembled Pelé's generation of the 1960s. Boca Juniors once again found talent in their ranks to fill the gap left by the very successful group of 2000–2001 (with upcoming stars Rolando Schiavi, Roberto Abbondanzieri and Carlos Tevez). Boca Juniors and Santos would eventually meet in a rematch of the 1963 final; Boca avenged the 1963 loss by defeating Santos in both legs of the final. Carlos Bianchi won the Cup for a fourth time and became the most successful manager in the competition's history and Boca Juniors hailed themselves pentacampeones. Boca reached their fourth final in five tournaments in 2004 but were beaten by surprise-outfit Once Caldas of Colombia, ending Boca's dream generation. Once Caldas, employing a conservative and defensive style of football, became the second Colombian side to win the competition.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Brian Olewnick stated [...] "Barbecue Dog doesn't quite reach the {{explosive}} heights of its predecessor, but is <b>arguably</b> <b>the</b> next <b>best</b> item in Jackson's discography.
