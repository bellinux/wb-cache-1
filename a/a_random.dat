5|$|In {{junctions}} with symmetrical sequences, the branchpoint is {{mobile and}} can migrate in <b>a</b> <b>random</b> walk process. The rate of branch migration varies dramatically with ion concentration, with single-step times increasing from 0.3−0.4 ms with no ions to 270−300 ms with 10 mM Mg2+. The change in rate is {{correlated with the}} formation of the stacked versus the unstacked structures.|$|E
5|$|Logarithms {{also occur}} in {{log-normal}} distributions. When the logarithm of <b>a</b> <b>random</b> variable has a normal distribution, the variable {{is said to}} have a log-normal distribution.

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not <b>a</b> <b>random</b> event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, {{or a lack of}} sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E
30|$|Observe {{that there}} is a duality between a class of {{symmetric}} stable distributions and a class of GG distributions with p∈(0, 2].

However, good results can be achieved in practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash.|$|E

5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use. However, assuming <b>a</b> <b>random</b> orientation of the planet's orbit, the true mass {{is likely to be}} close to the measured minimum mass.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the other}} Panzer Dragoon games, which are rail shooters, Panzer Dragoon Saga is a {{role-playing}} video game (RPG).

The game uses <b>a</b> <b>random</b> encounter system, whereby battles are triggered randomly as the player flies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{stationary}} {{distribution of the}} number of customers in the infinite-server system with non-Poissonian arrivals is dependent on the form of the service time distribution. In particular, when the interarrival time is <b>a</b> hyperexponential <b>random</b> variable that is more variable than <b>an</b> exponential <b>random</b> variable, the stationary state distribution becomes stochastically less variable, as the service time becomes more variable. On the other hand, when the interarrival time is <b>an</b> Erlang <b>random</b> variable that is less variable than <b>an</b> exponential <b>random</b> variable, the more variable service time yields the more variable stationary state distribution...|$|R

Under the framework of chance theory, this paper obtains chance distribution of the maximum flow of <b>an</b> uncertain <b>random</b> network. At the same time, the expected value of maximum flow is given for <b>an</b> uncertain <b>random</b> network. <b>A</b> new method is derived to calculate chance distribution of the maximum flow for <b>an</b> uncertain <b>random</b> network.|$|R
