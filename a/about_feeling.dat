25|$|Crittenden {{proposes that}} {{both kinds of}} {{information}} can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized {{to be based on}} reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond' Type A strategies split off emotional information <b>about</b> <b>feeling</b> threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the sheet}} music, {{published}} on Musicnotes.com by BMG Music, shows [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{in the key}} of F minor, the recording suggests it is approximately in F♯ minor, perhaps due to a speed discrepancy. The song has a moderate fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. Aguilera's vocal range on the track spans from A♭3 to F♯5. Dorian Lyskey of The Guardian noted that the beats of the song are [...] "brassy" [...] and have the same [...] "aerobic oomph" [...] as Beyoncé's [...] "Crazy in Love", while Jody Rosen from Entertainment Weekly deemed the track [...] "exhilarating". According to Aguilera; lyrically, [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] is not a love song, but actually intertwines with the events that she experienced in real life. The song seems to be about Aguilera's husband, Jordan Bratman, but is really simply <b>about</b> <b>feeling</b> good. During an interview with MTV News, Aguilera said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to make it}} light and easy for people to dance to and sing along to... Lyrically, I just got married, so it's about someone in particular, but it's all <b>about</b> <b>feeling</b> good and not taking anything too seriously".|$|E

This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't.

[...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements <b>about</b> <b>feeling</b> proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E
500|$|During {{the last}} two years that the Beatles performed, Lennon and Ono created and {{attended}} their own public protests against the Vietnam War. On March 20, 1969, they were married at the registry office in Gibraltar and spent their honeymoon in Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the US, but were denied entry to the country. They held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded [...] "Give Peace a Chance". Lennon later stated his regrets <b>about</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "guilty enough to give McCartney credit as co-writer on my first independent single instead of giving it to Yoko, who had actually written it with me." [...] The famous couple often combined advocacy with performance art, such as in [...] "bagism", first introduced during a Vienna press conference, where they satirised prejudice and stereotyping by wearing a bag over their entire bodies.

500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{three out of}} five stars, Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone {{summarized}} that the messages on the album are dour, but complimented Madonna for talking about the then-current situation of the nation. Johny Davis from NME gave the album a rating of seven out of ten, saying that technically the album sounds good, but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to Madonna's previous endeavors like Ray of Light and Music. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what it promises than what it delivers, {{and that it is}} better in theory than practice. Kelefa Sanneh from Blender awarded the album three stars out of five. [...] "Just as disjointed as Music and much more severe... Without a compelling back story, her songs seem diminished". Dorian Lynskey from Q magazine also rated it three out of five, stating [...] "'Nothing Fails', the album's centerpiece, is as good a showstopper as 'Live to Tell'... it's no wonder that a record <b>about</b> <b>feeling</b> confused ends up sounding confused".|$|E
500|$|The second witness {{called by}} the defense was United Press International (UPI) {{journalist}} and Hendrix's friend Sharon Lawrence, who testified that she was with Hendrix in California when, after complaining <b>about</b> <b>feeling</b> ill, an unnamed fan gave him something. When Malone suggested that her memory was suspiciously acute, she explained that her training as a reporter prepared her to notice fine details. Hendrix's manager and producer, Chas Chandler, was called next, and he corroborated the defense's assertion that rock stars, particularly Hendrix, would regularly receive gifts from fans and that those gifts often included drugs. In its closing argument, the defense reiterated {{that in order to}} be guilty of possession of narcotics Hendrix had to have knowledge of the illegal drugs. After a trial that had lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for more than eight hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. Torontoist Kevin Plummer wrote: [...] "As the all-male jury announced its acquittal, the courtroom—crowded with young people—erupted into applause." [...] In remarks to reporters after the verdict was announced, Hendrix commented: [...] "Canada has given me the best Christmas present I ever had", while flashing a peace sign.|$|E

[...] The song is a [...] "grim escape fantasy" [...] describing a murder suicide, which [...] "has the singer driving his car to the shore, his trunk “bleeding” with “broken hearts”. The hook of the song ends with the refrain of [...] "I feel like a ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby." [...] Pitchfork described the singing as [...] "heart-battered." [...] The Quietus states that the song [...] "makes you realise the ocean means a lot more to this songwriter than the reference to Ocean's Eleven that he's cited in interviews, he is mysterious and tragic."
