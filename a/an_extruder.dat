25|$|The {{forming process}} {{involves}} the dough entering <b>an</b> <b>extruder</b> {{in which the}} rotation of a single or double screw system pushes the dough toward a die set to a specific shape. As the starch granules swell slightly {{in the presence of}} water and a low amount of thermal energy, they become embedded within the protein matrix and align along the direction of the shear caused by the extrusion process.|$|E
25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in <b>an</b> <b>extruder</b> and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E
25|$|Extrusion is {{the process}} of {{kneading}} and shaping {{at the same time and}} in the matter of a few minutes. This process takes place in <b>an</b> <b>extruder</b> which is a grooved extrusion cylinder equipped with an extrusion worm which is a shaft with deep thread around its core. The extrusion worm kneads and moves the dough forward and presses it through the dies in the head of the extruder. The longitudinal grooves in the cylinder reduce the friction and improves the movement of the dough. Both the worm and the cylinder are made of stainless steel, but the worm has a Teflon coating to decrease friction.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePolymer-layered {{silicate}} nanocomposites {{have drawn}} a {{great interest in}} polymer science these past years. Understanding of the complex mechanism of dispersion and exfoliation of the clay tactoids may allow us to better control the final morphology and the homogeneity of clay nanocomposites and thus their macroscopic properties. The first step we propose in this study consists of a multiscale' approach of the exfoliation state of the extruded polypropylene/montmorillonite nanocomposite. We used three <b>extruders</b> designs: <b>a</b> single-screw <b>extruder,</b> <b>a</b> twin-screw <b>extruder,</b> and <b>an</b> optimized-screw <b>extruder</b> with adapted shear. The rheological analysis, the WAXS diffractograms, and the TEM micrographs all show different nanocomposite morphologies. A statistical TEM image analysis methodology was developed to evaluate the different particle parameters (thickness, length, aspect ratio, interparticle distance). The results obtained show a correlation between the size of the tactoids and the shear intensity...|$|R
25|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through <b>an</b> <b>extruder,</b> where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10–20bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both protein denaturation and starch gelatinization, depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).|$|E
