50|$|Suddenly, {{a segment}} of the flight console rolls outward to greet them. The pilot is a robot. Though {{primitive}} in appearance, it is an advanced cybernetic intelligence. Self-aware and self-programming, the mobile electronic brain is connected to the Swift's on-board computer by the <b>antenna</b> <b>cable</b> trailing behind it. When asked its name, the robot admits it has none. It recalls that, after activation, it mispronounced 'brain' as 'Brian', which the Alphans adopt as its moniker. It is the sole survivor of the Star Mission crew. Years ago, they landed on the nearby planet (designated 'Planet D') and the entire crew instantly died.|$|E
50|$|Media Center uses TV tuner {{devices to}} play back and record TV shows from {{standard}} <b>antenna,</b> <b>cable</b> or satellite signals. Users can record television programs manually or schedule recording via the electronic program guide. Recordings can be burned to Video DVD or, barring copy restrictions, {{be transferred to}} a portable media player. Media Center supports both analog and digital tuners and allows up to six of each tuner type (analog, digital over-the-air, Clear QAM, CableCard) to be configured. All the tuners use the same guide data {{but it can be}} edited and configured to include additional channels such as Clear QAM not found or included in most Titan Guides. While playing live television, the program keeps a buffer that allows users to rewind or pause live TV and skip commercials. A third party program MCEbuddy allows automatic commercial skipping on recorded programs.|$|E

50|$|A {{terminating}} resistor for a television coaxial cable is {{often in the}} form of a cap, threaded to screw onto an F connector. <b>Antenna</b> <b>cables</b> are sometimes used for internet connections; however RG-6 should not be used for 10BASE2 (which should use RG-58) as the impedance mismatch can cause phasing problems with the baseband signal.|$|R
5000|$|Through-the-Earth {{transmission}} can overcome these restrictions by using ultra-low frequency (300-3000 Hz) signals, which can travel through {{several hundred feet}} of rock strata. The <b>antenna</b> <b>cable</b> can be located on the surface only at a mine site, and provide signal coverage to {{all parts of the}} underground mine. The antenna may be placed in a [...] "loop" [...] formation {{around the perimeter of the}} mine site (or wherever coverage is needed) for systems using magnetic fields to carry signals. Systems that use electric fields as the signal carrier are not subject to this limitation. Transmissions propagate through rock strata which is used as the medium to carry the ultra-low-frequency signals. This is important in mining applications, particularly after any significant incident, such as fire or explosion, which would destroy much of the fixed communication infrastructure underground.|$|E
5000|$|Yak-9 {{variants}} carried {{two different}} wings, five different engines, six different fuel tank combinations and seven types of armament configurations. In December 1943, it became possible {{to install the}} more powerful M-107 engine on a new Yak-9U airframe: the engine mounting was new with individual faired exhaust pipes; fuselage structure and wings were made of metal and the whole aircraft {{was covered with a}} Bakelite skin [...] Fuel capacity was increased to 400 L. In order to re-balance the model, the wing was repositioned four inches forward and in order to improve pitch control, the horizontal tail surfaces were slightly reduced. The rear part of the canopy was lengthened and the <b>antenna</b> <b>cable</b> was moved inside it. Usual armament was a 20 mm ShVAK cannon with 120 rounds firing through a hollow propeller shaft and a 12.7 mm UBS machine gun with 170 rounds.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1950s June Lake had two {{competing}} grocery markets: Louie's Market {{which had been}} in business for 20 years and was {{owned and operated by}} Louis and Pauline Prole and their daughters Louise and Jocelyn and the newer June Lake General Store owned by Al and Jean Matlaf. Louie's Market had a wide variety of services including a bakery, ice cream fountain, groceries, necessities, hardware, cold storage for local fisherman and hunters as well as a deli and meat counter. Louis was a trucker and brought in his own supplies to keep the cost down; he also knew produce and only the best would do for his customers and friends. During the long haul, he would often stop along 395 and deliver fresh produce to the locals, many of whom still remember him with a smile. There were also numerous other services including service stations; automotive repair and towing; sport and tackle shops; hardware and dry goods; even an arcade featuring pinball machines and the like. June Lake at the time was one of the more important commercial centers of the Eastern Sierra region. A new, larger school with a teacher's residence had been constructed near the Rodeo Grounds. In 1955, motel owner Edward Krause and associate Frank Roberts established one of the earliest Community <b>Antenna</b> <b>Cable</b> systems, making June Lake the only town in the area to offer television to its motel guests.|$|E

50|$|Isolation {{transformers}} are transformers for {{low frequency}} analog and digital audio connections or rarely for high-frequencies in <b>antenna</b> <b>cables</b> between TV outlets and devices (tuner, VCR, TV, etc.). This filter then suppresses low-frequency ground loop currents on the sheath and core of coaxial cables, which {{can result from}} multiple grounds at different potentials. They affect the signal because of their upper and lower frequency limits and therefore can not transmit DC. In addition, analog signals can suffer from nonlinear distortion, especially near the frequency limits of the device.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} assumed until {{recently}} that GPS time receiver units (recever+cables+antenna) have good stability {{and do not}} affect time transfer by more than 1 ns. Differences of a few nanoseconds sometimes observed during calibration campaigns {{have been attributed to}} external causes, such as multipath propagation, rather than to variations within the hardware. The characteristic feature of most comparisons of GPS time receivers is their short duration. Normally the comparison takes place, at most, over one week. To observe the behavior of GPS time receivers {{over a period of several}} months, an experiment has been organized involving three receivers of two types. All three were connected to the same atomic clock. An unexpected sensitivity to external temperature was found in one type of receiver.
