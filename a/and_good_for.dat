5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E

25|$|Thomas A. Edison {{had invented}} the {{phonograph}} in 1877. But the fame bestowed on Edison for this invention (sometimes called his most original) was {{not due to}} its quality. Recording with his tinfoil phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the tinfoil tore easily, and even when the stylus was properly adjusted, its reproduction of sound was distorted and squeaky, <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> only a few playbacks; nevertheless Edison had discovered the secret of sound recording. However he did not work to improve its quality, likely because of an agreement {{to spend the next}} five years developing the New York City electric light and power system.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to the war}} {{this was}} the first Test to be played in Australia since 3 March 1937 and there were eight Australian debutants; Ian Johnson, Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Keith Miller, Arthur Morris, Don Tallon, Ernie Toshack and George Tribe. However, Johnson, Lindwall, McCool, Miller, Tallon and Toshack had played in an Australia vs New Zealand match the {{previous}} season which was belatedly recognised as a Test, the only game between the two countries treated as such before 1973. As a result, only Morris and Tribe are now seen as debutants with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett having played only four Tests before the war and Sid Barnes one. Don Bradman made himself available for selection at the last moment against the advice of his doctor due to the severe attack of fibrositis during the war, an ailment from which the England captain Wally Hammond also suffered. There were no English debutants; Hammond, Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, Paul Gibb, Bill Voce and Doug Wright were all pre-war players, vice-captain Norman Yardley had played one Test before the war and Alec Bedser and Jack Ikin had debuted against India in 1946. The vaunted England batting line up had done well so far on the tour, with Hutton making 522 runs (87.00), Washbrook 461 runs (51.22), Edrich 221 runs (44.20), Compton 423 runs (60.43) and Hammond 277 runs (55.40), but their bowling had been weakened by injuries. Gibbs was preferred as wicketkeeper over Godfrey Evans because of his batting form in South Africa in 1938-39. There had been a drought in Queensland since 1941 and the curator had tried boring for water without success. The Woolloongabba wicket, traditionally green and helpful to fast bowlers, was a dry, lifeless brown <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> runs. Bradman won the toss and had no difficulty in choosing to bat first.|$|E

[...] Time selected Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness as the best album of the year in its year-end [...] "Best of 1995" [...] list. Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A rating; reviewer David Browne praised the group's ambition and wrote, [...] "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is more than just the work of a tortured, finicky pop obsessive.

[...] IGN gave the album a score of 9.5 out of 10 and said, [...] "As the band's magnum opus it single-handedly changed the face of Alternative Rock. That said, it's not just music, but a work of art."
