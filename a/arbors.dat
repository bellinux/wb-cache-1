25|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} {{is concerned}} with how the brain {{is affected by the}} stimulation of its information processing provided by its surroundings (including the opportunity to interact socially). Brains in richer, more-stimulating environments, have increased numbers of synapses, and the dendrite <b>arbors</b> upon which they reside are more complex. This effect happens particularly during neurodevelopment, but also to a lesser degree in adulthood. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity and so increased size and number of glial energy-support cells. Capillary vasculation also is greater to provide the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The neuropil (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands making the cortex thicker. There may also exist (at least in rodents) more neurons.|$|E
25|$|There is {{converging}} {{evidence from}} cognitive neuroscientists {{around the world}} that age-induced cognitive deficits may not be due to neuronal loss or cell death, but rather {{may be the result of}} small region-specific changes to the morphology of neurons. Studies by Duan et al., have shown that dendritic <b>arbors</b> and dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal neurons decrease in size and/or number in specific regions and layers of human and non-human primate cortex as a result of age (Duan et al., 2003; morph). Interestingly, a 46% decrease in spine number and spine density has been reported in humans older than 50 compared with younger individuals. An electron microscopy study in monkeys reported a 50% loss in spines on the apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex of old animals (27–32 years old) compared with young ones (6–9 years old).|$|E
500|$|Many {{of the old}} roses had cultivars {{that grew}} very long canes, which could be tied to trellises or against walls. These older {{varieties}} are called [...] "ramblers", rather than [...] "climbers". Climbing plants in the traditional cottage garden included European honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) and Traveller's Joy (Clematis vitalba). The modern cottage garden includes many Clematis hybrids that have the old appeal, with sparse foliage {{that allows them to}} grow through roses and trees, and along fences and <b>arbors.</b> There are also many Clematis species used in the modern cottage garden, including Clematis armandii, Clematis chrysocoma, and Clematis flammula. Popular honeysuckles for cottage gardens include Japanese honeysuckle and Lonicera tragophylla.|$|E

50|$|One {{end of a}} {{compensating}} chain (typically roller chain) {{is suspended}} from {{the underside of the}} counterweight <b>arbor,</b> the opposite end mounted to the adjacent wall, at a point corresponding to half the travel of the <b>arbor.</b> The compensating chain is about half the length that the <b>arbor</b> travels, and sized to weigh twice as much as the combined weight of the lift lines per linear foot. At <b>arbor</b> low trim, the compensating chain is fully supported by the wall. At <b>arbor</b> high trim, the chain is fully supported by the <b>arbor.</b> Paying out at half the speed of <b>arbor</b> travel, a compensating chain effectively eliminates imbalance along the full path of travel.|$|R

2500|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} is {{the stimulation}} of the brain by its physical and social surroundings. Brains in richer, more stimulating environments have higher rates of synaptogenesis and more complex dendrite <b>arbors,</b> leading to increased brain activity. This effect takes place primarily during neurodevelopment, but also during adulthood [...] to a lesser degree. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity, leading to an increased size and number of glial energy-support cells. Environmental enrichment also enhances capillary vasculation, providing the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The neuropil (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands, thickening the cortex. Research on rodent brains suggests that environmental enrichment may also lead to an increased rate of neurogenesis.|$|E

2500|$|A village would {{challenge}} another village to a game, {{and the two}} villages would then negotiate a day and place for the match. After the Spanish missions were established, the games usually took place on a Sunday afternoon, from about noon until dark. The two teams kicked a small ball (not much bigger than a musket ball), made by wrapping buckskin around dried mud, trying to hit the goalpost. The single goalpost was triangular, flat, and taller than it was wide, on a long post (Bushnell described it, based on a drawing in a Spanish manuscript, as [...] "like a tall, flat Christmas tree with a long trunk"). There were snail shells, a nest and a stuffed eagle {{on top of the}} goalpost. Benches, and sometimes <b>arbors</b> to shade them, were placed {{at the edges of the}} field for the two teams. Spectators gambled heavily on the games. As the Apalachee did not normally use money, their bets were made with personal goods.|$|E

[...] Early ripening, to escape the killing northern frosts, but with a rich, full-bodied flavor, the hardy Concord grape thrives where European cuttings had failed to survive. In 1853, Mr. Bull felt ready to put the first bunches of his Concord grapes before the public—and won a prize at the Boston Horticultural Society Exhibition. [...] From these early <b>arbors,</b> fame of Mr. Bull’s (“the father of the Concord grape”) Concord grape spread worldwide, bringing him up to $1,000 a cutting, but he died a relatively poor man.
