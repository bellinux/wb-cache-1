2500|$|Many Benedictines, such as Celestino Sfondrati (died 1696) and Jesuits, {{supported}} by pious faithful and their movements and societies {{fought against the}} anti-Marian trends. [...] Increasing secularization led to the forced closing of most monasteries and convents, and Marian pilgrimages were either discontinued or greatly reduced in number. [...] Some Catholics criticized {{the practice of the}} rosary as not Jesus-oriented and too mechanical. In some places, priests forbade the praying of the rosary during Holy Mass. The highly conservative rural Bavarian dioceses of Passau [...] outlawed Marian prayer books <b>and</b> <b>related</b> <b>articles</b> in 1785.|$|E

2500|$|According to Goldman's Harmony in Western Music, [...] "the IV chord is actually, in the {{simplest}} mechanisms of diatonic relationships, at the greatest distance from I. In terms of the [...] circle of fifths, it leads away from I, rather than toward it." [...] Thus the progression I–ii–V–I (an authentic cadence) would feel more final or resolved than I–IV–I (a plagal cadence). Goldman concurs with Nattiez, who argues that [...] "the chord on the fourth degree appears long before the chord on II, and the subsequent final I, in the progression I–IV–viio–iii–vi–ii–V–I", and is farther from the tonic there as well.

2500|$|While scale degrees are {{typically}} represented in musical analysis or musicology articles with Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3..., sometimes with a circumflex above the numeral: , , ...), the triads (three-note chords) that have these degrees as their roots are often identified by Roman numerals (e.g., I, IV, V, {{which in the}} key of C major would be the triads C major, F major, G major). In some conventions (as in this <b>and</b> <b>related</b> <b>articles)</b> upper-case Roman numerals indicate major triads (e.g., I, IV, V) while lower-case Roman numerals indicate minor triads (e.g., I for a major chord and i for a minor chord, or using the major key, ii, iii and vi representing typical diatonic minor triads): other writers, (e.g. Schoenberg) use upper case Roman numerals for both major and minor triads. Some writers use upper-case Roman numerals to indicate the chord is diatonic in the major scale, and lower-case Roman numerals {{to indicate that the}} chord is diatonic in the minor scale. Diminished triads may be represented by lower-case Roman numerals with a degree symbol (e.g., vii7 indicates a diminished seventh chord built on the seventh scale degree; in the key of C major, this chord would be b diminished seventh, which consists of the notes B, D, F and G).|$|E
