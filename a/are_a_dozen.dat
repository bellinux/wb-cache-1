25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> major freeways that {{crisscross}} the region. California's first freeway was the California State Route 110, {{also known}} as the Pasadena Freeway or the Arroyo Seco Parkway. It opened on January 1, 1940 and links downtown Los Angeles to downtown Pasadena. From Chavez Ravine north to Pasadena can be quite dangerous because there is no shoulder, the lanes are narrow, the turns are sharp (and not always properly banked), and the ramps are quite short and offer little room for acceleration to freeway speed; all of this is because the freeway was designed for much slower cars of a different era and much less traffic volume than exists today. Commercial vehicles over 6,000 pounds are prohibited from using this freeway. More recent freeways are straighter, wider, and allow for higher speeds.|$|E

2500|$|There is, most {{importantly}} to the Baconians' argument, evidence that Bacon had {{control over the}} Gray's Inn players. In a letter either to Lord Burghley, dated before 1598, or to the Earl of Somerset in 1613, he writes, [...] "I am sorry the joint masque from the four Inns of Court faileth here <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> gentlemen of Gray's Inn that {{will be ready to}} furnish a masque".

2500|$|During {{the time}} that Cotton was {{establishing}} herself as a professional artist reporters found it odd that an influential society woman would, {{as one of them}} said, challenge the successful male portraitists such as Sargent or George Burroughs Torrey.

As a fourth put it, [...] "The true American society woman does not think millions an excuse for idleness." [...] A fifth echoed this sentiment and elaborated: [...] "In the circles of great wealth <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> women who are doing meritorious work with brush, pen, and chisel.
