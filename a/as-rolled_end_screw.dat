Most times, two screws {{are placed in}} the first sacral segment, {{even if it is}} possible to place one screw in S 1 and one in S 2, or a single screw may be used if the area of safe placement is limited [14]. At the <b>end,</b> <b>screw</b> position has to be confirmed on antero-posterior, inlet and outlet views [15 – 19]. In very unstable disruptions, and whenever possible and safe, use of a trans-sacral screw is suggested, as this type of fixation seems to provide greater stability [20].|$|R

40|$|Abstract Six {{months after}} {{undergoing}} a Fontan operation, a 7 -year-old boy with right atrial isomerism {{and a single}} functional ventricle was admitted to our emergency department with cyanosis. Emergency cardiac catheterization revealed a large veno-venous fistula that began in a left hepatic vein, connected to the left accessory hepatic veins, and drained into the common atrium, resulting in desaturation. The fistula was occluded proximally with an Amplatzer septal occluder, with satisfying results; the patient's systemic arterial saturation decreased during his hospital stay. Three weeks after the first intervention, a second procedure was performed to retrieve the first device and to close the fistula distally. Multiple attempts with different types of gooseneck snares and a bioptome catheter failed to retrieve the first device, so a telescopic method was used to re-screw it. Using a Mullins long sheath and delivery sheath, the delivery cable was manipulated {{to fit into the}} slot of the <b>end</b> <b>screw,</b> and the cable was rotated gently in a clockwise direction to re-screw the device. Then, another Amplatzer septal occluder was placed at the distal end of the fistula. In conclusion, distal transcatheter occlusion of intrahepatic veno-venous fistulas might lead to better clinical outcomes in selected patients. Amplatzer septal occluder device can be retrieve without any complication within three weeks...|$|R
50|$|The chain tool has two {{positions}} where a chain can {{be inserted}} {{perpendicular to the}} tool, one close to the movable screw portion, and one lower down just above the fixed end. In each position, there are a pair of protruding tabs; one fits {{into the center of}} one link of the chain, the other fits {{into the center of the}} next link. With the chain properly in place, the pin is held in the center of the tool, so that the tip of the movable screw can press on the end of the pin. The <b>end</b> of the <b>screw</b> is slightly narrower than the pin, so that it can press the pin through the link. Often the <b>end</b> of the <b>screw</b> is a removable piece which can be replaced when worn.|$|R

5000|$|C-clamps or G-clamps are {{typically}} {{made of steel}} or cast iron, though smaller clamps may be made of pot metal. At {{the top of the}} [...] "C" [...] is usually a small flat edge. At the bottom is a threaded hole through which a large threaded <b>screw</b> protrudes. One <b>end</b> of this <b>screw</b> contains a flat edge of similar size to the one {{at the top of the}} frame, and the other end usually a small metal bar, perpendicular to the screw itself, which is used to gain leverage when tightening the clamp. When the clamp is completely closed, the flat <b>end</b> of the <b>screw</b> is in contact with the flat end on the frame. [...] When the clamp is actually used, it is very rare that this occurs. Generally some other object or objects will be contained between the top and bottom flat edges.|$|R
40|$|Background: Locking plates {{transmit}} load through fixed-angle locking screws instead {{of relying on}} plate-to-bone compression. Therefore, locking screws may induce higher stress at the screw-bone interface than that seen with con-ventional nonlocked plating. This study investigated whether locked plating in osteoporotic diaphyseal bone causes a greater periprosthetic fracture risk than conventional plating because of stress concentrations at the plate end. It further investigated the effect of replacing the locked end screwwith a conventional screw {{on the strength of}} the fixation construct. Methods: Three different bridge-plate constructs were applied to a validated surrogate of the osteoporotic femoral diaphysis. Constructs were tested dynamically to failure in bending, torsion, and axial loading to determine failure loads and failuremodes. A locked plating construct was compared with a nonlocked conventional plating construct. Subsequently, the outermost locking screw in locked plating constructs was replaced with a conventional screw to reduce stress concentrations at the plate end. Results: Compared with the conventional plating construct, the locked plating construct was 22 % weaker in bending (p = 0. 013), comparably strong in torsion (p = 0. 05), and 15 % stronger in axial compression (p = 0. 017). Substituting the locked <b>end</b> <b>screw</b> with a conventional screw increased the construct strength by 40 % in bending (p = 0. 001) but had no significant effect on construct strength under torsion (p = 0. 22) and compressive loading (p = 0. 53) compared with the locked plating construct. Under bending, all constructs failed by periprosthetic fracture...|$|R
