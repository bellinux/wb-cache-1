5|$|General Motors' first commercially {{available}} plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Volt, introduced in December 2010, includes warning sounds for pedestrians. GM's system is called Pedestrian-Friendly Alert System {{and it is}} manually <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> the driver, but future generations probably will include an active system.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to PET and fMRI, which show which {{areas of the}} brain are <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> certain tasks, researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas, thus providing insight into how different areas interact. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.|$|E

5000|$|Glucagon {{inhibits}} PFK2 <b>by</b> <b>activating</b> Protein Kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates the PFK2 {{complex and}} causes its FBPase activity to be favored; via PKA and PFK2/FBP, glucagon decreases F-2,6-BP, which inhibits glycolysis by allosteric inhibition of PFK1. Insulin <b>activates</b> PFK2 <b>by</b> <b>activating</b> protein phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the PFK-2 complex and causes its PFK2 activity to be favored; via Protein Phosphatase and PFK2, insulin increases F-2,6-BP, which <b>activates</b> glycolysis <b>by</b> allosteric activation of PFK1, signalling {{an abundance of}} glucose ...|$|R
50|$|In mammals, <b>activating</b> {{phosphorylation}} <b>by</b> CAK {{can only}} occur once cyclin is bound. In budding yeast, <b>activating</b> phosphorylation <b>by</b> CAK {{can take place}} before cyclin binding. In both humans and yeast, cyclin binding is the rate limiting step in the activation of Cdk. Therefore, phosphorylation of Cdk by CAK is considered a post-translational modification that is necessary for enzyme activity. Although <b>activating</b> phosphorylation <b>by</b> CAK is not exploited for cell-cycle regulation purposes, it is a highly conserved process because CAK also regulates transcription.|$|R
5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
5|$|One player plays lead guitar {{while another}} plays either bass guitar or rhythm guitar, {{depending}} on the song. Both players share a score, rock meter, star power meter, and streak multiplier. Cooperative mode is the only multiplayer mode in which a song can be failed. Star power can only be <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> both players simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|There are twenty-four {{gameplay}} variations {{included in}} Space Cavern; all are playable {{by one or}} two players and <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> modifying the 2600's difficulty switches.

5|$|Completing stages {{allow the}} player to {{progress}} through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; the first seven worlds feature an airship controlled {{by one of the}} Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths, and mini-games and bonus screens that provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve until <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> the player from the map screen.|$|E
5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging {{does not explain}} how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E

Users can then add text, filters, stickers and chat bubbles to the photo to share on social media platforms.|$|R
50|$|MC1R/cAMP {{signaling}} pathway: Activation of MC1R causes {{activation of}} adenylyl cyclase (AC), which produces {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} (cAMP), which activates protein kinase A (PKA), which <b>activates</b> (<b>by</b> protein phosphorylation) cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which upregulates MITF (CREB is a transcription factor of MITF). Whitening agents that interfere with the MC1R/cAMP signaling pathway have been reviewed by Chang (2012).|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} post-translational modifications, NEDD9 {{is subject to}} {{significant}} phosphorylation based on growth conditions. In most actively growing adherent cells, NEDD9 migrates as a doublet of 115 and 105 kDa. Serine/threonine hyper-phosphorylated p115 NEDD9 {{is more common in}} G2/M phase cells, suggesting these modifications are associated with increased localization to centrosome and mitotic spindle. One study indicated the conversion of p115 into p105 is <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> cell detachment through cytoskeletal regulation of phosphatase PP2A, although other work has found conflicting results.|$|E

Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has also released stand-alone holiday and promotional versions of the game.|$|E
5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is <b>activated</b> <b>by</b> a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
