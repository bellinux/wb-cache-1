5|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of COPD are sputum production, shortness of breath, and a productive cough. These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into emphysema <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms {{that may or may not}} occur with COPD.|$|E

5|$|Circumcision {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{pathological}} phimosis, refractory balanoposthitis <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV. The International Antiviral Society-USA also suggests circumcision be discussed with MSM who engage in primarily insertive anal sex, especially in areas where HIV is common.|$|E
5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as high blood {{pressure}} (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> kidney disease.|$|E

5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female sexual arousal disorder <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasm. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E

He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi. Declining health (including asthma, diabetes <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> insomnia) restricted his activity.|$|E

5|$|Alex Wiens (Russian: Алекс Винс, {{also known}} as Alexander Wiens) was born in 1980 in Perm, Russia. After leaving school, he {{completed}} a vocational training programme as a warehouseman. In 1999, after a medical examination for conscription, Wiens was exempted from compulsory military service in the Russian armed forces; it was stated that Wiens probably had suffered from a severe <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> psychosis. In 2003, he immigrated to Germany and gained German citizenship {{as a result of}} his ethnic origin. In Germany, he worked as a builder and caretaker, but had been living on welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed at the time of the murder. In November 2009, at the time of sentencing, Wiens was 28 years old, unmarried and without children.|$|E

5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E

5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> obstructive {{pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|In June2000, Icos and Texas Biotechnology {{formed a}} 50/50 {{partnership}} to research endothelin receptor antagonists {{for use in}} the areas of pulmonary hypertension <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> heart failure. Two drugs, sitaxentan sodium (also spelled sitaxsentan) and TBC3711, were tested in clinical trials under the partnership. Sitaxentan was designed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, and TBC3711 was designed to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. In April2003, Icos sold its part of the 50/50 partnership, including any share of sitaxentan and TBC3711, to Texas Biotechnology for $4million at closing and another $6million within 18months. Sitaxentan sodium was later approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and was marketed under the brand name Thelin. In 2010, Thelin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide due to concerns about irreversible liver damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} few months of his life, Lowell {{struggled}} with gout, sciatica in his left leg, <b>and</b> <b>chronic</b> nausea; by the summer of 1891, doctors believed that Lowell had cancer in his kidneys, liver, and lungs. His last few months, he was administered opium for the pain and was rarely fully conscious. He died on August 12, 1891, at Elmwood. After services in the Appleton Chapel, he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After his death, Norton served as his literary executor and published several collections of Lowell's works and his letters.|$|E
