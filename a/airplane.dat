40|$|A {{method of}} {{computing}} the power spectral densities of the lateral response of <b>airplanes</b> to random atmospheric turbulence was adapted to an electronic digital computer. By {{use of this}} program, the power spectral densities of the lateral roll, yaw, and sideslip angular displacement of several conventional and STOL <b>airplanes</b> were computed. The results show that for the conventional <b>airplanes,</b> the roll response is more prominent than that for yaw or sideslip response. For the STOL <b>airplanes,</b> on the other hand, the yaw and sideslip responses were larger than the roll response. The response frequency of the STOL <b>airplanes</b> generally is higher than that for the conventional <b>airplanes.</b> This combination of greater sensitivity of the STOL <b>airplanes</b> in yaw and sideslip and the frequency at which they occur could be a factor causing the poor riding qualities of this class of <b>airplanes...</b>|$|R

50|$|Installation of GPWS or {{alternative}} FAA-approved advisory systems was {{not required}} on turbo-propeller powered (turboprop) <b>airplanes</b> operated under Part 135 because, at that time, the general consensus was that the performance characteristics of turboprop <b>airplanes</b> made them less susceptible to CFIT accidents. For example, {{it was thought that}} turboprop <b>airplanes</b> had a greater ability to respond quickly in situations where altitude control was inadvertently neglected, as compared to turbojet <b>airplanes.</b> However, later studies, including investigations by the NTSB, analyzed CFIT accidents involving turboprop <b>airplanes</b> and found that many of these accidents could have been avoided if GPWS equipment had been used.|$|R

In this paper, we present an automatic target recognition system capable of recognizing <b>airplanes</b> observed with a passive radar.

5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first <b>airplane</b> flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an <b>airplane.</b>|$|E

40|$|Power-spectral-density {{calculations}} {{were made}} of the lateral responses to atmospheric turbulence for several conventional and short take-off and landing (STOL) <b>airplanes.</b> The turbulence was modeled as three orthogonal velocity components, which were uncorrelated, and each was represented with a one-dimensional power spectrum. Power spectral densities were computed for displacements, rates, and accelerations in roll, yaw, and sideslip. In addition, the power spectral density of the transverse acceleration was computed. Evaluation of ride quality based on a specific ride quality criterion was also made. The {{results show that the}} STOL <b>airplanes</b> generally had larger values for the rate and acceleration power spectra (and, consequently, larger corresponding root-mean-square values) than the conventional <b>airplanes.</b> The ride quality criterion gave poorer ratings to the STOL <b>airplanes</b> than to the conventional <b>airplanes...</b>|$|R

The demo featured Iwata and Reggie Fils-Aime in a doubles tennis match against Shigeru Miyamoto and Scott Dyer, a contest winner. The other sports titles were on display at E3 and shared a similar naming convention to the tennis game such as, Wii Sports: Baseball, Wii Sports: Golf, and Wii Sports: <b>Airplane.</b> At the time, baseball only featured a batting simulation. The <b>airplane</b> title was similar to Pilotwings and required the player to maneuver an <b>airplane</b> through rings within a time frame.
