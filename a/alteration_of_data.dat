40|$|Abstract:- In a large {{distributed}} system {{such as the}} Grid, ensuring <b>data</b> integrity is <b>of</b> particular importance. Since in a same network honest users and possible malicious entities live together, the risks <b>of</b> unauthorized <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> and information cannot be ignored. This concern on data integrity has two faces. On the one hand, insurance has to be given that data has not been altered by unauthorized hands. This is called integrity <b>of</b> passive <b>data.</b> On the other hand, users may {{want to have the}} guarantee that the jobs they submit on the Grid are executed in the right way with the proper input data, and result on reliable output data.

40|$|The {{issue of}} a {{published}} literature not representative {{of the population of}} research is most often discussed in terms of entire studies being suppressed. However, alternative sources of publication bias are questionable research practices (QRPs) that entail post hoc <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> hypotheses to support data or post hoc <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to support hypotheses. Using general strain theory as an explanatory framework, we outline the means, motives, and opportunities for researchers to better their chances of publication independent of rigor and relevance. We then assess the frequency of QRPs in management research by tracking differences between dissertations and their resulting journal publications. Our primary finding is that from dissertation to journal article, the ratio of supported to unsupported hypotheses more than doubled (0. 82 to 1. 00 versus 1. 94 to 1. 00). The rise in predictive accuracy resulted from the dropping of statistically nonsig-nificant hypotheses, the addition of statistically significant hypotheses, the reversing of predicted direction <b>of</b> hypotheses, and <b>alterations</b> to data. We conclude with recommendations to help mitigate the problem of an unrepresentative literature that we label the “Chrysalis Effect. ...|$|R

Honest users and possible malicious entities live together in this network, the risks <b>of</b> unauthorized <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> and information cannot be ignored.

40|$|Up-to-date {{information}} {{is crucial in}} many fields such as medicine, science, and stock market, where data should be distributed to clients from a centralized database. Shared databases are usually stored in data centers where they are distributed over insecure public access network, the Internet.

Researchers proposed using watermarking to prevent problems and claim digital rights. Many methods are proposed recently to watermark databases to protect digital rights of owners. Particularly, optimization based watermarking techniques draw attention, which results in lower distortion and improved watermark capacity. Difference expansion watermarking (DEW) with Firefly Algorithm (FFA), a bioinspired optimization technique, is proposed to embed watermark into relational databases in this work. Best attribute values to yield lower distortion and increased watermark capacity are selected efficiently by the FFA.

In this paper, {{instead of using}} the conventional irreversible block-based watermarking approach to achieve tamper localization, we propose to incorporate such functionality into the region-based lossless watermarking scheme. This is achieved by partitioning an image into certain non-overlapping regions and appending the associated local authentication information directly into the watermark payload. A region of authentication, which can be flexibly specified by the user, is partitioned into small regions in a multilevel hierarchical manner. Such hierarchical structure allows the user to easily adjust the localization accuracy, and makes the tamper detection efficient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of tamper localization...|$|R

However, GPS is a radio-navigation system and is prone to vulnerabilities that may be introduced intentionally or unintentionally. The legal literature has not debated the possibility <b>of</b> human <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> GPS <b>data</b> in judicial reasoning which raises the prospect <b>of</b> forged GPS <b>data</b> being presented to courts by individuals who have the motive and the technical knowledge to do so. By exposing the weaknesses present, this paper aims to draw the attention of the legal fraternity to these issues which may put the legal system in a dilemma as over-reliance on GPS technology may produce disastrous results, especially when innocence or guilt largely depends on GPS evidence...|$|R

Since arguments are correlated, a little <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> input <b>data</b> often results in a models with absolutely different suites of arguments. We propose two steps for application of factor analysis to GMDH. The first step simply consists in using GMDH in the orthogonal basis of factors. On the second, heuristic step we preliminarily obliterate so called unstable and inessential factors. Some versions of this method are realized by means of Java.

It is necessary to maintain high performance and data availability, especially for high diverse topologies. Dynamic data allocation is accomplished in three phases: performance assessment to decide reallocation; assignment generation to create new assignment; and data reorganization to realize the assignment. This dissertation contributes methodology on analysis and implementation. Strategies for reallocating data when network topology alterations are presented. Benefit functions are defined to evaluate assignment efficiently. An analytical approach to data assignment generation establishes the lower bound on algorithm performance since allocation is NP hard. Then, implemented heuristic approaches by test approximate the bound to generate sub-optimal assignments. A non-blocking strategy presented resolves any conflicts with ongoing normal database activities when reorganizing data. The proposed dependency test and schedule algorithms can implement the new data assignment in a parallel manner. ...|$|R
