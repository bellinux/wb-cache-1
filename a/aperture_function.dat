5000|$|Whenever a {{function}} is discontinuously truncated in one FT domain, broadening and rippling are {{introduced in the}} other FT domain. A perfect example from optics is {{in connection with the}} point spread function, which for on-axis plane wave illumination of a quadratic lens (with circular aperture), is an Airy function, J1(x)/x. Literally, the point source has been [...] "spread out" [...] (with ripples added), to form the Airy point spread function (as the result of truncation of the plane wave spectrum by the finite aperture of the lens). This source of error is known as Gibbs phenomenon and it may be mitigated by simply ensuring that all significant content lies {{near the center of the}} transparency, or through the use of window functions which smoothly taper the field to zero at the frame boundaries. By the convolution theorem, the FT of an arbitrary transparency function - multiplied (or truncated) by an <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> - is equal to the FT of the non-truncated transparency function convolved against the FT of the <b>aperture</b> <b>function,</b> which in this case becomes a type of [...] "Greens function" [...] or [...] "impulse response function" [...] in the spectral domain. Therefore, the image of a circular lens is equal to the object plane function convolved against the Airy function (the FT of a circular <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> is J1(x)/x and the FT of a rectangular <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> is a product of sinc functions, sin x/x).|$|E

Sometimes this function {{is referred to as}} the generalized pupil function, in which case pupil function only indicates whether light is transmitted or not. Imperfections in the optics typically have a direct effect on the pupil function, it is therefore an important tool to study optical imaging systems and their performance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sudden turn-on of a matter-wave source {{leads to}} {{characteristic}} oscillations of the probability density {{which are the}} hallmark feature of diffraction in time. The apodization of matter waves relies {{on the use of}} smooth <b>aperture</b> <b>functions</b> which suppress such oscillations. The analytical dynamics arising with different <b>aperture</b> <b>functions</b> are discussed systematically for switching-on processes, and for single and many-pulse formation procedures. The possibility and time scale of a revival of the diffraction-in-time pattern is also analysed. Similar modulations in time of the pulsed output coupling in atom-lasers are responsible for the dynamical evolution and characteristics of the beam profile. For multiple pulses, different phase schemes and regimes are described and compared. Strongly overlapping pulses lead to a saturated, constant beam profile in time and space, up to the revival phenomenon. Coherent matter-wave pulse formation and dynamics have been studied traditionally in the context of scattering and interferometric experiments with mechanical shutters. Suddenly switching-on and off matter-wave sources leads to an oscillatory pattern in the probability density which was discovered by one of the author...|$|R

40|$|AMSR-E is a space-borne {{radiometer}} {{which measures}} Earth microwave emissions or brightness temperatures (TB) {{over a wide}} swath. AMSR-E data and images are useful in mapping valuable Earth-surface and atmospheric phenomena. A {{modified version of the}} Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) algorithm creates TB images from the collected data. SIR is an iterative algorithm with tuning parameters to optimize the reconstruction for the instrument and channel. It requires an approximate <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> for each channel to be effective. This thesis presents a simulator-based optimization of SIR iteration and <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> threshold parameters for each AMSR-E channel. A comparison of actual TB images generated using the optimal and sub-optimal values is included. Tuned parameters produce images with sharper transitions between regions of low and high TB for lower-frequency channels.

This requires modifications in the pupil plane of a system, causing a departure from the realm of most image quality studies. Examples include sparse apertures, synthetic apertures, coded apertures and phase elements. This work will focus on sparse aperture telescopes and the image quality issues associated with them, however, the methods presented will be applicable to other non-conventional aperture systems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{effective}} aperture approach {{is used as}} a tool for analysis and parameter optimization of mostly known ultrasound imaging systems- phased array systems, compounding systems and synthetic aperture imaging systems. Both characteristics of an imaging system, the effective <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> and the corresponding two-way radiation pattern, provide information about two of the most important parameters of images produced by an ultrasound system- lateral resolution and contrast. Therefore, in the design, optimization of the effective <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> leads to optimal choice of such parameters of an imaging systems that influence on lateral resolution and contrast of images produced by this imaging system. It is shown that the {{effective aperture}} approach can be used for optimization of a sparse synthetic transmit aperture (STA) imaging system. A new two-stage algorithm is proposed for optimization of both the positions of the transmitted elements and the weights of the receive elements. The proposed system employs a 64 -element array with only four active elements used during transmit. The numerical results show that Hamming apodization gives the best compromise between the contrast of images and the lateral resolution...|$|E
40|$|This {{technology}} {{is based on}} sampling considerations for a band-limited function, which has application to optical estimation generally, and to phase retrieval specifically. The analysis begins with the observation that the Fourier transform of an optical <b>aperture</b> <b>function</b> (pupil) can be implemented with minimal aliasing for Q values down to Q = 1. The sampling ratio, Q, {{is defined as the}} ratio of the sampling frequency to the band-limited cut-off frequency. The analytical results are given using a 1 -d <b>aperture</b> <b>function,</b> and with the electric field defined by the band-limited sinc(x) function. Perfect reconstruction of the Fourier transform (electric field) is derived using the Whittaker-Shannon sampling theorem for 1 <Q< 2. The Fourier transform is constructed by periodic extension, i. e., by spacing copies of the transform in a definite way, recognizing that no aliasing occurs for values of the sampling ratio such that 1 <Q< 2, which can be used to advantage in the application of phase retrieval estimation. A method was developed for propagating the electro magnetic field with no aliasing, which has been extended to 2 -d optical apertures...|$|E

Prior {{knowledge of the}} coherence state of the light is used to constrain the optimization in the mutual intensity domain. We use an assumption of spatially coherent light to design a fixed-pattern aperture mask. The concept of a dynamic aperture mask that displays several aperture patterns during one image exposure is also suggested, which is modeled under an assumption of partially coherent light.
