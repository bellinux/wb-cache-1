25|$|Naturism can {{sometimes}} contain aspects of eroticism, although the debate <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> often simplified and seen negatively {{in the media}} and the public mind and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience and discussion of erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.|$|E

500|$|Shelley was {{particularly}} interested in tying private, domestic history to public, political history. She emphasises romance, the family, sympathy, and compassion {{in the lives of}} the people she writes <b>about.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> particularly true in her essays on Petrarch and Vincenzo Monti. Her belief that these domestic influences would improve society, and that women could be at the forefront of them, ties her approach to that of other early feminist historians such as Mary Hays and Anna Jameson. Shelley argues that women possess a [...] "distinctive virtue" [...] in their ability to sympathise with others and should use this ability to improve society. She castigates Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for example, for abandoning his children at a foundling hospital, decrying the [...] "masculine egotism" [...] associated with his philosophy—a criticism similar to the one she makes of Victor Frankenstein in Frankenstein (1818).|$|E
500|$|The Qur'an condemns idolatry, {{and this}} has led some Islamic {{scholars}} to interpret it as prohibiting figurative representation; {{this is known as}} aniconism. However, since Islam has many centres of religious authority, opinion and tradition <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not uniform. [...] In popular practice today there is no general injunction against pictorial representation of people outside of religious contexts. Generally, images of Muhammad have been prohibited throughout history. In practice, images of Muhammad have been made on many occasions, generally in a restricted and socially regulated way; for example, they are often stylised or do not show Muhammad's face. Within Muslim communities, views about pictorial representations have varied: Shi'a Islam has been generally tolerant of pictorial representations of human figures while Sunni Islam generally forbids any pictorial representation of living beings, albeit with some variation in practice outside a religious context. Some contemporary interpretations of Islam, such as those followed by adherents of Wahhabism, are entirely aniconistic and condemn pictorial representations of any kind.|$|E

500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ...

2500|$|Is it {{not obvious}} {{that there are}} always enough moral {{problems}} without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. [...] "But", someone says, [...] "we didn't know it would happen." [...] Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; {{and it would be}} nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for morality.|$|E
2500|$|The slot-and-state syntax in MCell {{can also}} be used to model multimeric {{proteins}} or macromolecular complexes. When used in this way, a slot is a placeholder for a subunit or a molecular component of a complex, and the state of the slot will indicate whether a specific protein component is absent or present in the complex. A way to think <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that MCell macromolecules can have several dimensions: A [...] "state dimension" [...] and one or more [...] "spatial dimensions". The [...] "state dimension" [...] is used to describe the multiple possible states making up a multi-state protein, while the spatial dimension(s) describe topological relationships between neighboring subunits or members of a macromolecular complex. One drawback of this method for representing protein complexes, compared to Meredys, is that MCell does not allow for the diffusion of complexes, and hence, of multi-state molecules. This can in some cases be circumvented by adjusting the diffusion constants of ligands that interact with the complex, by using checkpointing functions or by combining simulations at different levels.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{assume that}} S and S are Riemann surfaces, {{and that the}} map π is complex analytic. [...] The map π {{is said to be}} {{ramified}} at a point P in S if there exist analytic coordinates near P and π(P) such that π takes the form π(z) = z'n, and n>1. [...] An equivalent way of thinking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that there exists a small neighborhood U of P such that π(P) has exactly one preimage in U, but the image of any other point in U has exactly n preimages in U. [...] The number n is called the ramification index at P and also denoted by e'P. [...] In calculating the Euler characteristic of S we notice the loss of eP1 copies of P above π(P) (that is, in the inverse image of π(P)). Now let us choose triangulations of S and S with vertices at the branch and ramification points, respectively, and use these to compute the Euler characteristics. Then S will have the same number of d-dimensional faces for d different from zero, but fewer than expected vertices. Therefore we find a [...] "corrected" [...] formula ...|$|E

We got along well together, but something was lacking. The stars weren't in alignment." [...] He also went on to say that: [...] "We felt like {{there was nothing left to}} give collectively.
