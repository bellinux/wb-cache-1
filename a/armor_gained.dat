50|$|The game {{is divided}} into several missions. Prior to each mission, the player can recruit new troops and {{assemble}} formations, equip troops with weapons and <b>armor</b> <b>gained</b> from the spoils of war or crafted from certain minigames. The player can return to an earlier mission to acquire additional resources and equipment to build up their troops before a larger battle.|$|E
50|$|While {{exploring}} a cavern in Egypt, Cheng Sinzan discovers a leg armor plate {{said to be}} one of six pieces of the Armor of Mars. Cheng is defeated by Laocorn Gaudeamus and his three henchmen before Laocorn attaches the part to his body and destroys the cavern. In Japan, Joe Higashi makes his triumphant return into the ring by defeating Thai champion Hwa Jai after the events of Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle. Joe reunites with Terry and Andy Bogard, as well as Mai Shiranui. While being chased by a masked assailant, Sulia Gaudeamus - Laocorn's sister - befriends Terry. After Big Bear is knocked unconscious by the assailant, Kim Kaphwan defeats him, exposing the assailant as Cheng. Sulia reveals that she has searched for Terry since his battle with Krauser. Sulia, Terry, Andy, Mai and Joe travel to Rhodes, where Sulia reveals that she is a descendent of Gaudeamus, a powerful warrior whose armor drew fear among Alexander the Great. One night, Alexander killed Gaudeamus, but the <b>armor</b> <b>gained</b> life after his death, and reincarnated himself as Mars before destroying a city; it was eventually defeated by four warriors. To prevent Mars from destroying cities again, the armor was broken up and hidden in different places around the world. On the island, the five discover a series of cave paintings that indicate that martial arts moves such as Tung Fu Rue's Hurricane Punch and Krauser's Blitz Ball were influenced by Gaudeamus. Sulia reveals that she possesses healing powers due to her heritage and shares a mental bond with Laocorn. After Sulia discovers the locations of two of the three remaining armor pieces, the group divides into two subgroups in an attempt to find them.|$|E
50|$|Online <b>Armor</b> has <b>gained</b> both {{negative}} and positive feedback with some users reporting serious compatibility problems with certain programs, such as F-Secure and Ad Muncher, {{as noted in the}} product website, but also receiving praise for its free online support and for its swift response to problems.|$|R
50|$|Initially, Ralph Roberts {{wore the}} Cobalt Man <b>armor</b> to <b>gain</b> Iron Man-like abilities, {{including}} flight, superhuman strength (it multiplied his strength 100x) and durability, recoil beams, etc. The armor (at least the second version) also had oxygen tanks and could protect its wearer from the vacuum of space.|$|R
50|$|Dragon Shaman - {{introduced}} in the Player's Handbook II. Open to all races, the Dragon Shaman is primarily a physical combatant who gains dragon-like powers from the particular type (color) of dragon he aligns with and develops an affinity for. This character may employ medium <b>armor,</b> and <b>gains</b> some spell-like abilities.|$|R
5000|$|Sentry Kit: Players who {{pick up the}} Sentry Kit will <b>gain</b> <b>armor</b> and a Maxim 08/15 or Villar Perosa (depending on map), {{but will}} be unable to put on a gas mask.|$|R
50|$|Arthur, {{the main}} protagonist, is a {{well-balanced}} character in speed and power. His weapon is the sword Excalibur. He can perform a special attack, a powerful slashing blow, by pressing attack then holding the joystick toward the enemy's direction. Initially, Arthur wears chain mail and leather <b>armor.</b> Upon <b>gaining</b> levels, Excalibur becomes stronger, and he eventually gets more body armor (later in {{silver and gold}} colors). Arthur {{is also the most}} devastating character, when mounted on horseback.|$|R
50|$|The Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) is {{a series}} of {{improvements}} to the M1 Abrams intended to improve fighting ability in urban environments. Historically, urban and other close battlefields have been the worst place for tanks to fight. A tank's front armor is much stronger than that on the sides, top, or rear. In an urban environment, attacks can come from any direction, and attackers can get close enough to reliably hit weak points in the tank's <b>armor</b> or <b>gain</b> sufficient elevation to hit the top armor.|$|R
50|$|When Valkyrie defeats a monster, she earns {{experience}} points {{towards the}} next level and (usually) {{a small amount of}} money. Although money is scarce in Marvel Land, the player rarely needs it to buy equipment. All the game's items can be obtained for free if the player knows where to look. In addition to equipping weapons and <b>armor,</b> Valkyrie <b>gains</b> access to seven spells. When she learns each one depends on her intelligence, which increases with each level of experience. The first, and possibly the most valuable, of these is the healing spell.|$|R
5000|$|Lann is a male {{character}} {{described as}} [...] "An intrepid warrior {{with a passion}} for weapons." [...] The character specializes in Dual-Wielding weapons, specifically Swords. His main role in the party is DPS (Damage per second) and relies on critical hit rate, damage and cap, speed and evasive maneuvers to win battles, but lacks any form of self-defense. His alternate weapons are Twin Spears, which comes with increased damage along with constant attacks and a fair evasion but has less abilities and also takes more damage from enemy attacks. He starts off with the ability of wearing light <b>armor,</b> but later <b>gains</b> the ability to wear heavy and plate armor as well.|$|R
5000|$|During the [...] "Demon" [...] storyline, Johnson is {{revealed}} to be alive. When asked his name by a relief worker, he gives it as [...] "Detroit Steel". The public however, believes Johnson to be dead, and Justine makes Sasha the new public face of Detroit Steel. The Steelcorps also appear in the subsequent [...] "Long Way Down" [...] storyline, in which Johnson kidnaps Sasha in order to steal a Detroit Steel unit, after which he is confronted {{by the rest of}} the Steelcorps including Sasha, Justine discovered that Johnson had earlier hacked into Hammer Industries where he disabled the remote-activated self-destruct system in the Detroit Steel <b>armor.</b> When Johnson <b>gained</b> control of the armor, Sasha and the Steelcorps battled Johnson up to the point where Sasha decapitated him with her whips.|$|R
50|$|One {{of three}} mission {{outcomes}} is possible: either the human forces are eliminated, the alien forces are neutralized, or the player chooses to withdraw. The mission's score {{and the result}} {{are based on the}} number of X-COM operatives lost, civilians saved or perished, aliens killed or captured, and the number and quality of alien artifacts obtained. Troops may also increase in rank or abilities if they made successful use of their primary attributes (e.g. killing enemies). Instead of gaining experience points, surviving human combatants might get an automatic rise (a semi-random amount depending on how much of the action in which they participated) to their attributes, such as Psi or Accuracy. Dead soldiers are permanently dead, but can be replaced with raw recruits back at base. In addition to combat personnel, the player may use unmanned ground vehicles, outfitted with heavy weapons and <b>armor</b> but not <b>gaining</b> experience. Recovered alien artifacts can then be researched and possibly reproduced. Captured live aliens may produce information, possibly leading to new technologies and even an access to psionic warfare.|$|R
5000|$|Darkseid also {{arranges}} for detective Dan Turpin to be lured {{into the}} Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's [...] "final host", as his Boss Dark Side body {{has begun to}} mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest [...] "rebirth", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, {{at the same moment}} Shilo Norman, the [...] "Embodiment of Freedom" [...] is shot by S.H.A.D.E. operatives, thus signalling the [...] "Victory of Evil". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle <b>armor.</b> Darkseid then <b>gains</b> the fullest of his power, his [...] "fall" [...] having the effect of compressing and crumpling space-time around Earth.|$|R
5000|$|In Iron Man: Armored Adventures, {{a teenage}} Stark {{initially}} creates the first armor completely on his own. It {{is similar to}} the movie version of the Mark III armor, with a less complex design and more red. Once Obadiah Stane's scientists said the armor is [...] "more advanced than anything we're currently working on" [...] and that [...] "it's years, if not decades ahead of current technology" [...] (Tony even mentioned in the same episode that he may have [...] "outgeniused himself" [...] when he made the armor). In addition to the traditional abilities of the armor (superhuman strength and durability, flight, repulsors, and the uni-beam), it is able to generate a force field around it, uses magnetic manipulation, and has other various functions, including a remote command system to enable Rhodes to control it from a separate computer terminal if Stark cannot ("Secrets and lies"), a security system to prevent people from opening it when Stark is unconscious ("Seeing Red") and a secondary wheeled transportation system that enables him to [...] "skate" [...] when the flight system is damaged ("Masquerade"). It can even adapt to fit any size ("Don't Worry, Be Happy"). In [...] "Ancient History 101", Stark even creates a pack that allows him to don the armor when and where he needs to, combined with anti-gravity devices so as to reduce the suit's weight (possibly based on how the comic version always carried his armor in his briefcase).The <b>armor</b> briefly <b>gained</b> intelligence in Episode 14 of Season 1 [...] "Man and Iron Man". Problems arose due to its desire to protect Stark above all (including almost killing Whiplash, {{as it did in the}} comics) - by constantly keeping him inside itself. However, like in the comics, the armor sacrificed itself in order to save Stark during a cardiac arrest.|$|R
2500|$|Wolverine {{appears in}} [...] voiced by Steven Blum. He ambushes Spider-Man at Hell's Kitchen {{and ask him}} {{questions}} to determine if Spider-Man is a symbiote or not. (Even if the player gives wrong answers, likely due to not reading the comics, the fight continues.) He helps Spidey evacuate a church; however, before he can board, Wolverine is attacked by two burly Symbiotes, which dog pile him to the ground. As a result, Wolverine turns into a monstrous symbiote version of himself; he attacks Spidey, even using the Symbiote pods to <b>gain</b> <b>armor.</b> If the player chooses the Red Suit Path, Wolverine uses his claws to gut himself, effectively removing the symbiote. (Ironically, Wolverine had originally suggested doing this to Spider-Man if the symbiote managed {{to gain control of}} him.) If the player chooses the Black Suit Path, Spider-Man will absorb Wolverine's symbiote and then rip him in half with Wolverine swearing to kill him. In both Black Suit endings, Black Widow enlists a symbiote-controlled Wolverine (who is in full control of his symbiote) to bring her Spider-Man dead or alive. The Symbiote-Wolverine prefers the dead option. Wolverine is an assist character who will slash at any opponents in all versions.|$|R
50|$|The ranger {{was one of}} the {{standard}} character classes available in the original Player's Handbook. The ranger was one of five subclasses presented in the original Players Handbook. The first edition rangers were a subtype of the fighters, using any weapon and wearing any <b>armor,</b> but they <b>gained</b> extra attacks at a slower rate than fighters and paladins. Unlike other warriors, the ranger used d8 hit dice instead of d10s, but had a second hit die at 1st level and maxed out at 11 hit dice instead of nine. Rangers also had extensive tracking abilities, based on a percentage score, and were able to surprise opponents on a roll of 1-3 on a d6 (rather than a 1-2) while they themselves could only be surprised on a 1. Rangers also gained limited spell use at level 8, acquiring 1st-3rd level druid spells and 1st and 2nd level magic-user spells (two per level maximum). Rangers were most effective when fighting giants and humanoids (such as orcs), gaining a +1 to damage per level against these opponents. High level rangers gained followers, ranging in type and power from classed player character races, to creatures such as pegasus mounts, pseudodragons and werebears, and even to copper dragons and storm giants. As a general rule, the fewer followers a ranger gained (based on random dice rolls) the more powerful each individual follower was.|$|R
5000|$|A ninja-like {{iteration}} of Scorpion {{appears in}} the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Dante Basco (in [...] "Journey of the Iron Fist" [...] and [...] "Return of the Sinister Six"), and by Eric Bauza (in [...] "Graduation Day"). He first {{appears in the}} episode [...] "Journey of the Iron Fist" [...] where he is depicted as Iron Fist's arrogant rival in K'un-L'un and wielded a rope weapon with a blade at the end. Upon Spider-Man and Iron Fist beating Scorpion in the contest, the Elder of K'un-L'un exiled Scorpion from K'un-L'un. In the episode [...] "Return of the Sinister Six", Scorpion {{is a member of}} the Sinister Six equipped with Oscorp technology; he now sports an actual scorpion tail. Acting as the Beetle's replacement, Scorpion once again fights Iron Fist and then takes part in the group assault on Iron Patriot. Subsequent episodes show that Scorpion's <b>gained</b> <b>armor</b> is retrofitted to resemble Peter Parker's clone of the same name from the original Ultimate universe. In the episode [...] "Agent Venom", Scorpion is briefly possessed by the Venom symbiote before being freed by Spider-Man. In the episode [...] "New Warriors", Scorpion is seen among the escaped villains led by the Green Goblin during a showdown between Spider-Man's new team and Taskmaster's team. He fights with Agent Venom and gets defeated by Ka-Zar and Zabu. In the episode [...] "The Revenge of Arnim Zola", Arnim Zola uses synthizoid hybrids of villains, including one of Scorpion and Whirlwind that fights Spider-Man and captures Dagger. Scorpion has a cameo appearance in the episode [...] "Contest of Champions" [...] 1 among the Grandmaster's villain collection against Spider-Man and the Collector. In the two-part series finale [...] "Graduation Day", Scorpion is a member of Doctor Octopus' Superior Sinister Six. At an abandoned building where Doctor Octopus had Crossbones imprisoned, Spider-Man and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees fight Scorpion. During the fight, Scorpion uses a gas that Doctor Octopus provided him to transform Crossbones into a Lizard. Scorpion is defeated by Spider-Man's original group. Scorpion later broke out of his cell at the Triskelion and later harasses Spider-Man and Norman Osborn. During the fight at Oscorp, Spider-Man managed to defeat Scorpion.|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} the exiled Duke and his quest to return home after being transported {{to the other side}} of the world by a magician ally of Talwin Hawkins. During his exile, he contemplates all the choices he had made as the Duke, and regrets the pain he had caused. Along his journey, he {{encounters}} four men carrying an artifact of dark power. As soon as he sees it, he is caught in its power and led by a will not his own along with his new companions to where the artifact, a set of black armor, wished. They take it to the temple of the Gods, and are directed to take it to the Gods themselves upon the highest mountains of the world. As they travel, the former Duke Kaspar's companions are killed off one at a time, until he is alone in carrying the armor to the Gods. There he is shown visions of great evil that await if the armor is not sent back to the world from which it came. To do so, Kaspar is instructed to find his old enemy, Talwin Hawkins, and contact the order he works for, the Conclave of Shadows. Kaspar takes the advice and sails the armor back to his home and does as he is bid, only to find that the Conclave know of no means to destroy the <b>armor.</b> Hoping to <b>gain</b> more information, the head of the Conclave, Pug, transports them to the elf lands of Elvandar where they seek the wisdom of the elves. Even the elves prove to be of no help, and just as the sorcerer Pug and Kaspar are to return, a reincarnated Leso Varen attacks the elven land with his hordes of undead. After saving the elf lands, they return only to find that Pug's stronghold had been breached by none other than Leso Varen himself. After a battle in which Varen is killed again, Pug and his son are able to send the armor to an Assembly of the most powerful magicians in their plane. As the story concludes, Pug and an ally of his, Nakor, travel to where the armor was first uncovered, only to find that thousands more like it were hidden only under the surface.|$|R
