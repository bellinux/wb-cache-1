25|$|The {{overhead}} {{sour gas}} from the stripper contains hydrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane, and, perhaps, some butane and heavier components. That sour gas {{is sent to the}} refinery's central gas processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the refinery's main amine gas treating unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and pentane or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as refinery fuel gas. The hydrogen sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit or to sulfuric acid in a wet sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>process</b> or in the conventional Contact Process.|$|E
25|$|Aqua regia {{was also}} used for parting. It was made by adding sal {{ammoniac}} to nitric acid which produced a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. This acid dissolved the gold to a soluble chloride and the silver was attacked and precipitated as an insoluble chloride. Silver was removed by filtering and gold was then recovered by evaporating the liquid and heating the residue. Nitric acid was suitable for separating small quantities of gold from silver and Aqua regia used to separate small quantities of silver from gold. Aqua regia <b>acid</b> <b>process</b> is used by refiners of scrap gold used in jewelry manufacturing. This process is also well suited to recycling consumers' used or broken jewelry directly back onto the global market 24kt inventory.|$|E

50|$|Anodizing {{can also}} be {{performed}} in borate or tartrate baths in which aluminium oxide is insoluble. In these processes, the coating growth stops when the part is fully covered, and the thickness is linearly related to the voltage applied. These coatings are free of pores, relative to the sulfuric and chromic <b>acid</b> <b>processes.</b> This type of coating is widely used to make electrolytic capacitors, because the thin aluminium films (typically less than 0.5 μm) would risk being pierced by acidic processes.|$|R
2500|$|There are two routes for the {{hydration}} process: indirect hydration {{using the}} sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>process,</b> and direct hydration. The former process, which can use low-quality propene, [...] predominates in the USA {{while the latter}} process, which requires high-purity propene, is more commonly used in Europe. These processes give predominantly isopropyl alcohol rather than 1-propanol because the addition of water or sulfuric acid to propene follows Markovnikov's rule.|$|E
2500|$|The acid gases, if present, {{are removed}} by {{membrane}} or amine treating {{can then be}} routed into a sulfur recovery unit which converts the hydrogen sulfide in the acid gas into either elemental sulfur or sulfuric acid.

2500|$|During the Second World War, Germany {{used the}} code names W Salt, SH Salt, K-method, the E-method and the KA-method. These names {{represented}} {{the identities of}} the developers of the various chemical routes to RDX. The W-method was developed by Wolfram in 1934 and gave RDX the code name [...] "W-Salz". It used sulfamic acid, formaldehyde, and nitric acid. SH-Salz (SH salt) was from Schnurr who developed a batch-process in 1937–38 based on nitrolysis of hexamine. The K-method, from Knöffler, involved addition of ammonium nitrate to the hexamine/nitric <b>acid</b> <b>process.</b> The E-method, developed by Ebele, proved to be identical to the Ross and Schiessler process described below. The KA-method, also developed by Knöffler, and turned out to be identical to the Bachmann process described below.|$|E

30|$|A key {{advantage}} of acid pretreatment {{is that a}} subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis step is sometimes not required, as the acid itself hydrolyses the biomass to yield fermentable sugars (Zhu et al. 2009). A mixture of H 2 SO 4 and acetic acid resulted in 90 % saccharification (DeMoraes-Racha et al. 2010). Hemicellulose and lignin are solubilized with minimal degradation, and the hemicellulose is converted to sugars with acid pretreatment. The major drawback to these <b>acid</b> <b>processes</b> {{is the cost of}} acid and the requirement to neutralize the acid after treatment.|$|R

40|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>processes</b> in the atmosphere, {{particularly}} those caused by anthropogenic acid gases, {{increase the amount}} of bioavailable P in dust and hence are predicted to increase microbial biomass and primary productivity when supplied to oceanic surface waters. This is likely to be particularly important in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS), which is P limited during the winter bloom and N&P co-limited for phytoplankton in summer. However, {{it is not clear how}} the <b>acid</b> <b>processes</b> acting on Saharan dust will affect the microbial biomass and primary productivity in the EMS. Here, we carried out bioassay manipulations on EMS surface water on which Saharan dust was added as dust (Z), acid treated dust (ZA), dust plus excess N (ZN) and acid treated dust with excess N (ZNA) during springtime (May 2012) and measured bacterioplankton biomass, metabolic and other relevant chemical and biological parameters. We show that acid treatment of Saharan dust increased the amount of bioavailable P supplied by a factor of ~ 40 compared to non-acidified dust (18. 4 nmoles P mg- 1 dust vs. 0. 45 nmoles P mg- 1 dust, respectively). The increase in chlorophyll, primary and bacterial productivity for treatments Z and ZA were controlled by the amount of N added with the dust while those for treatments ZN and ZNA (in which excessive N was added) were controlled by the amount of P added. These results confirm that the surface waters were N&P co-limited for phytoplankton during springtime. However, total chlorophyll and primary productivity in the acid treated dust additions (ZA and ZNA) were less than predicted from that calculated from the amount of the potentially limiting nutrient added. This biological inhibition was interpreted as being due to labile trace metals being added with the acidified dust. A probable cause for this biological inhibition was the addition of dissolved Al, which forms potentially toxic Al nanoparticles when added to seawater. Thus, the effect of anthropogenic <b>acid</b> <b>processes</b> in the atmosphere, while increasing the flux of bioavailable P from dust to the surface ocean, may also add toxic trace metals such as Al, which moderate the fertilizing effect of the added nutrients...|$|R
