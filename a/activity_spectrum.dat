The type of multi‐targeted pharmacological approach necessary to address a complex multifaceted disease such as aging might take advantage of pleiotropic natural polyphenols affecting {{a wide variety of}} biological processes. We have recently postulated that the secoiridoids oleuropein aglycone (OA) and decarboxymethyl oleuropein aglycone (DOA), two complex polyphenols present in health‐promoting extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), might constitute a new family of plant‐produced gerosuppressant agents. This paper describes an analysis of the biological <b>activity</b> <b>spectra</b> (BAS) of OA and DOA using PASS (Prediction of <b>Activity</b> <b>Spectra</b> for Substances) software. PASS can predict thousands of biological activities, as the BAS of a compound is an intrinsic property that is largely dependent on the compound"s structure and reflects pharmacological effects, physiological and biochemical mechanisms of action, and specific toxicities. Using Pharmaexpert, a tool that analyzes the PASS‐predicted BAS of substances based on thousands of"mechanism‐ effect" and"effect‐mechanism" relationships, we illuminate hypothesis‐generating pharmacological effects, mechanisms of action, and targets that might underlie the anti‐aging/anti‐cancer activities of the gerosuppressant EVOO oleuropeins...|$|R
