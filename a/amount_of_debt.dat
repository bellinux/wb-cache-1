Households also took on a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was exacerbated by {{the practice of the}} Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E

25|$|General Motors Corporation {{was formed}} on September 16, 1908, in Flint, Michigan, as a holding company {{controlled}} by William C. Durant, owner of Buick. At {{the beginning of}} the 20th century, there were fewer than 8,000 automobiles in America, and Durant had become a leading manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in Flint before making his foray into the automotive industry in 1904 by purchasing the fledgling Buick Motor Company. GM's co-founder was Charles Stewart Mott, whose carriage company was merged into Buick prior to GM's creation. Over the years, Mott became the largest single stockholder in GM, and spent his life with his Mott Foundation, which has benefited the city of Flint, his adopted home. GM acquired Oldsmobile later that year. In 1909, Durant brought in Cadillac, Elmore, Oakland, and several others. Also in 1909, GM acquired the Reliance Motor Truck Company of Owosso, Michigan, and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, the predecessors of GMC Truck. Durant, along with R. S. McLaughlin, lost control of GM in 1910 to a bankers' trust, because of the large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> taken on in its acquisitions, coupled with a collapse in new vehicle sales.|$|E

500|$|Since the 1970s, {{tuition at}} Cornell and other Ivy League schools has grown {{much faster than}} inflation. [...] This trend coincided with the {{creation}} of Federally guaranteed student loan programs. [...] At the same time, the endowments of these schools continue to grow due to gifts and successful investments. [...] Critics called for universities to keep their tuition at affordable levels and to not hoard endowment earnings. [...] As a result, in 2008, Cornell and other Ivy Schools decided to increase the spending of endowment earnings in order to subsidize tuition for low and middle income families, reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> that Cornell students will incur. Cornell also placed a priority to soliciting endowed scholarships for undergraduates. In fall 2007, Cornell had 1,863 undergraduates (14% of all undergraduates) receiving federal Pell Grants.

[...] Upon his appointment, O'Reilly travelled to Adelaide, where {{he met with the}} Archbishop of Adelaide Christopher Reynolds and the Cardinal of Sydney Patrick Moran to discuss the formation of the new diocese.

To ensure a sufficiently large population for the new diocese, Moran suggested that its boundaries be altered from those drawn up by the Pope, but Reynolds opposed this plan.

500|$|In 1873, a {{business}} depression (known as the Panic of 1873), increased {{the pressure for}} retaining greenbacks, as some in Congress believed that inflating the currency would ease the economic problems. [...] Grant's Treasury Secretary, William Adams Richardson, reissued $26 million of the redeemed greenbacks, reversing the administration's previous policy of removing them from circulation. [...] This ignited a four-month debate in the Senate over whether and when the government should return to backing all of its currency with gold—including the remaining greenbacks. [...] The majority, including Bayard, favored resumption, but in wording the resolution that passed the Senate, Republican John Sherman of Ohio left vague the exact timing; Bayard feared it would be put off indefinitely. [...] The Sherman bill also proposed to remove greenbacks from circulation by exchanging them for bonds payable in gold; in response, Bayard proposed an amendment limiting the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> the government could incur. [...] When the amendment was rejected, Bayard voted against the bill (known as the Specie Payment Resumption Act,) believing that it was likely to cause inflation.|$|E

500|$|The Economist {{provides}} a somewhat modified approach to saving the euro in that [...] "a limited version of federalisation could be less miserable solution than break-up of the euro". The recipe to this tricky {{combination of the}} limited federalisation, greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting the fiscal integration. In order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy, the overindebted countries require [...] "access to money and for banks to have a [...] "safe" [...] euro-wide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country" [...] which could be obtained by [...] "narrower Eurobond that mutualises a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> for {{a limited amount of}} time". The proposition made by German Council of Economic Experts provides detailed blue print to mutualise the current debts of all euro-zone economies above 60% of their GDP. Instead of the break-up and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro-zone governments, [...] "everybody, from Germany (debt: 81% of GDP) to Italy (120%) would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the 60% threshold. The new mutualised-bond market, worth some €2.3 trillion, would be paid off over the next 25 years. Each country would pledge a specified tax (such as a VAT surcharge) to provide the cash." [...] So far, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed all forms of mutualisation.|$|E
500|$|Multiple {{allegations}} of forgery were brought against Pleydell in the Court of Chancery. Although {{the circumstances of}} many are unknown, a significant suit was initiated by Member for Chippenham Francis Newdigate {{at the start of}} the 1563 parliamentary session, when Pleydell is known to have been in a considerable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> Newdigate, second husband of Anne Seymour (Pleydell's employer), accused Pleydell of forgery with regard to the manor of Monkton in his constituency, which his spouse owned and Gabriel had leased since 1559. Details are unclear, but Newdigate introduced the case to the House of Commons between 11 and 27 February 1563, probably in light of discussion surrounding the proposed Forgery Act 1563 (5 Eliz.1 c.14). On 22 March, the Commons assembled a committee made up of Recorder of London Richard Onslow, Sir Nicholas Arnold, Walter Haddon, Thomas Norton and Master of the Rolls Sir William Cordell to investigate Newdigate's suspicions. Cordell's involvement as an official of the judiciary may indicate that Pleydell had again claimed parliamentary privilege against Newdigate's allegations, since the case was heard in the Court of Chancery while he was a sitting Member for Wootton Bassett. The committee expressed [...] "great and vehement suspicion" [...] of Pleydell in a report which he read and answered. On 10 April the House ordered that copies of committee documents should be given to Pleydell and Newdigate and that Pleydell's evidence would be kept by the Commons, and no further mention of the affair is evident.|$|E
