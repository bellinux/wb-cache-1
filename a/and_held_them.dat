5|$|Hokies {{tailback}} Darren Evans {{ran for a}} school-record of 253yards, and exceeded 100rushing {{yards in}} a game {{for the first time}} in his career. The Hokie defense shut down the Terrapins running game <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> to 12yards on 18carries. Maryland also proved unable or unwilling to blitz against Sean Glennon, the Tech quarterback hobbled by an ankle injury. Glennon threw for 127yards and a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Maryland beat 20th-ranked Baylor, 20–6, with Tamburello {{passing for}} two touchdowns. Maryland then defeated Wake Forest, 28–7, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> to nine rushing yards. Against , they allowed 18 {{yards on the}} ground. Vereb scored three touchdowns and made an interception, but the Tar Heels scored under unusual circumstances when center Jim Jones stripped Tamburello and returned it 35 yards. The final result was 25–7.|$|E
5|$|During 2002, The Hurricane won the WWF Hardcore Championship at WrestleMania X8, but Molly betrayed him, {{hitting him}} {{in the back of the}} head with a frying pan, and {{defeating}} him for the championship. Helms was later drafted to the SmackDown! brand following the brand extension, and he won the Cruiserweight Championship from Tajiri and Billy Kidman in a triple threat match. He lost it to Jamie Noble at King of the Ring. Later in 2002, he was traded to Raw, won the World Tag Team Championship with Kane, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> for around a month in an alliance known as Hurri-Kane.|$|E

5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{agreement}} was ineffective in the meantime. The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister Tran Huy Lieu <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Giáp and Lieu from the cabinet. As a result, the VNQDD's Vũ Hồng Khanh became defence minister, with Giap as his deputy. What the VNQDD and other non-communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power-sharing agreement {{turned out to be}} a ruse. Every non-communist minister had a communist deputy, and if the former refused to approve a decree, the Vietminh official would do so. Many ministers were excluded from knowing the details of their portfolio; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings. In one case, the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle. Meanwhile, Giáp was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank in the coalition government. Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information, he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events.|$|E
5|$|In 1783, the Kodavas {{erupted in}} revolt against Tipu and threw their forces out of Coorg. In 1785, he marched into Mercara {{the capital of}} Coorg and {{addressed}} them. He showed racial and religious bias by stating that the Kodavas were guilty of polyandry in a speech before a gathering of Kodavas. He mistook the patrilineal patriarchal Kodavas to be a sub-group of matriarchal Nairs. He threatened {{that he would not}} revile or molest a single individual among them, but instead make Ahmadis (Muslims) out of the whole of them; transplanting them from their homeland in the Coorg to Seringapatam. This inflammatory speech with false accusations of polyandry and an open threat angered the Kodavas who thereafter hated Tipu and again revolted against him. Tipu seized nearly 70,000 Hindus of Coorg along with their king, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> captive at Seringapatam. They were also forcibly converted to Islam and received the same harsh treatment as the Mangalorean Catholics. From 1786 until 1789, even the Nairs of Malabar were captured and deported to Seringapatam.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Nathaniel Branden {{established}} Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), {{to promote}} Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published {{some of these}} articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions {{on a wide range}} of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.|$|E
5|$|Pugliese's {{next major}} success {{came in the}} WWWF, {{where he had been}} wrestling {{sporadically}} since 1970 under the ring name Tony Parisi. He teamed with Gino Brito, who was wrestling as Louis Cerdan, to win the WWWF World Tag Team Championship on November 18, 1975. They defeated The Blackjacks (Blackjack Mulligan and Blackjack Lanza) to win the belts <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> for over six months. They eventually dropped the title in a match against The Executioners (a team composed of Killer Kowalski and Big John Studd, who wore masks to hide their identities) on May 11, 1976. Also in 1976, Parisi teamed with champion Bruno Sammartino in Madison Square Garden to defeat Ivan Koloff and Superstar Billy Graham.When the promotion (which had since been renamed the World Wrestling Federation) decided to reactivate the WWF International Heavyweight Championship in 1982, Parisi became the new champion. He lost the belt to his former partner, Gino Brito, that August.|$|E
5|$|The club had a {{slow start}} to the 1967–68 season but soon picked up, {{particularly}} so with a 7–0 victory over Chelsea, though for the second successive season they ended up in fourth spot. Success instead came from the cup competitions, as they first knocked out Luton Town, Bury, Sunderland, Stoke City and Derby County {{en route to the}} final against Arsenal at Wembley; Leeds won the game 1–0 in a dour defensive manner but striker Jimmy Greenhoff later said it was the most memorable of the club's trophies due to it being the first such success. The second soon followed, despite a disappointment of exiting the FA Cup at the semi-final stage with defeat by Everton, as they reached the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by beating CA Spora (Luxembourg), FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland), and Dundee (Scotland). They beat Ferencvárosi (Hungary) 1–0 at Elland Road <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> to a 0–0 draw at Népstadion to win the club's first European trophy.|$|E
25|$|Government {{security}} forces used {{the pretext of}} state security to arbitrarily arrest individuals.

5|$|The {{school has}} one main church, St Peter's, and five chapels: the Boys' Chapel, the Chapel of the Angels, the Sodality Chapel, the St Francis Chapel and the St Ignatius Chapel. The last two are {{both within the}} towers of St Peter's Church, and are not {{normally}} used by pupils. The Sodality Chapel {{is the home of}} the relics of the 3rd-century Roman convert St Gordianus. The Jesuits brought his remains from the College of St Omer <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> beneath the altar since 1859. His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 whilst the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned. The chapel is again used by the re-established Sodality. Adjacent to the Old Infirmary is the Rosary Garden, a place for spiritual contemplation, at the centre of which is a stone statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E
5|$|Their time in Japan {{was only}} {{the first of many}} {{international}} tours for these third generation Kangaroos; they worked all over Asia as well as in Costello's homeland of Australia. In 1969, the Kangaroos wrestled for the newly created Eastern Sports Association (ESA) out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they were once again recognized as champions on their arrival, becoming the inaugural holders of the ESA International Tag Team Championship. On 5 August 1969, the Kangaroos dropped the titles to Eastern Sports Association mainstays The Beast and Rudy Kay. In 1970, they joined Dick the Bruiser’s World Wrestling Association (WWA), where they competed regularly for nearly two years. On 26 December 1970 Costello and Kent defeated WWA World Tag Team Champions Dick the Bruiser and Bill Miller to claim the tag titles. The Kangaroos used every dirty tactic {{to hold on to the}} gold for six months before losing the titles to Wilbur Snyder and Moose Cholak. On 18 June 1971, the Kangaroos regained the titles, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>them</b> for just over two months before Wilbur Snyder and Paul Christy beat them for their straps. After leaving the WWA, Costello and Kent made a few appearances in New York for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), a promotion the original Fabulous Kangaroos (Al Costello and Roy Hefferman) had previously worked for under the company's former name, Capitol Wrestling. In one of their headline appearances at Madison Square Garden, the Kangaroos wrestled to a 45-minute time limit draw against Terry and Dory Funk, Sr..|$|E
