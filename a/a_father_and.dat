5|$|P.exclamans are haplodiploid insects, as {{are other}} Polistes species {{including}} Polistes metricus, Polistes dominula, and Polistes annularis. This means they have haploid males that produce identical haploid sperm, and diploid females that produce haploid eggs through meiosis. This has consequences for genetic relatedness within colonies, since sisters receive identical sperm if they share <b>a</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> the normal half identical contribution from the mother. This results in sex-biased {{conflicts between the}} queen and the workers {{with respect to the}} sex ratio, with workers preferring a more female biased sex ratio, and queens preferring equal investment in queens and males.|$|E

5|$|A C Benson was {{a friend}} of Henry James, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson's encouragement.

They developed a close friendship, described by James's biographer Leon Edel as resembling <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé's early efforts. According to Somerset Maugham, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man's devotion was couched in extravagant terms.|$|E

5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote {{a defense}} of his {{decision}} to duel {{while at the same}} time intending to throw away his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His desire to be available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E
