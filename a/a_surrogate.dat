5|$|The {{technique}} of using flashbacks {{had been used}} in earlier films—most notably in The Power and the Glory (1933)—but no film was as immersed in this technique as Citizen Kane.

5|$|An item of {{discussion}} between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise {{that he had}} accepted Rose as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> daughter. The Doctor's intended reply to Rose was also discussed; Davies, who left the reply unspecified, stated he didn't know when asked by Collinson on the episode's commentary track, and Gardner vehemently believed the Doctor would reciprocate Rose's love.|$|E

5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> audience.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{had three}} more {{children}} with Olivia. As money was now tight, Olivia insisted that her stepchildren {{put to work}} rather than receive schooling. The Colt brothers became attached to their one surviving sister, Sarah Ann, who acted as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> mother of sorts, until she was sent off to a relative's house {{to work as a}} menial.

After an intense fight, in which Jacob and Mulder are both wounded, Ariel declares her love for Isaac and returns the creature to dust.|$|E
5|$|Miles' storylines {{have often}} centred on his friendships and romantic {{relationships}} with other characters. He has become <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> father to several teenagers, including Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). Miles and Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) had a long relationship together, during which they lost an unborn child. Kirsty eventually left town, ending their relationship. After sharing a long friendship, Miles and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) entered into a romantic relationship in 2011. Leah becomes pregnant and Miles proposes to her. Miles has earned a generally positive reception, while Quong Tart has been nominated for three Inside Soap Awards.|$|E

40|$|A {{holy grail}} of {{conservation}} {{is to find}} simple but reliable measures of environmental change to guide management. For example, particular species or particular habitat attributes are often used as proxies for the abundance or diversity of a subset of other taxa. However, the efficacy of such kinds of species-based surrogates and habitat-based surrogates is rarely assessed, nor are different kinds of surrogates compared {{in terms of their}} relative effectiveness. We use 30 -year datasets on arboreal marsupials and vegetation structure to quantify the effectiveness of: (1) the abundance of a particular species of arboreal marsupial as <b>a</b> species-based <b>surrogate</b> for other arboreal marsupial taxa, (2) hollow-bearing tree abundance as <b>a</b> habitat-based <b>surrogate</b> for arboreal marsupial abundance, and (3) a combination of species- and habitat-based surrogates. We also quantify the robustness of species-based and habitat-based surrogates over time. We then use the same approach to model overall species richness of arboreal marsupials. We show that <b>a</b> species-based <b>surrogate</b> can appear to be <b>a</b> valid <b>surrogate</b> until <b>a</b> habitat-based <b>surrogate</b> is co-examined, after which the effectiveness of the former is lost. The addition of <b>a</b> species-based <b>surrogate</b> to <b>a</b> habitat-based <b>surrogate</b> made little difference in explaining arboreal marsupial abundance, but altered the co-occurrence relationship between species. Hence, there was limited value in simultaneously using a combination of kinds of surrogates. The habitat-based surrogate also generally performed significantly better and was easier and less costly to gather than the species-based surrogate. We found that over 30 years of study, the relationship...|$|R
5|$|On July 14, 2012, Barr came in second, {{losing the}} {{nomination}} to Jill Stein. Stein chose Cheri Honkala as her running-mate despite suggestions {{that she could}} choose Barr. Barr was given a prime speaking role at the Green Party National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, but decided to instead send <b>a</b> <b>surrogate,</b> (Farheen Hakeem), to speak on her behalf. Barr's surrogate reportedly chided the party for not respecting Barr's candidacy. A shouting match in a hallway reportedly ensued. Barr repeatedly criticized Jill Stein after losing the Green Party nomination, and caused controversy by using alleged transphobic words in statements about Stein on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|Other divinities also employ surrogates to {{meet their}} own needs. In the Puranas, Sati commits suicide by immolating herself when Shiva is insulted and is reborn as Parvati and becomes Shiva's consort again. In a later Sanskrit text, Sati creates <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> who burns herself, while the real Sati is reborn as Parvati. In the Mahabharata, the goddess Svaha assumes the form of six of the wives of the Saptarishi (seven great sages), with whom Agni is in love with, and has coitus with him. Later, Svaha marries Agni.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe to act as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a {{friendly}} favor and he would raise it.

Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s testes while placing {{stem cells from}} a second ram into the testes of the first, ram A.

Ram A therefore has effectively become <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> ram.|$|E

5|$|With {{relation}} to the human characters, David was conceptualized as not only <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> son for Peter Weyland, but {{as a replacement for}} Weyland's estranged daughter, Meredith Vickers. The actress who portrayed Vickers, Charlize Theron, detailed that Ridley Scott perceived Weyland's family and his company, the Weyland Corporation, as being male-dominated, with Vickers' shared DNA being the only attachment. This runs counter to David, who is a synthetic male created to supplant Vickers and uphold the family's patriarchy. Throughout the eight-month rewrite process leading directly into principal photography, Damon Lindelof focused on enhancing David's bondage to Weyland and the Prometheus- despite David being designed to be <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> son, he would actually be a proverbial captive to the master and his ship. With Weyland's death {{at the hands of the}} awakened Engineer, David's programming has run its course and every action he takes from thereon out is by his own volition, essentially freeing him. A philosophical element Scott raised about the David 8 model is that he exemplifies the dangers of making an android sentient- with him having the capacity for free will and the ability to create, he crosses a moral boundary that other androids stay within. The contrast between David and the others androids was developed further in , with the creation of the physically identical character Walter, who was made more robotic and unable to create on his own.|$|E
