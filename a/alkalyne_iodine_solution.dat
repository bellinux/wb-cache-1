50|$|<b>Iodine</b> <b>solution</b> {{is used to}} {{sanitize}} {{the surface}} of fruit and vegetables for bacteria and virus. The common concentration for sanitization is 25 ppm idophor for 1 minute.

But, oocytes of protozoan parasites will not be killed, {{and it is also}} doubtful that bacterial spores are killed. <b>Iodine</b> <b>solutions</b> should not be considered able to sanitize or disinfect salad, fruit or vegetables that are contaminated by feces. Thus, it should not be considered safe to eat raw fruit, salads and vegetables which are sanitized with iodine, if they could be contaminated by feces.|$|R
40|$|Objective. Hyperthyroidism {{has been}} {{described}} as elevated serum free T 3 and/or free T 4 levels with decreased thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations. The main causes are related to autoimmune and neoplastic pathology. However, it might be caused due to a long-term topical exposure (<b>iodine</b> <b>solution</b> dressing) or by intravenous administration of iodine-containing substances. Both clinical and laboratory features might be presented. The main management is based on interruption of all exposures with <b>iodine</b> <b>solutions</b> and also antithyroid medicine in case of severe laboratory and clinical disturbances. Data Sources. We present a case of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism in a critically ill ICU patient caused by excessive <b>iodine</b> containing antiseptic <b>solution</b> washes and contrast agent administration.
