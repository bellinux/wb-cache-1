25|$|It is {{important}} to note that constructivism is not a particular pedagogy. In fact, constructivism is a theory describing how learning happens, regardless of whether learners <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> experiences to understand a lecture or following the instructions for building a model airplane. In both cases, the theory of constructivism suggests that learners construct knowledge out of their experiences.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-fourteenth century a misericord at Gloucester cathedral, England shows {{two young}} men playing a ball game. It looks as though they <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> hands for the game; however, kicking {{certainly}} cannot be excluded. It is notable {{for the fact that}} most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used.|$|E
25|$|Shareholders and investors, through {{socially}} responsible investing, <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> capital to encourage behavior they consider responsible. However, definitions {{of what constitutes}} ethical behavior vary. For example, some religious investors in the US have withdrawn investment from companies that violate their religious views, while secular investors divest from companies that they see as imposing religious views on workers or customers.|$|E

25|$|When {{an older}} {{individual}} is completing a task, {{such as having}} a conversation or doing work, they <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> working memory to help them complete this task. As they age, their ability to multi-task seems to decline; thus after an interruption it is often more difficult for an aging individual to successfully finish the task at hand. Additionally, working memory {{plays a role in}} the comprehension and production of speech. There is often a decline in sentence comprehension and sentence production as individuals age. Rather than linking this decline directly to deficits in linguistic ability, it is actually deficits in working memory that contribute to these decreasing language skills.|$|E
25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and {{the indignity of}} their situations was directly related to easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E
25|$|User {{privacy in}} China {{is not as}} cut-and-dry {{as it is in}} other parts of the world. China, reportedly, has a much more {{invasive}} policy when Internet activity involves the Chinese government. For this reason, search engines are under constant pressure to conform to Chinese rules and regulations on censorship while still attempting to keep their integrity. Therefore, most search engines operate differently in China than in the other countries, such as the US or Britain, if they operate in China at all. There are two types of intrusions that occur in China regarding the internet: the alleged intrusion of the company providing users with Internet service, and the alleged intrusion of the Chinese government. The intrusion allegations made against companies providing users with Internet service are based upon reports that companies, such as Yahoo! in the previous example, <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> access to the internet users' private information to track and monitor users' Internet activity. The claims made against the Chinese government lies in the fact that the government is forcing Internet-based companies to track users private online data without the user knowing that they are being monitored. Both alleged intrusions are relatively harsh and possibly force foreign Internet service providers to decide if they value the Chinese market over internet privacy. Also, many websites are blocked in China such as Facebook and Twitter. However many Chinese internet users use special methods like a VPN to unblock websites that are blocked.|$|E

Likewise, AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album four stars out of five and wrote: [...] "Van Halen <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> history to revive their present and they succeed surprisingly well on A Different Kind of Truth." [...] The A.V. Club's Steven Hyden stated, [...] "After so many years of fumbling dysfunction that reduced the once-proud Van Halen name to a laughingstock, A Different Kind Of Truth matters because it's a reminder of why this band mattered," [...] while noting that, [...] "Roth deserves some of the credit for that. For whatever reason, when Roth is in the band, Eddie Van Halen plays guitar like the world wants him to play guitar." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Rob Sheffield stating, [...] "Van Halen's 'heard you missed us, we're back' album is not only the most long-awaited reunion joint in the history of reunion joints, it is – against all reasonable expectations – a real Van Halen album." ...|$|E

In Chomsky's view {{there is little reason}} to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation [...] "intellectual" [...] obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: [...] "These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities. [...] There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine—in fact, I think the opposite.... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people who <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> minds, then it's all over society" [...] (Understanding Power, p.96).|$|E
