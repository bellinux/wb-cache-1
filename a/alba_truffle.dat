5000|$|The world's most {{expensive}} truffle, a 1.51 kilogram rare White <b>Alba</b> <b>truffle,</b> was sold for 125,000 Euros (Hong Kong Dollar $1,250,000; US $160,000) on 13 November 2006 to Gordon Wu, who planned a charity dinner party at Toscana Restaurant at Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong. This price beats the previous world record of 95,000 Euros for a 1.21 kilogram White <b>Alba</b> <b>truffle</b> in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Some truffle oils {{are made}} with truffle {{residues}} incurred during collection or preparation for sale. Many truffle oils sold in retail markets are not made from truffles, but instead use manufactured aromatic compounds including 2,4-dithiapentane (a prominent aroma active compound found in truffles) with an oil base. There are no regulations regarding the labeling of 2,4-dithiapentane, and it can legally be called truffle aroma, truffle flavor, truffle concentrate or other similar terms {{even though it is}} not extracted from truffles. In the United States, the ingredient may use the modifiers [...] "organic" [...] or [...] "natural" [...] as long as the components meet the federal requirements for those terms. Truffle oils range from clear to cloudy, and yellow to green, depending on the base oil used. Some include a piece of truffle in the bottle. These pieces can be from any of over 200 different truffle species, and may be listed as [...] "black truffle" [...] or [...] "white truffle" [...] even if not one of prized culinary varietals such as the black Périgord or white <b>Alba</b> <b>truffle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Northern Italy, mountainous in many parts, {{is notable}} for the alpine cheeses of the Valle d'Aosta, the pesto of Liguria, and, in Piedmonte, the <b>Alba</b> <b>truffle.</b> In the Alto Adige, the {{influence}} of neighboring Austria {{may be found in}} a regional repertoire that includes speck and dumplings. In the north, risotto and polenta have tended to serve the staple function taken by pasta across the rest of the country. Italy's center includes the celebrated culinary regions of Tuscany — famous for its olive oil and bean dishes — and Emilia-Romagna — home of prosciutto di Parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and ragù — the latter now produced (and traduced) worldwide as spaghetti alla bolognese. Southern Italy includes the hearty food of Lazio in which meat and offal frequently figure, but also the vegetable-focused fare of Basilicata, historically one of Italy's poorest regions. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia have distinctively different foodways. The former is notable for its many sweet dishes, seafood, and citrus fruit, while Sardinian cuisine has traditionally looked to its hilly interior with a cuisine centered on lamb, sucking pig, breads, and pecorino sardo. It is in the food of Naples and Campania, however, that many visitors would recognize the foods that have come to be regarded as quintessentially Italian: pizza, spaghetti with tomato sauce, aubergine parmigiana (but the origins of the two last dishes are claimed by Sicily).|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, a White <b>Alba’s</b> <b>Truffle</b> {{weighing}} in at 4.16 pounds or 1.89 kilos was unearthed in the Umbrian region of Italy by the Balestra Family of Sabatino. It was auctioned at Sotheby’s in New York. While some had {{expected it to}} sell for $1 million, it was sold for $61,000 to a Taiwanese buyer.|$|R
40|$|We {{observe the}} change of {{aromatic}} compounds in the headspace of white <b>truffles</b> (<b>Alba’s</b> <b>Truffle)</b> after storage at + 4 °C {{over a period of}} a few days. Measurements have been performed using SPME-GC-MS technique and the Pico 2 -electronic nose (EN) developed at Sensor Lab. in Brescia. The EN shows a very high sensitivity towards the truffle’s relevant molecules such as 2, 4 -dithiapentane and is able to detect gasses from truffle samples up to a mass of the order of 10 mg. As for truffle aging, results obtained with both techniques are strongly correlated and confirm that there is a variation of the truffle’s headspace after circa 5 days...|$|R
30|$|True truffles, {{belonging}} to the genus Tuber (Tuberaceae, Pezizales, Pezizomycetes), produce hypogeous ascocarps, which are formed in soil or sometimes within layers of leaf litter. They have {{lost the ability to}} actively discharge ascospores (Bonito and Smith 2016). They are symbiotic fungi that develop association with fine roots of specific host trees (T. oregonense Trappe, Bonito and P. Rawl. with Douglas fir) or broad host ranges (T. aestivum (Wulfen:Fr.) Spreng. with some plant species in Betulaceae, Corylaceae, Fagaceae, Tiliaceae, Pinaceae and Cistaceae) (Hall et al. 2007). The unique aroma makes some species greatly sought after as high-end culinary ingredients throughout the world, especially in Europe (Hall et al. 2007). The scarcity and irreplaceably scent of French Périgord black truffle (T. melanosporum Vittad.) and Italian <b>Alba</b> white <b>truffle</b> (T. magnatum Pico.) render them among the most famous and demanding truffles in the world (Hall et al. 2007; Bonito et al. 2010 a).|$|R
