25|$|The {{genesis of}} Zack and Miri {{has been in}} Kevin Smith's mind since the '90s. Two porn {{centered}} projects were in development. One was a film called Name. It {{was intended to be}} a follow up (not a sequel) to Chasing Amy and would've starred the trio from that movie, Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, and Joey Lauren Adams and to be set in the View Askewniverse. But the project wasn't made, and was replaced with Dogma. The second attempt was in 1997 as a failed 22 episode series titled Hiatus. The series would've starred Lee again, and was about a man returning home after being away in California and leading a double life as <b>a</b> <b>porn</b> star. When he pitched the series to tv networks, they all rejected the idea believing that the kind of material handed to them can never happen on television. But he kept the idea in mind and wrote a script following Clerks II that would be porn-bent.|$|E
