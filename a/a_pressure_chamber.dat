25|$|The {{equipment}} {{required for}} hyperbaric oxygen treatment consists of <b>a</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber,</b> {{which may be}} of rigid or flexible construction, and a means of delivering 100% oxygen. Operation is performed to a predetermined schedule by trained personnel who monitor the patient and may adjust the schedule as required. HBOT found early use {{in the treatment of}} decompression sickness, and has also shown great effectiveness in treating conditions such as gas gangrene and carbon monoxide poisoning. More recent research has examined the possibility that it may also have value for other conditions such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, but no significant evidence has been found.|$|E
25|$|MacInnis {{first learned}} to scuba dive in 1954 {{in the waters}} off Florida. He {{attended}} the University of Toronto, {{where he was the}} captain of the swim team in the mid-1950s. MacInnis held the Canadian record for the breaststroke and tried unsuccessfully to make the Canadian Olympic team in 1956. MacInnis received his MD from the University of Toronto in 1962. He spent his internship at the Toronto General Hospital, where an experience with a tunnel construction worker suffering from decompression sickness helped to point MacInnis toward his post-graduate studies in diving medicine. MacInnis arranged for the worker, John McGean, to be transported to <b>a</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> in Buffalo, New York, where he was successfully treated. MacInnis also interned at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.|$|E
25|$|After check-in, all {{checked baggage}} is {{screened}} using sophisticated X-ray and CT scanners {{and put in}} <b>a</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> to trigger any possible explosive devices. Following the check-in process, passengers continue to personal security and passport control. Before passing through the metal detectors and putting carry-on baggage through the X-ray machine at the security checkpoint, passports and boarding passes are re-inspected and additional questions may be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are verified once again. Security procedures for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by passport control depending on country of origin, or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited countries at war with Israel (all Arab countries except Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania and Qatar) {{will be subject to}} further questioning.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} phase of testing, called Pressure Testing, {{candidates}} who have successfully performed the Valsalva maneuver will be subjected to increased ambient pressure. [...] This test is performed under the supervision of a diving-certified medical doctor. [...] All testees enter <b>a</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber,</b> accompanied by the doctor, and the 'tank' is sealed. [...] Typically, there is in the chamber a somewhat surprising object: an inflated volleyball, water polo ball or similar inflated ball. [...] Upon sealing the tank, pressure is increased, while the testees equalise their eardrum pressure. [...] (if any testee is unable to 'Valsalva', the test stops, and pressure is slowly released.) [...] Pressure builds within the chamber until the chamber is equal to water pressure at [...] "escape depth". [...] At this point, the chamber feels very warm and dry, and the volleyball has become compressed enough that it has become the shape of a bowl, and appears to have been emptied of air, due to the greatly increased air pressure inside of the tank. [...] Sounds inside the tank at pressure sound as if they are [...] "far away".|$|E

5000|$|One type {{of passive}} trimmer uses <b>a</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> to enable {{resistor}} trimming {{in a single}} run. The LTCC boards are contacted by test probes on the assembly side and trimmed with a laser beam from the resistor side. This trimming method requires no contact points between the resistances, because the fine pitch adapter contacts the component {{on the opposite side}} of where the trimming occurs. Therefore, the LTCC can be arranged more compactly and less expensively.|$|E
