5|$|In {{addition}} to litigation work, Weiquan lawyers like Gao Zhisheng have also advocated publicly {{and in the}} media for human rights for Falun Gong.

In response, Gao lost his legal license, was put under house arrest, detained, and was reportedly tortured.|$|E

40|$|The women {{folks in}} Nigeria are {{generally}} vulnerable to male-perpetrated violence. Apart from political marginalization, Nigerian women {{are victims of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> cultural violence.

In addressing these concerns the study utilized a field surveyed questionnaire to elicit primary data from 510 randomly selected women widows. The findings revealed that widows in Nigeria are subjected to harmful traditional practices <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuses.</b> Based on the findings it was recommended that the issue of <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> of widows should not be overlooked if HIV/AIDS prevention is to be effective <b>and</b> that preventing <b>sexual</b> violence <b>and</b> HIV/AIDS will necessitate a cultural shift in terms of gender-role expectation in Nigeria...|$|R

5|$|When parents die of HIV/AIDS, {{extended}} family members usually become the children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives. Extended family members often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans; however, some sources indicate that {{extended family}} members mistreat orphans whose parents {{have died from}} HIV/AIDS. For example, family members {{who are unable to}} support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become victims of domestic violence <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, the {{government}} made a Statement of Reconciliation– including an apology {{to those people}} who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schools– and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF). The Foundation was provided with $350million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> In its 2005 budget, the Canadian government committed an additional $40million to support the work of the AHF. Federal funding for the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget. The AHF closed in 2014. Former AHF executive director Mike DeGagne has said that the loss of AHF support has created a gap in dealing with mental health crises such as suicides in the Attawapiskat First Nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{residential}} school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by removing {{them from their}} families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, exposing many of them to physical <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> and forcibly enfranchising them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the {{residential school}} system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system {{has been linked to}} an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide, which persist within Indigenous communities.|$|E

5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E
