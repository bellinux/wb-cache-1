Acknowledging Starr's achievement, Lennon sent him a telegram that read: [...] "Congratulations. How dare you? <b>And</b> <b>please</b> write me a hit song." [...] Lennon pushed for [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] to be issued as the third single off the album in the United States, but [...] "Oh My My", written by Starr and Vini Poncia, was chosen instead.|$|E

[...] Inari-zushi, a Japanese sushi roll of packaged fried tofu, is another popular offering. [...] Fried tofu {{is believed to be}} a favorite food of Japanese foxes, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association. [...] Priests do not normally offer these foods to the deity, but it is common for shops that line the approach to an Inari shrine to sell fried tofu for devotees to offer. [...] Fox statues are often offered to Inari shrines by worshippers, and on occasion a stuffed and mounted fox is presented to a temple. [...] At one time, some temples were home to live foxes that were venerated, but this is not current practice.|$|E
500|$|The third quatrain {{continues}} {{the metaphor of}} the nightingale and seasonal imagery to further stress that the poet's silence is not because their love is less pleasant. The nightingale is used as a metaphor to explain that just because he doesn't flatter the Fair Youth, doesn't mean that he loves less. As one scholar put it, [...] "too much praise ceases to please". The poet explains his silence further in line 11, that the wild birds physically burden the tree branches as well as crowd the air with their songs. This may represent the myriad of love sonnets being published in attempt to flatter <b>and</b> <b>please</b> their muses. A similar interpretation of line 12 by Katherine Duncan-Jones is given, in which she claims that the poet is addressing the many circulating love sonnets as somewhat redundant, describes them as [...] "pleasures which have become familiar are no longer intensely enjoyable". This is a usage of another common proverb; [...] "Too much familiarity breeds contempt." ...|$|E

It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks. Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it – <b>and</b> <b>please</b> leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E

The 38-year-old requested admission to Harvard after having been previously rejected by four schools despite impressive credentials. In a controversial move, Holmes admitted Delany and two other black men to the Medical School. Their admission sparked a student statement, which read: [...] "Resolved That we have no objection to the education and evaluation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us." [...] Sixty students signed the resolution, although 48 students signed another resolution which noted it would be [...] "a far greater evil, if, in the present state of public feeling, a medical college in Boston could refuse to this unfortunate class any privileges of education, which it is {{in the power of the}} profession to bestow". In response, Holmes told the black students they would not be able to continue after that semester. A faculty meeting directed Holmes to write that [...] "the intermixing of races is distasteful to a large portion of the class, & injurious to the interests of the school". Despite his support of education for blacks, he was not an abolitionist; against what he considered the abolitionists' habit of using [...] "every form of language calculated to inflame", he felt that the movement was going too far. This lack of support dismayed friends like James Russell Lowell, who once told Holmes he should be more outspoken against slavery. Holmes calmly responded, [...] "Let me try to improve <b>and</b> <b>please</b> my fellowmen after my own fashion at present." [...] Nonetheless, Holmes believed that slavery could be ended peacefully and legally.|$|E
