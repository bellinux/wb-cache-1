50|$|Private bailiffs are {{licensed}} by the Province of Ontario's Ministry of Consumer Services under the <b>Bailiffs</b> Act. <b>Assistant</b> <b>bailiffs</b> are similarly licensed, but must be supervised by a bailiff. Bailiffs in this capacity assist others who {{have a right to}} exercise self-help to repossess or seize something, or to evict under a commercial tenancy. Bailiffs are agents of the person contracting their services, not government employees or peace officers, and are prohibited from using force to seize goods or evict tenants.|$|R
50|$|Assaulting or {{resisting}} a constable, reeve, <b>assistant</b> reeve, <b>bailiff,</b> keeper is {{an offence}} under Section 44 the Epping Forest Act 1878. This would relate to someone causing an obstruction or assault {{in relation to}} them carrying out their wide range of duties under the Act.|$|R
5000|$|He {{attended}} Ratanga primary school(1966-1972) {{before proceeding}} to Maranda School (1973-1976). [...] He later proceeded to Ramapo College of New Jersey (1988-1991) where he acquired a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Environmental Studies and International Studies after having successfully {{served as an}} <b>assistant</b> water <b>bailiff</b> at the ministry of water between 1978-1981. Before then he was working at Nile Investments Central Africa Limited (1983-1986) as the marketing manager and at the PolyPipes Limited between (1986-1987) {{in the same position}} of marketing manager.Also, he occasionally taught at Aquinas High School.|$|R
50|$|The {{power to}} swear in constables {{is derived from the}} Epping Forest Act 1878. This gives the Conservators of the forest the power {{to swear in}} reeves, <b>assistant</b> reeves, <b>bailiffs</b> or other {{officers}} appointed by them for 'securing the better execution' of the Act and their bylaws. Epping Forest keepers are sworn as constables under section 43 of the Act, giving them the powers and privileges of a constable in relation to enforcing by-laws and the Epping Forest Act. The Act does not specify a geographical limit within which they can exercise those powers, suggesting that they can do so off of forest land if the matter is in relation to their jurisdiction. They are sworn in before a Justice of the Peace for Essex. Not all Forest Keepers are attested as constables. Whilst it has been erroneously suggested that the Keepers are sworn in as special constables, section 43 of the Act is quite clear that they are attested as constables.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} fourteenth century, Lihou {{may have become}} the origin of a local legend about a wealthy Bailiff of Guernsey who {{attempted}} to have an innocent peasant executed on false charges of theft of silver cups. In either 1302 or 1304, a priory servant called Thomas le Roer was alleged to have murdered one of the monks. The <b>Bailiff</b> and several <b>assistants</b> attempted to apprehend Le Roer {{but he did not}} surrender and was subsequently killed by Ranulph Gautier, one of the <b>Bailiff's</b> <b>assistants.</b> Gautier tried to find sanctuary in a nearby church and eventually fled to England, before returning to Guernsey when the king pardoned him. However, some years later Gautier was tortured to death in Castle Cornet, but it is not known why.|$|R
2500|$|Being {{devoid of}} his {{employees}} assistance, Hitchen was rendered to seek his resources to continue his [...] "trade". It {{should be noted that}} at that time Jonathan Wild, a prisoner himself in the Wood street Compter for a debt(from 1709 to 16 December 1712, the exact date Hitchen's [...] "Answer" [...] was presented to the committee), was running his business in Cock Alley and serving public in a similar way of Hitchen's. Wild, an under-keeper, while in the Compter, to the prisoners waiting for appearing before the magistrate, was well-acquainted with the prototypes of the personae of his further real life drama full of prostitutes and thieves(one of them, Marry Milliner, mentioned above). During these years he had already been practicing taking fees for recovering stolen letters and diaries, and only later developed into a thief-maker and a mastermind of organized crimes. There was virtually no type of crime he was not involved in; coining, forging, smuggling or protection rackets. It is obvious that a handicapped under-marshal would make a good use of such a scoundrel. It was actually him to usher Wild from making his living with proceeds of prostitution and as a <b>bailiff's</b> <b>assistant</b> to the fully fledged thief-taker. In his account of 1713-14, written as an answer to Hitchen's [...] "Regulator", Wild describes how the marshal approached to him: ...|$|R

In his account of 1713-14, written as an answer to Hitchen's [...] "Regulator", Wild describes how the marshal approached to him:I am very sensible that you are let into the knowledge of the intrigues of the compter, particularly with relation to the securing of pocket books. But your experience is inferior to mine... I can put you in a far better method than you are acquainted with... But I must first tell you that you'll spoil the trade of thief-taking in advancing greater rewards than are necessary. I give but half a crown a book... And when the thieves and pickpockets see us confederate they'll submit to our terms.Thus their partnership started taking Hitchen and his assistant first to Temple Bar, westernmost limit of his area of Jurisdiction. There marshal was revered with different [...] "fine" [...] drinks at different taverns, to which he only gave a brief sign asking for information on stolen goods. He was verbose, though, in his [...] "promises of protection" [...] to female visitors of those establishments:"I Wild gives an example of marshal's treatment of well-dressed women too. Once he seized a baillif's wife in the street in Ludgate Hill for talking to a man and accused her of being [...] "lewd". He took her to Cheapside and made her wait till he dined and pay for his meal. Pickpockets, or [...] "mathematicians" [...] as Hitchen called them affectionately", appear with a noteworthy incident in this period. On their regular night walks near St.Paul's, Hitchen and Wild saw the boys running away. Hitchen, having information on a stolen book, saw the reason of their hiding. He caught and arrested one, whose name was James Jones, the same juvenile who stole Lord Barnard's bills. The boy gave the address of his friends next morning before the justice and Hitchen took Wild to Barbican to attack their house during the night. The uninvited guests were welcomed with unfriendly 'damn ye', upon which the assistant Wild was left inside with the company while the marshal fled for bringing more constables. The gang of around 12 year-olds was taken and tried at Kingston assizes as their robbery was committed in Surrey. To the great disappointment and fury of marshal, court acquitted the boys upon their parents' complaint on marshal forcing their children to commit crime. He could not claim usual 40 pounds for their dead or alive heads. Moreover, was reprimanded by the court for the base interest. Wild gives very interesting account of the other side of Hitchen's relation to pickpockets we will mention below.|$|R
