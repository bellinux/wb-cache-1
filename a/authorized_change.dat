This is further enhanced by identifying <b>authorized</b> <b>change</b> vs unauthorised change and dynamically reconciling entire environments against ticketing systems for ITSM processes or SDLC processes, UpGuard summarizes key insights across this data dynamically and includes a proprietary risk modeling method called CSTAR that aggregates all relevant risk factors into a score between 0-950, similar to a credit score, allowing companies to effectively predict and prioritize high-risk impact areas, track risk hotspots over time, and compare scores to similar companies in like industries for comparison.|$|E

Nuclear inspectors {{are faced with}} tens of thousands of images to review, of which less than 1 % is significant. The Safeguards authorized means of reducing the image set is, at present, a two-frame differencing change-detection filter. We further limit the set by tracking flasks thanks to the timing of events provided by image time-stamps. Traditional visual tracking cannot be applied, owing to the low frame rate, and the need for compatibility with the <b>authorized</b> <b>change</b> detection filter. Our algorithm is based on a hidden semi-Markov model of the nuclear process, and handles multiple flasks and observations available only when the flasks are moved. State occupancy durations are used when selecting the next image to review...|$|E
