500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Stockholm, Sweden in September 2010. Production mostly {{took place at}} multiple locations in the city's central business district, including at the Stockholm Court House. One challenge was realizing the Vanger estate. They picked an eighteenth-century French architecture mansion Hofsta located approximately [...] southwest of Stockholm. Filmmakers wanted to use a typical [...] "manor from Småland" [...] that was solemn, formal, and [...] "very Old Money". [...] "The Swedish <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> the modern and the minimal {{but they also have}} these wonderful country homes that can be juxtaposed against the modern city—yet both speak to money." [...] Principal photography relocated in October to Uppsala. On Queen Street, the facade of the area was renovated to mimic the Hotel Alder, after an old photograph of a building obtained by Fincher. From December onward, production moved to Zurich, Switzerland, where locations were established at Dolder Grand Hotel and the Zurich Airport. Because of the [...] "beautiful" [...] environment of the city, Fincher found it difficult to film in the area. Principal photography concluded in Oslo, Norway, where production took place at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Recorded for over fifteen hours, twelve extras were sought for background roles. Filming also took place in the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) was {{instrumental}} in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number. [...] CMB measurements <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> constraining the matter content Ωm and curvature parameter Ωk. [...] It is not as sensitive to ΩΛ directly, partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift. [...] The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter H0 come from Type Ia supernovae. [...] Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for {{the age of the}} universe quoted above.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, Gee's {{work has}} focused on the {{learning}} principles in video games and how these learning principles {{can be applied to the}} K-12 classroom. Video games, when they are successful, <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> challenging players. They motivate players to persevere and simultaneously teach players how to play. Gee began his work in video games by identifying thirty-six learning principles that are present in - but not exclusive to - the design of good video games. Gee argues for the application of these principles in the classroom. Gee's video game learning theory includes his identification of twelve basic learning principles. [...] He identifies these as: 1)Active Control, 2) Design Principle, 3) Semiotic Principle, 4) Semiotic Domain, 5) Meta-level Thinking, 6) Psychosocial Moratorium Principle, 7) Committed Learning Principle 8) Identity Principle, 9) Self-knowledge Principle, 10) Amplification of Input Principle, 11) Achievement Principle, 12) Practice Principle, 13) Ongoing Learning Principle, 14) Regime of Competence Principle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} description refers {{mainly to}} the external anatomy of the common European shrimp, Crangon crangon, as a typical example of a decapod shrimp. The body of the shrimp {{is divided into two}} main parts: the head and thorax which are fused together to form the cephalothorax, and a long narrow abdomen. The shell which protects the cephalothorax is harder and thicker than the shell elsewhere on the shrimp and is called the carapace. The carapace typically surrounds the gills, through which water is pumped by the action of the mouthparts. The rostrum, eyes, whiskers and legs also issue from the carapace. The rostrum, from the Latin rōstrum meaning beak, looks like a beak or pointed nose {{at the front of the}} shrimp's head. It is a rigid forward extension of the carapace and can be used for attack or defense. It may also stabilize the shrimp when it swims backward. Two bulbous eyes on stalks sit either side of the rostrum. These are compound eyes which have panoramic vision and <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> detecting movement. Two pairs of whiskers (antennae) also issue from the head. One of these pairs is very long and can be twice the length of the shrimp, while the other pair is quite short. The antennae have sensors on them which allow the shrimp to feel where they touch, and also allow them to [...] "smell" [...] or [...] "taste" [...] things by sampling the chemicals in the water. The long antennae help the shrimp orient itself with regard to its immediate surroundings, while the short antennae help assess the suitability of prey.|$|E
