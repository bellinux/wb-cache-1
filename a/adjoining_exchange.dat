In 1917, after having earlier written at his London club his A Soldier's Declaration {{which appeared in the}} press and was read to the House of Commons, Sassoon was visited at the hotel by Colonel Jones Williams who reprimanded him for his actions. It was from Exchange station that Sassoon made his famous trip to Formby the next day, ripped the ribbon of his Military Cross off his tunic and flung it into the waters {{at the mouth of the}} Mersey.|$|E

In 1997, a neighboring property owner, Ross Development Corp., offered to deed the city six <b>adjoining</b> parcels in <b>exchange</b> for the city's constructing a road from the Glen McConnell Parkway to the park. The estimated cost of the road was $421,100, and the appraised value of the new 161 acres being offered (a 95-acre park addition and a 66-acre wetland preserve) was $429,590.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} on January 2, 1893 that the [...] "Baltimore Stock Exchange {{has not been}} especially lively during the year, {{but there has been}} a usual average of dealings, largely in the local stocks, especially Gas." [...] At the time, Baltimore was the third export city in the country. John C. B. Pendleton <b>adjoined</b> the <b>exchange</b> as a member in 1897, and in 1899, Legg Mason got its start selling stocks out of a back office in the Baltimore Stock Exchange. [...] On March 13, 1899, a seat in the exchange sold for $3,025, the highest price ever for a seat, with a bid of $3,000 for another seat declined. A few years prior, seats were quoted as low as $50, and they had more than doubled in value in the beginning of 1899.|$|R
50|$|The Bank of California Building is a {{landmark}} building located at 815 2nd Avenue in Seattle, Washington. It is located mid-block <b>adjoining</b> the <b>Exchange</b> Building. It {{was built by}} the Bank of California (predecessor to the Union Bank of California) in 1924 and has been continually used as a bank ever since. It housed the offices for the Bank of California until 1973 when a new building, the Union Bank of California Center was built {{at the corner of}} 4th and Madison Streets. Ironically, this newer, larger building is no longer used as a bank and instead is occupied by a Bartell Drugs store. The original Bank of California Building was retained as a branch office until being sold to the Puget Sound Mutual Savings Bank in 1982 which was headquartered in the building until 1993 when through a series of mergers and acquisitions the bank became a branch of Key Bank, which it remains to present day.|$|R
5000|$|Mrs Hudson {{retained}} the middle section of allotment 12 until 1876. Photographic evidence reveals several structures extant {{on the site}} whether any of these survive {{as part of the}} present brick and timber building has not been established, although it is possible. In April 1869 Mrs Hudson had advertised to let Borger's old blacksmith's shop <b>adjoining</b> the Royal <b>Exchange</b> Hotel, (the hotel was on the southwest corner of Fitzroy and Palmerin Streets, on the site later occupied by the Bank of New South Wales). Warwick historian Thomas Hall recalled in 1925 that Henry Borger opened a blacksmith's shop in Fitzroy Street, and it may have been on that part of allotment 12 which Mrs Hudson still held in 1869.|$|R
50|$|In November 1894 Thomas {{purchased}} {{freehold land}} <b>adjoining</b> Gympie's Stock <b>Exchange</b> from Matthew Mellor for £1,000 cash. At {{this time the}} site featured timber buildings occupied by a chemist and fruiterer, and mining brokers. Thomas engaged Brisbane architect Leslie Gordon Corrie to design a block of offices and shops. Born in Hobart in 1859, Corrie trained as an architect in Tasmania and worked in private practice and for government. In 1886, he established a private practice in Brisbane and was appointed architect to the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society. In 1888-1892 he was in partnership with his former master Henry Hunter. From 1898 to 1905 he was in partnership with GHM Addison as Addison and Corrie. Corrie was a foundation member and long-time councillor of the Queensland Institute of Architects, elected a fellow in 1889 and President from 1906-08.|$|R
50|$|Private First Class Ono's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:Private First Class Frank H. Ono distinguished {{himself by}} extraordinary heroism in action on 4 July 1944, near Castellina, Italy. In attacking a heavily defended hill, Private First Class Ono's squad {{was caught in}} a hail of formidable fire from the well-entrenched enemy. Private First Class Ono opened fire with his automatic rifle and silenced one machine gun 300 hundred yards to the right front. Advancing through incessant fire, he killed a sniper with another burst of fire, and while his squad leader reorganized the rest of the platoon in the rear, he alone defended the critical position. His weapon was then wrenched from his grasp by a burst of enemy machine pistol fire as enemy troops attempted to close in on him. Hurling hand grenades, Private First Class Ono forced the enemy to abandon the attempt, resolutely defending the newly won ground until the rest of the platoon moved forward. Taking a wounded comrade's rifle, Private First Class Ono again joined in the assault. After killing two more enemy soldiers, he boldly ran through withering automatic, small arms, and mortar fire to render first aid to his platoon leader and a seriously wounded rifleman. In danger of being encircled, the platoon was ordered to withdraw. Volunteering to cover the platoon, Private First Class Ono occupied virtually unprotected positions near the crest of the hill, engaging an enemy machine gun emplaced on an <b>adjoining</b> ridge and <b>exchanging</b> fire with snipers armed with machine pistols. Completely disregarding his own safety, he made himself the constant target of concentrated enemy fire until the platoon reached the comparative safety of a draw. He then descended the hill in stages, firing his rifle, until he rejoined the platoon. Private First Class Ono's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.|$|R
