50|$|The {{impact of}} Park's methods was instant. His Forward Interception Plan, issued officially on 25 July 1942, forced the Axis to abandon {{daylight}} raids within six days. The Ju 87s were withdrawn from operations over Malta altogether. Kesselring responded by sending in fighter sweeps at even higher altitudes {{to gain the}} tactical <b>advantage.</b> <b>Park</b> retaliated by ordering his fighters to climb no higher than 6100 ft. While this did give away a considerable height advantage, it forced the Bf 109s to descend to altitudes more suitable for the Spitfire than the German fighter. The methods would have great effect in October when Kesselring returned.|$|E

5000|$|Pay {{and display}} systems differ from road-side parking meters {{in that one}} machine can service {{multiple}} vehicle spaces, resulting in lower set up costs. In addition, this system theoretically prevents drivers from taking <b>advantage</b> of <b>parking</b> meters that have time remaining; this factor alone has doubled parking revenues in cities that have switched to pay and display. (A driver may occasionally take advantage of remaining time should a departing parker give away a ticket with remaining time, however.) ...|$|R
50|$|The pay by plate system {{services}} multiple vehicles by simply inputting {{the license plate}} information into a machine. This system results in lower set up costs, maintenance, and prevents drivers from taking <b>advantage</b> of <b>parking</b> meters that have time remaining. In many cities, pay by plate has replaced the road-side parking meter and the pay and display machines. The advantage to the city could be: increased revenue, increased compliance, less disputed tickets, increased parking space utilization and/or reduction in staff Results section.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} <b>advantage</b> of valet <b>parking,</b> {{aside from}} stacking, is that valets can park cars closer and straighter than some customers may park. This will save them {{space in the}} parking lot or garage, and prevent the inconvenience of going to different floors by cramming everything in.|$|R
50|$|North Harbor Tower is a 556 ft (169m) tall {{skyscraper}} in Chicago, Illinois, US. It {{was completed}} in 1988 and has 55 floors.

50|$|The cable lift {{utilizes}} a {{cable loop}} {{in place of}} the traditional chain, which is attached to a short section of chain that engages the trains chain dog. Because a cable is much lighter than a chain, cable lifts are much faster than chain lifts and can be used on much steeper hills - even vertical. A cable also requires far less maintenance than a chain. Another <b>advantage</b> to <b>park</b> guests is that a cable lift is very quiet, partly because the main drive winch is located directly beneath the top of the lift, a location which will normally be relatively far from guest-accessible areas.|$|R
50|$|Statistically, {{there is}} a large {{difference}} between the car-dominated developed nations, and the more populous developing countries where cars are less common than motorcycles.

5000|$|Beth Riesgraf as Parker, called [...] "The Thief", is {{an expert}} thief, cat-burglar, pickpocket and safe-cracker, memorably {{referred}} to (by Eliot) as [...] "20 pounds of crazy in a five-pound bag". The product of an abusive childhood spent in several foster homes, Parker is awkward around other people and has a terrible understanding of social norms. Over {{the course of the}} series, she comes to regard {{the other members of the}} team as her family, and for the first time in her life, trusts someone other than herself. Sophie and other members of the team have attempted to improve gaps in her social skills on numerous occasions, usually with limited success. As they become closer, Parker develops romantic feelings for Hardison, but her inability to properly express her feelings leads to a slow, awkward courtship. While emotionally impulsive, she can demonstrate great physical self-control in her work using acrobatics, strength, and concentration to her <b>advantage.</b> <b>Parker</b> was trained at a young age by expert thief (and recurring character) Archie Leach, and her obsessive focus on theft is to the point that her safe house is filled with gear and rappelling equipment to help her in various jobs. Parker is often sensitive to cons involving children, and at several points, the team's other members were thrown into danger when she went off-script to ensure an at-risk child did not end up like her. In season 5's [...] "The Broken Wing Job", she proves that she can handle problems on her own while the other team members are away and seems to be, with Nate's guidance, developing her ability as a planner. In the series finale, Nate retires and leaves the team in her hands as the new Mastermind.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Collapse of {{buildings}} in earthquakes causes casualties and economic losses, the reinforced concrete columns damage models is {{a basis for}} the research of integer collapse. The major <b>advantage</b> of <b>Park</b> and Ang’s method is the consideration of first exceedance failure and cumulative damage failure in terms of defining the structural damage under earthquake, however, it isn’t consider the differences of structural failures by different displacement amplitudes and load sequence. By multiplying the effective energy dissipation factor and the load sequence factor, the modified Park-Ang seismic damage model is obtained. The comparison between the two models indicates that the modified Park-Ang model have mean value closer to 1 and smaller scatter, besides the effects of load path and load sequence on damage can be taken into account in the modified model...|$|R

The spitball was phased out after the 1920 season, with Faber one of the 17 pitchers permitted to use it for the remainder of their careers. He took <b>advantage</b> of Comiskey <b>Park's</b> spacious dimensions, surrendering only 91 home runs—barely one homer per month—from 1920 to 1931.

The essence of the industrial park under Ukrainian law and its main types are considered. It is revealed that the main <b>advantage</b> of industrial <b>parks</b> compared with other similar economic mechanisms is a more advanced system of organizational, informational and financial mechanisms to stimulate the process of their creation and operation. The possibilities of creating industrial parks in the Ivano-Frankivsk region are considered. Typical obstacles to the establishment of industrial parks on the example of Hryplyn Industrial Investment Zone are analysed. It is proved that principles of Hryplyn Industrial Investment Zone meet the basic requirements for successful operation of the industrial park. In the condition of appropriate measures of state support it can be a powerful catalyst of economic growth in the region...|$|R
5000|$|The Brewers-Cubs rivalry is due {{mostly to}} the fact that the ballparks are located less than 85 mi apart. However, this rivalry did not begin to grow until , when the Brewers moved from the American League Central Division to the NL Central. Until then, the Brewers had a rivalry with the White Sox, which had become known as The I-94 Series, as both teams are just a short drive from Interstate 94. Brewers-Cubs games are {{consistent}} sellouts or near-sellouts, as fans of both teams take advantage of the relative proximity of Miller Park and Wrigley Field. The two stadiums are roughly equidistant for Cubs fans living in north-suburban Chicago; hence, fans in this region take <b>advantage</b> of Miller <b>Park's</b> larger seating and parking capacity, more modern amenities, and the certainty that the game will not be weather-delayed (due to Miller Park's roof) to attend Cubs games in Milwaukee in large numbers, enhancing the rivalry's intensity. Due to the close proximity of the ball park, many Cub fans make the drive to Miller Park which coined the nickname [...] "Wrigley North".|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{multi-purpose}} stadium in the 1960s, teams and municipalities began constructing them in commercial districts as opposed to residential areas, primarily to take <b>advantage</b> of increased <b>parking</b> space, but also to prevent people from viewing games for free, although such stadiums (especially the [...] "cookie-cutter" [...] stadiums) had high enclosed walls anyway in order to better accommodate football. This trend continued after teams started moving back into purpose-built stadiums in the 1990s. Nonetheless, some newer stadiums still have views that allow fans to watch for free; for instance, PNC Park in Pittsburgh is open-ended toward the Roberto Clemente Bridge, allowing some fans to watch a game for free on the bridge.At&t park in San Franciso allows 75 fans access to an area underneath one of the arches {{at the base of the}} 24-foot-high brick wall in right field...From this vantage point, they can watch 3 innings of the game, more it's a slow night, they are at eye level with the players with just a chain link fence separating them from all the action...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a pause}} {{of mutual}} inspection. For a time naive {{humanity}} swamped the conventions of warfare altogether; {{the interest of the}} millions below and of the thousands above alike was spectacular. The evening was unexpectedly fine--only a few thin level bands of clouds at seven or eight thousand feet broke its luminous clarity. The wind had dropped; it was an evening infinitely peaceful and still. The heavy concussions of the distant guns and those incidental harmless pyrotechnics {{at the level of the}} clouds seemed to have as little to do with killing and force, terror and submission, as a salute at a naval review. Below, every point of vantage bristled with spectators, the roofs of the towering buildings, the public squares, the active ferry boats, and every favourable street intersection had its crowds: all the river piers were dense with people, the Battery Park was solid black with east-side population, and every position of <b>advantage</b> in Central <b>Park</b> and along Riverside Drive had its peculiar and characteristic assembly from the adjacent streets.
