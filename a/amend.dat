5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to <b>amend</b> Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} President had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to <b>amend</b> any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to <b>amend</b> Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E
