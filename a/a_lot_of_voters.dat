40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} effects of {{introducing}} centrifugal incentives in an otherwise standard Downsian model of electoral competition. First, we demonstrate that a symmetric equilibrium is guaranteed to exist when centrifugal incentives are induced by any kind of partial voter participation (such as abstention due to indifference, abstention due to alienation, etc.) and, then, we argue that: (a) this symmetric equilibrium is in pure strategies, and it is hence convergent, only when centrifugal incentives are sufficiently weak on both sides; (b) when centrifugal incentives are strong on both sides (when, for example, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> abstain when they are sufficiently indifferent between the two candidates) players use mixed strategies—the stronger the centrifugal incentives, the larger the probability weight that players assign to locations near the extremes; and (c) when centrifugal incentives are strong on one side only—say for example only on the right—the support of players’ mixed strategies contain all policies except from those that are sufficiently close to the left extreme...|$|E

30|$|Based on this information, we also {{enhanced}} our {{theory of}} the sources of Wikipedia traffic before election time. We have shown good evidence that newer parties which attracted <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> swing <b>voters</b> received disproportionately high levels of Wikipedia traffic. Our data is at an aggregate level therefore we cannot offer firm conclusions about individual behaviour: however, the data is consistent with the idea that voters do not seek information uniformly about all parties at election time. Rather, they behave like ‘cognitive misers’, being more likely to seek information on new political parties with which they do not have previous experience and being more likely to seek information only when they are actually changing the way they vote. By contrast, {{there was no evidence of}} a ‘media effect’: there was little correlation between news media mentions and overall Wikipedia traffic patterns. Indeed, the news media and Wikipedia appeared biased towards different things: with news favouring incumbent parties, whilst Wikipedia favoured new ones. Furthermore, there was no evidence of a ‘viability’ effect: voters did not appear to ignore parties that had little realistic chance of gaining power.|$|R
5000|$|The UMP's electoral base {{reflects}} {{that of the}} old Rally for the Republic (RPR) and, in some cases, that of the Union for French Democracy (UDF). In the 2007 presidential election, Nicolas Sarkozy performed best in the east of France - particularly Alsace (36.2%); Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur (37.0%) - the wealthy coastal department of the Alpes-Maritimes (43.6%) was his best department in France; Champagne-Ardenne (32.7%) and Rhône-Alpes (32.7%). These areas were among National Front candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen's best regions in 2002 and are conservative {{on issues such as}} immigration. Sarkozy obviously received <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> votes from <b>voters</b> who had supported the far-right in April 2002. For example, in the Alpes-Maritimes, Sarkozy performed 21.6% better than Chirac did in 2002 while Le Pen lost 12.6% in five years. Sarkozy also appealed more than average to blue-collar workers in regions such as northern Meurthe-et-Moselle and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, although most of these regions, despite his gains, remain reliably left-wing. The party is also strong in every election in very wealthy suburban or coastal (and, in some cases, urban) areas such as Neuilly-sur-Seine (72.6% for Sarkozy in the first round), Saint-Tropez (54.79%), Cannes (48.19%) or Marcq-en-Barœul (47.35%).
