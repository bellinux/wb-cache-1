During the first four interviews, he stayed mostly silent and refused to sign the detectives' notes, but during the fifth interview on 13 October, when Melvin said he knew Silcott had struck Blakelock with a machete or sword, his demeanour changed, according to the notes.|$|E

500|$|According to Ausmus, Hoffman {{wanted his}} teams {{to feel like}} a family. He felt like he let his family down if he did not do his job on a {{particular}} night. Still, he was accessible and held himself accountable on the rare occasions that he failed. Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones. [...] "The people <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E
40|$|A {{time delay}} {{procedure}} {{was used to}} teach 3 children with autism to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> "What's that?" when novel stimuli were presented during an instructional task. Once <b>the</b> ability to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was acquired, <b>the</b> children's ability to learn novel information by <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was assessed. <b>The</b> children were then taught to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> within a less structured context. All three studies used a multiple baseline across participants. Generalization was assessed in a different room, to a new person, and to novel stimuli. All of the children learned to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> within <b>the</b> instructional context, while on {{a walk in the}} school building, and to request information about three-dimensional objects. The acquisition of novel information was consistent for receptive and expressive tests for 2 of the children, with varied results for the 3 rd. These studies indicate that children with autism can be taught to ask questions that lead to the acquisition of new information...|$|R

6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later, our affairs, {{as they were}} {{connected}} with the sloop-of-war, came to a crisis. This ship now came on, close under our lee, losing a little of her way in passing, an expedient probably thought of {{to give her a}} little more time to put her questions, and to receive the desired answers. I observed also, that she let go all her bow-lines, which seemed much to deaden her way, of which there still remained sufficient, notwithstanding, to carry her well clear of us.

Of course, I made such answers as were called for by the case, and we established a sort of business acquaintance between us, the very first day.

60|$|Coming {{into the}} {{compound}} from the rear, Sheldon {{could see nothing}} until he rode {{around the corner of}} the bungalow. Then he saw everything at once--first, a glimpse at the sea, where the Martha floated huge alongside the cutter and the ketch which had rescued her; and, next, the ground in front of the veranda steps, where a great crowd of fresh-caught cannibals stood at attention. From the fact that each was attired in a new, snow-white lava-lava, Sheldon knew that they were recruits. Part way up the steps, one of them was just backing down into the crowd, while another, called out by name, was coming up. It was Joan's voice that had called him, and Sheldon reined in his horse and watched. She sat at the head of the steps, behind a table, between Munster and his white mate, the three of them checking long lists, Joan <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> and writing the answers in the big, red-covered, Berande labour-journal.|$|E

However, reports have come out from multiple people who were previously featured on the segment, claiming that the answers are taken out of context, while others stated that they were playing along, knowing {{that it was a}} joke. Examples include accusations of them using the answer to a question and selectively editing it to appear as if they were answering another question, which was then aired on the program, thus casting doubt on the legitimacy of the segment.
