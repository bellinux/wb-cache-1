In 1989, Muncie was sentenced to 18 months in a federal prison in California after {{he pleaded guilty to}} intending to sell [...] of cocaine to a friend. He turned his life around after prison, pursuing business interests and sharing stories of his drug problems with at-risk youths. Muncie said his time in prison likely saved his life.

2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, I walked around with a big smile on my face, grinning <b>at</b> <b>everybody.</b> It was funny." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{why should}} you not?" [...] said Mrs. Arrowpoint, encouragingly. [...] "You have but to begin as I did. Pen, ink, and paper are <b>at</b> <b>everybody's</b> command. But I will send you all I have written with pleasure." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{dead silence}} for several minutes, while {{everybody}} looked <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> else in dismay.|$|E
60|$|There was a slow, ominous {{murmur of}} voices. The fat {{man on the}} {{platform}} beamed <b>at</b> <b>everybody.</b>|$|E
60|$|Everybody {{started and}} looked up, {{as if it}} were the murderer. He looked <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> coldly and sarcastically.|$|E

In 1963 Everybody's hailed her (somewhat inaccurately) as 'Australia's only woman cartoonist', although she was definitely the best known.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind,' said Leonard, 'he sneers <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> all alike! I can't {{think how}} Dr. May came {{to have such}} a son, or how Aubrey can run after him so.' ...|$|E

60|$|The Shy Man {{came into}} our yard one {{afternoon}} in April, while I was sleeping with mother in the sun on an old sweater which we had borrowed from Fred, one of the barmen. I heard mother growl, but I didn't take any notice. Mother {{is what they call}} a good watch-dog, and she growls <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> except master. At first, when she used to do it, I would get up and bark my head off, but not now. Life's too short to bark <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> who comes into our yard. It is behind the public-house, and they keep empty bottles and things there, so people are always coming and going.|$|E
6000|$|... "What we want most," [...] he said thoughtfully, [...] "is {{some big}} topic. That's {{the only way}} to get a paper going. Look <b>at</b> <b>Everybody's</b> Magazine. They didn't amount to a row of beans till Lawson started his 'Frenzied Finance' articles. Directly they began, the whole country was {{squealing}} for copies. Everybody's put up their price from ten to fifteen cents, and now they lead the field." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ladies and gentlemen,' said Mr Vincent Crummles, who {{had been}} writing {{on a piece of}} paper, 'we'll call the Mortal Struggle {{tomorrow}} <b>at</b> ten; <b>everybody</b> for the procession.

60|$|Captain Cuttle, {{whose eyes}} were now as wide open {{as they would}} be, and the knobs upon whose face were {{perfectly}} luminous, gave a long shrill whistle of a most melancholy sound, and stood gazing <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> {{in a state of}} speechlessness.|$|E
6000|$|... "You fire <b>at</b> <b>everybody,</b> Pen--you're grown awful, {{that you}} are," [...] Foker said. [...] "Now you've pulled about Blondel's yellow wig, and Colchicum's black one, why don't {{you have a}} shy at a brown one, hay? you know whose I mean. It got into Lady Clavering's carriage." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pickwick {{was struck}} {{motionless}} and speechless. He {{stood with his}} lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends, without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation. They, in their turn, stared at him; and Master Bardell, in his turn, stared <b>at</b> <b>everybody.</b>|$|E
60|$|Well, then. Miss Landless’s {{brother had}} said he admired Miss Bud. Mr. Edwin Drood had said to Miss Landless’s brother {{that he had no}} {{business}} to admire Miss Bud. Miss Landless’s brother had then ‘up’d’ (this was the cook’s exact information) with the bottle, knife, fork, and decanter (the decanter now coolly flying <b>at</b> <b>everybody’s</b> head, without the least introduction), and thrown them all at Mr. Edwin Drood.|$|R

6000|$|The Chancellor, much disconcerted <b>at</b> finding <b>everybody</b> looking <b>at</b> him, {{could only}} murmur, in a shy whisper, [...] "Precisely so!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely. And {{now look}} along that avenue to the left. Do {{you see a}} man in a brown suit, with straw hat to match, walking towards us at a regular pace, and keeping in a {{perfectly}} straight course? He looks <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> he passes as if he were counting them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "BADEN-BADEN (no date). Lot of vociferous Americans {{at breakfast}} this morning. Talking <b>AT</b> <b>everybody,</b> while pretending to talk among themselves. On their first travels, manifestly. Showing off. The usual signs--airy, easy-going {{references}} to grand distances and foreign places. 'Well GOOD-by, old fellow--if I don't run across you in Italy, you hunt {{me up in}} London before you sail.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} me to turn his nose up <b>at</b> <b>everybody.</b> He used to like Mr. Monk; but he envies Mr. Monk, because Mr. Monk is Chancellor of the Exchequer. I asked him whether we shouldn't have Lord Drummond at Matching, and he told me angrily that I might ask all the Government if I liked." ...|$|E
5000|$|CityBeat {{was founded}} in November 1994.

6000|$|... "No; nonsense, Naumann! English {{ladies are}} not <b>at</b> <b>everybody's</b> service as models. And {{you want to}} express too much with your painting. You would only have made a better or worse {{portrait}} with a background which every connoisseur would give a different reason for or against. And what is {{a portrait of a}} woman? Your painting and Plastik are poor stuff after all. They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising them. Language is a finer medium." ...|$|R
60|$|He grew up, {{said these}} humble friends, the playmate {{not only of}} all mortal kind, but of creatures of the woods; although, when Kenyon pressed them for some {{particulars}} of this latter mode of companionship, they could remember {{little more than a}} few anecdotes of a pet fox, which used to growl and snap <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> save Donatello himself.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{just at the}} end of the dinner, his eyes, {{which had}} been staring <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> in turn, fixed {{themselves}} for a while upon the plate laid for George. He pointed to it presently with his left hand. His daughters looked at him and did not comprehend, or choose to comprehend, the signal; nor did the servants at first understand it.|$|E
60|$|Witchcraft! Everybody looked aghast at the breathless {{messenger}}, and the breathless messenger looked equally aghast <b>at</b> <b>everybody</b> - except Will Marks, who, finding himself unobserved, {{not only}} squeezed {{the young lady}} again, but kissed her twice. Surely {{he must have been}} bewitched himself, or he never could have done it - and the young lady too, or she never would have let him.|$|E
50|$|Young died in 1957 of an {{intestinal}} obstruction {{at his home}} in Chicago shortly after receiving news that his sister Belva Overton had died in New York.

5000|$|On 17 December, {{after they}} {{considered}} {{the value of the}} essay Einiges Philosophische in gemeinfasslicher Form (Some Philosophy <b>at</b> <b>Everybody's</b> Understanding) and after [...] "a verbal defense in front of the academic committee, brilliantly held for original opinions", the Sorbonne committee granted him the title of [...] "licencé ès lettres" [...] (Philology Licensed).
