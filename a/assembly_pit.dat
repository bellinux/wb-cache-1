Second, we determined that LDL-ferritin can induce clustering of LDL receptors over noncoated membrane on the surface of K+-depleted fibroblasts; however, when these cells are subsequently incubated in the presence of K+, these clusters become associated with newly formed coated pits and are internalized. Finally, we determined that K+ depletion inhibits the <b>assembly</b> of coated <b>pits,</b> but that existing coated pits in K+-depleted cells are able to internalize LDL.
