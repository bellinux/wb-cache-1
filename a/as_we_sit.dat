6000|$|One without {{looks in}} to-night [...] Through the curtain-chink From {{the sheet of}} glistening white; One without looks in to-night [...] <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> and think [...] By the fender-brink.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} done so, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> {{in the same room}} and at the same desk. Or you may {{remember}} meeting me at dinner at your uncle's castle in Cumberland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jean le Roi--he fears nothing--he {{cares for}} nothing, {{not even for}} me, his father," [...] Johnson muttered with {{chattering}} teeth. [...] "If he feels like it he will kill us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> here." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the next}} morning Maggie went, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have seen. <b>Sitting</b> on the coach on their way home, the brother and sister talked {{to each other in}} sad, {{interrupted}} whispers.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Flack {{looked at}} her for a moment very hard, in the whites of the eyes; then he replied, turning back to her sister: [...] "Anything YOU like, Miss Francie. With you one subject's as good <b>as</b> another. Can't <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> down? Can't <b>we</b> be comfortable?" [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, an it please your Grace!--it is not fit {{for such}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> to <b>sit</b> with {{the rulers of}} the land," [...] said the Jew; whose {{ambition}} for precedence though it had led him to dispute Place with the extenuated and impoverished descendant {{of the line of}} Montdidier, by no means stimulated him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy Saxons.|$|R
60|$|Now, my father, on the morrow night, {{once again}} Umslopogaas and Galazi the wolf {{sat by the}} fire in the mouth of their cave, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> to-night, my father, and Galazi took up his tale.|$|E
6000|$|And yet, I've been {{thinking}} I'd so {{like to see}} [...] If what goes on behind HER, goes on behind ME! [...] And then, goodness gracious! what fun it would be [...] For us BOTH <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> by our window! ...|$|E
6000|$|Long, long {{through the}} hours, and the night, and the chimes, [...] Here we talk of old books, and old friends, and old times; [...] <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> {{in a fog}} made of rich Latakie [...] This chamber is {{pleasant}} to you, friend, and me.|$|E
30|$|This “primacy of movement” (Sheets-Johnstone, 1999) is the {{formative}} human condition and thus includes learning and reasoning across disciplines, contexts, and media. Cognition develops in streaming activity of ecologically embodied, embedded, and distributed interaction. Cognitive activity may be actual, projected, or even imagined, <b>as</b> when <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> still with our eyes closed. Even then, our conscious experience of inner sensory perceptions and dialogue need not imply a contentful mind. Rather, some scholars believe that mental representations, {{which have been}} a focal historical construct of cognitive science, {{are for the most}} conscious epiphenomena of an intrinsically enactive mind at work (Chemero, 2009; Hutto & Myin, 2013; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991).|$|R
40|$|We all {{are members}} of media audiences. On many occasions, we are self-consciously so – such <b>as</b> when <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> in {{darkness}} in a cinema, transfixed by a larger-than-life screen, sharing the experience {{with a group of}} relative strangers. More frequently, we are part of an audience through habit or circumstance. Much of our media use is habitual. We are often barely aware of it. We scan the morning newspaper, half-listen to the car radio or iPod on the journey to work or university, glance at billboards, check online daily news updates, glance at the evening news bulletin – all this happens amidst the clutter of domestic life and regular patterns of work and leisure...|$|R
60|$|I wish I {{were with}} you, dear, {{sitting by the}} fire undressing, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> used to <b>sit,</b> and I would try {{to tell you what}} I feel. I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you think about it. Mina, pray for my happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Plop, sir! Mrs. Butt is drying my uniform {{at home at}} {{this very}} moment <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> talking here, sir. She says to me, 'Why, {{whatever}} 'ave you been a-doing? You're all wet.' And," [...] he added, again with the confidential air, [...] "I was wet, too. Wringin' wet." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, in {{the morning}} <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> in the {{sunshine}} on the seat by the little [...] shrine, And look at the mountain-walls, Walls of blue shadow, And see so near at our feet in the meadow Myriads of dandelion pappus Bubbles ravelled in the dark green grass Held still beneath the sunshine-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will go {{and have}} a talk with the Doctor; he can go round to the other {{officers}} one by one. I will tell Mr. Hunter, and he will tell the other residents, so that when they meet here in the evening no explanations will be needed, and a very few words <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> out on the veranda will be sufficient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah,--you {{should read}} it. I know {{nothing in the}} English {{language}} that brings home to one so often one's own best feelings and aspirations. 'It stands all-beautiful in naked purity,'" [...] she continued, still alluding to poor Sir Florian's soul. [...] "'Instinct with inexpressible beauty and grace, Each stain of earthliness had passed away.' I can see him now in all his manly beauty, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> used to <b>sit</b> together by the hour, looking over the waters. Oh, Julia, the thing itself has gone,--the earthly reality; but the memory of it will live for ever!" ...|$|R
2500|$|On an April 13, 2012, {{appearance}} on Stossel, Palin related how, {{as a commercial}} fisherman, she saw firsthand how Japanese fishing trawlers were responsible for [...] "pretty much raping {{the bottom of the}} ocean floor before there was strict regulation on overfishing, and these Japanese trawlers, with 20-mile long nets, being able to overfish and then waste the bycatch. The rest of us, <b>as</b> commercial fishermen, <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> there saying, 'Well, pretty soon, there's not going to be a species left for us to help feed the rest of the world.'" [...] Host John Stossel referred to such abusive fishing practices as an example of the tragedy of the commons and suggested giving different groups private rights over different parts of the ocean.|$|R
40|$|What is an ‘audience’? We all {{are members}} of media audiences. On many occasions, we are self-consciously so – such <b>as</b> when <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> in {{darkness}} in a cinema, transfixed by a larger-than-life screen, sharing the experience {{with a group of}} relative strangers. More frequently, we are part of an audience through habit or circumstance. Much of our media use is habitual. We are often barely aware of it. We scan the morning newspaper, half-listen to the car radio or iPod on the journey to work or university, glance at billboards, check online daily news updates, glance at the evening news bulletin – all this happens amidst the clutter of domestic life and regular patterns of work and leisure. We can be willing, unwilling and accidental members of media audiences. We offer our time and attention to all kinds of media. We can be considered as engaging in unpaid work, for we have considerable economic value once we join others to constitute an audience. It may be difficult for us to think of watching television or sitting in a cinema as ‘work’, for pleasure, entertainmen...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{everything}} {{ought to}} be broken up. But I say nothing about that. What I do say is this. That <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> here as directors and will be held to be responsible as such by the public, we ought {{to know what is}} being done. We ought to know where the shares really are. I for one do not even know what scrip has been issued.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It was the witching {{time for}} Story-telling. [...] "Our whole life, Travellers," [...] said I, [...] "is a story {{more or less}} intelligible,--generally less; but we shall read it by a clearer light when it is ended. I, for one, am so divided this night between fact and fiction, that I scarce know which is which. Shall I beguile the time by telling you a story <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you endanger other people's {{life and}} liberty in your pursuit of happiness, I {{shall have to}} {{confiscate}} your arms, boys. Take the orchard for your archery ground; that is safe, {{and we can see}} you <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> here. I wish I had two hands, so that I could paint you a fine, gay target;" [...] and Miss Celia looked regretfully at the injured arm, which as yet was of little use.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Sir," [...] he said, [...] "we treat {{together}} as strangers. You are Mr. Sherwin's son--not mine. You are {{the husband of}} his daughter--not a relation of my family. Rise, <b>as</b> I do: <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> together {{no longer in the}} same room. Write!" [...] (he pushed pen, ink, and paper before me,) [...] "write your terms there--I shall find means to keep you to a written engagement--the terms of your absence, for life, from this country; and of hers: the terms of your silence, and of the silence of your accomplices; of all of them. Write what you please; I am ready to pay dearly for your absence, your secrecy, and your abandonment of the name you have degraded. My God! that I should live to bargain for hushing up the dishonour of my family, and to bargain for it with you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{say nothing}} {{in defense of}} his character--nothing in palliation of the offense for which he suffered. But I cannot forget that {{in the time of}} his most fearful extremity, when the strong arm of the law had already seized him, he thought of the young man whose humble {{fortunes}} he had helped to build; whose heartfelt gratitude he had fairly won; whose simple faith he was resolved never to betray. I leave it to greater intellects than mine to reconcile the anomaly of his reckless falsehood toward others and his steadfast truth toward me. It is as certain <b>as</b> that <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> here that one of Fauntleroy's last efforts in this world was the effort he made to preserve me from being a loser by the trust that I had placed in him. There is the secret of my strange tenderness for the memory of a felon; that is why the word villain does somehow still grate on my heart when I hear it associated with the name--the disgraced name, I grant you--of the forger Fauntleroy. Pass the bottles, young gentlemen, and pardon a man of the old school for having so long interrupted your conversation with a story of the old time.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'd rather not," [...] she admitted. [...] "My {{brain is}} too full. I have a hundred fancies dancing about. I even find myself, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> here, rehearsing my gestures, tuning {{myself to a}} new outlook. Oh! You most {{disturbing}} person--intellectually of course, I mean," [...] she added, laughing into his face. [...] "Take off my rugs and help me up. No, we'll leave them there. Perhaps, after dinner, we might walk for a little time." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is ground}} for this belief, however, for, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> on our perch, {{overlooking}} the valley, {{we see this}} Pedro, this Conrad of the Mountains, seated in the bower on the mound behind his dwelling, resting contemplatively at the well-loved spot, after one of his periodical returns. Mariquita the younger is beside him. They are both looking earnestly at the grave, and conversing about {{the time when they}} shall once again meet the lost one by the side of Jesus in the better land.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we 'll {{think of}} that <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> here alone," [...] she rejoined. [...] "Mary and I will sit here and talk about it. So I give him up," [...] she went on, as he was going. [...] "I 'm sure you 'll be {{the best of friends}} to him, but if you should ever forget him, or grow tired of him, or lose your {{interest}} in him, and he should come to any harm or any trouble, please, sir, remember"--And she paused, with a tremulous voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there <b>we</b> <b>sits.</b> Sometimes {{they would}} all talk at once, {{sometimes}} {{two or three of}} them would give it me. Ten o'clock comes and they got desperate like, for only one or two of them had put anything into their pockets, thinking that the matter was sure to be finished that night. When the messages were sent out again, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> couldn't agree, I sits down in a corner and, says I: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, let's {{go right}} away from London--right {{out into the}} country, far <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can, where he'll never find us, where <b>we</b> can <b>sit</b> on the grass under the trees and rest." ...|$|R
60|$|There will <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> {{upon the}} rocks, And see the shepherds feed their flocks By summer rivers, by whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals.-—Marlowe.|$|R
6000|$|... "We cannot come," [...] Selingman declared, without hesitation. [...] "I take {{my friend}} Maraton somewhere. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> here, Mr. Foley, we have spoken of politics. You {{are a great}} man. If any one can lift your country from the rut along which she is travelling, you will do it. A Unionist Prime Minister and you hold out the hand to Maraton! But what foresight! What acumen! You see beyond the thunder-clouds {{the things that we}} have seen. Not only do you see them, but you have the courage to follow your convictions. What a mess you are making of Parties!" ...|$|E
60|$|But how puny and {{harmless}} {{they now}} looked beside this huge and terrific incarnation of hate, of vengeance and of death. The man himself, for such I may call him, was fully fifteen {{feet in height}} and, on Earth, would have weighed some four hundred pounds. He sat his mount <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> a horse, grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs, while {{the hands of his}} two right arms held his immense spear low at the side of his mount; his two left arms were outstretched laterally to help preserve his balance, the thing he rode having neither bridle or reins of any description for guidance.|$|E
6000|$|In which case, I fear, {{they must}} go their way; while we go ours; confessing {{that there is}} an order, and there is a law, for man; and that if he disturb that order, or break that law in anywise, they will prove {{themselves}} too strong for him, and reassert themselves, and go forward, grinding him to powder if he stubbornly try to stop their way. But we must assert too, that his disobedience to them, even for a moment, has disturbed the natural course of events, and broken that inevitable sequence, which we may find indeed, in our own imaginations, as long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> with a book in our studies: but which vanishes the moment that we step outside into practical contact with life; and, instead of talking cheerfully of a necessary and orderly progress, find ourselves more inclined to cry with the cynical man of the world: ...|$|E
6000|$|KEEGAN [dropping {{the broad}} Irish vernacular {{of his speech}} to Patsy]. An hour if you like, Miss Reilly: you're always welcome. Shall <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> down? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not come}} {{particularly}} to see him," [...] was my airy reply. [...] "Besides, we said no time--any fine day. Shall <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know nothing}} of my motive for leaving Italy," [...] he began, [...] "except that it was for {{political}} reasons. If I had been driven to this country by the persecution of my government, I should not have kept those reasons a secret from you or from any one. I have concealed them because no government authority has pronounced the sentence of my exile. You have heard, Walter, of the political societies that are hidden in every great city on the continent of Europe? To one of those societies I belonged in Italy--and belong still in England. When I came to this country, I came by the direction of my chief. I was over-zealous in my younger time--I ran the risk of compromising myself and others. For those reasons I was ordered to emigrate to England and to wait. I emigrated--I have waited--I wait still. To-morrow I may be called away--ten years hence I may be called away. It is all one to me--I am here, I support myself by teaching, and I wait. I violate no oath (you shall hear why presently) in making my confidence complete by telling you {{the name of the}} society to which I belong. All I do is to put my life in your hands. If what I say to you now is ever known by others to have passed my lips, <b>as</b> certainly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> two <b>sit</b> here, I am a dead man." ...|$|R
