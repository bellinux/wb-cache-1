40|$|Chromosome {{studies were}} done on mitogen-stimulated {{lymphocytes}} {{from one or}} more tissues (blood, lymph nodes, skin lesions) in 15 patients with mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome. A cytogenetically abnormal clone was found in 10 individuals, including 6 with data from several tissues.

40|$|For about 20 {{years we}} have known from {{cytogenetic}} studies {{that there is a}} clonal cell population in Hodgkin's disease. Most karyotypes are complexly aberrant and chromosome numbers typically lie in the hyperploid range. Some chromo-some regions seem to be preferentially involved, but a chro-mosome aberration specific for Hodgkin's disease has not yet been determined. Although the existence of a clonal cell population is evident from these cytogenetic studies, there is still an ongoing debate, whether in all cases the pathogno-monic Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells belong to one single <b>aberrant</b> <b>clone</b> and thus represent a monoclonal pro-liferation.

In order to analyse whether cytogenetically unrelated clones are also unrelated at the molecular level, we analysed the X-chromosome inactivation status in cell cultures from a cytogenetically highly polyclonal acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid gland. By using cell cultures dominated by a single abnormal clone, obtained through in vitro culturing for 3 - 5 passages, we showed that the different clones must indeed have originated from different cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{and management of}} the BCR-ABL– negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are at an explosive crossroads of scientific investigation and evolving paradigms since the discovery of the ty-rosine kinase–activating JAK 2 V 617 F mutation in 2005. Additional discovery of relevant molecular lesions (JAK 2 exon 12 mutations and c-MplW 515 L/K) have only further enriched our understanding of MPD pathogenesis. The improved diagnostic certainty these molecular markers provide have resulted in the modification, and simplification, of the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic algorithms for MPDs. Despite these scientific advances, however, the initial management of MPDs continues to rely upon a risk-based strategy to minimize the risk of vascular events with control of erythrocytosis, targeted antiplatelet therapy, and risk-based myelosuppressive therapy. No current medical therapy has altered the natural trend of the MPDs to lead to overt severe myelofibro-sis or acute leukemia. Investigations into targeted therapies for MPDs are proceeding at a brisk pace with agents aimed at immunomodulation, decreasing marrow stromal reaction to the <b>aberrant</b> <b>clone,</b> DNA hypomethylation, or the inhibition of tyrosine kinases. Specific inhibition of JAK 2 itself appears promising by in vitro investigations, and clinical trials with multiple agents are planned to commence enrollment in 2007. The potential impact of JAK 2 inhibitors on the mani-festations of the MPDs is unclear, but is awaited with great interest...|$|E
40|$|Stem cells {{share many}} {{properties}} with malignant cells, {{such as the}} ability to self-renew and proliferate. Cancer is believed to be a disease of stem cells. The gastrointestinal tract has high cancer prevalence partly because of rapid epithelial cell turnover and exposure to dietary toxins. The molecular pathways of carcinogenesis differ according to the tissue. Work on hereditary cancer syndromes including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has led to advances in our understanding of the events that occur in tumour development from a gastrointestinal stem cell. The initial mutation involved in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence is in the 'gatekeeper' tumour-suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Somatic hits in this gene are non-random in FAP, with the type of mutation selected for by the position of the germline mutation. In the stomach, a metaplasia-dysplasia sequence occurs and is often related to Helicobacter pylori infection. Clonal expansion of mutated cells occurs by niche succession. Further expansion of the <b>aberrant</b> <b>clone</b> then occurs by the longitudinal division of crypts into two daughter units [...] crypt fission. Two theories seek to explain the early development of adenomas [...] the 'top down' and 'bottom up' hypotheses. Initial studies suggested that colorectal tumours were monoclonal; however, later work on chimeric mice and a sex chromosome mixoploid patient with FAP suggested that up to 76 % of early adenomas were polyclonal. Introduction of a homozygous resistance allele has reduced tumour multiplicity in the mouse and has been used to rule out random collision of polyps as the cause of these observations. It is likely that short-range interaction between adjacent initiated crypts is responsible for polyclonality...|$|E

We observed aneuploid clones as well as stem lines bearing structural abnormalities (e. g., translocation, inversions). The various <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> were found in cultures ranging in age from 41 to 144 days and comprised varying percentages of the cell populations ranging from 0. 8 % to virtually 100 %.

40|$|Ensuring {{cooperation}} among formerly autonomous cells {{has been a}} central challenge {{in the evolution of}} multicellular organisms. One solution is monoclonality, but this option still leaves room for exploitative behavior, as it does not eliminate genetic and epigenetic variability. We therefore hypothesized that embryonic development must be protected by robust regulatory mechanisms that prevent <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> from superseding wild-type cells. Using a genome-wide screen in murine induced pluripotent stem cells, we identified a network of genes (centered on p 53, topoisomerase 1, and olfactory receptors) whose down-regulation caused the cells to replace wild-type cells in vitro and in the mouse embryo—without perturbing normal development. These genes thus appear to fulfill an unexpected role in fostering cell cooperation. Multicellularity has evolved independent-ly a number of times. Under certainconditions, it offers selective advan-tages that outweigh the costs of constraining competition (1). It can afford protection against predation, increase metabolic efficiency through division of labor, promotemore efficient resourc...|$|R
40|$|A benign retroperitoneal schwannoma from {{a patient}} without prior {{exposure}} to radiotherapy or chemotherapy was analyzed by chromosome banding after short-term culture. An extensive intratumor heterogeneity {{in the form of}} 29 karyotypically related as well as unrelated clones was found. The <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> were diploid or near-diploid and displayed both numerical and structural changes. All chromosomes, except 11, 16, and 20, were affected. Numerical changes included trisomies X, 7, 9, 17, and 18, and monosomies 13 and 18. No clonal loss of chromosome 22, the most characteristic abnormality in schwannomas of other locations, was, however, detected. The structural aberrations resulted in a total of 58 chromosomal breakpoints, with chromosomes 18, 1, and 15 participating in rearrangements most frequently, followed by chromosomes 14, 2, and 22. A striking finding was the clonal involvement of 18 p 11 in eight rearrangements affecting different chromosomes, suggesting alteration of telomeric function. The molecular mechanisms underlying the observed massive polyclonality in the schwannoma, particularly the presence of cytogenetically unrelated clones, are unknown and probably heterogeneous...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a multicentric study {{to assess the}} impact of two different culture procedures on the detection of chromosomal abnormalities in 217 consecutive unselected cases with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) referred for routine analysis either at the time of diagnosis (n = 172) or during disease evolution (n = 45). Parallel cultures of peripheral blood or bone marrow were set up with the addition of either the conventional B-cell mitogen 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) or a combination of CpG oligonucleotide (CpG) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). Cytogenetic analyses were performed on both cultures. Clonal abnormalities were identified in 116 cases (53 %). In 78 cases (36 %), the <b>aberrant</b> <b>clone</b> was detected in both cultures. Among these, the percentages of aberrant metaphases were similar in both conditions in 17 cases, higher in the CpG/IL- 2 culture in 43 cases, and higher in the TPA culture in 18 cases. Clonal aberrations were detected in only one culture, either in CpG/IL- 2 or TPA in 33 (15 %) and 5 (2 %) cases, respectively. Taken together, abnormal karyotypes were observed in 51 % with CpG/IL- 2 and 38 % with TPA (P < 0. 0001). Application of FISH (n = 201) allowed the detection of abnormalities not visible by conventional cytogenetic analysis in 80 cases: del(13 q) (n = 71), del(11 q) (n = 5), + 12 (n = 2), del(14 q) (n = 1), and del(17 p) (n = 1). In conclusion, our results confirm that CpG/IL- 2 stimulation increases the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in CLL compared with TPA and that further improvement can be obtained by FISH. However, neither conventional cytogenetics nor FISH detected all aberrations, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from normal to malignant phenotype implies the activation of some pathways {{that underlie the}} <b>aberrant</b> <b>clone</b> expansion. In some way, the conventional function of proteins involved in DNA repair, cell death/growth induction, vascularization, and metabolism is inhibited or shifted toward other pathways by soluble mediators that orchestrate such change depending on the microenvironment conditions. The adenoma-carcinoma sequence of the colon {{represents one of the}} most well studied and characterized models of human tumor progression. In this section, we focus our attention on defined pathways that underlie the initiation, promotion, and progression of colon cancer, conferring aggressiveness to the neoplastic cells. Clusterin (CLU) is a pleiotropic protein with a broad range of functions. It has recently drawn much attention because of its association with cancer promotion and metastasis. It is involved in prosurvival and apoptosis processes that are carried out by two different forms. sCLU is cytoprotective and its prosurvival function is the basis of the current Phase I/II clinical trials. In colorectal cancer an increase of sCLU expression occurs, whereas the nuclear proapoptotic form is downregulated. Several controversial data have been published on colon cancer discussing its role as tumor suppressor or prosurvival factor in colon cancer. Here, we report the dynamic interaction of the different forms of CLU with their partners DNA-repair protein Ku 70 and proapoptotic factor Bax during colon cancer progression, which seems to be a crucial point for the neoplastic cell fate. We also highlight that the appearance and the progressive increase of the sCLU in colorectal tumors correlate to a significant increase of CLU in serum and stool of patients. On the basis of results obtained by CLU immuno-dosage in blood and stool of colon cancer patients, we report that sCLU could represent a diagnostic molecular marker for colon cancer screening...|$|E

The strain is heterozygous for six markers of the right arm of chromosome V and heterozygous for cyh 2 (resistance to cycloheximide) on chromosome VII. —Selection of meiotic spores on a medium containing cycloheximide and required nutrilites—except those for the markers of the right arm of chromosome V—allows the growth of <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> belonging only to two classes: a) diploid clones, caused by failure of the second meiotic division, with a frequency of 0. 54 x 10 - 4 per viable spore; and b) diplo V, aneuploids derived from nondisjunctions in meiosis I or meiosis II, with a total spontaneous frequency of 0. 95 x 10 - 4 per viable spore. About two-thirds of the aneuploids originated during meiosis I, the rest during meiosis II. An investigation of these events in control meioses and after treatment with MMS, Benomyl and Amphotericin B suggests that this assay system is suitable for screening environmental mutagens for their effects on meiotic segregation...|$|R
40|$|PN 6024 is an {{extraordinary}} mutant strain of the cellular slime mold Polysphondylium pallidum, characterized by having defects in many unlinked genes. New strains with altered development appeared spontaneously as <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> of PN 6024. Genetic crosses using the macrocyst sexual cycle were used to show that PN 6030 (a clone like PN 6024 in phenotype) carries mutations at two loci, emm and hge, whereas PN 6031 (a clone of altered morphology) carries in addition a mutation at a third locus, mgt. hge and possibly mgt {{are linked to the}} mating type locus mat. The relatively high frequency of recombination between mat and hge is strong evidence that meiosis precedes macrocyst germination. The mutant genes themselves are of interest. A major effect of the emm- 1 mutation is to remove the requirement for light to trigger aggregation. hge- 1 greatly reduces the frequency of aggregation, whereas mgt- 1 greatly increases it under standard conditions. None of these mutations interrupts later development leading to stalks and spore cells. It is hypothesized that all three genes act on steps immediately preceding the differentiation of the founder cells which initiate aggregation...|$|R
40|$|Keratoacanthoma (KA) is {{a benign}} keratinocytic {{neoplasm}} that spontaneously regresses after 3 - 6 months and shares features with squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Furthermore, {{there are reports}} of KAs that have metastasized, invoking the question of whether KA is a variant of SCC (Hodak et al., 1993). To date, no reported criteria are sensitive enough to discriminate reliably between KA and SCC, and consequently there is a clinical need for discriminating markers. Our previous study analyzed 132 KAs and 29 SCCs and revealed significantly different regions of genomic aberrations using chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). In the present study, we applied array CGH to investigate 98 KAs and 22 SCCs from the above samples. The result shows that all KAs and SCCs have some degree of genetic aberrations. The distribution of numbers of <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> per sample differed significantly between KAs and SCCs (P< 0. 02), which also demonstrated recurrent aberrations that differed significantly (P< 0. 001), as illustrated by unsupervised cluster analysis. Classifiers for clinicopathological parameters of KAs were established based on t-test statistics and permutation tests. Tumor size, fibrosis, and inflammation, which are related to the developmental stages of KAs, showed significant (t-test, permutation test) associations with aberrations of selected genomic regions.

40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) is {{a devastating}} cancer {{with a median}} {{survival}} of around 15 months. Significant advances in treatment have not been achieved yet, even {{with a host of}} new therapeutics under investigation. Therefore, the quest for a cure for GBM remains as intense as ever. Of particular interest for GBM therapy is the selective induction of apoptosis using the pro-apoptotic tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL signals apoptosis via its two agonistic receptors TRAIL-R 1 and TRAIL-R 2. TRAIL is normally present as homotrimeric transmembrane protein, but can also be processed into a soluble trimeric form (sTRAIL). Recombinant sTRAIL has strong tumouricidal activity towards GBM cells, with no or minimal toxicity towards normal human cells. Unfortunately, GBM is a very heterogeneous tumour, with multiple genetically <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> within one tumour. Consequently, any single agent therapy is likely to be not effective enough. However, the anti-GBM activity of TRAIL can be synergistically enhanced by a variety of conventional and novel targeted therapies, making TRAIL an ideal candidate for combinatorial strategies. Here we will, after briefly detailing the biology of TRAIL/TRAIL receptor signalling, focus on the promises and pitfalls of recombinant TRAIL as a therapeutic agent alone and in combinatorial therapeutic approaches for GBM...|$|R

This question is important because these viruses persist in lymphoid cells and suppress double-stranded DNA-break repair. Consequently, prenatal adenovirus infections may generate the <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> of lymphocytes that precede development of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The present {{study was designed to}} overcome technical limitations of prior work by processing cord blood lymphocytes within a day of collection, and by analyzing sufficient numbers of lymphocytes to detect adenovirus-containing cells at the lower limits determined by our previous studies of tonsil lymphocytes. By this approach, adenoviral DNA was identified in 19 of 517 (3. 7 %) samples, providing definitive evidence for the occurrence of prenatal infection with species C adenoviruses in a significant fraction of neonates predominantly of African American and Hispanic ancestry. Cord blood samples were also tested for the presence of the ETV 6 -RUNX 1 translocation, the most common genetic abnormality in childhood ALL. Using a nested PCR assay, the ETV 6 -RUNX 1 transcript was detected in four of 196 adenovirus-negative samples and one of 14 adenovirus-positive cord blood samples. These findings indicate that this method will be suitable for determining concordance between adenovirus infection and the leukemia-associated translocations in newborns...|$|R
40|$|Multiple-complete-digest mapping is a DNA mapping {{technique}} {{based on}} complete-restriction-digest fingerprints {{of a set}} of clones that provides highly redundant coverage of the mapping target. The maps assembled from these fingerprints order both the clones and the restriction fragments. Maps are coordinated across three enzymes in the examples presented. Starting with yeast artificial chromosome contigs from the 7 q 31. 3 and 7 p 14 regions of the human genome, we have produced cosmid-based maps spanning more than one million base pairs. Each yeast artificial chromosome is first subcloned into cosmids at a redundancy of × 15 – 30. Complete-digest fragments are electrophoresed on agarose gels, poststained, and imaged on a fluorescent scanner. <b>Aberrant</b> <b>clones</b> that are not representative of the underlying genome are rejected in the map construction process. Almost every restriction fragment is ordered, allowing selection of minimal tiling paths with clone-to-clone overlaps of only a few thousand base pairs. These maps demonstrate the practicality of applying the experimental and software-based steps in multiple-complete-digest mapping to a target of significant size and complexity.

Little is known on BM cell recruitment and activity as BM aspirate is frequently contaminated with peripheral blood. But some evidences suggest an active role of immune cells in protection against MDS and secondary leukemia. BM CD 8 +CD 28 - CD 57 + T cells are directly cytotoxic and have a distinct cytokine signature in MDS, producing TNF-α, IL- 6, CCL 3, CCL 4, IL- 1 RA. TNF-α; FAS-L, TRAIL [...] . actively induce apoptosis of aberrant cells. On the other hand, TNF-α has ambiguous activity, increasing MDS related cytopenia and myelofibrosis together with TGF-b. IL- 32 amplifies NK cytotoxicity but also the vicious circle of TNF-α production. Myeloid Derived Suppressing Cells (MDSC) are increased in MDS and have ambiguous role in protection/ progression of the diseases. CD 33 is expressed on MDS and MDSC cells and is directly involved in MDSC activity. CD 33 is a potential target for biotherapy.

We microdissected a total of 173 histologically normal ducts or terminal ductolobular units (TDLUs) and malignant epithelial samples from 18 breast cancer cases, and examined their DNA for LOH at 21 microsatellite markers on 10 chromosome arms. Fourteen of 109 (13 %) normal ducts/TDLUs, from 8 of 18 (44 %) cases, contained LOH. The location of these 14 ducts/TDLUs appeared unrelated to distance from the cancer. LOH in normal-appearing epithelium involved only single markers, whereas LOH in cancers commonly encompassed all informative markers on a chromosome arm. In only 1 of 14 (7 %) ducts/TDLUs with LOH, was the same LOH seen in the co-existing cancer. Global differences in LOH per arm in normal-appearing tissue were not demonstrated, but less LOH was seen at 11 q and 17 p than at 1 q (P = 0. 002), 16 q (P = 0. 01), and possibly 17 q (P = 0. 06). These results indicate that in a large fraction of women with breast cancer, histologically normal breast epithelium harbors occult <b>aberrant</b> <b>clones.</b> Individual clones rarely are precursors of co-existing cancers.

Double minutes and homogeneously staining regions were observed in one and two carcinomas, respectively. To characterize the karyotypic profile of gallbladder cancer more precisely, we have combined the present findings with our three previously reported cases, thereby providing the largest cytogenetic database on this tumor type to date.

Therefore, in this study, extragonadal endometriosis (n = 10), ovarian endometriosis without malignancy (n = 10), ovarian endometriosis with direct transition into endometrioid adenocarcinoma (n = 8), and normal endometrium (n = 12) were investigated for numerical chromosomal aberrations by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} using centromere enumeration probes. The proportions of cells with aneusomies were semiquantitatively assessed. Trisomies 1 and 7, and monosomies 9 and 17 were found in endometriosis, ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and normal endometrium. The proportions of aneusomic cells were significantly higher in ovarian endometrioid carcinoma compared with ovarian endometriosis (P < 0. 001), and in ovarian endometriosis compared with extragonadal endometriosis and normal endometrium (P < 0. 001). The data provide new evidence of a common lineage of endometriosis and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. The higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations in endometrioid carcinoma than in endometriosis may reflect an expansion of <b>aberrant</b> cell <b>clones</b> already present in endometriosis during the progression to cancer. The higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations in ovarian endometriosis than in extragonadal endometriosis suggests a role of the ovarian stromal milieu in the induction of genetic changes, which may eventually lead to invasive cancer...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{case report}} an {{overview}} on the differential diagnostic considerations with respect to blood hypereosinophilia (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) in childhood is given. A 13 -year-old boy was admitted for the clarification of an asthma. In the blood count an increased HE with 3 [*] 500 /µl (30 %) was found along with elevated total serum IgE and IL- 5 level (2 [*] 000 [*]IU/ml and 17 [*]pg/ml). Lung function showed an obstruction (FEV 1 38 %). Radiologically the picture of bronchiectasis and mucus pluggine appeared. In the BAL a HE (76 %) with raised IL- 5 level was apparent. Histologically asthma was diagnosed with mucostasis, hypertrophy of the bronchial wall musculature and a lung HE. Differential-diagnostically an ABPA, a Churg-Strauss-Syndrome, a parasitosis, drug associated HE, allergies and malignant disease could be excluded. An <b>aberrant</b> T-cell <b>clone</b> in peripheral blood was detected by flow cytometry and T-cell receptor clonal rearrangements by PCR, leading to the diagnosis of a lymphoid variant of HES (L-HES). Failure to detect the FIP 1 L 1 -PDGFRA gene fusion and a normal bone marrow examination could exclude a neoplastic HES (HESN). After steroid initiation, prompt decrease of blood eosinophilia with resolution of symptoms was observed. Steroid discontinuation led to eosinophilia recurrence associated with disease symptoms. As steroid-sparing agent the immunosuppressive azathioprine was additionally given; steroid doses could be decreased and stopped in the course. This case demonstrated the range of HE evaluation in infancy. With asthma one should also consider {{the possibility of a}} L-HES...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{amplification}} (amp) {{is one of}} {{the basic}} mechanisms connected with overexpression of onco-genes. The c-MYC (located in 8 q 24) and MLL (located in 11 q 23) are the most often over represented genes that lead to a rapid proliferation of the affected cell clone in patients with myeloid neoplasms. Assessment of the level of amp c-MYC or amp MLL in the cases with trisomy 8 (+ 8) or trisomy 11 (+ 11) and myeloid malignances is necessary for a more precise estimation of the disease progression. A total of 26 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were included in the study: 18 with + 8, six with + 11 and two with complex karyotypes suspected of the partial trisomy. Routine cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were applied to indicate the chromosome alterations and genes amp in the bone marrow cells. Amp c-MYC was observed in 12 from 18 (66. 7 %) patients with + 8. All the patients with + 11 demonstrat-ed a different level of amp MLL. In most of the cases with MDS (9 / 10), the coincidence of the + 8 or + 11 with amp c-MYC or amp MLL, respectively, leads to transformation to AML and/or short overall survival. Our data suggest that amp c-MYC and amp MLL de-velop in conformity with + 8 and + 11, especially in cases with progressive deviations in the karyotype as an aggressive expansion of an <b>aberrant</b> cell <b>clone</b> and appearance of additional chromosome anomalies...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{variations}} {{are among}} the most frequent interindividual genetic differences in the human genome. The frequency and distribution of de novo somatic structural variants in normal cells is, however, poorly explored. Using age-stratified cohorts of 318 monozygotic (MZ) twins and 296 single-born subjects, we describe age-related accumulation of copy-number variation in the nuclear genomes in vivo and frequency changes for both megabase- and kilobase-range variants. Megabase-range aberrations were found in 3. 4 % (9 of 264) of subjects ≥ 60 years old; these subjects included 78 MZ twin pairs and 108 single-born individuals. No such findings were observed in 81 MZ pairs or 180 single-born subjects who were ≤ 55 years old. Recurrent region- and gene-specific mutations, mostly deletions, were observed. Longitudinal analyses of 43 subjects whose data were collected 7 - 19 years apart suggest considerable variation in the rate of accumulation of clones carrying structural changes. Furthermore, the longitudinal analysis of individuals with structural aberrations suggests that there is a natural self-removal of <b>aberrant</b> cell <b>clones</b> from peripheral blood. In three healthy subjects, we detected somatic aberrations characteristic of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. The recurrent rearrangements uncovered here are candidates for common age-related defects in human blood cells. We anticipate that extension of these results will allow determination of the genetic age of different somatic-cell lineages and estimation of possible individual differences between genetic and chronological age. Our work might also help to explain the cause of an age-related {{reduction in the number of}} cell clones in the blood; such a reduction is one of the hallmarks of immunosenescence. © 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{contemporary}} cytogenetic methods with DNA CGH microarray {{technology and}} chromosome flow-sorting increases substantially {{the ability to}} resolve exchange breakpoints associated with interstitial deletions and translocations, allowing the consequences of radiation damage to be directly measured at low doses, while also providing valuable insights into molecular mechanisms of misrepair processes that, in turn, identify appropriate biophysical models of risk at low doses. The aims of this work apply to cells recovered from 3 D tissue constructs of human skin and, {{for the purpose of}} comparison, the same cells irradiated in traditional 2 D cultures. These aims are: to analyze by multi-flour fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) the chromosomes in clonal descendents of individual human fibroblasts that were previously irradiated; to examine irradiated clones from Aim 1 for submicroscopic deletions by subjecting their DNA to comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray analysis; and to flow-sort <b>aberrant</b> chromosomes from <b>clones</b> containing stable radiation-induced translocations and map the breakpoints to within an average resolution of 100 kb using the technique of 'array painting'...|$|R
40|$|Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an {{inherited}} orphan disorder caused by mutations {{in one of}} the five genes encoding reduced nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate oxidase subunits, which subsequently lead to impairment in the production of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to offer several cell line models of CGD and therefore support research on pathophysiology and new therapeutic approaches, we optimized protocols to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from wild-type, X(0) -, AR 22 (0) - and AR 47 (0) -CGD patient's fibroblasts into neutrophils and into macrophages. <b>Aberrant</b> genetic <b>clones</b> were discarded after chromosome karyotyping and array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis. All remaining iPSC lines showed human embryonic stem cell-like morphology, expressed all tested pluripotency markers and formed embryoid bodies that contained cells originating from all three primary germ layers. Furthermore, each CGD patient-specific iPSC line retained the gp 91 (phox), p 47 (phox), and p 22 (phox) mutations found in the corresponding patient's neutrophils. The average production of CD 34 (+) progenitors was of 1. 5 × 10 (6) cells after 10 days of differentiation of 10 × 10 (6) iPSCs. They were terminally differentiated into about 3 × 10 (5) neutrophils or into 3 × 10 (7) macrophages. Based on morphological, phenotypical, and functional criteria both phagocyte types were mature and indistinguishable from the native human neutrophils and macrophages. However, neutrophils and macrophages derived from X(0) -, AR 22 (0) -, and AR 47 (0) -CGD patient-specific iPSC lines lacked ROS production and the corresponding mutated proteins. To simplify the phagocytes' production upon request, progenitors can be cryopreserved. In conclusion, we describe a reproducible, simple, and efficient way to generate neutrophils and macrophages from iPSCs and provide a new cellular model for the AR 22 (0) -CGD genetic form that has not been described before...|$|R
40|$|Post-zygotic genetic {{variation}} {{has previously been}} shown in healthy individuals and linked to various disorders. The definition of post-zygotic or somatic variation is the existence of genetically distinct populations of cells in a subject derived from a single zygote. Structural changes in the human genome are a major type of inter-individual {{genetic variation}} and copy number variation (CNV), involving changes in the copy number of genes, {{are one of the}} best studied category of structural genetic changes. In paper I we reported a pair of healthy female monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for aneuploidy of chromosomes X and Y, contributing to the delineation of the frequency of somatic variation in MZ twins. It also illustrates the plasticity of the genome for tolerating large aberrations in healthy subjects. In paper II we showed age-related accumulation of copy number variation in the nuclear genomes in vivo for both megabase- and kilobase-range variants. Using age-stratified MZ twins and single-born subjects, we detected megabase-range aberrations in 3. 4 % of people ≥ 60 years old but not in individuals younger than 55 years. Moreover, the longitudinal analysis of subjects with aberrations suggests that the <b>aberrant</b> cell <b>clones</b> are not immortalized and disappear from circulation. We also showed that sorted blood cells display different genomic profiles.   The detected recurrent rearrangements are candidates for common age-related defects in blood cells. This work might help to describe the cause of an age-related {{decline in the number of}} cell clones in the blood, which is one of the hallmarks of immunosenescence.  In paper III we described a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) ~ 4 kb upstream of the IFNAR 1 gene, which was somatically variable.   We detected 14 alleles displaying inter- and intra-individual variation. Further analyses indicated strong clustering of transcription factor binding sites within this region, suggesting an enhancer. This putative VNTR-based enhancer might influence the transcriptional regulation of neighboring cytokine receptor genes and the pathways they are involved in. These three studies stress the importance of research on post-zygotic variation in genetics. Furthermore, they emphasize that biobanks should consider sampling of multiple tissues to better address this issue in the genetic studies...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} factor VII (FVII) variant, FVIIShinjo, {{characterized}} by normal FVII antigen levels and variable procoagulant activity using tissue thromboplastin from different sources. Normal FVII activity is obtained using human placenta thromboplastin but low activity using rabbit or bovine brain thromboplastin. Exons 2 - 8 and the intron-exon junctions of the FVII genes of the propositus were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from peripheral white blood cells, and screened by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. DNA fragments showing <b>aberrant</b> mobility were <b>cloned</b> and sequenced. We detected a single-point mutation, a homozygous G to A transition at nucleotide position 6, 055 in exon 4, {{which results in}} the substitution of Arg 79 by Gln in the first EGF-like domain. This mutation results {{in a loss of}} a site for the restriction endonuclease MspI. The Msp I digestion pattern of the PCR-amplified exon 3 + 4 fragments from each member of the family was determined. The Msp I haplotypes were consistent with this G to A transition being associated with reduced FVII activity as detected using thromboplastins from various species. We conclude that the Arg 79 to Gln substitution in the first EGF-like domain of FVII identified in the propositus is responsible for the inherited FVII abnormality in this Japanese family. We postulate that one of the sites of interaction between FVII and tissue thromboplastin includes Arg 79 in the first EGF-like domain of factor VII...|$|R
