[...] This statement was not true for Glinka, who studied Western music theory assiduously with Siegfried Dehn in Berlin before he composed his opera A Life for the Tsar. It was true for Balakirev, who [...] "opposed academicism with tremendous vigor," [...] <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> initially for Rimsky-Korsakov, who had been imbued by Balakirev and Stasov with the same attitude.|$|E

40|$|What is {{a fictional}} character? Nothing, {{according}} to Mark Sainsbury. Yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> {{to say that}} there are fictional characters. How?

How? Because the truth-value of the sentence is to be assessed under the (false) presupposition that there are such people as Emma <b>and</b> Anna. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> to say that Conan Doyle's novels represent Sherlock Holmes, that I have been thinking about Holmes, and that Holmes is a famous character. How? Because such sentences either involve, or can be explained in terms of, intensional verbs or operators, and intensional contexts do not require that something be the thing which is represented, or thought about, or regarded in such a way as to make it famous...|$|R

In this paper, we {{construct}} a complete invariant for stably homeomorphic classes of curves on compact oriented surfaces without boundaries {{and show that}} this is a finite type invariant for curves. 1. Introduction. In knot theory, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still unknown whether finite type invariants completely classify knots (the Vassiliev conjecture).

Her shrinking form, her downcast eyes, when she had to listen to him, cornered at the end of an empty corridor, he regarded as signs of submission to the overpowering force of his will, the recognition of his personal fascinations.

40|$|Excerpt] Under federal law, {{corporations}} or {{most other}} legal entities may be criminally {{liable for the}} crimes of their employees and agents. This <b>is</b> <b>true</b> {{in the case of}} regulatory offenses, like crimes in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, <b>and</b> Cosmetic Act; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in the case of economic offenses, like crimes in violation of the securities laws; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in the case of common law crimes, like keeping a house of prostitution in violation of the Mann Act. Ordinarily, the agents and employees who commit the crimes for which their principals and employers are liable also face prosecution and punishment. Individual criminal statutes, Justice Department policies, and the Sentencing Guidelines largely dictate the circumstances under which, and the extent to which, agents, employees, corporations, and similar unincorporated entities are prosecuted and punished. This is a brief overview of federal law in the area...|$|R

In contrast, business loans increase following {{a monetary}} tightening. The `perverse' response of business loans cannot be explained by an increase in the demand for funds due to a reduction in real activity. These results are consistent with a change in bank portfolio behaviour in favour of business loans in response to a monetary tightening. ...|$|R
