OBJECTIVE: The present manuscript describes CIP’s modified protocol for potato cryopreservation, its large-scale application, {{and the establishment of}} quality and operational standards, which included a viability reassessment of material entering the cryobank. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2013, CIP established stricter quality and operational standards under which 1, 028 potato accessions were cryopreserved with an improved PVS 2 -droplet protocol. In 2014 the viability of 114 accessions cryopreserved in 2013 accessions were reassessed. RESULTS: The average recovery rate (full plant recovery after LN exposure) of 1028 cryopreserved Solanum species ranged from 34 to 59 %, and 70 % of the processed accessions showed a minimum recovery rate of = 20 % and were considered as successfully cryopreserved. CONCLUSION: CIP has established a new high quality management system for cryobanking. Periodic viability reassessment, strict and clear recovery criteria and the monitoring of the percent of successful <b>accessions</b> meeting the <b>criteria</b> as well as contamination rates are metrics that need to be considered in cryobanks.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of EU financial assistance {{is to help}} prepare the Western Balkan countries {{to meet the challenges}} of future EU membership. From 2000 to 2007, SAPARD, ISPA, PHARE and CARDS were financial instruments which help candidate and potential candidate countries to carry out reforms, important for accession preparations, as per the membership criteria, but also for the economic and social modernization of the countries. In 2007, with a view to streamline all pre-accession in a single framework and under the same regulation, the new Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) replaced the previous pre-accession programmes. The main objective of the IPA is to help the countries to face the challenge of European integration, to implement the reforms needed to meet EU requirements and progress in the Stabilization and Association Process and to lay the foundations for fulfilling Copenhagen criteria for the EU membership. The European Union, in the last few decades, has been particularly interested in providing support to countries which are potential candidates such as Albania. In the past, until 2007, the EU supported Albania through various instruments like: ECHO-Humanitarian Aid programme, PHARE and CARDS. The IPA 2007 - 2013 is aimed at supporting the accession process of Albania focusing on political, institutional and economic transition.

40|$|Preparing for EU {{membership}} requires changes {{across a}} wide range of sectors in many of the institutions and organisations involved in the public governance and legislative enforcement processes. Criteria that every candidate country has to undertake in the process of accession, known as "Copenhagen criteria", can be summed down to political, economical and administrative requirements in order to fully adopt, implement and comply with the Community acquis. The administrative criteria (also known as Madrid criteria) requires from the candidate country to be able to create conditions for adjustment of national governance structure to the EU public governance mechanisms. This requires modernisation of their administrations taking into account the principles of professionalism and neutrality. Transition and EU enlargement deeply rely on capacities and quality of common and national institutions responsible for enforcement and conduct of development policies. In the very core of this adaptation process lays the institutional change and convergence. Institutions create motivational structures for individuals and organisations, and coordinate their activities and behaviour. Although institutions have to provide envisaged and coherent rules, sometimes {{there is a need for}} institutions to change and adapt to social preferences, technology, political and socio-economic structures and external factors. Many challenges in Croatian public administration rise from inadequate education, insufficient monitoring of employees' performance, and high level of political impact, lack of organisational culture, true values, paternalism and no orientation toward a citizen. There is no defined development strategy in public governance. The number of state officials is extremely high. Nevertheless, the government has foreseen seize of public administration growth, horizontal decentralisation, rationality and sound economic behaviour in the accession to EU. It is highly important because public administration is the one to carry the burden of legislative reform within the country. European Commission objects Croatia the weakness of its institutions indebted for efficient cooperation with International Court of Justice and conduct of obligations from international agreements. For the past few years EU-Croatia Parliamentary Committee has adopted several Declarations and Recommendations all stating that Croatia demonstrates continuous progress and efforts in the area of judicial and public administration reform, but also has to pursue strengthening the administrative capacity, not only to implement adopted reforms, but to secure that it can benefit fully from increased financial assistance.

Furthermore we investigate to which degree countries are fulfilling the <b>accession</b> <b>criteria</b> and compare their performance with the performance of earlier EU joiners like the countries of the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Greece. After concluding that the <b>accession</b> <b>criteria</b> do not necessarily favour a particular monetary regime, we analyse {{the pros and cons of}} the two regimes widely believed to be most stable- currency boards and inflation targeting. We find that under either regime tensions are likely to arise from the attempt to meet the <b>accession</b> <b>criteria</b> of a low inflation rate and a stable exchange rate. Due to likely large productivity gains in the traded goods sector the real exchange rate can be expected to display a trend real appreciation. Thus a currency board arrangement may well fail to produce an inflation rate below the Maastricht ceiling, unless the economy is run with a wasteful amount of spare capacity. Similarly the credibility of any inflation target would be undermined by the requirement that the exchange rate be kept within a specified target zone. This conflict could be resolved if the inflation ceiling was re-specified in terms of traded goods price inflation (and preferable in terms of ' core' traded goods price inflation) but this would require a change in the Maastricht Treaty...|$|E

It analyzes the influence of multiculturalism on Turkey’s accession and addresses the challenges arising from multiculturalism.

Two conclusions emerge: First {{there is a substantial}} degree of internal logic to the reports. The second conclusion is that the interpretation and reconstruction of the criteria, through the practice of pre-accession monitoring, entails an inherent amplification of the criteria. diversity/homogeneity; European identity; normative political theory; enlargement; Poland; Romania...|$|E
