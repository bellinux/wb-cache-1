25|$|An {{alternative}} technique, which shares much {{in common}} with DSC, is differential thermal analysis (DTA). In this technique it is the heat flow to the sample <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> that remains the same rather than the temperature. When the sample <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> are heated identically, phase changes and other thermal processes cause a difference in temperature between the sample <b>and</b> <b>reference.</b> Both DSC <b>and</b> DTA provide similar information. DSC measures the energy required to keep both the <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> the sample at the same temperature whereas DTA measures the difference in temperature between the sample <b>and</b> the <b>reference</b> when the same amount of energy has been introduced into both.|$|R

5|$|A 1983 {{industry}} crash, {{caused by}} the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted {{a higher degree of}} regulation by future console manufacturers: when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, Nintendo of America instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a lockout chip to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, <b>and</b> <b>references</b> to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.|$|E

While conventional accounts of meaning took expressions to have just one feature (reference), Frege introduced the view that expressions have two different aspects of significance: their sense <b>and</b> their <b>reference.</b>|$|R

It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E
5|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{released}} on September 24, 1991.

The album's subject matter incorporated sexual innuendos <b>and</b> <b>references</b> to drugs and death as well as themes of lust and exuberance.|$|E
5|$|Burger's Daughter details a {{group of}} white anti-apartheid activists in South Africa seeking to {{overthrow}} the South African government.

The perspective shifts between Rosa's internal monologue (often directed towards her father or her lover Conrad), and the omniscient narrator. The novel is rooted {{in the history of the}} anti-apartheid struggle <b>and</b> <b>references</b> to actual events and people from that period, including Nelson Mandela and the 1976 Soweto uprising.|$|E

5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early {{performances of the}} play is scant. What is known is that {{the crew of the}} ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions <b>and</b> <b>references</b> to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E
5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home {{in case of an}} accident. This {{had a profound effect on}} Zappa, <b>and</b> <b>references</b> to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E

40|$|This column aims {{to explore}} the {{potential}} of personal information management (PIM) <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> management. It focuses on combining the use of PIM <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> management software with mind maps to stimulate the creative and innovative use of information collected. Following {{a brief review of}} the literature on the topic per se, awareness is raised of appropriate software and the potential of mind maps. The column is written against the background of research from information behaviour, PIM, mind maps, creativity, innovation and the reflective and evidence-focused librarian. There is growing emphasis on more than information literacy skills and the responsible use of information. Creative and innovative use of information is stressed. More intensive use and exploitation of information is necessary to justify the time and effort spent in using PIM <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> management software. Mind maps and collaboration might support creative and innovative use of information, and need to be further exploited. Although software is strong in supporting collaboration, there is very limited built-in support for the combination of features for information <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> management with features for mind maps. Although much has been published on developments in PIM <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> management, there is limited coverage of combining PIM <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> management with the use of mind maps and creativity, reflection and noting evidence.
