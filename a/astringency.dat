5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include <b>astringency</b> and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of willow bark extract to cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the doctrine of signatures to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish waters that were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an <b>astringency</b> reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the active ingredient of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the active ingredient of willow extract, salicin, relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian Ayurvedic tradition, {{one of the}} six tastes is <b>astringency</b> (kasaaya). In Sinhala and Sri Lankan English it is {{referred}} to as kahata.|$|E
25|$|The <b>astringency</b> in tea can be {{attributed}} to the presence of polyphenols. These are the most abundant compounds in tea leaves, making up 30-40% of their composition.|$|E
25|$|Winemakers {{working with}} Barbera {{have a variety}} of ways to deal with the grape's high acidity and <b>astringency.</b> The most common has been through {{blending}} with varieties lacking those components and creating a softer and potentially more balanced wine as a result.|$|E
25|$|Sea {{buckthorn}} berries are edible and nutritious, though astringent, sour and oily, unpleasant to eat raw, unless 'bletted' (frosted {{to reduce the}} <b>astringency)</b> and/or mixed as a drink with sweeter substances such as apple or grape juice. Additionally, malolactic fermentation of sea buckthorn juice reduces sourness, thus in general enhances sensory properties. The mechanism behind this change is transformation of malic acid into lactic acid in microbial metabolism.|$|E
25|$|The stalk (or rafle) is the {{herbaceous}} branch {{that bears}} the grapes. It consists of about 80% water, soluble minerals (nearly 3% {{with half of}} potassium) and polyphenols. The polyphenols are mainly tannins and {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste and the sensation of <b>astringency.</b> In the production of a white wine, the stalk does not contain any useful part: its moisture can cause dilution and the presence of tannins is not desirable in the wine. This is why it is quickly isolated {{from the rest of the}} harvest, either by shaking or by pressing.|$|E
25|$|Wine simple phenols {{are further}} {{transformed}} during wine aging into complex molecules formed notably by the condensation of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins, which explains the modification in the color. Anthocyanins react with catechins, proanthocyanidins and other wine components during wine aging to form new polymeric pigments {{resulting in a}} modification of the wine color and a lower <b>astringency.</b> Average total polyphenol content measured by the Folin method is 216mg/100 ml for red wine and 32mg/100 ml for white wine. The content of phenols in rosé wine (82mg/100 ml) is intermediate between that in red and white wines.|$|E
25|$|In red wine, up to 90% of the wine's {{phenolic}} content {{falls under}} the classification of flavonoids. These phenols, mainly derived from the stems, seeds and skins are often leached out of the grape during the maceration period of winemaking. The amount of phenols leached is known as extraction. These compounds contribute to the <b>astringency,</b> color and mouthfeel of the wine. In white wines the number of flavonoids is reduced due to the lesser contact with the skins that they receive during winemaking. There is on-going study into {{the health benefits of}} wine derived from the antioxidant and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{benefits}} associated with lees contact deals with the influence on the wine of the mannoproteins released during the autolysis of the yeast cells. Composed primarily of mannose and proteins, with some glucose, mannoproteins are often bound in the cell wall of yeast with hydrophobic aroma compounds that become volatilized as the cell wall breaks down. Not only does the release of mannoproteins impart sensory changes in the wine but they can contribute to tartrate and protein stability, help enhance the body and mouthfeel of the wine as well as decrease the perception of bitterness and <b>astringency</b> of tannins.|$|E
25|$|In winemaking, {{the grape}} {{is often used}} as a deep {{coloring}} component in blends, rather than being made in a varietal form with some exceptions. Carignan can be a difficult variety for winemakers to work with being naturally high in acidity, tannins and <b>astringency</b> which {{requires a lot of}} skill to produce a wine of finesse and elegance. Some winemakers have experimented with carbonic maceration and adding small amounts of Cinsault and Grenache with some positive results. Syrah and Grenache are considered its best blending partners being capable of performing a softer wine with rustic fruit and perfume. In California, Ridge Vineyards has found some success with a varietal wine made from Carignan vines that were planted in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between free-run and pressed juice is that pressed juice often has lower acidity levels, higher potassium and pH level, more phenolic compounds such as tannins and more suspended solids such as natural gum and proteins. Some of these attributes can be positive {{influences on the}} wine with the increased phenolics offering more body, aroma characteristics (such as the varietal aromas from terpenes) and aging potential. Other attributes may have more negative influence such as increased <b>astringency</b> and bitterness, precursor for browning pigments in white wine, mouthfeel and balance issues (as well as potential microbial instability) from the increased pH and the enhance need for fining agents {{to assist in the}} clarification and stabilization of the wine with the increase in suspended solids.|$|E
25|$|Tannins {{refer to}} the diverse group of {{chemical}} compounds in wine that can affect the color, aging ability and texture of the wine. While tannins cannot be smelled or tasted, they can be perceived during wine tasting by the tactile drying sensation and sense of bitterness that they can leave in the mouth. This {{is due to the}} tendency of tannins to react with proteins, such as the ones found in saliva. In food and wine pairing, foods that are high in proteins (such as red meat) are often paired with tannic wines to minimize the <b>astringency</b> of tannins. However, many wine drinkers find the perception of tannins to be a positive trait—especially as it relates to mouthfeel. The management of tannins in the winemaking process is a key component in the resulting quality.|$|E
500|$|In his {{analysis}} of King Priam, Bowen argues that the change in Tippett's musical style arose initially from [...] {{the nature of the}} opera, a tragedy radically different in tone from [...] the warm optimism of The Midsummer Marriage. Clarke sees the change as something more fundamental, the increases in dissonance and atonality in Priam being representative of a trend that continued and reached a climax of <b>astringency</b> a few years later in Tippett's third opera, The Knot Garden. Tippett's new modernistic language, writes Clarke, was rooted in his desire to represent a wider range of human experiences, characteristic of a changing world: [...] "War, violence, sex, homoeroticism, and social and interpersonal alienation [...] much more overtly in [...] dramatic works or works with text". Critics acknowledged Priam as a considerable achievement, but received the new musical style cautiously. [...] While Gloag thought the change was not [...] an absolute departure from Tippett's earlier style, [...] Milner viewed King Priam as a complete break with Tippett's previous work, pointing out the lack of counterpoint, the considerably increased dissonances, and the move towards atonality: [...] "very little of the music is in a definite key".|$|E
2500|$|When {{referring}} to wine, dry {{is the opposite}} of sweet, and does not refer to <b>astringency.</b> Wines that contain tannins and so cause an astringent sensation are not necessarily classified as [...] "dry", and [...] "dry" [...] wines are not necessarily astringent.|$|E
2500|$|Chokeberries are {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants and}} as food products. The sour berries can be eaten raw off the bush, but are more frequently processed. They {{can be found}} in wine, jam, syrup, juice, soft spreads, tea, salsa, chili starters, extracts, beer, ice cream, gummies and tinctures. The name [...] "chokeberry" [...] comes from the <b>astringency</b> of the fruits, which create a sensation making one's mouth pucker.|$|E
2500|$|Plantation bushes (guànmù, taídì, [...] ): Cultivated tea bushes, {{from the}} seeds or {{cuttings}} of wild tea trees and planted in relatively low altitudes and flatter terrain. The tea produced from these plants are considered inferior {{due to the}} use of pesticides and chemical fertilizer in cultivation, and the lack of pleasant flavors, and the presence of harsh bitterness and <b>astringency</b> from the tea.|$|E
2500|$|It has {{therapeutic}} {{applications for}} its anti-itching, astringent, and antiseptic properties, and, as an over-the-counter preparation like Burow's solution, {{it is used}} to treat ear infections. Burow's solution preparations have been diluted and modified with amino acids to make them more palatable for use as gargles for conditions like aphthous ulcers of the mouth. [...] In veterinary medicine, aluminium triacetate's <b>astringency</b> property is used for treating Mortellaro disease in hoofed animals such as cattle.|$|E
2500|$|Its more {{pronounced}} oxidation and a quicker release of aromas help wines {{to lose their}} <b>astringency</b> and harshness faster; which makes this the wood of choice for shorter maturations - six to ten months. Because of American oak’s modest tannin contribution, the perfect first fill is a wine with abundant tannins and good texture; it allows the fruit to interact harmoniously with the wood, which contributes {{a wide array of}} complex aromas and soft, yet very palatable tannins.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>astringency</b> {{associated}} with wine is usually {{derived from a}} wine's tannins. Tannins add a gritty texture and chalky, astringent taste. It can enhance the perception of [...] "body" [...] or weight in the wine. Tannins are normally derived from the skins, seeds, and stems of the grapes themselves (leeched out during the maceration process) or from contact with oak during barrel aging. Tannins react with proteins. When paired with dishes that are high in proteins and fats (such as red meat and hard cheeses), the tannins will bind to the proteins and come across as softer. In the absence of protein from the food, such as some vegetarian dishes, the tannins will react with the proteins on the tongue and sides of the mouth—accentuating the <b>astringency</b> and having a drying effect on the palate. Various cooking methods, such as grilling and blackening can add a bitter [...] "char" [...] component to the dish that will allow it to play well with a tannic wine. While fish oils can make tannic wines taste metallic or off. Astringent tannic wines like Barolo and Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a lot of foods but can be soften by fatty foods {{with a lot of}} proteins such as hard cheeses or meats. The dry tannins also serve as a cleansing agent on the palate by binding to the grease and oils left over in the mouth. Spicy and sweet foods can accentuate the dry, bitterness of tannins and make the wine seem to have off flavors.|$|E

The taste of aged raw pu'erh or ripe pu'erh should be smooth, with slight hints of bitterness, and lack a biting <b>astringency</b> or any off-sour tastes. The element of taste {{is an important}} indicator of aged pu'erh quality, the texture should be rich and thick and should have very distinct gān (甘) and húigān(回甘) on the tongue and cheeks, which together induces salivation and leaves a [...] "feeling" [...] {{in the back of}} the throat.|$|E
2500|$|Other screenwriters made large contributions, too, but [...] "probably none {{larger than}} Mankiewicz's," [...] {{according}} to Kael.

2500|$|Wild trees (gŭshù, {{literally}} [...] "old tree"): Teas {{from old}} wild trees, grown without human intervention, {{are the highest}} valued pu'er teas.

Young raw pu'er teas produced from the leaf tips of these trees also lack overwhelming <b>astringency</b> and bitterness often attributed to young pu'er.

2500|$|In winemaking, fining is {{the process}} where a {{substance}} (fining agent) {{is added to the}} wine to create an adsorbent, enzymatic or ionic bond with the suspended particles, producing larger molecules and larger particles that will precipitate out of the wine more readily and rapidly. Unlike filtration, which can only remove particulates (such as dead yeast cells and grape fragments), fining can remove soluble substances such as polymerized tannins, coloring phenols and proteins; some of these proteins can cause haziness in wines exposed to high temperatures after bottling. The reduction of tannin can reduce <b>astringency</b> in red wines intended for early drinking. Many substances have historically been used as fining agents, including dried blood powder, but today there are two general types of fining agents [...] organic compounds and solid/mineral materials.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called bletting. Some, such as the early-ripening varieties [...] "pieper" [...] and [...] "NC21"(also known as [...] "supersweet"), easily lose <b>astringency</b> and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch—these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited [...] "yates", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The {{same goes for the}} Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki), where early frost can severely damage a fruit crop.|$|E
2500|$|This {{plant has}} oval entire leaves, and {{unisexual}} flowers on short stalks. In the male flowers, which are numerous, the stamens are sixteen {{in number and}} arranged in pairs; the female flowers are solitary, with traces of stamens, and a smooth ovary with one ovule {{in each of the}} eight cells—the ovary is surmounted by four styles, which are hairy at the base. The fruit-stalk is very short, bearing a subglobose fruit an inch in diameter or a bit larger, of an orange-yellow color, ranging to bluish, and with a sweetish astringent pulp. [...] It is surrounded at the base by the persistent calyx-lobes, which increase in size as the fruit ripens. [...] The <b>astringency</b> renders the fruit somewhat unpalatable, but after it has been subjected to the action of frost, or has become partially rotted or [...] "bletted" [...] like a medlar, its flavor is improved.|$|E
2500|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristics of}} its fruit {{have made the}} tree well known. [...] This fruit is a globular berry, with variation {{in the number of}} seeds, sometimes with eight and sometimes without any. [...] It bears at its apex the remnants of the styles and sits in the enlarged and persistent calyx. [...] It ripens in late autumn, is pale orange with a red cheek, often covered with a slight glaucous bloom. [...] One joke among Southerners is to induce strangers to taste unripe persimmon fruit, as its very astringent bitterness is shocking to those unfamiliar with it. [...] Folklore states that frost is required to make it edible, but fully ripened fruit lightly shaken from the tree or found on the ground below the tree is sweet, juicy and delicious. [...] The peculiar <b>astringency</b> of the fruit is due to the presence of a tannin similar to that of Cinchona. [...] The seeds were used as buttons during the American Civil War.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the works}} of Bliss's maturity, Burn {{comments}} {{that many of them}} were inspired by external stimuli. Some by the performers for whom they were written, such as the concertos for piano (1938), violin (1955) and cello (1970); some by literary and theatrical partners, such as the film music, ballets, cantatas and The Olympians; some by painters, such as the Serenade and the Metamorphic Variations; some by classical literature, such as Hymn to Apollo (1926), The Enchantress, and Pastoral. Of Bliss's works after the Second [...] World War, his opera, The Olympians is generally considered a failure. The idiom was judged to be old-fashioned. A contemporary critic, in a broadly favourable review, wrote, [...] "Bliss has wisely cleared his idiom of modern harmonic <b>astringency.</b> He uses quite a lot of common chords and progressions; in fact, he has gone back to the harmony of the musical gods. The result, inevitably, is a certain air of reminiscence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many wine lovers see natural tannins (found {{particularly}} in varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon and often accentuated by heavy oak barrel aging) {{as a sign}} of potential longevity and ageability.

[...] In many regions (such as in Bordeaux), tannic grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon are blended with lower-tannin grapes such as Merlot or Cabernet Franc, diluting the tannic characteristics. White wines and wines that are vinified to be drunk young (for examples, see nouveau wines) typically have lower tannin levels.|$|E
2500|$|After {{giving up}} his {{practice}} around 1784, Hahnemann made his living chiefly {{as a writer and}} translator, while resolving also to investigate the causes of medicine's alleged errors. While translating William Cullen's A Treatise on the Materia Medica, Hahnemann encountered the claim that cinchona, the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating malaria because of its <b>astringency.</b> Hahnemann believed that other astringent substances are not effective against malaria and began to research cinchona's effect on the human body by self-application. Noting that the drug induced malaria-like symptoms in himself, he concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: [...] "that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms." [...] This principle, like cures like, became the basis for an approach to medicine which he gave the name homeopathy. He first used the term homeopathy in his essay Indications of the Homeopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice, published in Hufeland's Journal in 1807.|$|E
2500|$|According to the National Cancer Institute, the {{aluminium}} acetates {{are used}} topically in humans as antiseptic agents, which also cause body tissues to shrink.

2500|$|In {{the most}} notable {{expression}} of Nebbiolo, the wines of Barolo, there is division between what is considered a [...] "traditional" [...] approach to Nebbiolo and a [...] "modernist" [...] approach. The roots of both styles can trace their history to the early [...] "pre-technology" [...] production of Nebbiolo. Prior to the advent of temperature-controlled fermentation, the late harvest dates for Nebbiolo meant that the wines began fermentation when the weather turned cold. These cool temperatures would delay fermentation for several days, extending the maceration period and extraction of phenolic compounds such as tannins. When fermentation did begin, temperatures would reach excessive levels of 95-100 °F (35-38 °C), which would drastically reduce potential aromas and flavors. With {{the high levels of}} tannins, these early Barolos would require five years or more of aging in oak barrels to soften some of the <b>astringency.</b> Lack of understanding of proper hygiene lead to less sanitary conditions than what both traditional and modernist producers maintain today. Those conditions lead to the development of bacterial infection of cement fermentation tanks and old wood barrels, which contributed to the development of off flavors and potential wine faults that would require at least 24 hours decanting to alleviate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1693, amidst another {{conflict}} with the French, King William III of England imposed punitive levels of taxation French wine imports. This {{very high level of}} taxation, drove even more English wine merchants to the Douro. The popularity of Port, or [...] "blackstrap" [...] as it was sometimes known because of its dark color and <b>astringency,</b> continued to increase when the War of the Spanish Succession essentially severed all trade in French wine among the English. With that rising popularity also came an increase in wine fraud and adulteration. Less than scrupulous producers were adding sugar and elderberry juice to the wine to increase alcohol content and enhance color more cheaply. Various spices such as black pepper, cinnamon and ginger were added to give the wine additional flavors. Grapes grown in other regions of Portugal and even Spain were trucked into Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia to be misrepresented as authentic Port from the Douro. As news of the scandal spread, sales and imports of Port wine in England dropped dramatically. Imports dropped from a high 116,000 hectoliters (over 3 million US gallons) in 1728 to 54,900 hectoliters (around 1.45million US gallons) in 1756. Worse still for the Port producers was the precipitous drop in pricing.|$|E
2500|$|The word 'alumen' {{occurs in}} Pliny's Natural History. In the 52nd chapter of his 35th book, {{he gives a}} {{detailed}} description. By comparing this with the account of 'stupteria' given by Dioscorides in the 123rd chapter of his 5th book, it is obvious the two are identical. Pliny informs us that 'alumen' was found naturally in the earth. He calls it 'salsugoterrae'. Different substances were distinguished {{by the name of}} 'alumen', but they were all characterised by a certain degree of <b>astringency,</b> and were all employed in dyeing and medicine, the light-colored alumen being useful in brilliant dyes, the dark-colored only in dyeing black or very dark colors. One species was a liquid, which was apt to be adulterated; but when pure it had the property of blackening when added to pomegranate juice. This property seems to characterize a solution of iron sulfate in water; a solution of ordinary (potassium) alum would possess no such property. Pliny says that there is another kind of alum that the Greeks call 'schiston', and which [...] "splits into filaments of a whitish colour", From the name 'schiston' and the mode of formation, it appears that this species was the salt that forms spontaneously on certain salty minerals, as alum slate and bituminous shale, and consists chiefly of sulfates of iron and aluminium. In some places the iron sulfate may have been lacking, so the salt would be white and would answer, as Pliny says it did, for dyeing bright colors. Pliny describes several other species of alumen {{but it is not clear}} as to what these minerals are.|$|E
