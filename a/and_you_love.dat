500|$|Critics {{compared}} [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] {{to previous}} works by Ne-Yo. Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "second cousin" [...] of Ne-Yo's singles [...] "Sexy Love" [...] and [...] "Because of You". Regarding the lyrics, Rihanna said, [...] "When you're {{in love with}} someone, even though they keep hurting you, you're so naive <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> them {{so much that you}} put all the negative behind even though you keep getting hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{recorded}} it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade {{you could}} hear Tom saying, [...] "When your heart beats, and you hold me, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> me..." [...] That {{was the last thing}} you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff. We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.|$|E
500|$|Everyone reminisces {{about the}} huge meal and much fun ("This Was a Real Nice Clambake"). [...] Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks {{in at the}} wrong moment, and {{declares}} that he is finished with her ("Geraniums In the Winder"), as Jigger jeers ("There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman"). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that [...] "he's your feller <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> him" [...] ("What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"). [...] Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. [...] She begs him {{to give it to}} her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.|$|E

500|$|Chesnutt shopped {{the album}} around to record companies, but they mistook {{it for a}} demo and {{rejected}} it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He {{said in an interview}} for Vibe at the time, [...] "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience I had in my bedroom? To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do." [...] In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go! ...|$|E
500|$|Hassan is Amir's closest {{childhood}} friend. He {{is described}} as having a China doll face, green eyes, and a harelip. Hosseini regards him as a flat character in terms of development; he is [...] "a lovely guy and you root for him <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> him but he's not complicated". The reader eventually discovers that Hassan is actually the son of Baba and Sanaubar, although Hassan never discovers this during his lifetime. Moreover, it would make Hassan a Pashtun according to tribal law and not Hazara as he's actually the son of Baba, and ironic for Assef to bully him as both Assef and Hassan are half Pashtuns. Hassan is later killed by the Taliban for refusal to abandon Amir's property.|$|E
500|$|... "Marry You" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons, the collaboration of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, for Mars's debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Lawrence explained the inspiration behind the song in an interview with American Songwriter stating, [...] "e had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she’s in her gown and he’s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling". Lawrence was surprised at the impact of the song after watching some YouTube videos. He stated that [...] "e always {{thought it was a good}} song and catchy, but we didn’t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has. The first time we saw one of those YouTube videos...we were almost in tears... the power of what it is we can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people’s lives in such an amazing way." [...] In an interview with Idolator Bruno Mars said that the song had its beginning by [...] "just playing the chords," [...] and then freestyling the lyrics [...] "I think I wanna marry you!". He continued, [...] "you’re in Vegas...had way too many drinks, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> everybody, and you want to do something that you probably shouldn’t do and you’ll regret in the morning." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grohl {{stated that}} it was [...] "a song about realizing {{that you are the}} source of all of the {{problems}} in a relationship <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> the other person so much, you want to free them of the problem, which is actually yourself. It was a riff that turned into another riff that turned into another riff and ended up being a nice little power punk song." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why? If {{he loves}} you <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> him, {{you have a right}} to him. Among all the shams and fictions that we call laws, there is only one true-- the law of Nature, by virtue of which you belong to each other." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Perfectly right; {{if people}} be {{right to marry}} only for the present. And now, let us hear what you are unhappy about.

60|$|DAISY. And {{sometimes}} {{you were so}} exquisitely tender. Your voice was soft and caressing. And you called me by sweet names so that the tears ran down my cheeks.
