50|$|The {{world economy}} crisis is traced back by Sinn to {{an abuse of}} {{liability}} limitation by American investment banks. The lack of capital reserve requirements gave these banks the possibility to pursue their business with inadequate capital reserves and encouraged them to gamble. In addition the lack of personal liability for homeowners created {{in a similar way}} an exaggerated willingness to take risks and thus caused the United States housing bubble. To correct this situation Sinn has called for considerably higher capital reserve requirements, the balancing of offshore business and a return to the <b>accounting</b> <b>principle</b> of the lower of cost of the German Commercial Code (HGB).|$|E

5000|$|Substance over form is an <b>accounting</b> <b>principle</b> used [...] "to {{ensure that}} {{financial}} statements give a complete, relevant, and {{accurate picture of}} transactions and events". If an entity practices the 'substance over form' concept, then the financial statements will show the overall financial reality of the entity (economic substance), rather than the legal form of transactions (form).In accounting for business transactions and other events, the measurement and reporting is for {{the economic impact of}} an event, instead of its legal form. Substance over form is critical for reliable financial reporting. It is particularly relevant in cases of revenue recognition, sale and purchase agreements, etc. The key point of the concept is that a transaction should not be recorded in such a manner as to hide the true intent of the transaction, which would mislead the readers of a company's financial statements.|$|E
50|$|For {{certain types}} of companies, {{different}} recognition criteria may apply, for instance, the option to recognise financial assets at either acquisition cost or fair value is unaivalable to investment funds which must necessarily use fair value, as laid out by the Law of 17 December 2010. Tax rules significantly affect accounting practice in Luxembourg, for instance, some instruments may qualify as debt instruments under Lux GAAP while they are recognised as equity instruments above, for instance Convertible Preferred Equity Certificates (CPECs) which consist of preference shares which pay an interest to the investor but are accounted for as debt while they would typically meet the recognition criteria as an equity instrument under IAS 32. Generally speaking, substance over form has been made a non-mandatory <b>accounting</b> <b>principle</b> with the Law of 30 July 2013, and the legal substance of contracts usually takes precedence under Lux GAAP as opposed to economic substance under IFRS, similar to accounting principles in France. Similarly, legal rules applicable to companies in Luxembourg also affect accounting, especially the Law of 10 August 1915 as amended, which constitutes the main law for commercial companies. For instance, article 49 of the 1915 Law contains strict rules concerning the purchase of own shares, which translate into a specific accounting treatment whereby the own shares must be neutralised and allocated to a specific reserve.|$|E

5000|$|FIN 46 was an {{interpretation}} of ARB 51, an <b>accounting</b> <b>principle</b> issued in August 1959 defining the situations where Consolidated Financial Statements must be prepared. [...] Whenever a company has a controlling financial {{interest in another entity}} it must consolidate the assets and liabilities of the other entity - that is, it must add the assets and liabilities of the other entity to its own, canceling any intercompany interests. The traditional ARB 51 approach assumed that equity - usually common stock - would receive the residual economic interest generated by a business, which is why ARB 51 focuses on equity-based majority voting interests. The traditional criterion for a controlling financial interest under ARB 51 is a majority voting interest. In the 1980s and 1990s it became common for companies to control assets in certain businesses without maintaining a majority voting interest in those businesses. This was more often done with securitizations rather than traditional limited liability corporations, because the securitization's common stock or other voting interests could be paid defined, limited amounts and all other cash flows could be directed to other securityholders. Until FIN 46 was implemented, this enabled companies to avoid consolidation, which permitted them to keep the liabilities and losses of their controlled special purpose entities off of their financial statements. In such cases, consolidation based on equity did not serve the purpose of effective reporting because it does not reflect the true nature of relationships among entities.|$|E
