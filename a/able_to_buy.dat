Since Thomas had never written a will, estate and {{property}} were divided between his children and his grandchildren. A friend to the Thomas family, Stephen St. John Gardiner, became the administrator of the estate. With the job, Gardiner was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the bridge. He became controller and majority of the bridge's stock.|$|E

5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June 1951. He {{said in his}} autobiography that there was greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some good players had been transferred before he arrived. But Shankly believed he still had good players {{to work with and}} was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> some additional players on the transfer market for low fees.|$|E

5|$|Birdsong first {{appeared}} with the Supremes in Ballard's {{place at a}} benefit concert at the Hollywood Bowl on April 29, 1967. Following the performance, Gordy quickly learned that Birdsong was still contractually committed to the Blue Belles when that group's lawyers filed an injunction against him. In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober. Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled {{step in the}} diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut and polished, US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 {{the club}} moved {{to their first}} private {{enclosed}} ground at Dinton Road, next to Kingston Barracks, moving again {{at the turn of}} the century to Lower Marsh Lane in 1902, specifically to part of the rugby ground in Richmond Road. The split in 1908–09 between Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C. and Old Kingstonians led to the breakaway group Old Kingstonians playing at Norbiton Sports Ground, Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C. remaining at Richmond Road. Reunited after World War I, the club continued to play at Richmond Road but, in 1920, the site's owners, the Dysarts, leased the site to Leyland Motors, then establishing a factory base at nearby Ham. The club managed to negotiate a ground-sharing arrangement and were eventually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the land, but the issue impacted their performance.|$|E

5|$|Seacole {{had joined}} the Roman Catholic Church circa 1860, and {{returned}} to a Jamaica changed in her absence as it faced economic downturn. She became a prominent figure in the country. However, by 1867 she was again running short of money, and the Seacole fund was resurrected in London, with new patrons including the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of Cambridge, and many other senior military officers. The fund burgeoned, and Seacole was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> land on Duke Street in Kingston, near New Blundell Hall, where she built a bungalow as her new home, plus a larger property to rent out.|$|E
5|$|The Duke's {{allowance}} was {{supplemented by}} government favours and illegal currency trading. The City of Paris provided the Duke with a house at 4 Route du Champ d'Entraînement, on the Neuilly-sur-Seine {{side of the}} Bois de Boulogne, for a nominal rent. The French government exempted him from paying income tax, and the couple were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> goods duty-free through the British embassy and the military commissary. In 1951, the Duke produced a ghost-written memoir, A King's Story, in which he expressed disagreement with liberal politics. The royalties from the book added to their income. Nine years later, he penned a relatively unknown book, A Family Album, chiefly about the fashion and habits {{of the royal family}} throughout his life, from the time of Queen Victoria to that of his grandfather and father, and his own tastes.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs and {{his wife}} lived in rented {{property}} for {{the first years of}} their marriage. His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of lower middle class according to McKinstry: although more prosperous than he had been during his childhood, the family were not initially financially comfortable. Hobbs' wages increased with his reputation so that by 1913, he was earning £375 each year, placing his family within the bracket of the London middle class. After several years of moving from one property to another, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> his own house in 1913, in Clapham Common, a prosperous area of London. By the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the players were famous. Hobbs was the biggest attraction and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around £780 each year), the income from his business, product endorsement—he {{was one of the first}} cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products—and ghostwritten books and articles made him relatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached £1,500 a year by 1925, more than a family doctor at the time. Consequently, in 1928 the family moved to a large house in private grounds and Hobbs was able to send his children to private schools. He had greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers, but was always first concerned to give his family the security lacking from his childhood.|$|E

5|$|Sir Walter Hungerford {{inherited}} Farleigh Hungerford castle {{upon the}} death of his mother, Joan, in 1412. Walter's first political patron was John of Gaunt's son, Henry IV, and later he became a close companion of Henry's own son, Henry V; Henry V made Walter, like his father before him, the Speaker of the Commons in 1414. Walter prospered: he became known as an expert jouster, in 1415 fought at the battle of Agincourt during the Hundred Years War, was made Steward of the Royal Household and was a major figure in government during the 1420s, serving as the Treasurer of England and as one of the legal guardians of the young Henry VI. Despite having to pay a ransom of £3,000 to the French after his son was captured in 1429, Walter, by now created Baron Hungerford, amassed considerable wealth from his various sources of income, which included the right to one hundred marks (£66) per year from the town of Marlborough, the wool taxes from Wells, and the ransoms gained from the taking of French prisoners. As a result, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> more land, acquiring around 110 new manors and estates {{over the course of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's {{career as}} both actor and theatre manager is {{important}} {{in the history of the}} British stage because he was one of the first in a long and illustrious line of actor-managers that would include such luminaries as Garrick, Henry Irving, and Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Rising from actor at Drury Lane to advisor to the manager Christopher Rich, Cibber worked himself by degrees into a position to take over the company, first taking many of its players—including Thomas Doggett, Robert Wilks, and Anne Oldfield—to form a new company at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket. The three actors squeezed out the previous owners in a series of lengthy and complex manoeuvres, but after Rich's letters patent were revoked, Cibber, Doggett and Wilks were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the company outright and return to the Theatre Royal by 1711. After a few stormy years of power-struggle between the prudent Doggett and the extravagant Wilks, Doggett was replaced by the upcoming actor Barton Booth and Cibber became in practice sole manager of Drury Lane. He set a pattern for the line of more charismatic and successful actors that were to succeed him in this combination of roles. His near-contemporary Garrick, as well as the 19th-century actor-managers Irving and Tree, would later structure their careers, writing, and manager identity around their own striking stage personalities. Cibber's forte as actor-manager was, by contrast, the manager side. He was a clever, innovative, and unscrupulous businessman who retained all his life a love of appearing on the stage. His triumph was that he rose to a position where, in consequence of his sole power over production and casting at Drury Lane, London audiences had to put up with him as an actor. Cibber's one significant mistake as a theatre manager was to pass over John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, which became an outstanding success for John Rich's theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields. When Cibber attempted to mimic Gay's success with his own ballad-opera—Love in a Riddle (1729)—it was shouted down by the audience and Cibber cancelled its run. He rescued its comic subplot as Damon and Phillida.|$|E

50|$|In August 1850 Herman Melville vacationed in the Berkshires, {{intending}} to stay {{only a short}} time. He was then thirty-one, and owed much of his literary fame {{to the success of}} his first book, Typee (1846). After getting to know Sarah Morewood during August, he abruptly decided to move his family to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, uprooting his young wife (Elizabeth Shaw Melville) from their home in Manhattan. In his haste to move, Melville “acted impulsively, and extravagantly, even recklessly,” observed biographer Hershel Parker. In September 1850 Mrs. Morewood and her husband bought a farm of 250 acres in Pittsfield, and in the same month Melville borrowed more money than he would ever be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> repay <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the farm adjoining hers--Arrowhead (Herman Melville House).|$|R
