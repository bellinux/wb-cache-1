5|$|David's third book {{differed}} from its predecessors {{in that it}} drew little from anything she had already written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the typescript. While she was away, the firm of her publisher, John Lehman, was closed down by its principal shareholder, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> herself under contract to the far less congenial company, Macdonald.|$|E
5|$|Riley renewed his {{relationship}} with Bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883. The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers' rendezvous. He stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable. Bottsworth, however, became convinced Riley was seeing another woman, and they terminated their relationship in January 1885. Riley's sister, Mary, had become {{a close friend of}} Bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her. Her reputation was tarnished by the affair <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> it difficult to find employment once their relationship ended.|$|E
5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable to {{conceive}} children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E

5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o'clock to fit in work and study, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the advice}} of Roosevelt's secretary, Malvina Thompson, Hickok then sought work in New York with public {{relations}} man and politician Grover Whalen. Shortly after Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, Hickok was hired by Whalen to do publicity for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Opportunities for female employees of the Fair were limited, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> the work unrewarding compared to her reporting days. Hickok primarily worked on promoting the fair to young people, including arranging class trips. Because Hickok rented both a country home and an apartment, she often faced financial problems despite her good salary during these years, and Roosevelt occasionally sent her small gifts of money.|$|E
5|$|Weston {{moved from}} Capitol to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content and very comfortable working with him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> herself in the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|E

5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Rachel's beloved mother, Ada Hobson, died in Summer 1993 (veteran actress Constance Ford {{had died}} earlier that year). Rachel needed support more than ever, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> {{it in the}} unlikeliest source, Mac's former enemy, {{reformed}} villain Carl Hutchins. The two fell in love and became engaged. Iris did not like this news one bit, and at Rachel and Carl's wedding, she planned to startle Carl by firing blanks at him. Evan (now played by Eric Scott Woods) placed real bullets into Iris's gun, causing Iris to gravely wound Carl. She was convicted of the crime and sent to prison.|$|E

25|$|After recuperating until 1802, {{she decided}} to re-enlist, rejoining the 9th Dragoons, now garrisoned in Paris, as a gentleman volunteer. The memoirs claim that she was accorded many of the {{privileges}} of an officer, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> herself an object of curiosity in fashionable society, culminating in a dinner invitation with Napoleon, now First Consul of the Republic. For ten days, she became an attendant to Josephine, but she {{found it hard to}} adapt to the informal idleness of the Château de Saint-Cloud, so she returned to her regiment in the Paris garrison until 1805, when Marshal Augereau recruited her as a uniformed aide-de-camp for his wife, who, like her, enjoyed both riding and shooting – a more conducive household than Saint-Cloud. The basic outline is confirmed by the appearance of her stipend at St-Cloud in Napoleon's accounts in 1804, and by the eyewitness memoirs of Marbot, which vouch for her role with Augereau, and summarize her previous biography up to her departure from Saint-Cloud. In 1805, she was also proposed (albeit unsuccessfully) for the Napoleonic army's gallantry medal, the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
25|$|Later, Sae {{leaves for}} New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked {{together}} in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him that this might be the last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in Iraq.|$|E

500|$|The executions had a {{powerful}} effect on the Russian intelligentsia, destroying the acmeist poetry group, and placing a stigma on Akhmatova and her son Lev (by Gumilev). Lev's later arrest during the purges and terrors of the 1930s was based on being his father's son. From a new Marxist perspective, Akhmatova's [...] poetry was deemed to represent an introspective [...] "bourgeois aesthetic", reflecting only trivial [...] "female" [...] preoccupations, not in keeping with these new revolutionary politics of the time. She was roundly attacked by the state, by former supporters and friends, and seen to be an anachronism. During what she termed [...] "The Vegetarian Years", Akhmatova's work was unofficially banned by a party resolution of 1925 <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> it hard to publish, though she didn't stop writing poetry. She made acclaimed translations of works by Victor Hugo, Rabindranath Tagore, Giacomo Leopardi and pursued academic work on Pushkin and Dostoyevsky. She worked as a critic and essayist, though many USSR and foreign critics and readers concluded she had died.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara's last film of 1947 {{was playing}} a Creole woman {{opposite}} Rex Harrison in John M. Stahl's The Foxes of Harrow, set in pre-Civil War New Orleans. TCM state that O'Hara had been [...] "angling" [...] to star in Forever Amber (1947), Fox's big [...] historical romance at the time, but believe that due to a contractual clause, neither of her joint contract owners, Fox and RKO, would accept her appearing in a [...] "major star vehicle" [...] at the time. During the production O'Hara and Harrison intensely disliked each other from the outset, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> him to be [...] "rude, vulgar, and arrogant". Harrison had thought that she disliked him simply because he was British. He reportedly belched in her face during dance sequences and accused her of anti-Semitism, being married to a Jewish woman (Lilli Palmer) at the time, which she vehemently denied. Variety, while acknowledging the length, thought that O'Hara and Harrison carried off their dramatic scenes with [...] "surprising skill". The following year, O'Hara starred opposite Robert Young in the commercially successful comedy film, Sitting Pretty. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised O'Hara and Young as husband and wife, remarking that they were [...] "delightfully clever", acting with [...] "elaborate indignation, alternating with good-natured despair".|$|E

The singer's management called Babyface {{to set up a}} meeting and see if they wanted to work together. Once met, both were surprised by their camaraderie and wanted to write songs. Madonna came over to Babyface's house and after a couple of days they came up with two songs. One of them was based on a piece of music composed by Babyface, but he was not sure about its musical direction. He made Madonna listen to the composition, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> a way to take the song forward. Babyface clarified that [...] "t was just a beat and the chords.
