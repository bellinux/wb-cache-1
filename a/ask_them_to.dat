5|$|Before his {{execution}} {{a convicted felon}} was usually detained in custody for three market days, on each {{of which he was}} publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods. After the sentence had been carried out a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and execution, for the official records.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood {{directors}} and writers, the Hollywood Ten, intending to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress. The ACLU supported the appeals {{of several of}} the artists, but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a blacklist which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged, prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress Jean Muir, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.|$|E

5|$|Ron's (Nick Offerman) ex-wife Tammy (Megan Mullally) {{continues}} {{her efforts}} to sabotage his life, but the normally susceptible Ron easily resists her seductions because {{he is now in}} a solid relationship with Tom's (Aziz Ansari) ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson), much to Tom's jealousy. Later, however, Wendy and Ron break up after she announces she is moving back to Canada. Meanwhile, Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the parks department throw a party for the Pawnee police department, where they hope to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> provide security for the upcoming Harvest Festival. During the party, Ben (Adam Scott) awkwardly fails to get Chief Trumple's (Eric Pierpoint) favor. Tom, unaware of Ron and Wendy's breakup, arrives at the party with Tammy to make him jealous. After bickering loudly, Ron and Tammy both decide to leave the party together to talk and try to make amends. However, a night filled with drunken sex and mayhem ensues, ending with the two getting remarried and ending up in jail.|$|E

When the Suebi invaded the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis, the Visigoths attacked and defeated them 5 October 456 at the Campus Paramus, twelve miles from Astorga, {{on the banks of}} the Órbigo (Urbicus), subsequently occupying the province as nominal foederati of the Empire.|$|E

25|$|In winter 952, Adelaide {{gave birth}} to a son, whom she named Henry after her {{brother-in-law}} and the child's grandfather, Henry the Fowler. Rumors spread that Otto had been persuaded by his wife and brother to propose this child as his heir instead of Liudolf. For many German nobles, this rumor represented Otto's final transformation from a policy focused on Germany to an Italian-centered one. The idea that Otto would <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> revoke the succession rights of Liudolf prompted many nobles into open rebellion. Liudolf and Conrad first led the nobles against Henry, the Duke of Bavaria, in spring 953. Henry was unpopular with the Bavarians due to his Saxon heritage, and his vassals quickly rebelled against him.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{through the}} French member, they would contact trusted {{individuals}} {{in the area of}} operation, and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> recruit a team of trusted subordinates (i.e., a subcell). If the mission was sabotage, reconnaissance or espionage, {{there was no need to}} meet in large units. If the team was to carry out direct action, often an unwise mission unless an appreciable number of the locals had military experience, it would be necessary to assemble into units for combat. Even then, the hideouts of the leadership were known only to subcell leaders. The legitimacy of the Jedburgh team came from its known affiliation with Allied powers, and it was a structure more appropriate for UW than for truly clandestine operations.|$|E

In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students {{at different levels of}} government. Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to North Korea on April 23.|$|E
25|$|He {{was hired}} by NBC News' Washington bureau the {{following}} year and became bureau chief by 1989. Russert assumed the job of host of the Sunday morning program Meet the Press in 1991, and would become the longest-serving host of the program. Its name was changed to Meet the Press with Tim Russert, and, at his suggestion, went to an hour-long format in 1992. The show also shifted to a greater focus on in-depth interviews with high-profile guests, where Russert was known especially for his extensive preparatory research and cross-examining style. One approach he developed was to find old quotes or video clips that were inconsistent with guests' more recent statements, present them on-air to his guests and then <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> clarify their positions. With Russert as host the show became increasingly popular, receiving more than four million viewers per week, and it was {{recognized as one of}} the most important sources of political news. Time magazine named Russert one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008, and Russert often moderated political campaign debates.|$|E
