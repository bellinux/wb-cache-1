5|$|And, {{at the end}} of the day, that's {{one thing}} we can't get past—serious BlackBerry enthusiasts will tell you that the {{interface}} is doing just fine, and there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> reasons to get hooked on these devices. For us, however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful hardware aside, this device is essentially exactly the same as every other BlackBerry.|$|E
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{opportunities}} in the county for hiking, observing wildlife and admiring the scenery. These include Brechfa Forest, the Pembrey Country Park, the Millennium Coastal Park at Llanelli, the WWT Llanelli Wetlands Centre and the Carmel National Nature Reserve. There are large stretches of golden sands and the Wales Coast Path now provides a continuous walking route around the whole of Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{writing was}} retraced by a later scribe (usually dated to the 10th or 11th century), {{and the beauty}} of the original script was spoiled. Accents and breathing marks, as well as punctuation, have been added by a later hand. There are no enlarged initials, no divisions into chapters or sections such as are found in later manuscripts, but a different system of division peculiar to this manuscript. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> the itacistic faults, especially the exchange of ει for ι and αι for ε. The exchange of ει and ο for ω is less frequent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{voluntary}} {{nature of}} the rural collectivization varied from region to region. According to Ralph Bates: [...] "While there <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> abuses, forced collectivization, etc., there <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> good collectives, i.e., voluntary ones." ...|$|R
60|$|Elsley did not shoot; but he {{had heard}} there <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> game there.|$|R
60|$|But there <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> gas. There <b>was</b> no {{discernible}} {{reason why the}} car should not go. She started the engine. It ran for half a minute and quit. All the plugs showed sparks. No wires were detached in the distributor. There <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> water, and the oil was not clogged. And that ended Claire's knowledge of {{the inside of a}} motor.|$|R
25|$|In {{the town}} there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> Victorian buildings.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> taxis in the city. Taxis {{are white}} cars {{and have a}} red plate. Fares are the same, {{regardless}} of how new and comfortable the car is.|$|E
25|$|Anna Politkovskaya {{described}} {{cases of}} prosecution and even murders of Muslims by Russia's law enforcement bodies at the North Caucasus. However, there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> Muslims in higher government, Duma, and business.|$|E

25|$|Not all beer in {{mainland}} Europe is pasteurised; there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> examples of unfiltered, unpasteurised beers, but these will commonly be served from a chilled container under pressure: a keg.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{food items}} that this dolphin feeds upon. They include fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. During {{foraging}} periods, herds of about 7 dolphins will circle around prey and trap their victim. These prey entrapments occur slightly below the water surface level.|$|E
25|$|Not {{far away}} from the urban center, close to the city itself, and fully set in the {{municipality}} of Coimbra, there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> mountain and river landscapes. These include the river beach of Palheiros do Zorro in the parish of Torres do Mondego.|$|E
50|$|Sirakola (Koulikoro Cercle) {{has a large}} {{market on}} Thursdays, on which days there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> public transportation.|$|R

25|$|The park {{boasts a}} variety of habitats, {{including}} both deciduous and coniferous woodlands, grassland and ponds. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> walks throughout the wooded areas of the park, an outdoor exercise area and a children's playground. There is a network of bridleways which cyclists and horseriders are welcome to use.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> maceiós {{and lakes}} {{in this part}} of Brazil; because of this, the city was named Maceió, and the State, Alagoas. The new Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport connects Maceió with many Brazilian cities and also {{operates}} some international flights. The city is home to the Federal University of Alagoas.|$|E
25|$|I {{think that}} Gould's {{separate}} compartments was a purely political ploy to win middle-of-the-road religious {{people to the}} science camp. But it's a very empty idea. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> places where religion does not keep off the scientific turf. Any belief in miracles is flat contradictory {{not just to the}} facts of science but to the spirit of science.|$|E

25|$|Health {{officials}} say there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> problems in China's approach to AIDS. There are frequent reports of police crack-downs on local NGOs involved in AIDS prevention. There have also been reports of police using {{the presence of a}} condom in a sex worker's handbag to justify detention. This has been partially blamed on policy incoordination, and contradictions and conflicts between laws and regulations.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that they were most likely facing two perpetrators, who had meticulously planned the murders in advance, due to the difficulties a single perpetrator would face in controlling both girls. As he attacked one, the other would {{have an opportunity to}} escape. In Baneheia, people are always close by, and there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> hiding places among the pine thickets and rocks. The odds were good that a lone assailant would fail.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{there are}} {{a high level of}} Japanese imports used within the {{drifting}} scene, {{due in part to the}} UK sharing a right-hand drive layout with Japan. However, these cars often cost more than UK-market cars, partly due to import costs. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> UK and European models used as drift cars as well, older BMW's are particularly prominent due to cost and availability, with Volvo 300 series and Ford Sierras also proving popular.|$|E
50|$|Watermelon Day (งานวันแตงโม) is {{organized}} every year. There <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> watermelon on offer and a food and beauty contest.|$|R

25|$|The {{league is}} {{continually}} {{on the lookout}} for college-quality baseball fields for each team to permanently call home. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> fields that can host a weekend here or there, but very few have enough summer schedule flexibility to accommodate a 37-game season. Most college facilities have summer camps or youth tournaments that would conflict with LCBL games. One potential solution is {{the creation of a new}} baseball-only four-field complex in St. Louis, though no plans are currently in the works.|$|E
25|$|As you play, you'll {{discover}} {{a treasure trove}} of features in Pirates of the Caribbean Multiplayer. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> Power-Ups to save your hide, or drive the final nail in your enemy's coffin. There are Boons to earn, which grant you magical powers. You can form Guilds and challenge other Guilds for domination of the harbors, bays and islands of the Caribbean. And to keep things interesting, the world of play is ever changing, as more areas to explore are unlocked and new treasures are discovered.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope is that such large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E

"Oh, yes, now I have begun, I shall {{go through}} with it, {{though it is not}} so {{pleasant}} as it was a month ago, for the nights are getting cold; still there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> excitement about it, and we manage to keep the Prussians awake as well as ourselves. Whatever it may be with the National Guard there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> pluck among the students. I could not wish to have better comrades." ...|$|R
