5|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} clinical {{consequences of the}} presence of an <b>axillary</b> arch including confusing the identification and palpation of enlarged or tumorous lymph nodes, the trapping of <b>axillary</b> structures including the <b>axillary</b> nerve and the <b>axillary</b> vein and causing potential problems in <b>axillary</b> surgery or breast reconstruction. There have also been reported instances of the <b>axillary</b> arch being involved in the development of deep vein thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>axillary</b> {{sclerite}} (lAx) is {{the anterior}} hinge plate {{of the wing}} base. Its anterior part is supported on the anterior notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the tergal margin. The anterior end of the sclerite is generally produced as a slender arm, the apex of which (e) is always associated with {{the base of the}} subcostal vein (Sc), though it is not united with the latter. The body of the sclerite articulates laterally with the second <b>axillary.</b> The second <b>axillary</b> sclerite (2Ax) is more variable in form than the first <b>axillary,</b> but its mechanical relations are no less definite. It is obliquely hinged to the outer margin of the body of the first <b>axillary,</b> and the radial vein (R) is always flexibly attached to its anterior end (d). The second <b>axillary</b> presents both a dorsal and a ventral sclerotization in the wing base; its ventral surface rests upon the fulcral wing process of the pleuron. The second <b>axillary,</b> therefore, is the pivotal sclerite of the wing base, and it specifically manipulates the radial vein.|$|E
5|$|The third <b>axillary</b> {{sclerite}} (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third <b>axillary</b> is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} <b>axillary,</b> and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth <b>axillary</b> when the latter is present. Distally the third <b>axillary</b> is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third <b>axillary,</b> therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third <b>axillary</b> on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth <b>Axillary</b> sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third <b>axillary</b> and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
5|$|The <b>axillary</b> {{region is}} region {{containing}} the <b>axillary</b> sclerites has {{in general the}} form of a scalene triangle. The base of the triangle (a-b) is the hinge of the wing with the body; the apex (c) is the distal end of the third <b>axillary</b> sclerite; the longer side is anterior to the apex. The point d on the anterior side of the triangle marks the articulation of the radial vein with the second <b>axillary</b> sclerite. The line between d and c is the plica basalis (bf), or fold of the wing {{at the base of the}} mediocubital field.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{the lateral}} pectoral nerve innervates the <b>axillary</b> arch, although instances {{have been found}} where the intercostobrachial nerve, the medial pectoral nerve and the thoracodorsal nerve provide the nervous supply.|$|E
5|$|The arch is {{considered}} to have no functional significance, although this is challenged by some authors. It {{plays a role in}} entrapment of nearby structures and may alter local anatomy in the event that a dissection of the local area is needed during surgery. The arch appears to arise from the panniculus carnosus, a structure found in most non-primate mammals, and has similarities with muscles found in many animals. The <b>axillary</b> arch has several other names including Langer's <b>axillary</b> arch, the muscle of Langer, axillopectoral muscle, Achselbogen and pectorodorsalis muscle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>axillary</b> arch may insert {{into the}} tendon of the pectoralis major muscle, the fascia of the coracobrachialis muscle, or the fascia {{covering}} the biceps brachii muscle. Insertion into the pectoralis major muscle proper, the long {{head of the}} biceps brachii muscle, the coracoid process, the pectoralis minor muscle, the <b>axillary</b> fascia and to the bone at {{the crest of the}} greater tubercle of the humerus inserting distal to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle have all been reported.|$|E
5|$|Most {{veins and}} crossveins {{occur in the}} {{anterior}} area of the remigium, {{which is responsible for}} most of the flight, powered by the thoracic muscles. The posterior portion of the remigium is sometimes called the clavus; the two other posterior fields are the anal and jugal ares. When the vannal fold has the usual position anterior to the group of anal veins, the remigium contains the costal, subcostal, radial, medial, cubital, and postcubital veins. In the flexed wing the remigiumturns posteriorly on the flexible basal connection of the radius with the second <b>axillary,</b> and the base of the mediocubital field is folded medially on the <b>axillary</b> region along the plica basalis (bf) between the median plates (m, m') of the wing base.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalence}} of the <b>axillary</b> arch in the European population is around 7%, but this varies considerably among different genetic groups; {{lower in the}} Turkish population and more prevalant in the Chinese population.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} started in 1918 and was {{finished}} in 1921. The station, excluding its water tower and restaurant, cost 117,062 Norwegian krone (NOK) to build and took 26,883 man-hours. The station and <b>axillary</b> buildings were designed by Gudmund Hoel of NSB Arkitektkontor. The station opened with {{the first part of}} the Rauma Line on 19 November 1921. It remained the terminus until 25 November 1923, when the next section, to Verma Station, opened.|$|E
5|$|The <b>axillary</b> arch is {{considered}} to have no functional significance, although one small study of 22 participants has reported an increase in strength, endurance and motor control of the arm in women (but not men) with the arch as compared with those without; and an improvement in shoulder proprioception in both men and women.|$|E
5|$|The costa (C) is {{the leading}} {{marginal}} vein on most insects, although sometimes {{there is a small}} vein above the costa called the precosta, although in almost all extant insects, the precosta is fused with the costa; The costa rarely ever branches because it is at the leading edge, which is associated at its base with the humeral plate. The trachea of the costal vein is perhaps a branch of the subcostal trachea. Located after the costa is the third vein, the subcosta, which branches into two separate veins: the anterior and posterior. The base of the subcosta is associated with the distal end of the neck of the first <b>axillary</b> (see section below). The fourth vein is the radius (R), which is branched into five separate veins. The radius is generally the strongest vein of the wing. Toward the middle of the wing, it forks into a first undivided branch (R1) and a second branch, called the radial sector (Ra), which subdivides dichotomously into four distal branches (R2, R3, R4, R5). Basally, the radius is flexibly united with the anterior end of the second <b>axillary</b> (2Ax).|$|E
5|$|The humeral {{plate is}} usually a small {{sclerite}} on the anterior margin of the wing base, movable and articulated with {{the base of the}} costal vein. Odonata have their humeral plate greatly enlarged, with two muscles arising from the episternum inserted into the Humeral plates and two {{from the edge of the}} epimeron inserted into the <b>axillary</b> plate.|$|E
5|$|The panniculus carnosus is a {{layer of}} {{striated}} muscle deep to the panniculus adiposus. Although absent in hominoids, the panniculus carnosus is common in non-hominoid primates and non-primate mammals. In lower mammals {{the area of the}} panniculus carnosus can be extensive, almost covering the entire body {{in the case of the}} short-beaked echidna. Several human muscles are considered discrete muscles originating from the panniculus carnosus, and some researchers classify the <b>axillary</b> arch as a sporadic vestigial muscle of this type.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of <b>axillary</b> and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
5|$|Equestrians {{by birth}} would {{normally}} begin their military careers at c. 30 years of age. An <b>axillary</b> {{had to do}} 25 years of service before joining the army. Commands were held in a set sequence, each held for 3–4 years: prefect of an auxiliary cohors, tribunus militum in a legion and finally prefect of an auxiliary ala. In Hadrian's time, a fourth command was added, for exceptionally able officers, of prefect of an ala milliaria. Like officers senatorial rank, hereditary equestrians held civilian posts before and after their decade of military service, whereas non-hereditary officers tended {{to remain in the}} army, commanding various units in various provinces. By the 3rd century, most auxiliary prefects had exclusively military careers.|$|E
5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on {{the tips of}} new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from <b>axillary</b> buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.|$|E
5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and <b>axillary</b> arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E
5|$|When at rest, {{the wings}} are held {{over the back}} in most insects, which may involve {{longitudinal}} folding of the wing membrane and sometimes also transverse folding. Folding may sometimes occur along the flexion lines. Though fold lines may be transverse, as in the hindwings of beetles and earwigs, they are normally radial {{to the base of}} the wing, allowing adjacent sections of a wing to be folded over or under each other. The commonest fold line is the jugal fold, situated just behind the third anal vein, although, most Neoptera have a jugal fold just behind vein 3A on the forewings. It is sometimes also present on the hindwings. Where the anal area of the hindwing is large, as in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the whole of this part may be folded under the anterior part of the wing along a vannal fold a little posterior to the claval furrow. In addition, in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the anal area is folded like a fan along the veins, the anal veins being convex, at the crests of the folds, and the accessory veins concave. Whereas the claval furrow and jugal fold are probably homologous in different species, the vannal fold varies in position in different taxa. Folding is produced by a muscle arising on the pleuron and inserted into the third <b>axillary</b> sclerite in such a way that, when it contracts, the sclerite pivots about its points of articulation with the posterior notal process and the second <b>axillary</b> sclerite.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third <b>axillary</b> {{sclerite}} rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E
5|$|At the {{posterior}} {{angle of the}} wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from the wing base behind the third <b>axillary</b> sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of the wing membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E
5|$|During the pupal stage, the {{morphology}} of {{the adult}} is developed through elaboration from larval structures. The general aspect {{of the adult}} is visible before the outer surface hardens – the head, resting on the thorax, the eyes, antennae (brought forward over the head), the wings brought over the thorax and the six legs between the wings and the abdomen. Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye-pieces, antennae, palpi and the maxillae. The pupal thorax displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows and <b>axillary</b> tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.|$|E
5|$|The median plates (m, m') {{are also}} sclerites {{that are not}} so {{definitely}} differentiated as specific plates as are the three principal axillaries, but nevertheless they are important elements of the flexor apparatus. They lie in the median area of the wing base distal to {{the second and third}} axillaries and are separated from each other by an oblique line (bf) which forms a prominent convex fold during flexion of the wing. The proximal plate (m) is usually attached to the distal arm of the third <b>axillary</b> and perhaps should be regarded {{as a part of the}} latter. The distal plate (m') is less constantly present as a distinct sclerite and may be represented by a general sclerotization of the base of the mediocubital field of the wing. When the veins of this region are distinct at their bases, they are associated with the outer median plate.|$|E
5|$|The vannus is {{bordered by}} the vannal fold, which {{typically}} occurs between the postcubitus {{and the first}} vannal vein. In Orthoptera it usually has this position. In the forewing of Blattidae, however, the only fold {{in this part of}} the wing lies immediately before the postcubitus. In Plecoptera the vannal fold is posterior to the postcubitus, but proximally it crosses the base of the first vannal vein. In the cicada the vannal fold lies immediately behind the first vannal vein (lV). These small variations in the actual position of the vannal fold, however, do not affect the unity of action of the vannal veins, controlled by the flexor sclerite (3Ax), in the flexion of the wing. In the hindwings of most Orthoptera a secondary vena dividens forms a rib in the vannal fold. The vannus is usually triangular in shape, and its veins typically spread out from the third <b>axillary</b> like the ribs of a fan. Some of the vannal veins may be branched, and secondary veins may alternate with the primary veins. The vannal region is usually best developed in the hindwing, in which it may be enlarged to form a sustaining surface, as in Plecoptera and Orthoptera. The great fanlike expansions of the hindwings of Acrididae are clearly the vannal regions, since their veins are all supported on the third <b>axillary</b> sclerites on the wing bases, though Martynov (1925) ascribes most of the fan areas in Acrididae to the jugal regions of the wings. The true jugum of the acridid wing is represented only by the small membrane (Ju) mesad of the last vannal vein. The jugum is more highly developed in some other Polyneoptera, as in the Mantidae. In most of the higher insects with narrow wings the vannus becomes reduced, and the vannal fold is lost, but even in such cases the flexed wing may bend along a line between the postcubitus and the first vannal vein.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short <b>axillary</b> racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
5|$|Postcubitus (Pcu) is {{the first}} anal of the Comstock–Needham system. The postcubitus, however, has the status of an {{independent}} wing vein and should be recognized as such. In nymphal wings, its trachea arises between the cubital trachea and the group of vannal tracheae. In the mature wings of more generalized insect the Postcubitus is always associated proximally with the cubitus and is never intimately connected with the flexor sclerite (3Ax) of the wing base. In Neuroptera, Mecoptera, and Trichoptera the postcubitus may be more {{closely associated with the}} vannal veins, but its base is always free from the latter. The postcubitus is usually unbranched; it is primitively two branched. The vannal veins (lV to nV) are the anal veins that are immediately associated with the third <b>axillary,</b> and which are directly affected by the movement of this sclerite that brings about the flexion of the wings. In number the vannal veins vary. from 1 to 12, according to the expansion of the vannal area of the wing. The vannal tracheae usually arise from a common tracheal stem in nymphal insects, and the veins are regarded as branches of a single anal vein. Distally the vannal veins are either simple or branched. Jugal Veins (J) of the jugal lobe of the wing is often occupied by a network of irregular veins, or it may be entirely membranous; but sometimes it contains one or two distinct small veins, the first jugal vein, or vena arcuata, and the second jugal vein, or vena cardinalis (2J).|$|E
25|$|The third <b>axillary</b> {{sclerite}} (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third <b>axillary</b> is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally, it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} <b>axillary,</b> and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth <b>axillary</b> when the latter is present. Distally, the third <b>axillary</b> is prolonged in a process always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing, here termed the vannal veins (V).

The fourth <b>axillary</b> sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present, it is usually a small plate intervening between the third <b>axillary</b> and the posterior notal wing process, and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>axillary</b> {{sclerite}} (lAx) is {{the anterior}} hinge plate {{of the wing}} base. Its anterior part is supported on the anterior notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the tergal margin.

25|$|The <b>axillary</b> {{block is}} {{particularly}} useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The <b>axillary</b> block {{is also the}} safest of the four main approaches to the brachial plexus, as it does not risk paresis of the phrenic nerve, nor does it {{have the potential to}} cause pneumothorax. In the axilla, the nerves of the brachial plexus and the <b>axillary</b> artery are enclosed together in a fibrous sheath which is a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. The easily palpated <b>axillary</b> artery thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic close to this artery frequently leads to a good block of the brachial plexus. The <b>axillary</b> block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 75% of {{the lymph}} from the breast {{travels to the}} <b>axillary</b> lymph nodes {{on the same side}} of the body, whilst 25% of the lymph travels to the parasternal nodes (beside the sternum bone). A small amount of {{remaining}} lymph travels to the other breast and to the abdominal lymph nodes. The <b>axillary</b> lymph nodes include the pectoral (chest), subscapular (under the scapula), and humeral (humerus-bone area) lymph-node groups, which drain to the central <b>axillary</b> lymph nodes and to the apical <b>axillary</b> lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to oncology because breast cancer is common to the mammary gland, and cancer cells can metastasize (break away) from a tumour and be dispersed to other parts of the body by means of the lymphatic system.|$|E
25|$|The {{auxiliary}} region {{containing the}} <b>axillary</b> sclerites has, in general, {{the form of}} a scalene triangle. The base of the triangle (a-b) is the hinge of the wing with the body; the apex (c) is the distal end of the third <b>axillary</b> sclerite; the longer side is anterior to the apex. The point d on the anterior side of the triangle marks the articulation of the radial vein with the second <b>axillary</b> sclerite. The line between d and c is the plica basalis (bf), or fold of the wing {{at the base of the}} mediocubital field.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the {{standard}} {{projections of the}} shoulder are AP and Lateral Scapula or <b>Axillary</b> Projection.|$|E
25|$|An {{extended}} abdominoplasty is {{a complete}} abdominoplasty plus a lateral thigh lift. The resulting scar runs from the posterior <b>axillary</b> line (when placing your open hands on your hips, the thumbs lie along the posterior <b>axillary</b> line.) The operation does all of the abdominal contouring of a complete abdominoplasty and allows further improvement of the flank (waist), as well as smoothing the contour of the upper lateral thigh.|$|E
25|$|For <b>axillary</b> block, {{success rates}} are greatly {{improved}} with multiple injection techniques whether using nerve stimulation or ultrasound guidance.|$|E
25|$|Auxin induces shoot apical dominance; the <b>axillary</b> buds are {{inhibited}} by auxin, as a {{high concentration}} of auxin directly stimulates ethylene synthesis in <b>axillary</b> buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.|$|E
25|$|DHEA {{and other}} adrenal androgens such as androstenedione, {{although}} relatively weak androgens, {{are responsible for}} the androgenic effects of adrenarche, such as early pubic and <b>axillary</b> hair growth, adult-type body odor, increased oiliness of hair and skin, and mild acne. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a non-functional androgen receptor (AR) and are immune to the androgenic effects of DHEA and other androgens, have absent or only sparse/scanty pubic and <b>axillary</b> hair and body hair in general, demonstrating the role of DHEA, testosterone, and other androgens in body hair development at both adrenarche and pubarche.|$|E
