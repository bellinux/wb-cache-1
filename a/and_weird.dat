5|$|Born in New York City, {{he spent}} much of his early {{childhood}} in Bogotá, Colombia before moving back to the United States at the age of 12. In his youth, Williamson developed an interest in comic strips, particularly Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon. He took art classes at Burne Hogarth's Cartoonists and Illustrators School, there befriending future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel, who introduced him to the work of illustrators who had influenced adventure strips. Before long, he was working professionally in the comics industry. His most notable works include his science-fiction/heroic fantasy art for EC Comics in the 1950s, on titles including Weird Science <b>and</b> <b>Weird</b> Fantasy.|$|E

25|$|Particularly revered among Ballard's admirers is {{his short}} story {{collection}} Vermilion Sands (1971), set in an eponymous desert resort town inhabited by forgotten starlets, insane heirs, very eccentric artists, and the merchants and bizarre servants who provide for them. Each story features peculiarly exotic technology such as cloud-carving sculptors performing {{for a party}} of eccentric onlookers, poetry-composing computers, orchids with operatic voices and egos to match, phototropic self-painting canvases, etc. In keeping with Ballard's central themes, most notably technologically mediated masochism, these tawdry <b>and</b> <b>weird</b> technologies service the dark and hidden desires and schemes of the human castaways who occupy Vermilion Sands, typically with psychologically grotesque and physically fatal results. In his introduction to Vermilion Sands, Ballard cites this as his favourite collection.|$|E

500|$|McIlwraith was an {{experienced}} magazine editor, {{but she knew}} little about weird fiction, and unlike Wright she also had to face real competition from other magazines for Weird Tales core readership. [...] Although Unknown folded in 1943, in its four years of existence it transformed the field of fantasy and horror, <b>and</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales was no longer regarded as the leader in its field. [...] Unknown published many successful humorous fantasy stories, and McIlwraith responded by including some humorous material, but Weird Tales rates were less than Unknown, with predictable effects on quality. [...] In 1940 the policy of reprinting horror <b>and</b> <b>weird</b> classics ceased, <b>and</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales began using the slogan [...] "All Stories New – No Reprints". [...] Weinberg suggests {{that this was a}} mistake, as Weird Tales readership appreciated getting access to classic stories [...] "often mentioned but rarely found". [...] Without the reprints Weird Tales was left to survive on the rejects from Unknown, with the same authors selling to both markets. [...] In Weinberg's words, [...] "only the quality of the stories [...] their work between the two pulps".|$|E
