50|$|On {{the demand}} side, the main {{customer}} base for fine chemicals, the pharmaceutical industry, {{is faced with}} slower growth of demand, patent expirations of many lucrative blockbuster drugs and stalling new product launches. In order to restrain these challenges, the leading companies are implementing restructuring programs. They comprise a reduction of in-house chemical manufacturing and plant eliminations. Outsourcing is moving up from a purely opportunistic to a strategic approach. It is difficult to make a judgment, whether {{the positive or negative}} effects of these initiatives will prevail. In a worst-case scenario, a condition could develop, whereby even top-tier mid-sized, family-owned fine-chemical companies with state-of-the-art plants and processes could be relegated to producing small quantities of fine chemicals for new life-science products in late stage of development. In agro fine chemicals, the active ingredients become more sophisticated and performing. Therefore, they require multipurpose instead of dedicated plants prevailing in the industry so far. At the same token, outsourcing is gaining ground. Globalization results in a shift of fine chemical production from the industrialized to developing countries. The latter benefit not only from a “low cost / high skill” advantage, but also from a rapidly rising domestic demand for Western medicine. Despite the mantras of Western industry leaders, the cost advantage of the Asian producers is going to persist. As the pharmemerging countries mainly use generics, their market share continues to grow to the detriment of originator pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. This is also the case for biosimilars, the generic versions of biopharmaceuticals. As a consequence of the harsh business climate, many Western fine chemical companies or divisions created during the “irrational exuberance” {{at the end of the}} 20th century already have exited from the sector. Others will follow suit or will be acquired by private equity firms. Survival strategies include implementation of lean production principles originally developed by the automotive industry and extending the business model to include also contract research at the beginning and active drug formulation towards the end of the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>chain.</b> This latter strategy, however, is not finding unanimous approval by industry experts.|$|E

The infrastructural {{aspects of}} {{integrated}} interaction and factors impacting on the efficiency increase of regional participation  {{in the creation}} of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> on the example of cooperation  between developed and developing countries during the  implementation of joint production projects are considered. Methods. A factor analysis of the degree of various countries’ involvement into global <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> is carried out,  taking into account their geographical location, natural resources and openness of markets, as well as the infrastructure, professional knowledge of the workforce, practice of cooperation of  domestic firms with foreign partners and the attractiveness of their investment climate. Results. An evaluation of the integrated potential of individual countries, which could undertake the functions of  integrators and mediators within the implementation of regional  programmes of social and economic development, is presented. The  growth potential is estimated and the role of global creation chains  of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> (AVC) revealed as a tool for increasing the  competitiveness of national trade policies.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the notion that}} the term “Industrialisation” within the banking system is not clearly understood, nor its impact on the whole <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chain.</b> The goal is to establish a clear definition of the term “Industrialisation” in an international context and study the manifestation and impact of Industrialisation across the length of the banking <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chain.</b> Four indicators of Industrialisation (standardisation, automation, specialisation, quality management) were identified through a systematic literature review. The work focuses on one of the ‘three pillars’ of the German banking system: the East German Savings Banks Group. The research uses a homogenous multi method approach utilizing statistical financial information, existing documentary evidence and questionnaires. The data (quantitative and qualitative) was derived from files held by the national association on the 48 savings banks, and from 36 quantitative questionnaires returned by respondent banks. The 36 complete data sets were systematically combined using a comprehensive regression approach. The data was used to test three over-arching hypotheses, each relating to connections between the (generally understood) four stages of the value-added chain, activities related to each stage and indicators of banking success. The research clearly identified that: 1) Industrialisation dominates the savings banks <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chain.</b> 2) Industrialisation augments financial outcomes and ‘perceived success’ in product development, marketing, settlement and transactions. 3) Outsourcing functions are negatively correlated to banking success in these <b>value</b> <b>added</b> stages. 4) Success in risk management was shown to be contingent on settlement and transactions, but no other activities. Automated services, such as self-service terminals and internet banking, are successful in the areas of settlements, transactions, marketing and customer relations. Increasing automation and standardisation can increase the perceived and quantitative measured success within the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chain.</b> Conclusions & Implications: The developed model extends knowledge in the area of banking and Industrialisation, showing increasing interaction between stages along the value-added chain. The closer the stages, the stronger the effects. The model provides a guide for managerial attention in <b>adding</b> <b>value</b> through Industrialisation techniques in the industry. The management implications of the study are that the savings banks should focus on their core competencies in providing a holistic in-house service in routine transactions, as well as supporting exceptional financing and investment tasks for their clients. To enhance the efficiency of Industrialisation across the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chain,</b> savings banks should find standards and routines contributing to Industrialisation success in risk management, and seek to comprehensively link the function of risk management to the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chain</b> stages...|$|R

The core topic of the essay will be related to the different objectives, blocks and ways of internationalization, which the companies should take into consideration, when they are handling to jump up to split their value added chain to other locations. After analyze some markets, specially Low Cost Countries, not always internationalization is a cost advantage question, if not internationalization should be analyzed from a strategic approach where factors such as quality, service of the supply chain and their inherent consequences, should be deeply studied. Up to now, most companies which start an internationalization process, priorize cost issues to other ones, at least so important (in some cases, even more), as quality, service or technology. In addition, we will describe some strategic and operative tools which can be used to decide if internationalization makes sense or not, considering three different approaches such as advanced BCG Matrix, Porter´s Diamond or Total Cost of Ownership During last years, since current economic crisis started, labor costs in main LCC with China as main player, increased a lot, making necessary to re analyze the decision matrix concerning to split the production process in other countries or even the whole <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>chain.</b> New opportunities are coming up nowadays in new markets, giving to some challenging companies the opportunity to increase their competitiveness.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} comprehensive framework for conceptual, methodological and instrumental contribution to urban intervention planning {{and public policy}} design. For a Latin American case study, a prospective multi-methodology modeling platform was developed to support the novel proposed approaches for intervention assessment, {{as well as to}} establish a knowledge building dynamic for planners using multidisciplinary discussion and, most importantly, paradigm confrontation and change. Paradigm analysis of both planning and modeling fields drives the strategy to establish a scientific bond between underlying analytical approaches and planning agents’ visions. The analysis thereby offers a greater understanding of the urban problem and an inclusive definition of the city´s selected path for urban development, focused on the complex exchange of formal approaches, real practice issues, and agents’ professional and methodological biases. The compared paradigm analysis allows insertion of the modeling paradigm discussion – traditionally reserved to the theoretical arena - into a wider philosophical framework for urban planning, intended to facilitate the multiple urban analysts’ paradigm confrontation and to establish a strategy based on multi-paradigm thinking capable of uncertainty and complexity comprehension in practice. This analysis drives the planning modeling tools development and the communication and appropriation proposals. For the case study Medellín Metropolitan Area (Colombia), considering that planning is a non-neutral value discipline, City Object/City Subject are presented as the main paradigms for urban planning practice and their methodological approaches are contrasted with Normative/Descriptive modeling paradigms. A stronger bias on physic-spatial focused planning related to the City Object proposed paradigm was identified and formalized. A multi-paradigm modeling platform was then built to bridge the City Object + City Subject multi-paradigm, which is capable of combined territorial and social actor dynamic envisioned through the Normative + Descriptive OR multi-methodology. This development enhances the descriptive and explicative power of the urban intervention evolution analysis, exploring urban occupation as both a driver and driven dynamic of the social actors’ transactions and as a strategic link to assess the demand cycles for planning. The demand is redefined as a dynamic variable in time and space instead of as an input. The developed multi-paradigm multi-methodology platform offers contributions to different levels of urban planning modeling and assessment, related to the general chain of analysis as well as to each implemented methodology. It especially redefines the modeling exercise as an active part of the planning exercise, configuring an information <b>added</b> <b>value</b> <b>chain</b> (source, base and results) that feeds the knowledge building process and highlights new analysis lines and niches. As a result, analysts are compelled to exchange, discuss and confront their position on the building impacts of Urban Futures. For the case study, the platform offers prospective information on density; socioeconomic composition, urban service qualification (distribution, accessibility, connectivity) and externality estimation (congestion), among many other indicators linked to versatile information systems (geographical and relational). It has been supported by several of the local and regional planning agencies and progressively integrated into their planning exercises. The research offers an analysis framework that acknowledges the urban planning exercise’s impact on the evolution of spatial and social exclusion patterns. This framework aims for innovation in the planning field in order to build the basis of a truly comprehensive planning strategy that tackles the most urgent problems of our current and future urbanization processes...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{prepared}} by Marion Panizzon and Charlotte Sieber-Gasser for the International Conference on the Political Economy of Liberalising Trade in Services, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 14 - 15 June 2010 Recent literature has {{shed light on}} the economic potential of cross-border networks. These networks, consisting of expatriates and their acquaintances from abroad and at home, provide the basis for the creation of cross-border <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chains</b> and therewith the means for turning brain drain into brain circulation. Both aspects are potentially valuable for economic growth in the developing world. Unilateral co-development policies operating through co-funding of expatriate business ventures, but also bilateral agreements liberalising circular migration for a limited set of per-sons testify to the increasing awareness of governments about the potential, which expatriate networks hold for economic growth in developing countries. Whereas such punctual efforts are valuable, viewed from a long term perspective, these top-down, government mandated Diaspora stimulation programs, will not replace, this paper argues, the market-driven liberalisation of infrastructure and other services in developing countries. Nor will they carry, in the case of circular labour migration, the political momentum to liberalise labour market admission for those non-nationals, who will eventually emerge as the future transnational entrepreneurs. It will take a combination of mode 4 and infrastructure services openings-cum regulation for countries at both sides of the spectrum to provide the basis and precondition for transnational business and entrepreneurial networks to emerge and translate into cross-border, <b>value</b> <b>added</b> production <b>chains.</b> Two key issues are of particular relevance in this context: (i) the services sector, especially in infrastructure, tends to suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in developing countries, and (ii) labour migration, a highly complex issue, still faces disproportionately rigid barriers despite well-documented global welfare gains. Both are hindrances for emerging markets to fully take advantage of the potential of these cross-border networks. Adapting the legal framework for enhancing the regulatory and institutional frameworks for services trade, especially in infrastructure services sectors (ISS) and labour migration could provide the incentives necessary for brain circulation and strengthen cross-border <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chains</b> by lowering transaction costs. This paper analyses the shortfalls of the global legal framework – the shallow status quo of GATS commitments in ISS and mode 4 particular – in relation to stimulating brain circulation and the creation of cross-border <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chains</b> in emerging markets. It highlights the necessity of adapting the legal framework, both on the global and the regional level, to stimulate broader and wider market access in the four key ISS sectors (telecommunications, transport, professional and financial services) in developing countries, as domestic supply capacity, global competitiveness and economic diversification in ISS sectors are necessary for mobilising expatriate re-turns, both physical and virtual. The paper argues that industrialised, labour receiving countries need to offer mode 4 market access to wider categories of persons, especially to students, graduate trainees and young professionals from abroad. Further-more, free trade in semi-finished products and mode 4 market access are crucial for the creation of cross-border <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>chains</b> across the developing world.
