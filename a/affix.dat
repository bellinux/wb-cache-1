5|$|Ōtsuki Fumihiko in Daigenkai (1932–1935) {{proposes that}} the word comes from kitsu, which is onomatopoeia for the bark of a fox, and ne, which may be an <b>affix</b> or an honorific word meaning a servant of an Inari shrine.|$|E
5|$|Darby denied {{involvement}} with the murder, claiming that New Court partisans such as Francis P. Blair and Amos Kendall were seeking to defame him. He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the New Court Argus was written by New Court supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor. The claims and counterclaims {{between the two sides}} reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the New Court Argus suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old Court partisans and <b>affix</b> a stigma to them.|$|E
5|$|Laces, straps, or rivets {{were used}} to <b>affix</b> the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} types of <b>affixes,</b> namely prefixes (awalan), suffixes (akhiran), circumfixes (apitan) and infixes (sisipan). These <b>affixes</b> are {{categorised}} into noun <b>affixes,</b> verb <b>affixes,</b> and adjective <b>affixes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lexical <b>affixes</b> (or {{semantic}} <b>affixes)</b> {{are bound}} elements that appear as <b>affixes,</b> but function as incorporated nouns within verbs and as elements of nouns. In other words, they {{are similar to}} word roots/stems in function but similar to <b>affixes</b> in form. Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical <b>affixes</b> differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as <b>affixes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography {{focused upon}} morphology: the same derivational <b>affix</b> would {{be written in}} the same way in {{different}} contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.|$|E
5|$|The ESRB {{reported}} that Bethesda Softworks would promptly notify all retailers of the change, issue stickers for retailers and distributors to <b>affix</b> on the product, display the new rating in all following product shipments and marketing, {{and create a}} downloadable patch rendering the topless skin inaccessible. Bethesda complied with the request but disagreed with the ESRB's rationale. Some retailers began to check for ID before selling Oblivion as a result, and one California Assemblyman used the event to criticize the ESRB's inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|After these incidents, the US Congress and NASA {{considered}} {{whether to}} abandon the programme {{out of concern for}} the astronauts' safety, but NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to continue. The next flight to Mir, STS-86, carried David Wolf aboard Atlantis. During the orbiter's stay, Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to <b>affix</b> a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members to seal the leak in Spektrs hull. Wolf spent 119 days aboard Mir with the EO-24 crew and was replaced during STS-89 with Andy Thomas, who carried out the last US expedition on Mir. The EO-25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–Mir mission, STS-91.|$|E
50|$|Inflectional <b>affixes</b> encode {{the subject}} and object of the theme. Wiyot makes a sharp {{distinction}} between definite and indefinite subjects, and each of these classes has {{its own set of}} inflectional <b>affixes.</b> Certain classes of Wiyot verbs can also take benefactive and instrumental <b>affixes.</b> The benefactive characterizes the verb as being done to a third person object for the benefit of a second object. Instrumental <b>affixes</b> convey that action is performed using a device of some kind. Instrumental and benefactive <b>affixes</b> directly encode for the subject of the verb and thus do not appear with inflectional <b>affixes</b> for subject. Therefore, the most inflectional <b>affixes</b> a verb can possibly take is three.Inflectional <b>affixes</b> can be either terminal or nonterminal in nature. Terminal <b>affixes,</b> when added to verb or noun themes, can complete words, while nonterminal <b>affixes</b> require additional affixation.The noun form rakhóhwalił, meaning he/she laughs at me, contains two inflectional <b>affixes</b> that modify the verb form rakhohw- shown above: -al is the nonterminal suffix that encodes a first person object, and -ił is the terminal suffix for a third person subject.|$|R

40|$|The {{execution}} of Turkish {{which is an}} agglutinating language is achieved mostly through <b>affixes.</b> In Turkish {{there are more than}} two hundred <b>affixes</b> most of which have more than a single usage variation. The distinction between derivational and inflectional <b>affixes</b> relating to the classification of these <b>affixes</b> is accepted rather as a superficial and insufficient classification. In this frame an apparent diversity attracts attention about works concerning the classification of <b>affixes.</b> The reason of this diversity should be searched in the differences within the features of <b>affixes</b> which have been based on and given a certain priority. Because role and function of <b>affixes</b> with regard to their usage, change according to sub-branches of linguistics. From the points of phonetics, morphology, syntax, lexicography and prosody functions, tasks and roles of <b>affixes</b> have different appearances. These usage features and views of <b>affixes</b> in different fields of linguistics are {{to pave the way for}} an agreed and accurate classification...|$|R
5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural <b>affix.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital, but {{the hospital was}} reluctant to <b>affix</b> a faux gargoyle to the building. Thus, the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall, a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver. Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen tore up the sidewalk on the very spot where the producers planned to film the scene. The construction crew reassured the show that the construction would be finished in time for filming. Indeed, the work was finished two hours before shooting of the episode started. Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market. The walls were painted to match those of Heritage Hall, although after filming was completed, they were returned to their original state.|$|E
5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, <b>affix</b> the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|E
40|$|Two {{subjects}} {{have been}} studied in this article: 1. The concepts of simile and similarity, 2. <b>Affixes</b> which inform the concepts of simile and similarity. <b>Affixes</b> such as +CA, +CIl, +mAn, +(I) msl, +(I) mtırak, +sI, +sIl, have been shown like as diminution <b>affixes</b> in some Turkish grammar and grammar term's dictionaries. Indeed, these <b>affixes</b> have similarity functions. In this article, these <b>affixes,</b> explained with the researches and examples that have similarity functions...|$|R
2500|$|Since <b>affixes</b> {{may be used}} as root words, {{and roots}} may combine like <b>affixes,</b> the {{boundary}} between the two is blurred. Indeed, many so-called <b>affixes</b> are indistinguishable from other roots. However, [...] "true" [...] <b>affixes</b> are grammatically fixed as being either prefixes or suffixes, whereas the order of roots in compounds is determined by semantics.|$|R

5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may <b>affix</b> their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePolysynthesis in Inuit {{appears at}} both lexical and {{sentence}} levels. The {{analysis of a}} sampling of 3000 lexical entries and 300 <b>affixes</b> collected in Eastern Greenland (Tunumiisut) shows how polysynthesis works in lexical morphology and how phonetic wastage helps to obscure the motivation for some lexical forms and favors the development of homophones. Furthermore, {{the analysis of the}} full set of <b>affixes</b> reveals a number of formal and semantic similarities which relate <b>affixes</b> having different functions. This suggests a continuum over incorporating <b>affixes,</b> TAM verb <b>affixes,</b> and verb inflection, attested in a number of items. While the lexical origin of some incorporating <b>affixes</b> has already been suggested, the hypothesis of a larger lexical, derivational, and inflectional continuum may provide clues for discovering grammaticalization processes operating within the stock of <b>affixes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Any {{algorithmic}} {{study of}} written English must {{sooner or later}} face the problem of unscrambling English <b>affixes.</b> The role of <b>affixes</b> is crucial {{in the study of}} word-breaking practice. In the automatic determination of the parts of speech (a central feature of automatic syntactic analysis), the suppressing action of <b>affixes</b> must be understood in detail. In the determination of English citation forms, complete lists of <b>affixes</b> are necessary. The inflection of English verbs is tied up with the existence of suffixes. Existing definitions of <b>affixes</b> suffer because they are neither computable nor in general agreement with one another, and none of them refers directly to written English. Existing lists of <b>affixes</b> vary widely in size and content, implying a lack of agreement as to what constitutes a complete listing of English <b>affixes,</b> or how one is to be obtained.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the frequency of occurrence of <b>affixed</b> words in consecutive portions of ten selected trade books. Family frequencies of the <b>affixed</b> words included in the study were used to describe the frequency of their occurrence in printed school materials. In addition, <b>affixed</b> words were categorized as being either semantically transparent or semantically opaque. ^ Three categories of selected trade books, Books for Early Readers, Books for Middle Readers, and Books for Advanced Readers, were selected based on the criteria of their literary value and their endurance over time. One hundred-word samples were drawn from five consecutive portions of the ten selected trade books. ^ Three research questions were formulated to determine (1) if there were any differences in the frequency of occurrence of <b>affixed</b> words among the random samples drawn, (2) if there were any differences in the number of <b>affixed</b> words which had family frequencies equal to or less than 100. 00 among the random samples, and (3) if there were any differences in the percentage of <b>affixed</b> words which were semantically opaque among the three categories of selected trade books. ^ Findings of the study included the following: (1) There were differences in the number of <b>affixed</b> words occurring among the ten selected trade books. In terms of the occurrence of <b>affixed</b> words, the books tended to cluster into two groups. (2) There were differences in the number of <b>affixed</b> words having family frequencies with U values equal to or less than 100. 00. The range was five <b>affixed</b> words to 28 <b>affixed</b> words having family frequencies with U values equal to or less than 100. 00. (3) There was an increase in the percentage of <b>affixed</b> words which were semantically opaque among the three categories of trade books. The percentage of semantically opaque <b>affixed</b> words increased as the competency level increased. The largest increase was found between the percentages of semantically opaque <b>affixed</b> words in the categories Books for Early Readers the Books for Middle Readers. ...|$|R
