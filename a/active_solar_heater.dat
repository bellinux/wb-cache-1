It has the most favor to produce pure water to overcome the water needs issue in arid regions. For this reason, several researches were undertaken a local manufacturing devices which can realize this objective. The {{focus of this article}} is to discuss a new approach of solar distillation system. The aim is to combine a double slope solar still with a cylindrical <b>solar</b> water <b>heater</b> which can be motivated by the two following significant reasons: firstly, to increase water temperature inside the solar still in order to improve with, high level, its distillate production capability, besides, the cylindrical type <b>solar</b> <b>heater</b> has a good ability of heating water with low heat losses to the ambient surrounding. Both of the previous systems may form a double slope <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> still. Performed numerical investigations are based on the determination of temperature and distillate mass profiles in the case of an <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> still and to compare them to those of solar still without preheating system.
