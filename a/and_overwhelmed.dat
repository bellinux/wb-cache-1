5|$|A North Korean {{tank column}} {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran {{the task force}} in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After the North Korean tank column had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on a force of some 5,000 North Korean infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up the North Korean advance. North Korean troops eventually flanked <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> American positions and {{the remnants of the}} task force retreated in disorder.|$|E

5|$|Pritchard {{learned from}} local {{residents}} {{that about a}} mile and a half to the north there was a military camp. Not knowing whether this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so surprised <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately.|$|E

David Bowie (portraying himself) sees the video and sends an e-mail to Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band {{as one of their}} first artists. Will is so excited <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> that he falls {{down in the middle of}} the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album).

They barely make it, losing the lawyer in the process, but discover a large group of Martians stationed there as they are preparing to take off. Byron creates a diversion by challenging them to a fistfight. While he succeeds in killing the Ambassador, he is outnumbered <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed,</b> but Tom, Barbara and Cindy escape.|$|E
5|$|Discovered {{at anchor}} off Pointe-Noire on 22 January by the British brig HMS Hazard, Topaze was {{isolated}} and attacked by two British frigates, led by Captain Samuel Pechell in HMS Cleopatra. In the ensuing engagement, the British ships outnumbered <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> their opponent, capturing {{the ship and}} her cargo, despite heavy fire from a French gun battery that overlooked the anchorage. The British ships were drawn from a force gathered for the impending invasion of Martinique, which was launched six days after Topaze had been captured and successfully completed in a campaign lasting just over three weeks.|$|E
5|$|General Papagos rushed Greek {{units to}} the Metsovon pass where the Germans were {{expected}} to attack. On 14 April a pitched battle between several Greek units and the LSSAH brigade—which had by then reached Grevena—erupted. The Greek 13th and Cavalry Divisions lacked the equipment necessary to fight against an armoured unit but nevertheless fought on till the next day, when the defenders were finally encircled <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed.</b> On 18 April, General Wilson {{in a meeting with}} Papagos, informed him that the British and Commonwealth forces at Thermopylai would carry on fighting till the first week of May, providing that Greek forces from Albania could redeploy and cover the left flank.|$|E

5|$|Wang Mang {{initiated}} {{a series of}} major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying {{to the north and}} the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.|$|E
5|$|Zotov {{was not a}} {{religious}} scholar, but he knew the Bible well—an important qualification for Tsaritsa Natalia. Although he did not expect it, he was well rewarded before he had even started his work, receiving from Feodor and the Tsaritsa, as well as Patriarch Joachim, gifts including a set of apartments, two new sets of clothing, and 100 rubles. He was also raised {{to the rank of}} a minor nobleman. Zotov was deeply humbled <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the Tsaritsa's request, and was enthralled at the prospect of teaching Peter. Zotov and Peter quickly became good friends, and Zotov remained close to Peter until the former's death.|$|E
5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, <b>and,</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so England's loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. The city's dead had been buried in and around the local churches. With a limited amount of space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. Despite the rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply, and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> the burial system completely.|$|E
5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by tacking {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed.</b> For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began their}} 2007football season with emotion and remembrance. As Virginia Tech {{recovered}} from the worst school shooting in American history, football served {{as a way to}} help the university community emotionally heal. The opening game of the season, on September 1, 2007, was against East Carolina University and featured numerous remembrance ceremonies and commemorations. Buoyed by the emotion of the day, the Hokies earned a 177 victory. Their next game would not be as easy. One week later, Virginia Tech traveled to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to face the No.2 Louisiana State University Tigers. The Tigers were widely regarded in pre-season polls as favorites to play in the National Championship Game <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> the Hokies in front of a home crowd, 487.|$|E

5|$|This new sail {{was much}} larger than the others sighted earlier in the day, and the {{detached}} squadron abandoned their former pursuit and turned towards the new arrival, Hercule. By 17:45, L'Héritier was in full flight with the British force strung out behind him, the rest of Bridport's fleet far to the west. Jason had the lead with Mars shortly behind, although Inman on Ramillies had lost his fore topmast and had dropped back. Hood, an experienced officer and a nephew of both Bridport and the veteran Admiral Lord Hood, pressed his ship forwards and gradually gained on both Jason and Hercule. L'Héritier knew that in open water he would be caught <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed,</b> and sought instead to escape through the narrow and dangerous channel of the Raz de Sein, a rocky passage between the Île de Sein and the Pointe du Raz: during the Expédition d'Irlande the French ship of the line Séduisant had been wrecked in the Raz de Sein with 680 lives.|$|E
5|$|To their left, the Union Brigade {{suddenly}} {{swept through}} the infantry lines, giving rise to the legend {{that some of the}} 92nd Gordon Highland Regiment clung onto their stirrups and accompanied them into the charge. From the centre leftwards, the Royal Dragoons destroyed Bourgeois' brigade, capturing the eagle of the 105th Ligne. The Inniskillings routed the other brigade of Quoit's division, and the Scots Greys came upon the lead French regiment, 45th Ligne, as it was still reforming after having crossed the sunken road and broken through the hedge row in pursuit of the British infantry. The Greys captured the eagle of the 45th Ligne <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> Grenier's brigade. These would be the only two French eagles captured by the British during the battle. On Wellington's extreme left, Durutte's division had time to form squares and fend off groups of Greys.|$|E
5|$|Only part of Captain King’s force, {{including}} 35 of Lieutenant Angus's 70 sailors, {{succeeded in}} making a landing at the Red House. Under fire from the defenders, the invaders charged Lieutenant Lamont’s detachment of the 49th Regiment. The sailors, armed with pikes and swords, closed in for hand-to-hand fighting. Lamont's troops drove back the attackers three times but King made a fourth assault which hit the British left flank <b>and</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> them; capturing Lamont and killing, taking or dispersing all of his men. The victorious Americans {{set fire to the}} post, spiked the guns and set off back to the landing-point, where they expected their boats to have re-landed in order to evacuate them. However, in the moonless darkness, King’s force became dispersed and split into two parties: one led by King and the other by Lieutenant Angus. Angus returned to the landing-point and found only four of the party’s ten boats there. Unaware that the six missing boats had not in fact landed, Angus assumed that King had already departed, and he re-crossed the river in the remaining boats. When King’s party reached the landing-point, they found themselves stranded. A search downriver found two unattended British boats, in which King sent half of his men, and the prisoners that he had captured, over the Niagara while he waited with his 30 remaining men for more boats to come from Buffalo and pick him up.|$|E
