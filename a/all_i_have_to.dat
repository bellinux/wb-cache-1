500|$|On Sept 21, 1937, Hugo Black was “besieged” by reporters. He said, “If I {{make any}} {{statement}} {{it will be}} in a way the people can hear me and understand what I have to say, and not have to depend on some parts of the press which might fail to report <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say.” ...|$|E
500|$|On November 22, 2011, the behind-the-scenes {{footage of}} the video was posted online. In the footage, her stylist said that the {{inspiration}} for the video was [...] "trailer-trash, ghetto fabulous, out-there, [...] edgy." [...] During the footage Beyoncé said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is party and have a good time." [...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and I had a great childhood. We went from nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off. It didn't matter where we were 'cause we had love and we had so much fun. It's great when you don't have as much how you improvise and you have more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} years, Bax {{maintained}} a contented retirement {{for much of}} the time. Walton commented, [...] "an important cricket match at Lord's would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, [...] "I ought perhaps to be thinking of an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. [...] He wrote in 1952, [...] "I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say and it is of no use to repeat myself." [...] Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.|$|E

500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{trial in}} the Victorian Supreme Court lasting twelve sitting days Ryan was convicted {{of the murder of}} Hodson and sentenced to death by Justice John Starke, the {{mandatory}} sentence at that time. Asked if he had anything to say before sentencing Ryan stated [...] "I still maintain my innocence. I will consult with my counsel with a view to appeal. That is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 9 February 1886 Parnell {{declared}} {{to the voters}} of Galway that [...] "If my candidate is defeated, the news will spread round the universe that a disaster has overwhelmed Ireland. The world will say, 'Parnell is beaten. Ireland has no longer a leader.'" [...] Biggar split with Parnell over this, declaring [...] "Mr. Chairman, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say is, I can't agree with what you state, and if Mr. Lynch [...] goes to the poll I'll support him!".|$|E

2500|$|Ma Chao died in 222 {{at the age}} of 47 (by East Asian age reckoning). His {{cause of}} death was not {{recorded}} in history. Before his death, he wrote to Liu Bei: [...] "Over 200 members of my family were killed by Cao Cao. I only have my cousin Ma Dai left with me. He will be the one to continue my family line. I entrust him to Your Majesty's care. That is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say." [...] In 260, Liu Bei's son and successor, Liu Shan, granted Ma Chao the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Wei" [...] (威侯).|$|E
2500|$|After {{the speech}} Obama {{and his wife}} were interviewed by Brian Williams, and when asked about what she thought, Michelle replied, [...] "And <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say is, honey, you didn't screw it up, so good job." [...] Obama said that he hoped his two daughters had watched the whole event, as their baby-sitter was {{permitted}} to let them stay up only if they watched the convention. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, called Obama after the speech and told him, [...] "You did well...I just kind of worry about you. I hope you keep your head on straight." [...] She was later quoted by a journalist: [...] "I was a little amazed. It was really quite an exceptional speech, or I'm being prejudiced, I don't know. But, to me, it was really quite exceptional." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 28, 2011, Love, Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Auf der Maur {{appeared}} at the New York screening of Schemel's documentary [...] at the Museum of Modern Art. The appearance {{was the first time}} in thirteen years that all four members appeared together in public. Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating [...] "nothing has been discussed, but I have a feeling." [...] After the screening, the four took part in a Q session where Love stated: [...] "For me, as much as I love playing with Patty – and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage – if it's not moving forward, I don't wanna do it. That's just my thing. There's rumblings; there's always bloody rumblings. But if it's not miserable and it's going forward and I'm happy with it… that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say about that question." ...|$|E
60|$|I'm glad I've {{done what}} <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> Arthur. I've {{sometimes}} felt I gave you so little {{in return for}} all you've given me. But at least now I've given you <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give.|$|R

60|$|So we <b>all</b> sat down. <b>I</b> was {{the first}} witness, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say was {{carefully}} noted. Then Phil Jones and Mr. Ranson followed; and after an hour or more, the judge said he was satisfied.|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{release of}} the work, Anger was arrested on {{obscenity}} charges. He was acquitted, after the case went to the Supreme Court of California, which deemed it to be art rather than pornography. Anger made the claim to have been seventeen {{years old when he}} made it, {{despite the fact that he}} was actually twenty, presumably to present himself as more of an enfant terrible. A homoerotic work lasting only 14 minutes, Fireworks revolves around a young man (played by Anger himself) associating with various navy sailors, who eventually turn on him, stripping him naked and beating him to death, ripping open his chest to find a compass inside. Several fireworks then explode, accompanied by a burning Christmas tree and the final shot shows the young man lying in bed next to another topless man. Of this film, Anger would later state in 1966 that [...] "This flick is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say about being 17, the United States Navy, American Christmas and the fourth of July." [...] He would continuously alter and adapt the film up until 1980, with it finally being distributed on VHS in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|One such {{threat was}} {{delivered}} by fur trader James McDougall, who {{is quoted as}} saying to a gathering of local chiefs, [...] "You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is to pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends." [...] Likewise, another fur trader threatened Pawnee Indians that if they didn't agree to certain conditions, [...] "he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them." [...] The Reverend Isaac McCoy was quoted in his History of Baptist Indian Missions as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War. [...] Artist and writer George Catlin observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, [...] "They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the pale face by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them." [...] So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief Four Bears denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to October 2012, Deep Purple {{had never}} been {{nominated}} for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013. Despite ranking second in the public's vote on the Rock Hall fans' ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, [...] "they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What's the first song every kid learns how to play? ...And they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? ...the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions." [...] Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement for the non-induction of Deep Purple; [...] "The {{list of people who}} haven't even been nominated is mind-boggling.. big one for me is Deep Purple. How could you not induct Deep Purple?". Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band's induction. In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: [...] "I'm {{not going to get into}} the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language...'Deep Purple'! Did I say that already?" [...] In 2015, Chris Jericho, WWE wrestler and current vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: [...] "that Deep Purple are not in it [...] It's bullshit. Obviously there's some politics against them from getting in there." ...|$|E
