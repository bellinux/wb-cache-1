25|$|It is {{not known}} how many letters the Proto-Sinaitic {{alphabet}} had nor what their <b>alphabetic</b> <b>order</b> was. Among its descendants, the Ugaritic alphabet had 27 consonants, the South Arabian alphabets had 29, and the Phoenician alphabet 22. These scripts were arranged in two orders, an ABGDE order in Phoenician and an HMĦLQ order in the south; Ugaritic preserved both orders. Both sequences proved remarkably stable among the descendants of these scripts.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{scholars}} have recently argued that ballot order effects give certain candidates {{an unfair advantage}} in elections and have urged states to randomize or rotate the order of candidate names to make elections more rational and fair. This article suggests that advocates of reform have been too quick to concede that static order-ing methods are nondiscriminatory. One common method of ballot ordering, arranging candidates in alphabet-ical order by their last names, disadvantages specific minority populations by pushing their candidates down the ballot. To substantiate this argument, I engineer two computer simulation experiments which show a sig-nificant link between ballot position and racial/ethnic status under <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> laws. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are particularly burdened by these laws. Because courts apply {{a higher level of}} scrutiny to election laws that infringe fundamental voting rights than laws that merely regulate elections, the discrimina-tory impact of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> rules significantly bolsters the case to rotate or randomize ballot order.

25|$|The impalement arts {{have evolved}} {{as the product}} of a history of {{performance}} dating back to at least the 19th century. That heritage, and especially the collective achievements of notable performers, helps to define the subject. As with other performance arts, judgements about who might be the most notable are highly subjective and clouded by the hyperbole of publicity. For similar reasons it is also sometimes difficult to resolve debates about who originated particular stunts. Nevertheless, some names recur frequently in historical records and current news. Some are recognised for pioneering achievements, some for bringing the arts to widespread audiences and some as distinctive characters who, although less famous, have had significant influence on their peers. Because this is not a league table of merit and because overlaps make a chronological presentation awkward, they are presented here in <b>alphabetic</b> <b>order</b> under the two main disciplines.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{to a new}} writing medium {{sometimes}} {{caused a}} break in graphical form, or make the relationship difficult to trace. It is not immediately obvious that the cuneiform Ugaritic alphabet derives from a prototypical Semitic abjad, for example, although {{this appears to be}} the case. And while manual alphabets are a direct continuation of the local written alphabet (both the British two-handed and the French/American one-handed alphabets retain the forms of the Latin alphabet, as the Indian manual alphabet does Devanagari, and the Korean does Hangul), Braille, semaphore, maritime signal flags, and the Morse codes are essentially arbitrary geometric forms. The shapes of the English Braille and semaphore letters, for example, are derived from the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>order</b> of the Latin alphabet, but not from the graphic forms of the letters themselves. Most modern forms of shorthand are also unrelated to the alphabet, generally transcribing sounds instead of letters.|$|E
25|$|In France, until 1 January 2005, {{children}} were {{required by law}} to take the surname of their father. If the father was unknown, the child had the family name of the mother. Since 1 January 2005, article 311-21 of the French Civil code permits parents to give their children either the name of their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both - although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, both parents family names are hyphenated in <b>alphabetic</b> <b>order</b> with only the first of their names if they have a hyphenated name themselves. This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979. Similar measures were adopted by Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983), Spain (1999) and Austria (2013).|$|E
50|$|Spelling {{dictionaries}} are referencing {{materials that}} specifically aid users {{in finding the}} correct spelling of a word.

This circumvents the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> limitations of a classic dictionary.

The next year the roster starts from 'H', for either Haryana or Himachal Pradesh (if it has started from Haryana on the previous occasion when it all started from 'H', then this time it would start from Himachal Pradesh). This highly intricate system, in vogue since the mid-1980s, had ensured that officers from different states are placed all over India.|$|E
25|$|The {{quicksort}} algorithm {{was developed}} in 1959 by Tony Hoare while in the Soviet Union, as a visiting student at Moscow State University. At that time, Hoare worked in a project on machine translation for the National Physical Laboratory. As {{a part of the}} translation process, he needed to sort the words of Russian sentences prior to looking them up in a Russian-English dictionary that was already sorted in <b>alphabetic</b> <b>order</b> on magnetic tape. After recognizing that his first idea, insertion sort, would be slow, he quickly came up with a new idea that was Quicksort. He wrote a program in Mercury Autocode for the partition but couldn't write the program to account for the list of unsorted segments. On return to England, he was asked to write code for Shellsort as part of his new job. Hoare mentioned to his boss that he knew of a faster algorithm and his boss bet sixpence that he didn't. His boss ultimately accepted that he had lost the bet. Later, Hoare learned about ALGOL and its ability to do recursion that enabled him to publish the code in Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, the premier computer science journal of the time.|$|E
25|$|Braille was {{introduced}} to Britain in 1861. In 1876, a French-based system with a few hundred English contractions and abbreviations was adopted as the predominant script in Great Britain. However, the contractions and abbreviations proved unsatisfactory, and in 1902 the current grade-2 system, called Revised Braille, was adopted in the British Commonwealth. In 1878, the ideal of basing all braille alphabets {{of the world on}} the original French <b>alphabetic</b> <b>order</b> was accepted by Britain, Germany, and Egypt (see International Braille). In the United States at the time, three scripts were used: non-braille New York Point; American Braille, which was reordered so that the most frequent letters were the ones with the fewest dots; and a variation of English Braille, which was reordered to match the English alphabet, assigning the values wxyz to the letters that, in France and England, stood for xyzç. A partially contracted English Braille, Grade 1½, was adopted in Britain in 1918, and fully contracted Grade 2, with a few minor concessions to the Americans, was adopted in 1932. The concessions were to swap the British two-dot capital sign with the one-dot emphasis sign, which had generally been omitted anyway (as capitals had been in New York Point), to drop a few religious contractions from general usage, and to introduce a rule stating that contractions and abbreviations should not span 'major' syllable boundaries.|$|E
5000|$|Clay tablets {{written in}} Ugaritic provide the {{earliest}} evidence {{of both the}} North Semitic and South Semitic orders of the alphabet, which {{gave rise to the}} <b>alphabetic</b> <b>orders</b> of the reduced Phoenician alphabet and its descendants (including Greek and Latin) on the one hand, and of the Ge'ez alphabet on the other. Arabic and Old South Arabian are the only other Semitic alphabets which have letters for all or almost all of the 29 commonly reconstructed proto-Semitic consonant phonemes. (But note that several of these distinctions were only secondarily added to the Arabic alphabet by means of diacritic dots.) According to Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz in Handbook of Ugaritic Studies (eds. Wilfred G.E. Watson and Nicholas Wyatt, 1999): [...] "The language they 30 signs represented could be described as an idiom which in terms of content seemed to be comparable to Canaanite texts, but from a phonological perspective, however, was more like Arabic" [...] (82, 89, 614).|$|R

Most Chinese words are multisyllabic compounds, where each syllable or morpheme is written with a single Chinese character. Following a two-millennia tradition, Chinese dictionaries - even modern pinyin-based ones like the Xinhua Zidian - are regularly ordered in [...] "sorted-morpheme arrangement" [...] based on the first morpheme (character) in a word. For instance, a Chinese dictionary user who wanted to look up the word Bābāduōsī 巴巴多斯 [...] "" [...] could find it under ba [...] in traditional sorted- morpheme ordering (which is easier if one knows the character's appearance or radical but not its pronunciation) or under baba in single-sort <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> (which is easier if one knows the pronunciation).

40|$|Earth science {{metadata}} {{search engines}} dealing with {{large volumes of}} Earth science metadata need an effective method to respond to queries and retrieve metadata very quickly. Basically, Earth science metadata includes three types of information: descriptive text, temporal range, and spatial range. So, except for the general text retrieval, Earth science metadata retrieval requires a temporal range query and a spatial range query, which are not widely needed by other types of search engines. DIMES, a distributed metadata server, is being tested for use of Lucene to tackle the search problem of Earth science metadata.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{what drives}} author ordering in scientific research. We first discussa theoretical {{framework for the}} choice between alphabetical ordering and relative-contribution-based ordering and develop hypotheses, focusing {{on the nature of}} research, in particular, the importance of collaboration in the context of incomplete contract, the measurement cost of contribution-based ordering and the role of a principal investigator (PI). Our empirical examinations, based on the new large scale original scientists' surveys in the US and Japan, show the supporting results. In particular, an alphabetical ordering {{is more likely to be}} used when the research is theoretical and has less empirical component and when the team size is large and not co-located. The variation of research method goes a long way in explaining the variation of the use of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> across fields (mathematics and economics vs. the others) as well as its variation within a field. We also find that PI or Co-PIs are more likely to exist when the project uses more resources as well as when the team is more heterogeneous. Finally, we confirm that author ordering sends two signals in contribution based ordering, the first author for the largest research contribution and the last author for the PI (or Co-PI) ...|$|R
500|$|Isidore of Seville {{was born}} around 560 in Spain, under the {{unstable}} {{rule of the}} Visigoths {{after the collapse of}} the Roman empire. [...] His older brother, Leander, the abbot of a Seville monastery, supervised Isidore's education, probably in the school attached to his monastery. Leander was a powerful priest, a friend of Pope Gregory, and eventually he became bishop of Seville. Leander also made friends with the Visigothic king's sons, Hermenigild and Reccared. In 586, Reccared became king, and in 587 under Leander's religious direction he became a Catholic, controlling the choice of bishops. Reccared died in 601, not long after appointing Isidore as bishop of Seville. Isidore helped to unify the kingdom through Christianity and education, eradicating the Arian heresy which had been widespread, and led National Councils at Toledo and Seville. Isidore had a close friendship with king Sisebut, who came to the throne in 612, and with another Seville churchman, Braulio, who later became bishop of Saragossa. Isidore was widely read, mainly in Latin with a little Greek and Hebrew. He was familiar with the works of both the church fathers and pagan writers such as Martial, Tertullian and Pliny the Elder, this last the author of the major encyclopaedia then in existence, the Natural History. The classical encyclopedists had already introduced <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> of topics, and a literary rather than observational approach to knowledge: Isidore followed those traditions. Isidore became well known in his lifetime as a scholar. He started to put together a collection of his knowledge, the Etymologies, in about 600, and continued to write until about 625.|$|R
