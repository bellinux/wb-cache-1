5|$|Although Islam is the {{official}} religion of the federation, Sarawak has no official state religion. However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong {{as the head of}} Islam in Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial, child custody, betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. <b>An</b> <b>appeals</b> court and Courts of Kadi were also formed.|$|E

When former general manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was thrown out by <b>an</b> <b>appeals</b> court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for €443million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation.

5|$|Primarily <b>an</b> <b>appeals</b> court, the Oregon Supreme Court is {{also the}} court of last resort in Oregon. Although most oral {{arguments}} before the court are held in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, the court does travel around the state holding sessions in various schools.

Decisions of the court are published in the Oregon Reporter published by the Oregon Judicial Department.

5|$|The Assembly {{recessed}} on August 28 for the Labor Day holiday, and did {{not come}} back into session until September 4. The same day, Governor Stanley conferred with Rep. Smith, Delegate Gray, and House Speaker Moore. Their discussion focused on the Stanley plan's lack of <b>an</b> <b>appeals</b> process for pupil assignments. Stanley agreed to a compromise that would allow an administrative appeal (through an as-yet-to-be-worked-out process), followed by a required appeal to state courts and lower federal courts before any appeal could {{be taken to the}} U.S. Supreme Court. The Stanley plan seemed to suffer a serious blow the following day, however, when the Virginia State Board of Education voted not to endorse the plan. Four members strongly opposed withholding state funds from integrated schools, which led to the negative vote. The board also voted to publicly support the original Gray Commission plan. Meeting with the board after the vote, Governor Stanley discussed the possibility of merging his plan with some sort of pupil assignment plan, so that pupil assignment would be permitted but funds would still be withheld if assignment failed to segregate the schools. Another blow to the Stanley plan came when Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the former governor of Virginia who was now president of the University of Virginia, announced he opposed the Stanley plan and supported the Gray Commission's original proposals.|$|E
