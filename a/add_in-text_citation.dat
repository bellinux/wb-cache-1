40|$|APA {{citation}} style {{refers to}} the rules and conventions established by the American Psychological Association for documenting sources used in a research paper. APA style requires both <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> and a reference list. For every <b>in-text</b> <b>citation</b> {{there should be a}} full citation in the reference list and vice versa. The examples of APA styles and formats listed on this page include many of the most common types of sources used in academic research. For additional examples and more detailed information about APA citation style, refer to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association and the APA Style Guide to Electronic References. Also, for automatic generation of citations in appropriate citation style, use a bibliographic citation management program such as Refworks or EndNote.

40|$|We report {{characteristics}} of <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in over five million full text articles from two large databases - the PubMed Central Open Access subset and Elsevier journals - as functions of time, textual progression, and scientific field. The {{purpose of this}} study is to understand the {{characteristics of}} <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in a detailed way prior to pursuing other studies focused on answering more substantive research questions. As such, we have analyzed <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in several ways and report many findings here. Perhaps most significantly, we find that there are large field-level differences that are reflected in position within the text, citation interval (or reference age), and citation counts of references. In general, the fields of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Life and Earth Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering have similar reference distributions, although they vary in their specifics. The two remaining fields, Mathematics and Computer Science and Social Science and Humanities, have different reference distributions from the other three fields and between themselves. We also show that in all fields the numbers of sentences, references, and in-text mentions per article have increased over time, and that there are field-level and temporal differences in the numbers of in-text mentions per reference. A final finding is that references mentioned only once tend to be much more highly cited than those mentioned multiple times. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

40|$|Connect <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> to bibliographies <b>In-text</b> <b>citations</b> {{signal the}} use of a {{particular}} source and so must offer readers identifying information about that source—usually including author or title and a reference to a particular passage or page that also makes a clear link to the bibliography. For an overview of related key topics on working with documentation styles, visit the videos and quizzes in this tutorial. Explore It By documenting your sources carefully—in your text and in your bibliography—you give readers of your research project a map to the sources you use. While reading your paper, readers should be able to identify specific types of information about the sources you use. When your in-text references are accurate and formatted correctly, they will point readers to the complete citation on your bibliography page. All documentation styles call on you to include citations of sources in your text that are connected to entries in the bibliography that accompanies your research project. Though the requirements and styles differ, MLA, APA, and Chicago styles all require basic citations in your text that identify the author and indicate which of your sources is being cited. And when you cite a particular passage in your draft all these documentation styles require you to note, often by giving a page number, where the material appears in the source. The citations in the text of your research paper point readers to a particular entry in your bibliography. Here are several example sentences showing <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> of paraphrased material from a source. Each example is accompanied by an entry for citing the source in the works cited (MLA), references (APA), or in a note and on the bibliography page (Chicago). mla Teenagers may experience loneliness, depression, and a decline in “real world ” social activity as a result of overexposure to chat rooms and excessive Web surfing (Johnson) ...|$|R

40|$|Citation {{is a very}} {{important}} aspect of writing. When an author uses another author's ideas or information, credit must be given, whether the original author's words are used as a direct quote or not. The older, more traditional styles of citation relied on the author listing the full citation of each source on the page where the information was actually used, usually in a footnote. Later, the footnotes were collected {{at the end of the}} paper or chapter and called endnotes. However, both of these formats were awkward and clumsy for the writer. Therefore, both the MLA (Modern Language Association) and the APA (American Psychiatric Association) decided to create new systems that were easier to use for the writer, and yet still gave the reader as much information as they needed to know. MLA and APA styles of citation are designed around two different, yet related functions: <b>in-text</b> parenthetical <b>citation</b> and the list of sources. Both are absolutely necessary in order for either one to work. The <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> make reference to the list of sources, and the list of sources tells you the necessary information about the sources cited in the text of the essay. In this guide, we will deal with both functions, but separately. <b>IN-TEXT</b> CITATIONS <b>In-text</b> <b>citations</b> are used whenever a writer has used information from another source, whether that information is a direct quote or a paraphrase. The rule of thumb is that if the writer didn't know the information before beginning the research, it needs to be cited. The one exception to this rule is general knowledge. Any information found in a general encyclopedia or found in a majority of sources is not considered unique enough to need to be cited. The author CAN cite it, but they are not required to do so...|$|R
