5|$|Several other {{structures}} within the policies are listed. These include the Category B listed Gothic style mausoleum constructed in 1865 {{at a cost}} of £2,500, equivalent to around £266,000 as at 2012. Built {{in the shape of a}} cross, it has a round stained glass window in the front gable and features many gargoyles and other stone decorations. Bodies are interred in the burial ground outside but commemorative stones made of Carrara marble <b>are</b> <b>inside</b> the mausoleum. The corbels on the internal oak roof are embellished with angel figurines.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds <b>are</b> <b>inside</b> to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations <b>are</b> <b>inside</b> Castle Ravenloft.|$|E
60|$|It {{certainly}} is queer {{what a difference}} there <b>is</b> between being <b>inside</b> and outside. Sometimes happiness <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> and sometimes it is outside. Sometimes the one who <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> wishes {{with all his might}} that he were outside, and sometimes the one who is outside would give anything in the world to <b>be</b> <b>inside.</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cú Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the Fomorians. She {{falls in love}} with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him {{in the form of a}} pair of swans. Cú Chulainn, not {{realising}} who she is, shoots her down with his sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his foster-son Lugaid Riab nDerg. Lugaid goes on to become High King of Ireland, but the Lia Fáil (stone of destiny), fails to cry out when he stands on it, so Cú Chulainn splits it in two with his sword. When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual desirability and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house the women <b>are</b> <b>inside,</b> killing 150 of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of Belarus {{is divided into}} discrete regions, called oblasts. The oblasts are further divided into districts which are in turn subdivided into cities. The Constitution also allows for special regions to be created, which are {{to be controlled by}} legislation. Citizens of Belarus are also promised protection and sponsorship, regardless of whether they <b>are</b> <b>inside</b> Belarusian borders or in a foreign country. With some exceptions, those who do not have a nationality and foreigners are, under the Constitution, granted the same status and rights as citizens of Belarus. Belarus also has the power to grant asylum to those who have been subject to persecution due to their ethnic background, political ideology or religious affiliation.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components <b>are</b> <b>inside</b> the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E

30|$|The {{procedure}} {{was similar to}} that in Experiment 2, with the following exceptions. Observers were shown 16 pictures. For each, they were asked whether a specific object <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> and selected one of the following answer choices and then indicated their confidence: (1) yes, the object <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> and I can use the bar to show you where it is; (2) yes, the object <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> but from the picture I cannot tell where it is; (3) from the picture I cannot tell whether the object is inside; or (4) no, the object <b>is</b> not <b>inside.</b> If Choice 1 was selected, they used the bar with inclinometer to indicate the location of the object. After they had made their selections for all pictures, they were told that the object <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> and asked to guess about the location by orienting the bar.|$|R

25|$|The Th1 {{response}} {{is characterized by}} the production of Interferon-gamma, which activates the bactericidal activities of macrophages, and induces B cells to make opsonizing (coating) and complement-fixing antibodies, and leads to cell-mediated immunity. In general, Th1 responses are more effective against intracellular pathogens (viruses and bacteria that <b>are</b> <b>inside</b> host cells).|$|E
25|$|Increases in {{the size}} of plant cells are {{complicated}} by the fact that almost all plant cells <b>are</b> <b>inside</b> of a solid cell wall.
