40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> and their mutual cooperation.

The first kind of cooperation charts the relationships that exist between groups of a selected region of the world (intra-regional cooperation).

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the causes of {{emergence}} {{of the most important}} Latin American <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> in a period {{since the end of the}} World War II till the present days. The set of groups consists of ALADI, CAN, SELA, OTCA, MERCOSUR, ACS-AEC, ALBA, UNASUR, CELAC, and the Pacific Alliance. The main goal of the thesis is to discover how did the power predominance of the United States contribute to the emergence of Latin American <b>integration</b> <b>groups.</b> The tested hypothesis is based on the concept of soft balancing, and assumes that the primary cause of emergence of Latin American <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> was the fear of the power predominance of the United States. The causes of emergence are always examined from the perspective of the historical context and the founding treaty. If needed, other relevant documents are examined as well.
