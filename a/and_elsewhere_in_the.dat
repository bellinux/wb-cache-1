5|$|The {{national}} debt increased {{as a result}} during Hamilton's service as Secretary of the Treasury, but the nation established its good credit. Many in the Congress <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government profited from trading in the debt paper which was assumed. Many of Washington's fellow Virginians and others were vexed by this, but he considered that they had adequate redress through their Congressional representatives.|$|E
5|$|According to Stephen Shaw, most of Mysteries of the Siths {{content was}} {{inspired}} by Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy of books; one of the game's protagonists, Mara Jade, was drawn directly from the novels. Though the expansion includes characters from the previous game, new dialogue was recorded for Mysteries of the Siths scenario, including recurring background characters who speak similar lines to their counterparts in Dark Forces II. Some dialogue was authentically translated into Huttese, a fictional language used in Return of the Jedi <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Star Wars universe. The Star Wars original soundtrack by John Williams is used in Mysteries of the Sith.|$|E

5|$|After Tonopah's gold strike waned, {{they moved}} in 1905 to Goldfield, Nevada, where his brother Virgil {{and his wife were}} living. Tex Rickard was also already there and had opened a second Northern Saloon. He hired Wyatt as a pit boss. Wyatt also staked mining claims just outside Death Valley <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mojave Desert. In 1906, he {{discovered}} several deposits of gold and copper near the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California, on the Colorado River and filed more than 100 mining claims near the Whipple Mountains. While in Los Angeles, they lived in at least nine small Los Angeles rentals as early as 1885 and as late as 1929, mostly in the summer.|$|E
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Muslims divided their forces: {{the bulk}} of the army, under Abbas, {{remained}} at Kamacha to continue the siege, while the remainder (an obviously exaggerated force of 50,000 according to the Zuqnin chronicler) was sent to raid further into Byzantine territory and pillage. The siege continued through the autumn, and the Arabs, who customarily did not take along many provisions, began suffering from lack of supplies. To solve their supply problems, they established a market for merchants from Mesopotamia <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, with winter approaching, Abbas was forced to raise the siege and retreat south, burning the large market-place to prevent it from falling into Byzantine hands.|$|E

5|$|During the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma), Scotland lay {{close to}} the equator. Several changes in sea level {{occurred}} and the coal deposits of Lanarkshire and West Lothian and limestones of Fife and Dunbar date from this time. There are oil shales near Bathgate around which the 19th-century oil-processing industry developed, <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Midland Valley there are ironstones and fire clay deposits that had significance in the early Industrial Revolution. Fossil Grove in Victoria Park, Glasgow contains the preserved remains of a Carboniferous forest. More volcanic activity formed Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh and the nearby Bathgate Hills.|$|E
5|$|Following Japanese {{victories}} in Malaya, Singapore <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific in late 1941 and early 1942, the whole 15th Battalion was mobilised for wartime service and tasked with undertaking defensive duties {{along the coast}} of south-east Queensland, based at Caloundra, due to concerns of a potential invasion. The invasion did not occur and, in mid-1942, the 15th Battalion was transferred to the 29th Brigade. Consisting of the 42nd and 47th Battalions, the 29th was part of the 5th Division, and was moved north to Townsville, where the battalion served as a garrison force.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{nutritional}} {{significance of these}} components is defined not only by their structure or macronutrient category, {{but also by the}} physiological role that each nutrient serves. As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated.|$|E

The genus was also recorded from Mongolia based on the description of I. orientalis, and in North America based on I. ottingeri from Utah. Another North American species, from South Dakota, once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis, has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Pongsona {{produced}} {{strong wind}} gusts peaking at 278km/h (173mph 1-min), which left the entire island of Guam without power and destroyed about 1,300houses. With strong building standards and experience from repeated typhoon strikes, {{there were no}} fatalities directly related to Pongsona, although there was one indirect death from flying glass. Damage on the island totaled over $700million (2002 USD, $ USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northern Mariana Islands, {{and as a result}} of its impact the name was retired.|$|E

5|$|While he was {{a student}} at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of angels and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar {{played a}} key role. The Ocean Convoy System adopted by Britain {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940 ran on two routes – an east–west route between the UK and North America, and a north–south route between the UK, Gibraltar and Freetown in British-ruled Sierra Leone. Even before the war, Gibraltar had been {{designated}} as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe. From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.|$|E
