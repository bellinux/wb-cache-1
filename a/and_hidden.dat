5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved <b>and</b> <b>hidden.</b>|$|E

In the order Poales, {{comprising}} grasses, rushes and sedges, flowers are either petal-less or have small, unshowy petals. Many Zingiberales species have brightly coloured and showy flowers. However, their apparent structure is misleading. For example, the six tepals of cannas are small <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> under expanded and brightly coloured stamens or staminodes which resemble petals and may be mistaken for them.|$|E

5|$|According to Twelvers, {{there is}} at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely {{appointed}} authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali {{was the first of}} the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.|$|E

5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{developed}} as a partnership between development studios 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, and Certain Affinity. 343 Industries, the Halo series' franchise overseers, approached Saber Interactive to develop a remake of the original Halo in time for its tenth anniversary. After considering whether to remake the game entirely or to adapt and add features to the existing PC version, Saber decided to use its game engine for reproducing the original's appearance and the original Halos engine for gameplay. A development tool for toggling between {{the old and new}} visuals became a game feature. Anniversarys enhancements include a complete high-definition visual overhaul, support for cooperative and multiplayer gameplay via the Xbox Live online service, new and remastered sound effects and music, and extras such as achievements <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> in-game collectibles. The game is the first in the series to include Kinect support.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{mackerel}} sharks, common threshers are aplacental viviparous. They {{give birth}} to litters of two to four (rarely six) pups in the eastern Pacific, and three to seven pups in the eastern Atlantic. They are believed to reproduce throughout their range; one known nursery area is the Southern California Bight. Breeding occurs in the summer, usually July or August, and parturition occurs from March to June following a gestation period of nine months. The developing embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs ovulated by the mother. The teeth of small embryos are peg-like and non-functional, being covered by a sheath of soft tissues. As the embryos mature, their series of teeth become progressively more like those of adults in shape, though they remain depressed <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> until shortly before birth.|$|E

5|$|Sonic 2 is {{believed}} to have been planned to have time travel aspects and was originally developed alongside Sonic CD as the same game, but Sonic CD eventually became its own game over time. A demonstration cartridge of Sonic 2 was stolen at a New York City toy show early in 1992, which was later attributed to a lack of security. The prototype ROM was rediscovered by a fan named Simon Wai on a Chinese website, and features playable sections of two cut levels from the final release of the game: Wood Zone <b>and</b> <b>Hidden</b> Palace Zone. Hidden Palace Zone was in the game from the start, but removed because of a lack of time and capacity.|$|E
