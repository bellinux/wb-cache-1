[...] Despite criticizing the premiere performance, David Allen of The New York Times also praised the piece, saying, [...] "It’s {{designed to be a}} fun concert opener, and it is." [...] Eric C.

After their loss at the Battle of Sacramento, the remaining Mexican soldiers retreated south, leaving the city to American occupation. Almost 300 Mexicans were killed in the battle, as well as almost 300 wounded. The Americans also confiscated large amounts of Mexican supplies and took 400 Mexican soldiers prisoners of war.

50|$|In 1857, James Buchanan became President, John B.

Also in 1857, {{in response to a}} citizen petition to establish a road connecting the East and West, Congress authorized a contract to survey a wagon road along the thirty-fifth parallel from Fort Defiance, New Mexico Territory, to the Colorado River on what is now the Arizona/California border. Former Navy lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale won the contract and learned afterward that Secretary Floyd required him to take twenty-five camels with him. The first part of the trip required traveling from Camp Verde through San Antonio, Texas; Fort Davis, Texas; El Paso, Texas; and Albuquerque, New Mexico Territory, to Fort Defiance. The expedition left San Antonio on June 25, 1857, and twenty-five pack camels <b>accompanied</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> of mule-drawn wagons. Each camel carried a load of 600 pounds. Beale wrote very favorably about the camels endurance and packing abilities. Among his comments was that he would rather have one camel than four mules. Beale's comments led Floyd to report to Congress that camels had proved to be successful as a mode of transportation and to recommend that Congress authorize the purchase of an additional one thousand animals. Congress did not act. Beale and his party reached the Colorado River on October 26, 1857. After crossing into California, Beale used the camels for various purposes on his ranch near Bakersfield. Beale offered to keep the Army's camels on his property, but Union Secretary of War Edwin Stanton rejected the offer.|$|R

50|$|In {{developing}} nations, programmes {{for children}} under three {{are more likely to}} be embedded in community-based programmes in which parents are endorsed as the primary teachers of young children and given support to fulfill that role.

They are often <b>accompanied</b> by <b>a</b> <b>training</b> manual and delivered through participatory workshops and other negotiated and community-based activities. Apart from strengthening the role of parents, these programmes respond to gaps that have persisted in the developing world despite global attention to ECCE; i.e. a focus on under threes and servicing the most marginalised children and families. While some incorporate weekly activities for older pre-school children - such as A New Day for Kids (ANDK) in Cambodia - they are not a substitute for a pre-school programme with <b>a</b> <b>trained</b> teacher who has the skills to plan and implement an effective curriculum.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a novel Kalman filtering {{approach to the}} suppression of narrowband interference from direct sequence spread spectrum communications systems. The algo-rithm {{is based on the}} digital phase-locked loop Kalman filter. Because the interference is assumed to be much stronger than either the signal or noise, the Kalman filter locks onto a function related to the interference. The net result is an estimate of the phase of the interference and its amplitude. The algorithm is characterized through computer simu-lation for the case of narrowband Gaussian noise interference. Examples of the phase-and envelope-tracking capabilties of the algorithm are presented, followed by bit error rate curves for interference bandwidths ranging from 0. 5 % to 5. 0 % of the chip rate of the spread spectrum signal. The report concludes with three adaptive architectures. The first is suitable for constant envelope interference; the second is a more general structure; and the third incorporates <b>a</b> decision-feedback structure <b>accompanied</b> with <b>a</b> <b>training</b> sequence.

He <b>accompanied</b> Dina, <b>a</b> <b>trained</b> ethnographer in her own right, who was also a visiting professor at the University of São Paulo, where they conducted research forays into the Mato Grosso and the Amazon Rainforest. They first studied the Guaycuru and Bororó Indian tribes, staying among them for a few days. In 1938, they returned for a second, more than half-year-long expedition to study the Nambikwara and Tupi-Kawahib societies. At this time, his wife suffered an eye infection that prevented her from completing the study, which he concluded. This experience cemented Lévi-Strauss's professional identity as an anthropologist. Edmund Leach suggests, from Lévi-Strauss's own accounts in Tristes Tropiques, that he could not have spent more than a few weeks in any one place and was never able to converse easily with any of his native informants in their native language, which is uncharacteristic of anthropological research methods of participatory interaction with subjects to gain a full understanding of a culture.|$|R
