He argued that the U.S. cannot return to a sustainable long-term fiscal path by either tax increases or cuts to non-healthcare cost categories alone; the U.S. must confront the rising healthcare costs driving expenditures in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.|$|E

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 625 p. P. Wachtel and J. Young, in 1987, found that deficit announcements affect interest rates. Their finding was based on 12 Congressional Budget Office deficit projections made over a six-year period. We showed their results to be dependent on only 1 of those 12 projections. We applied their methodology to 67 announcements taken from a study of over 300 deficit projections made in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Our results, made with more complete and accurate data, were even a stronger confirmation of the deficit effect. There are three problems with the regression methodology. First of all, we cannot test for temporary interest rate responses to deficit announcements. Second, the effect deficits on interest rates is fixed, i. e., structurally the same, throughout the time period. Third, we use data constructed from the WSJ to judge the change in market expectations of future deficits. Unfortunately, we can never be certain in what direction and to what extent the market was surprised by any announcement. We, therefore, used intervention analysis, which only made use of the timing of the announcement, and relied less on quantifying changes in market expectations. Intervention analysis also allowed us to differentiate between permanent and temporary announcement effects, and allowed these effects to change throughout the period studied. We assume the WSJ imparts information as to when the market received new information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit.</b> We found that interest rates respond to deficit announcements for between one and six days, before returning to their pre-announcement levels. Assuming the WSJ can tell us whether deficits are now higher or lower than the market had previously thought, we find that increases (decreases) in announced future deficits cause increases (decreases) in interest rates for about 85 % of the cases studied. Finally, we attempted a precise quantification of market expectations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit.</b> We found an announced 1 % increase in future deficits implied between a. 75 and 1. 75 basis point movement in interest rates...|$|E
40|$|Anosognosia is {{the denial}} of illness that {{may be seen in}} brain-injured patients. In general, denial of illness takes two forms. There may be verbal, {{explicit}} denial of illness, or there may be a lack of genuine concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit.</b> The verbal explicit denial is termed anosognosia, and indifference has been termed anoso-diaphoria (Critchley, 1953). Anosognosia was first described by Von Monakow (1885) and Anton (1896). However, it was Babinski (1914) who first coined this term. Whereas subsequently anosognosia has been noted by many other authors, these impor-tant signs have not been the prime target of intensive investigation as has been the case with aphasia, alexia, and amnesia. Despite the lack of interest, these behavioral aberrations are not trivial. Not only may anosognosia impair a patient's desire to seek medical aid, it may also impair his desire to seek reha-bilitation or to benefit from rehabilitation programs. Perhaps equally important, neuropsychological studies of anosognosia may help us understand not only why patients deny their illness but also myriad other behavioral anomalies such a...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental investigation of semileptonic B meson decays with a D and pi mesons {{in the final}} state: B- → D+pi -e-nu e. The data for the analysis were collected with the CLEO II detector at the Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring. The D meson is reconstructed in the D+ → K-pi+pi+ channel. The advantage of using this particular B decay mode {{is that there is}} no contribution from the D* due to phase space exclusion. This analysis is the first attempt at measuring non-resonant decays semileptonic decays with the CLEO II detector.

We present the full neutrino reconstruction method used in extracting this decay channel from our data sample. The main difficulty comes in understanding combinatoric backgrounds and we develop two methods to solve this problem. After extensive study, no statistically significant signal is observed. So an upper limit is extracted. The result we obtain is B (B- → D +pi-e- nue) < 0. 71 % at 90 % C. L.

40|$|Ronald Reagan had {{a clever}} joke: “I am not worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> ” he said, “It {{is big enough}} to take care of itself. ” A deficit occurs when a {{government}} spends more money then it brings in through taxation. The former US president said this in 1984. Since then, governments around the world have continued to borrow at ever increasing rates for public funding. Today, most governments have accumulated large and looming public debts. This leaves serious questions about the future. Firstly, who is to pay for the consequences of this debt? Depending on whether you were born after 1980, {{you may not want to}} hear the answer because it is you who will pay. Therefore, if you are not currently aware of this situation, you should become intimately involved as this will likely become the paramount political issue for the next 50 years. For instance, a recent working paper from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), which is known as a bank for the central banks of the world, is concerned that the European Union is in serious economic decline.

40|$|The deficit ofthe {{federal budget}} dominates {{attention}} of the public arena. The process began with President Carter’s ill-fated budget announcement in February 1980. The response of the bond market revealed {{at the time the}} public’s increasing doubts and apprehen-sions about the course of fiscal policy. Concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> approached a feverish pitch since 1982. Wall Street “economists,” senators, congressmen, pundits, and the media in general attribute to the budget deficit an array ofdismal effects. We heard in 1982 that the deficit would obstruct any incipient recovery. This prediction has been thoroughly falsified within the first four quarters of the upswing. So it was replaced by a new prediction. The deficit is supposed to halt the recovery in the near future and push the econ-omy into a new recession. The deficit threatens us moreover with higher inflation. A direct link seems to be asserted connecting infla-tion with the deficit. Lastly, the deficit seems to be the cause of double-digit nominal interest rates and the highest real rates since the 1930 s. Such interest rates produce apparently an “overvalued dollar ” encouraging imports and lowering our exports. This pattern reduces, so we hear, our welfare, as it lowers domestic employment and output below the otherwise achievable level. And the close interdependence of national capital markets transmits the effects of the “high interest policy ” pursued by the U. S. government, repre-sented by a “loose ” fiscal and “tight ” monetary policy, to all major nations. This vision offers European officials an excellent opportu-nity to blame U. S. policy for their economic troubles...|$|E

It could bring financial problems (if the retirement pension and pension income tax will stay at the same level as now) considering the expected trends in demography. Population projection was calculated using cohort component method (including migration). The threshold for the projection is year 2011, projection is calculated with 100 -year horizon. There were also calculated revenues and expenses of the pension system for each projected year. If the expected parameters of the projection will be realized, the deficit of pension system in the hundred year period will reach 9. 5 billion Kč (prices 2011). It represents the deficit 95. 3 milliard Kč each year in the average. To reduce the deficit it is possible to increase the pension tax paid by productive people. But it could also bring the decline of fertility, because lower income could make people decide to reduce number of children. It would deepen the problems in the pay-as-you-go system. The financial problem of pension system could be solved by taking the number of children raised into consideration of the pension system construction. It would eliminate the situation that it is economically more favourable to be childless during the life. It could also bring the fertility increase.

40|$|Doctor of EducationDepartment of Educational LeadershipKakali BhattacharyaThe {{purpose of}} this {{narrative}} case {{study was to explore}} the lived experiences of four Black undergraduate collegiate women leaders in higher education in their third and fourth years of study in a predominantly White Midwestern institution. This qualitative study was conducted with purposeful and criterion-based sampling. The participants selected needed to be at least a student leader in a registered student organization at one time during their collegiate career. Narrative inquiry was used to explore the participants’ racialized, gendered, and leadership identity development prior to college and throughout the course of their collegiate careers. The participants’ narratives were organized using Bildungsroman format, or as a coming of age story. Findings indicate that although the participants identified as Black women and Black women student leaders, their racialized identity was much more salient than their gendered identity. Therefore, outside of biological markers like menstruating and becoming mothers, they were not able to articulate the development of their intersectional identity. Findings also show the participants had a certain amount of self-confidence and critical self-awareness that allowed them to succeed even when faced with racialized and gendered discrimination as individuals and within their roles as student leaders. Such obstacles contributed to their ability to just do when faced with challenges regardless of the difficulty level of the challenge. The study raises implications about the multitude of support systems that Black women and girls have upon entering college. Another implication is the amount of invisible labor that Black women as collegiate leaders do in order to support their fellow peers. Finally, this study raises implications <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> narratives that depict Black women’s and girls’ stories within education.
