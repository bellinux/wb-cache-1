500|$|This {{transformation}} did {{not stop}} when the war ended; industrial production in the United States increased by 75% from 1865 to 1873, making the U.S. second only to Britain in manufacturing output. [...] Railroad construction made practical the exploitation of the trans-Mississippi West. Although the railroads helped fuel an economic boom, they proved a two-edged sword in the 1870s. [...] The 1872 [...] Crédit Mobilier scandal, over graft {{in the construction of}} the First Transcontinental Railroad, shook the Grant administration to its highest levels. [...] Railroad bankruptcies in the Panic of 1873 led to loss of jobs, wage cuts, and business failures. These disturbances culminated in the Railroad Strikes of 1877, when workers struck over cut wages and loss of jobs. The action originally started on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, but spread to other lines, including the Lake Shore, much to Hay's outrage. Federal troops were sent by President Rutherford B. Hayes to quash the strikes, at the cost of over 100 civilian lives. The Lake Shore dispute, unlike those elsewhere, was settled without violence. Hay remained angry, and blamed foreign agitators for the dispute. He condemned the [...] "unarmed rebellion of foreign workingmen, mostly Irish" [...] and informed Stone by letter, [...] "the very devil seems to have entered into the lower classes of working men <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of scoundrels to encourage them to all lengths." ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin Crust of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, calling Saw II a [...] "worthy follow-up to its grisly predecessor". He said {{the story was}} [...] "much more focused on an endgame than the original film. There are fewer credibility gaps <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of reversals to satisfy fans". He criticized the use of numerous flashbacks, saying that it [...] "rob us of the pleasure of actually remembering for ourselves". Laura Kern, writing for The New York Times, gave it a mixed review, saying that Bousman [...] "delivers similar hard-core, practically humorless frights and hair-raising tension, but only after getting past a shaky beginning that plays more like a forensics-themed television show than a scary movie" [...] and called Greutert's editing [...] "crafty". She called the sequel [...] "more trick than treat" [...] and that it [...] "doesn't really compare to its fine predecessor - though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself". [...] Empires Kim Newman gave the film three out of five stars. He said that the film improves upon Saw [...] "perverse fascination with Seven-style murders and brutally violent puzzles" [...] and that Jigsaw's intellectual games make [...] "Hannibal Lecter look like the compiler of The Suns quick crossword". He ended his reviews saying, [...] "Morally dubious it may be, but this gory melange of torture, terror and darkly humorous depravity appeals to the sick puppy within us all".|$|E

[...] The paper also scored more scoops than would be expected for its size and Stephen B. Shepard, dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, said that its effective coverage of local news earned it {{a place in the}} New York media world. Accordingly, it was known as a good place for young, ambitious, scrappy reporters to start out.|$|E
