50|$|Francesco Cirio (24 December 1836 - 9 January 1900) was an Italian businessman, and is {{credited}} with {{being one of the}} first in the world with developing the <b>appertization</b> technique in Italy. <b>Appertization</b> is the method of processing vegetables that leads to them being canned. The term comes from Nicolas Appert, who invented the first process for using heat to sterilize food.|$|E
40|$|Sterilization is {{the most}} {{relevant}} technique to guaranty safety of shelf-stable food products at ambient temperature. However, these thermal processes are often optimised to microbiological aspect and consequently are not without consequences on quality. Only few studies are focussed on the simultaneous management of these two aspects. Ascorbic acid is of interest due to its vulnerability and health benefits. Its degradation at sterilization temperature[br/] (> 100 °C) is poorly documented. The aim of this work is to model thermal processes in a risk/benefit approach, taking in account the nutritional aspect. Its final objective is to design new thermal processes which will be efficient to inactivate heat-resistant microorganisms, but not too drastic {{in order to maintain}} the maximum quality. Using a new instrumented reactor (thermoresistometer Mastia®), the behaviors of ascorbic acid food model solution at [br/] pH = 3. 5, in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, was measured. The obtained data have shown that degradation of ascorbic acid does not follow classical kinetics in conditions of <b>appertization,</b> it follows 0. 5 -order kinetics in aerobic conditions and zero-order kinetics in anaerobic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus cereus is an {{important}} food-borne pathogen. It is primarily of concern in mildly processed refrigerated foods with an extended shelf-life because it can form heat-resistant spores and because some spores can germinate and grow at temperatures as low as 4 &# 176;C. B. cereus can cause {{two different types of}} food-borne disease, designated as the emetic and diarrheal syndrome, respectively. The taxonomy of these bacteria is complex and has evolved considerably over the last decade. B. cereus is genetically much related to six other Bacillus species, and together, these are now referred to as B. cereus sensu lato. Based on molecular-genetic criteria, B. cereus sensu lato is subdivided into seven phylogenetic groups, but these do not exactly coincide with the original species delineation, and food-borne pathogens of B. cereus sensu stricto are distributed over at least four phylogenetic groups. Adding further to the complexity, food-borne pathogens are also increasingly found among some of the other species of B. cereus sensu lato. The advanced taxonomic insights together with the trend towards milder processing in the food industry call for more detailed studies on properties of spores from the different phylogenetic groups of B. cereus, and in particular on their resistance to traditional and novel food preservation methods. In the first part, the thermal inactivation kinetics of spores from 39 B. cereus sensu lato strains representing six phylogenetic groups (group II to VII) were studied at three or more different temperatures for five different holding times in potassium phosphate buffer. Survival curves and thermal death time curves were established and the kinetic parameters DT (decimal reduction time at temperature T) and z (temperature dependence of DT) were derived by linear regression. Most strains (38 / 39) had survival curves without a pronounced shoulder or tail, as reflected by linear regression coefficients R 2 generally higher than 0. 95. Generally, there was a considerable strain-to-strain variation in most phylogenetic groups. However, spores from psychrotolerant strains (group VI) showed the lowest heat resistance, while spores from thermotolerant strains (groups III and VII) were generally most heat resistant. Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between spore heat resistance and both minimal and maximal growth temperature of the strains. In contrast, the z value was negatively correlated with the minimal and maximal growth temperature. The data of phylogenetic group-specific heat resistance provided here will contribute to a refinement of the existing risk assessment models of B. cereus, taking into account group-specific D and z values, as well as novel insights in the pathogenicity of strains in each phylogenetic group. In the second part, since the susceptibility of B. cereus spores of different genetic groups to high pressure (HP) at moderate temperature has not been investigated, we studied the effect of HP treatment at 600  800 MPa, 20  60 &# 176;C, for 15 minholding time on spores from the same collection of B. cereus strains (except two strains) suspended in potassium phosphate buffer. The results revealed that HP treatment induced spore germination as well as spore inactivation. Both outcomes exhibited a considerable strain to strain variation, but no significant differences between different phylogenetic groups. Spore inactivation increased only marginally with pressure (from 600 to 800 MPa), and more strongly with temperature (from 20 to 60 &# 176;C). However, even under the most severe treatments, a 6 -D reduction  the commonly used standard for pasteurization of low acid foods with a long refrigerated shelf life could not be reached. High pressure treatment at elevated temperature (> 60 &# 176;C) (HPHT) has been shown to have potential for food <b>appertization</b> because it can effectively inactivate bacterial spores. However, little information is available about inactivation of B. cereus spores by this process. An interesting question, both from a basic scientific point of view and with an outlook on industrial applications, is whether and to what extent the HP component of HPHT processes contributes to spore inactivation. In the literature, both synergistic and antagonistic interactions between pressure and heat have been observed. Therefore, in the third part, the inactivation kinetics of spores from the heat resistant B. cereus strain F 4430 / 73 by high pressure treatment at elevated temperature (HPHT; 600 MPa, 60  100 &# 176;C) and by conventional thermal treatment (HT: 0. 1 MPa, 60  100 &# 176;C) were compared in MES buffer system. HT inactivation could be described by a first-order kinetic model, while HPHT inactivation showed a fast followed by a slow phase. Significant spore inactivation occurred during pressure come-up and equilibration time (2. 0 to 4. 1 log 10, from 70  100 &# 176;C). HPHT inactivation proceeded considerably faster than HT inactivation, even in the slow phase which also followed first-order kinetics. The D values in the slow phase at 0. 1 and 600 MPa also showed a distinct temperature dependency, with z values significantly lower in the case of HT compared to HPHT. These results indicate a strong synergistic effect of HP and HT on inactivation of B. cereus spores, similar to what most other studies have observed for spores from other bacteria. Finally, in a fourth part, the effect of HPHT treatment at different temperatures (600 MPa, 50  100 &# 176;C with 5 &# 176;C increments, 5 min holding time) on the release of dipicolinic acid from the spores and on the loss of spore refractility was investigated, both in the absence and {{in the presence of the}} natural antimicrobial carvacrol. The objective here was to provide mechanistic insights in the impact of HPHT on B. cereus spores, but also to explore the potential of this natural antimicrobial to improve the efficacy of HPHT treatment in a hurdle-type approach. Spore inactivation by HPHT was less than about 1 log 10 at 50 to 70 &# 176;C, but gradually increased at highertemperatures up to about 5 log 10 at 100 &# 176;C. DPA release and loss of spore refractility in the spore population were higher at moderate (&# 8804; 65 &# 176;C) than at high (&# 8805; 70 &# 176;C) treatment temperatures, and we propose that moderate conditions induced the normal physiological pathway of spore germination resulting in fully hydrated spores, while at higher temperatures this pathway was suppressed and replaced by another mechanism of pressure-induced dipicolinic acid (DPA) release that results only in partial spore rehydration, probably because spore cortex hydrolysis is inhibited. Remarkably, carvacrol strongly suppressed DPA release and spore rehydration during HPHT treatment at &# 8805; 65 &# 176;C and also partly inhibited DPA release at &# 8805; 65 &# 176;C. Concomitantly, HPHT spore inactivation was reduced by carvacrol at 65  90 &# 176;C but unaffected at 95  100 &# 176;C. In summary, this work provides novel information on the inactivation of B. cereus spores that will be useful to optimize processing of foods by heat and high pressure treatment, Firstly, we described the variation in resistance of different B. cereus spores belonging to different phylogenetic groups towards heat and high pressure at moderate temperature. Secondly, we provide detailed kinetic analysis of the HPHT inactivation of the spores of a heat-resistant B. cereus strain, showing a strongly synergistic interaction of heat and pressure. The addition of carvacrol does not increase the efficacy of spore inactivation by HPHT treatment and, at 65  90 &# 176;C, even decreases the efficacy. Thirdly, based on analysis of spore refractility and DPA release, we propose that HP induces the normal physiological pathway of spore germination up to about 65 &# 176;C, while at higher temperatures this pathway is suppressed and replaced by another mechanism of pressure-induced DPA release. status: publishe...|$|E
