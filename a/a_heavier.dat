5|$|Behind the Devil's Back (2015) {{was noted}} for <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> use of {{electronics}} {{than in the}} past, said by some critics to be reminiscent of Westaway and Haigh's side project Gunship. The Edge and Rocksins.com reviewers remarked in particular the album's 1980s-style synths, while NE:MM writer David Smith drew comparisons to American alternative rock supergroup Angels & Airwaves.|$|E
5|$|Helium, {{mixed with}} <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> gas such as xenon, {{is useful for}} thermoacoustic {{refrigeration}} due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number. The inertness of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.|$|E
5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems {{one of the}} stars can lose mass to <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E
5000|$|In Newfoundland, popular {{folklore}} {{maintains that}} <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> crop of fruit means a hard or difficult winter. Similarly, in Finland and Sweden, {{the number of}} fruit on the trees {{was used as a}} predictor of the snow cover during winter, but here the belief was that the rowan [...] "will not bear <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> load of fruit and <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> load of snow in the same year", that is, <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> fruit crop predicted a winter with little snow.|$|R

40|$|The {{cross section}} of high-energy $e^+e^-$ pair {{production}} by <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> charged particle in the atomic field is investigated in detail. We {{take into account the}} interaction with the atomic field of $e^+e^-$ pair and <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> particle as well. The calculation is performed exactly in the parameters of the atomic field. It is shown that, in contrast to the commonly accepted point of view, the cross section differential with respect to the final momentum of <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> particle is strongly affected by the interaction of <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> particle with the atomic field. However, the cross section integrated over the final momentum of <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> particle is independent of this interaction. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
5|$|The navies of Britain and France in 1794 were at very {{different}} stages of development. Although the British fleet was numerically superior, the French ships were larger and stronger, and carried <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> weight of shot. The largest French ships were three-decker first rates, carrying 110 or 120 guns, against 100 guns on the largest British vessels.|$|E

The {{origin of}} {{neutrino}} mass is usually {{attributed to a}} seesaw mechanism, either through <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> Majorana fermion singlet (version 1) or <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> scalar triplet (version 2).

5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} nobelium behaves as <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table. The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in aqueous solution. Before nobelium's discovery, {{it was predicted that}} it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state is much more stable than the +3 state in aqueous solution {{and it is difficult to}} keep nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E

5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although others argue for the Sarmatians. By the time of Darius (558486 BC), Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured, and selectively bred <b>a</b> <b>heavier,</b> more muscled horse to carry the additional weight. The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and weaponry used {{from the time of the}} Persians up until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> analog of titanium and zirconium. At {{the time of his}} formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E
5|$|In {{recording}} Revelation, Third Day {{aimed to}} produce a southern rock album while being more creative musically; the band felt the end result was their best record to date. As a whole, the album is noted as adopting <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> and edgier rock sound than Third Day's previous adult contemporary-projects such as Wherever You Are (2005), while the album's lyrics reflect Christian themes. The album features guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Lacey Mosley of alternative metal band Flyleaf, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{began to}} build armored cruisers to support the battle fleet and to perform some of the roles then {{reserved}} only for battleships. The first vessel, , was built as an enlarged version of the protected cruiser , with a more powerful armament and heavier armor. She was followed by an improved cruiser, , which {{provided the basis for}} an even larger ship, which was named Sankt Georg. Each iteration carried <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> armament and had a higher top speed than the preceding design.|$|E
5|$|IÃ©na was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy. The ship's keel {{was laid}} in 1898 {{and she was}} completed four years later. Her design {{was derived from the}} preceding s with <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> secondary battery and thicker armour. She retained the tumblehome characteristic of all large French warships of this period that caused stability issues. Upon completion Iena was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and remained there for the duration of her career. She participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers and made many visits to French ports in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair eschewed {{the sound}} and lyrical content of her debut album Perfectionist (2011) in favour of <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> atmosphere, driven by strong {{percussion}} and electric guitars. The lyrics, largely co-written by Sinclair and Bhasker, explore the former's problematic childhood and adolescence. Accompanying the album, its cover art was designed by Sinclair and symbolizes the album's main themes. Upon release, music critics commended the album's cohesion, and perceived an evolution in Sinclair' songwriting.|$|E
