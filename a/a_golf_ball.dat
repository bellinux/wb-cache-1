Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads. It {{has been reported}} from Pinus patula plantations in Tamil Nadu, India. The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball</b> when viewed from a distance.|$|E

5|$|The {{story that}} the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball</b> is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's {{meteoric}} rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol {{at the height of}} the Great Depression.|$|E

Lyle is a somewhat comic character often having bad luck, whether he misses out on a potential relationship or gets hit by <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball.</b> The writers created a running joke for the character, where he gets wet in almost every episode, from falling in swimming pools to landing in dykes.|$|E

After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball,</b> Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E
5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball.</b> A water tank, {{mounted on a}} curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt to hit it again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, he hit his first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E

25|$|IBM and Remington Rand {{electric}} typewriters {{were the}} leading models until IBM introduced the IBM Selectric typewriter in 1961, which replaced the typebars with a spherical element (or typeball) slightly smaller than <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball,</b> with reverse-image letters molded into its surface. The Selectric used {{a system of}} latches, metal tapes, and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate {{the ball into the}} correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen. The typeball moved laterally in front of the paper, instead of the previous designs using a platen-carrying carriage moving the paper across a stationary print position.|$|E
25|$|Women {{moving out}} of the Victorian era and into the Edwardian era were {{starting}} to dress for a more active lifestyle. The evolving times brought a new fashion trend known as the “New Woman”. Active lives required less constricting clothing and required simpler and more streamlined clothing. The new woman was highly encouraged by women’s suffrage. Women that identified with this fashion movement were the type of women that were beginning to venture out of the domestic circle that they were told to maintain and beginning to pursue higher education, office jobs, and participating in active outdoor sports. The new and improved fashions allowed for women to swing a tennis racket, whack <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball,</b> but the ideas of “proper” feminine attire reduced the progress of more practical sportswear.|$|E

25|$|In reverse {{swing the}} seam is angled {{in the same}} way as in {{conventional}} swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball.</b> In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back – this enables the golf ball to travel farther.|$|E

As soon as she {{and her friends}} see them, black-haired Lavigne hits her in the head with <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball,</b> {{resulting}} in the red-haired girl splashing down into the water. Her boyfriend tries to grab her hand but misses, to black-haired Lavigne's amusement. Finally, the man, who eventually develops feelings for black-haired Lavigne, is seen waiting for her. As she comes toward him, they soon hold hands together, but red-haired girl sees this and attempts to seize black-haired Lavigne. But black-haired Lavigne and the man manage to dodge her, and in her attempt to win back her boyfriend, she tumbles all the way down and lands in a portable toilet ahead, where she gives a look of desperation towards the camera, showing she has failed to do so, and signalling that black-haired Lavigne has finally won the man's affections. Blonde Lavigne then takes her new boyfriend into a bathroom stall and slightly opens the door after a moment and pumps her arm in victory.|$|E

Immediately after the show Castillo took a cab to nearby Cedars Sinai Hospital where he collapsed as he was being admitted. The doctors discovered a duodenal ulcer that had ruptured his stomach and performed emergency surgery that saved Castillo’s life. While taking time off from Mötley Crüe to recover from his surgery, he discovered a small lump on his jaw and a month later, after it had grown to roughly the size of <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>ball,</b> he sought treatment and was diagnosed with Squamous cell Carcinoma, a common form of cancer that is not usually fatal if it is discovered early but can spread rapidly if left untreated.

Lydia then became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to one. She became the second member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
