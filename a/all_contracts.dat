The design of the IXA submarines was derived from the German Type IA submarine. <b>All</b> <b>contracts</b> for the construction of the submarines were awarded to DeSchiMAG AG Weser, Bremen. The first U-boat to be laid down in the Bremen ship yards was U-37, whose keel was laid down on 15 March 1937. The last U-boat to be laid down was , whose construction began on 15 September 1937. By November 1939, all eight submarines had been fully constructed and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine.|$|E

However, the council can override the mayor's veto with a nine out of thirteen member vote, and the city budget must be approved and can be changed by a simple majority vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{announcing his}} {{campaign}} for governor, Wolf submitted an inquiry to the Massachusetts Ethics Commission as a precaution {{there would be no}} conflict of interest. However, on August 2 the Commission ruled that Wolf's 23% ownership of the company did create a conflict because Cape Air had ongoing contracts with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort); Wolf was instructed he would either need to resign from the Senate and discontinue his campaign from Governor, divest his stake in Cape Air, or cancel <b>all</b> <b>contracts</b> between Cape Air and MassPort. In a statement to supporters, explaining that departing his company or canceling contacts would put his employees' jobs at risk, he announced that he would suspend his campaign, and resign from the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The City of Jersey City is {{organized}} as a mayor–council {{form of government}} under the Optional Municipal Charter Law.

Under state law, the mayor has the duty to enforce the charter and ordinances of the city, and all applicable state laws; report annually to the council and the public {{on the state of the}} city; supervise and control all departments of the government; prepare and submit to the council annual operating and capital budgets; supervise all city property, institutions and agencies; sign <b>all</b> <b>contracts</b> and bonds requiring the approval of the city; negotiate all contracts; and serve as a member, either voting or ex-officio, of all appointive bodies.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of 1922, Forbes had met Elias Mortimer, agent for the Thompson-Black Construction Company of St. Louis, which wanted to construct the hospitals. The two men became close, and Mortimer paid for Forbes' travels through the West, looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans. Forbes was also friendly with Charles F. Hurley, owner of the Hurley-Mason Construction Company of Washington state. Harding had ordered that <b>all</b> <b>contracts</b> be pursuant to public notice, but the three worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided three ways. Some of the money went to the bureau's chief counsel, Charles F. Cramer. Forbes defrauded the government in this hospital construction, increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed. A tenth of the inflated construction billings was {{set aside for the}} conspirators, with Forbes receiving a third of the take. The graft then spread to land acquisition, with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract – that was worth less than $20,000 – for $105,000. At least $25,000 of the resulting financial excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer.|$|E

30|$|For {{volatility}} modeling, {{we first}} considered the graphical representation of volatility clustering {{along with the}} descriptive statistics for <b>all</b> <b>contract</b> cycles of each commodity future. We, then, introduced a correlogram to check for serial correlation in the residuals, and, finally, the ARCH-LM test was conducted to check {{for the presence of}} an ARCH effect. <b>All</b> <b>contract</b> cycles of potato futures did not show any volatility clustering, and the result of the ARCH-LM test ruled out any ARCH effects in the daily return series. However, for <b>all</b> types of <b>contract</b> cycles of gold futures, we found unambiguous volatility clustering, and the ARCH-LM test results also suggested the presence of an ARCH effect. These results are in line with the findings of Kumar and Singh (2008) for gold futures.|$|R

25|$|The Court {{said that}} the {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements associated with the language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights.

Contracts would thus become massive, and yet there would be no real benefit from the increase in mass.
