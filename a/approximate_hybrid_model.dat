40|$|We define an equity-interest rate {{hybrid model}} in which the equity part {{is driven by the}} Heston {{stochastic}} volatility [Hes 93], and the interest rate (IR) is generated by the displaced-diffusion stochastic volatility Libor Market Model [AA 02]. We assume a non-zero correlation between the main processes. By an appropriate change of measure the dimension of the corresponding pricing PDE can be greatly reduced. We place by a number of approximations the model in the class of affine processes [DPS 00], for which we then provide the corresponding forward characteristic function. We discuss in detail the accuracy of the approximations and the efficient calibration. Finally, by experiments, we show the effect of the correlations and interest rate smile/skew on typical equity-interest rate hybrid product prices.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{process plants}} are {{nonlinear}} and together with this {{they include a}} combination of continuous valued and logical control inputs and subsystems. This paper attempts to explore the potential of hybrid model predictive control (MPC) to cope with both of these problems. It uses a laboratory scale plant that was designed for experiments with hybrid systems. This plant has both continuous and logical control inputs and it is considerably nonlinear. An <b>approximate</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>model</b> of the plant {{in the form of}} a piecewise affine (PWA) system is developed and evaluated in the first part of the paper. After that a hybrid MPC based on PWA model is applied to the control of the plant. While designing hybrid MPC and evaluating its performance, there is a special focus on the following question. Logical and continuous control systems are usually designed separately. This may result in unforeseen interactions between logical and continuous control and in the deterioration of the control performance. However, hybrid MPC is based on hybrid model that captures both logical and continuous dynamics in one unified framework. Hence it can reasonably be expected that hybrid MPC can avoid undesirable interactions and possibly also make use of these interactions in a positive way (e. g. to speed up the control response using logical inputs). Control results obtained with hybrid MPC are indeed fairly good and they show clear improvement over the results achieved with separate design of logical and continuous control...|$|E

To investigate the modeling techniques, ethanol fermentation with Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and recombinant Zymomonas mobilis and finally gluconic acid fermentation with Pseudomonas ovalis processes are chosen. Model equations of these applications are obtained from literature. Numeric solutions are done in Matlab by using ODE solver. For neural network modeling a part of the numerical data is used for training of the network. In <b>hybrid</b> <b>modeling</b> technique, model equations which are obtained from literature are first linearized then to constitute the <b>hybrid</b> <b>model</b> linearized solution results are subtracted from numerical results and obtained values are taken as nonlinear part of the process.

In this paper, travelling wave properties of <b>hybrid</b> <b>models</b> of bacterial chemo-taxis are investigated. Bacteria are modelled using an agent-based (individual-based) approach with internal dynamics describing signal transduction. In ad-dition to the chemotactic behaviour of the bacteria, the individual-based model also includes cell proliferation and death. Cells consume the extracellular nu-trient field (chemoattractant) which is modelled using a partial differential equation. Mesoscopic and macroscopic equations representing the behaviour of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>model</b> are derived {{and the existence}} of travelling wave solutions for these models is established.

To characterize network behavior, these models use averaging to continuously approximate discrete variables such as congestion window and queue size.

The proposed <b>hybrid</b> systems <b>modeling</b> framework fills the gap between packet-level and fluid-based models: by averaging discrete variables over a very short time scale (on the order of a round-trip time), our models are able to capture the dynamics of transient phenomena fairly accurately.
