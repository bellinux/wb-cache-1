Autorica pruža cjelovit prikaz predloženih promjena kojima se nastoji osigurati naknada štete u slučaju većih ekoloških katastrofa te ocijeniti izglede za njihovo stupanje na snagu.

The author discusses in particular the adoption <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> compensation in the 1992 Civil Liability Convention and 1992 Fund Convention and proposed third-tier compensation scheme.

Arguments over {{the population at}} which parish councils should be established continued to be made, with <b>amendments</b> proposing <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> 100, 200, 500, 600 and 1,000. The figure finally reverted to the government figure of 200. Major Leonard Darwin, Liberal Unionist MP for Lichfield unsuccessfully introduced an amendment to create parish councils in urban districts containing more than one parish. After 34 days of debate, the Commons completed its consideration of the bill on 8 January 1894. The passage of the bill through the House of Lords was completed on 12 February. The Lords made two amendments to the bill, the first raised the population for forming a parish council {{back to the original}} figure of 300, the second amendment provided that parochial charities would only transfer to the administration of a parish council with the approval of the Charity Commissioners. Both were agreed to. The act received the royal assent on 5 March 1894.|$|R
5000|$|It was contended {{on behalf}} of the {{plaintiff}} that any <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> the Treaties establishing the Communities made after 1 January 1973, when Ireland joined those Communities would require a further <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution. It was contended {{on behalf of}} the defendants that the authorisation contained in the first sentence of Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 was to join Communities which were established by Treaties as dynamic and developing entities and that it should be interpreted as authorising the State to participate in and agree to <b>amendments</b> <b>of</b> the Treaties which are within the original scope and objectives of the Treaties. It is the opinion of the Court that the first sentence in Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 of the Constitution must be construed as an authorisation given to the State not only to join the Communities as they stood in 1973, but also to join in <b>amendments</b> <b>of</b> the Treaties so long as such amendments do not alter the essential scope or objectives of the Communities. To hold that the first sentence of Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 does not authorise any form <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> to the Treaties after 1973 without a further <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution would be too narrow a construction; to construe it as an open-ended authority to agree, without further <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution, to any <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> the Treaties would be too broad.
