2500|$|As a discipline, {{art history}} is {{distinguished}} from art criticism, which {{is concerned with}} establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and art theory or [...] "philosophy of art", which {{is concerned with the}} fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is aesthetics, which includes investigating the enigma of the sublime and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses historical method to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, <b>and</b> <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.|$|E

60|$|At {{this point}} in the nineteenth century the sermon was the sole reason for churchgoing amongst a vast body of {{religious}} people.

60|$|Now, {{what sort}} of a man was this on whom the Lord Jesus Christ put so great an honour? If we say that St. Peter was nothing in himself; that all the {{goodness}} and worth in him was given him by Jesus Christ, then we must ask, {{what sort of}} goodness, what sort of worth, did the Lord give St. Peter to make him fit for so great an office? <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> use Christ's gifts? For, mind, he might have used them wrongly, as well as rightly; and the greater gifts he had, the more harm {{he would have done}} if he had used them ill.

Why <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> become otherwise? This question is not only of importance in itself, as helping to explain the origin and source of man's supremacy in nature--his tool-using faculty--but it is also of interest from the light it casts on that fallacy of poor Charles Reade's already alluded to--that we ought all of us in this respect to hark back to the condition of savages. I think when we have seen the reasons which make civilised man now right-handed, we shall also see why it would be highly undesirable for him to return, after so many ages of practice, to the condition of his undeveloped stone-age ancestors.|$|E

He felt as if he should cast away his last anchor, and drift helplessly down into utter shame and ruin.

60|$|In {{the fall}} of 1898, Steve and I poled up the Yukon on the last water, bound for Stewart River. We took the dogs along, all except Spot. We figured we'd been feeding him long enough. He'd cost us more time and trouble and money and grub than we'd got by selling him on the Chilcoot--especially grub. So Steve and I tied him down in the cabin and pulled our freight. We camped {{that night at the}} mouth of Indian River, and Steve and I were pretty facetious over having shaken him. Steve was a funny fellow, and I was just sitting up in the {{blankets}} and laughing when a tornado hit camp. The way that Spot walked into those dogs and gave them what-for was hair-raising. Now how did he get loose? It's up to you. I haven't any theory. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> get across the Klondike River? That's another facer. And anyway, how did he know we had gone up the Yukon? You see, we went by water, and he couldn't smell our tracks. Steve and I began to get superstitious about that dog. He got on our nerves, too; and, between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.|$|E
6000|$|I do, then, declare my conviction, {{and wish}} it may stand {{recorded}} to posterity, that {{there never was}} a bad man that had ability for good service. It is not in the nature of such men; their minds are so distorted to selfish purposes, to knavish, artificial, and crafty means of accomplishing those selfish ends, that, if put to any good service, they are poor, dull, helpless. Their natural faculties never have that direction; they are paralytic on that side; the muscles, if I may use the expression, that ought to move it, are all dead. They know nothing, but how to pursue selfish ends by wicked and indirect means. No man ever knowingly employed a bad man on account of his abilities, but for evil ends. Mr. Hastings knew this man to be bad; all the world knew him to be bad; <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> employ him? In such a manner as that he might be controlled by others?
