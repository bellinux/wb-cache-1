50|$|Dutch auctions are {{the reverse}} of English auctions whereby the price begins high and is {{systematically}} lowered until a buyer accepts the price.

However, with actual on-line Dutch auctions where the price is descending, it was found that auctions have on average a 30% higher ending price than first-price auctions with speculation pointing to bidder impatience or the effect of endogenous entry on the Dutch auction.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{implementation}} of a distributed service for performing sealed-bid <b>auctions.</b> This <b>service</b> provides an interface by which clients, or "bidders", can issue secret bids to the service for an advertised auction. Once the bidding period has ended, the <b>auction</b> <b>service</b> opens the bids, determines the winning bid, and provides the winning bidder with a ticket for claiming the item bid upon. Using novel cryptographic techniques, the service is constructed to provide strong protection for both the auction house and correct bidders, despite the malicious behavior of any number of bidders and fewer {{than one-third of the}} servers comprising the <b>auction</b> <b>service.</b> Specifically, it is guaranteed that (i) bids of correct bidders are not revealed until after the bidding period has ended, (ii) the auction house collects payment for the winning bid, (iii) losing bidders forfeit no money, and (iv) only the winning bidder can collect the item bid upon.

40|$|The {{increased}} attention of E-auction services in mobile E-commerce demands {{an approach to}} identify the relevant auctions as per the bidder’s requirements so as to increase the bidder satisfaction level and auction winning probability. In this paper, we propose an intelligent agent based model to identify the relevant set of auctions for a mobile bidder based on the bidder’s requirements, preferences and constraints from a set of active auctions available in the active <b>auction</b> <b>service</b> directory in regional gateway connected to Internet. The agent functions are based on Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture and are capable of taking dynamic decisions to search the matching auctions for the products requested by the bidder in the bidder belief set located in the bidder’s mobile device and/or in the case base of the regional gateway. If matching auctions are not found in either of them, BDI agent searches them in the active <b>auction</b> <b>service</b> directory and computes the relevance factor based on the parameters in the bidder’s requirements for all the matching active auctions and clusters into relevant (or potential) and non relevant auctions. The model is simulated to test the performance measures like availability of relevant auctions, average response time, and probability of winning auctions with better satisfaction. The proposed model is also compared with advertisement based <b>auction</b> <b>service</b> discovery model to show its effectiveness...|$|R
