40|$|In the Bayer {{process for}} <b>refining</b> <b>alumina,</b> lime (either {{quicklime}} or slaked lime) {{is added to}} the process liquor to precipitate calcium carbonate and restore alkalinity to the solution. Lime also precipitates calcium aluminate in an unwanted side reaction which consumes both lime and aluminate. The work described in this paper was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of this precipitation reaction about which little is known. The kinetics of the reaction between quicklime powder and aluminate in solution were studied as a function of stirring, reaction temperature, lime charge and sodium hydroxide concentration. It was concluded that the reaction was diffusion controlled, at least in the early stages. The second part of this study was directed towards assessing the effect of the calcium aluminate deposit on the lime slaking reaction. The kinetics of this reaction were investigated as a function of aluminate concentration, stirring, temperature and lime charge. The kinetic measurements were complemented by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the calcium aluminate deposit progressively shuts down the lime slaking reaction. If the aluminate concentration in solution is high enough, the lime particles are encapsulated by calcium aluminate and dissolution ceases...|$|R
5000|$|The cement {{is made by}} fusing {{together}} a mixture of a calcium-bearing material (normally calcium oxide from limestone) and an aluminium-bearing material (normally bauxite for general purposes, or <b>refined</b> <b>alumina</b> for white and refractory cements). The liquified mixture cools to a vesicular, basalt-like clinker which is ground alone to produce the finished product. Because complete melting usually takes place, raw materials in lump-form can be used. A typical kiln arrangement comprises a reverberatory furnace provided with a shaft preheater in which the hot exhaust gases pass upward as the lump raw material mix passes downward. The preheater recuperates most of the heat in the combustion gases, dehydrates and de-hydroxylates the bauxite and de-carbonates the limestone. The calcined material drops into the [...] "cool end" [...] of the melt bath. The melt overflows the hot end of the furnace into molds in which it cools and solidifies. The system is fired with pulverized coal or oil. The cooled clinker ingots are crushed and ground in a ball-mill. In the case of high-alumina refractory cements, where the mix only sinters, a rotary kiln can be used.|$|R

40|$|Mining {{and mineral}} {{processing}} industries have generated {{a large amount}} of polymineral wastes, causing the destruction and degradation of huge areas of landscapes at extensive geographical locations. Rehabilitation of these mine waste landscapes is critical to social and economic sustainability of mining and metallurgy operations, such as alumina refineries. The Bayer process to <b>refine</b> <b>alumina</b> generates large amounts of highly alkaline bauxite residues which are hazardous to plant growth. Innovative methodologies are urgently needed to address this economic and environmental challenge, one of which is soil formation from bauxite residues. Mineral weathering appears the prerequisite to the initiation of soil formation and development of functional soil properties in BRDAs. The present study investigated natural changes of mineralogy, zeta potential, isoelectric point, surface protonation, active alkaline groups and associated implications for rehabilitation of the BRDA. Alkaline calcite, hydrogarnet and sodalite minerals were slowly transformed or dissolved with declining levels over weathering time. Amorphous and semi-amorphous minerals also decreased with a corresponding decrease in BET and sorption sites. Zeta potential curve of fresh residue had steeper slope, than those of aged residues. The IEP of fresh residue was significantly higher, but those of aged residues were significantly lower, with a significant decrease of IEP with increasing time. These attributes in mineralogy and electrochemical characteristics such as transformation of alkaline minerals, and decreases of surface protonation and active alkaline groups, may be used to help the assessment of soil formation status in the bauxite residues of different age and associated rehabilitation requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} <b>alumina</b> {{production}} involves <b>refining</b> of bauxite ore into tri-hydrated alumina (Al 2 O 3, 3 H 2 O) by chemical method followed by process of calcinations. This method possesses {{various kinds of}} dust hazards in its work environment amongst the people involved. Poor health of industrial employees in India is due to its occupational environment (Park &#x 0026; Park, 1970), which {{is a major concern}} now-a-days. Attempts have been made to recognize the potential sources of airborne dust and to assess the dust load upon exposed workers at different work sites of alumina plants by comparing the observations with the standard values called &#x 2032;Threshold Limit Values&#x 2032; (T. L. V.) assigned by the international body ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental and Industrial Hygienists), USA, and also permissible exposure limit values prescribed in the second schedule Section F of Factories Act (Amendment), 1987. Alumina plant operation includes various physical operations like crushing, grinding, conveying, loading, transporting, etc., which generate finer particles. It can cause serious health hazards on inhalation, depending upon its size, shape, constituents and duration of exposure. Out of all these parameters, concentration of respirable fraction of airborne dust (0. 5 to 5. 0 micron size) and its free silica content have been reported to cause lung fibrosis as well as occupational disorders. In the present study, {{attempts have been made to}} make a survey of respirable fraction of the airborne dust (that remains suspended in air for quite an appreciable time) associated with various operations according to job profiles.

40|$|In the Bayer {{process for}} <b>refining</b> <b>alumina,</b> lime (either {{quicklime}} or slaked lime) {{is added to}} the process liquor to precipitate calcium carbonate and restore alkalinity to the solution. The work described in this paper was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of this precipitation reaction about which surprisingly little is known. In {{the first part of the}} study, the composition of calcium oxide disks after reacting with sodium carbonate solutions was examined by XRD and TGA. TGA results show that the amount of calcium carbonate formed on the disks increases with sodium carbonate concentration but the amount of calcium hydroxide reaches a minimum at a solution concentration of about 0. 05 M carbonate and then increases at higher carbonate concentrations. The kinetics of the formation of calcium carbonate were also followed using HPLC to monitor the change in bulk carbonate concentration due to the reaction of powdered lime in sodium carbonate solutions. The effect of the agitation speed and temperature on the reaction rate indicates that the formation of calcium carbonate is a diffusion-controlled process. To account for these findings it is suggested that at concentrations above 0. 05 M carbonate a more porous heterogeneous CaCO 3 –Ca(OH) 2 layer appears owing to direct attack on the surface by carbonate before a layer of calcium hydroxide can form. Scanning electron micrographs of disks after reaction in carbonate solutions support this suggestion. The second part of this study deals with the dissolution of lime in the presence of sodium carbonate. The concentration of Ca 2 + from dissolution of calcium hydroxide disks was determined by AAS. It was found that the dissolution process is slowed by the formation of calcium carbonate, and is diffusion controlled. The reaction of powdered calcium oxide in the sodium carbonate solution was followed by calorimetry. It was found that the relationship between the extent of dissolution and the carbonate concentration is similar to that obtained by TGA for the formation of calcium carbonate, suggesting the same mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Low {{temperature}} (165 &deg;C) Wet Oxidation (WO) and Catalytic Wet Oxidation (CWO) of 12 {{organic compounds}} {{has been studied}} in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution (simulating that encountered in the Bayer process used to <b>refine</b> <b>alumina)</b> for the first time. Most (11 out of 12) of the 12 organic compounds studied (formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids) {{have been identified in}} various worldwide Bayer liquors. The various aspects of WO and CWO studied for each of the above-mentioned compounds were as follows; -Extent of complete oxidation to carbonate (i. e. extent of removal of organic compound) -Extent of overall oxidation (i. e. extent of complete oxidation and partial oxidation to stable products) -The product(s) formed from partial (incomplete) oxidation -The reaction mechanism occurring -Why certain compounds undergo low temperature WO and/or CWO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution -The ability of various transition metal oxides to catalyse the WO of the selected organic compounds Of the 12 organic compounds studied only six (formic, malonic, citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids) underwent appreciable (&gt; 2 % overall oxidation) WO in isolation under the reaction conditions used (4. 4 - 7. 0 M NaOH, 165 &deg;C, 500 kPa Po₂, 2 hours). Each of these six compounds underwent some complete oxidation and therefore can be partly removed from highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution using low temperature WO. The order of extent of complete oxidation determined was as follows tartaric&gt; citric&gt; malonic&gt; formic&gt; lactic&gt; malic. All of these compounds also underwent some partial oxidation under the reaction conditions used, excluding formic acid, which only underwent complete oxidation. Oxalic acid was a major product of partial oxidation of all of the above-mentioned compounds (excluding formic acid), while acetic acid was a major product of partial oxidation of citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids. The WO of formic, malonic, citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids varied considerably with NaOH concentration over the NaOH concentration range studied (4. 4 - 7. 0 M). The extent of overall oxidation undergone by each of these compounds increased significantly with increasing NaOH concentration. All of the compounds that underwent appreciable WO under the reaction conditions studied contained hydrogen(s) significantly more acidic then the compounds that did not undergo appreciable WO, thus indicating that only organic compounds that contain acidic (albeit weakly acidic) hydrogens undergo low temperature (165 &deg;C) WO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution. Two different reaction mechanisms were identified to occur during low temperature WO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution. Malonic and formic acids underwent WO predominantly via a free radical based reaction mechanism, while citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids underwent WO predominantly via an ionic based reaction mechanism. The six organic compounds that did not undergo appreciable WO in isolation (acetic, propionic, butyric, oxalic, succinic and glutaric acids) all underwent appreciable WO when in the presence of malonic acid undergoing low temperature WO. Hence, low temperature WO of all of the above-mentioned compounds can be initiated by free radical intermediates produced by malonic acid undergoing WO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution. The ability of several transition metal oxides to catalyse the WO of the chosen 12 organic compounds was investigated. Of the transition metal oxides studied CuO was clearly the most active. Five of the organic compounds studied (malonic, citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids) were catalytically wet oxidised by CuO in highly alkaline, high ionic strength solution in isolation. The order of catalytic activity observed was malonic &gt; tartaric&gt; lactic&gt; malic&gt; citric. Two different catalytic reaction mechanisms were identified for CuO catalysed WO in highly alkaline solution for the organic compounds studied. CuO catalysed the WO of malonic acid predominantly by catalysing the formation of free radical intermediates. CuO catalysed the WO of citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids predominantly via a complexation-based reaction mechanism...|$|R

The wide implementation of energy efficiency measures can cut down GHG emissions and assist in the transition towards a more sustainable primary aluminium industry. In this study, 22 currently available energy efficiency measures are assessed, and cost-supply curves are constructed to determine the technical and the cost-effective energy and GHG savings potentials.

PROCESS DESCRIPTION: BAUXITE MINING Bauxite is the principal ore of alumina (Al 2 O 3), which is used to produce aluminum (Al). It is composed of hydrated aluminum oxides, hydrated aluminosilicates, iron oxides, hydrated iron oxides, titanium oxide, and silica. It contains mixtures of various minerals such as gibbsite, boehmite, hematite, goethite, Al-goethite, anatase, rutile, ilmenite, kaolin, and quartz. Bauxite is a residual rock formed from the weathering of various igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. These parent rocks have been exposed to long periods (millions of years) of weath-ering under tropical, subtropical, or very wet temperate conditions.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} specific chemical exposures {{and exposure}} assessment methods relating to published and unpublished epidemiological {{studies in the}} alumina and primary aluminium industry. Our focus was to review limitations in the current literature and make recommendations for future research. Although some of the exposures in the smelting of aluminium have been well characterised, particularly in potrooms, little has been published regarding the exposures in bauxite mining and <b>alumina</b> <b>refining.</b> Past epidemiological studies in the industry have concentrated on the smelting of aluminium, with many limitations in the methodology used in their exposure assessment. We found that in aluminium smelting, exposures to fluorides, coal tar pitch volatiles (CTPV) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) have tended to decrease in recent years, but insufficient information exists for the other known exposures. Although excess cancers have been found among workers in the smelting of aluminium, the exposure assessment methods in future studies need to be improved to better characterise possible causative agents. The small number of cohort studies has been {{a factor in the}} failure to identify clear exposure-response relationships for respiratory diseases. A dose-response relationship has been recently described for fluoride exposure and bronchial hyper-responsiveness, but whether fluorides are the causative agent, co-agent or simply markers for the causative agent(s) for potroom asthma, remains to be determined. Published epidemiological studies and quantitative exposure data for bauxite mining and <b>alumina</b> <b>refining</b> are virtually non-existent Determination of possible exposure-response relationships for this part of the industry through improved exposure assessment methods should be the focus of future studies. © 1998 British Occupational Hygiene Society.
