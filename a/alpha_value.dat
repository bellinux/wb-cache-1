2500|$|A {{number of}} common {{processes}} fractionate hydrogen isotopes {{to produce the}} isotope variations found in nature. Common physical processes include precipitation and evaporation. [...] Chemical reactions also {{have the potential to}} heavily influence the partitioning of heavy and light isotopes between pools. The rate of a chemical reaction depends in part on the energies of the chemical bonds being formed and broken in the reaction. Since different isotopes have different masses, the bond energies are different between different isotopologues of a chemical species. This will result in a difference in the rate of a reaction for the different isotopologues, resulting in a fractionation of the different isotopes between the reactant and product in a chemical reaction. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect. A classic example of such an isotope effect is the D/H ratio difference in the equilibrium between HO and H which can have an <b>alpha</b> <b>value</b> of as much as 3-4.|$|E

40|$|We {{treat the}} local {{exchange}} parameter, alpha, of the Slater's Xalpha method as a fitting parameter and determine its value by constraining some physical quantity {{obtained from the}} self-consistent solution of the Xalpha method to be equal to its "exact" <b>value.</b> Thus, the <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> that reproduce the exact atomic energies are obtained for four different combinations of basis sets. A similar set of <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> that is independent of basis set is obtained from numerical calculation. The <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> are obtained for the atoms H through Cl. The performance of the analytic Slater-Roothaan (SR) method, that permits calculations to be performed accurate to machine precision, is examined using these set of <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> for atomization energies of molecules belonging to the G 2 set. The calculations indicate that the average absolute and mean errors are larger than those obtained using the Hartree-Fock <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> in the SR method, but smaller than those for the standard Hartree-Fock theory or Kohn-Sham local density approximation. Alternative set of <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> is determined by matching the highest occupied eigenvalue of the SR method to negative of the first ionization potential. Finally, the <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> for the diatomic molecules of these atoms that yield the "exact" atomization energy are obtained. We find that the <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> for the diatomic molecules show much larger deviation than what is observed for the atomic <b>alpha</b> <b>values.</b> The results obtained are useful {{in the development of}} the analytic Slater-Roothaan Xalpha method for molecular calculations.

The results showed that the total Cronbach <b>Alpha</b> <b>values</b> were almost the same for both countries after dropping some items with less than 0. 5 Cronbach <b>Alpha</b> <b>values.</b> For example, the Cronbach <b>Alpha</b> <b>values</b> for the Malaysian version were the attitude (0. 882), entrepreneurial thinking (0. 962) and entrepreneurial behavior (0. 785).   The Cronbach <b>Alpha</b> <b>values</b> for the Indonesion version were the attitude (0. 785), entrepreneurial thinking (0. 620) and entrepreneurial behavior (0. 910).   In comparison, the Malaysian version scored a little bit higher than her counterpart in Indonesia.

The results in Table  2 indicate that the {{internal consistency}} reliability ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 for the three NUEPS scales.

For the ‘STA’ sub-dimension, the Cronbach’s <b>alpha</b> (α) <b>value</b> was 0.95, with a half-split reliability of 0.93. For the ‘SRP’, the Cronbach’s <b>alpha</b> (α) <b>value</b> was 0.95, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Finally, for the ‘LAPI’ sub-dimension, the Cronbach’s <b>alpha</b> (α) <b>value</b> was 0.92, and the half-split reliability was 0.90.

A probability framework is introduced to establish the correspondences of pixel colors, disparities, and <b>alpha</b> <b>values</b> in different layers. We propose an automatic optimization method to solve a Maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem using Expectation-Maximization (EM), given the input of only a narrow-band stereo image pair.
