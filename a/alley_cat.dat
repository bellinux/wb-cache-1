[...] He was a prolific cartoonist who produced a large number of strips and illustrated Don Marquis's books of poetry about Archy and Mehitabel, an <b>alley</b> <b>cat</b> and a cockroach.

2500|$|Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera is an English musical with book, music, {{and lyrics}} by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall {{written for the}} Crackpot Theatre Company aboard the Old Profanity Showboat in Bristol, England. [...] The show {{is based on a}} series of tales written by Longfellow about Stinkfoot, a New York City <b>alley</b> <b>cat,</b> a bit of a rogue and more than a bit of a rake. [...] It had been {{intended}} for children, but when told by a New York City literary agent that “No mother in America would want her child identifying with Stinkfoot the <b>alley</b> <b>cat,</b> never mind its name,” [...] the story went into a drawer for many years. [...] It came out with the meeting in 1977 of Vivian and Ki, at which point the story became bedtime reading for Vivian's son Rupert Stanshall (born 1968), and later for his daughter with Ki, Silky Longfellow-Stanshall (born 1979). [...] In 1985 it “grew up” when Vivian and Ki decided to base a musical on its lead character, Stinkfoot. [...] At that point, it became a melding of two very different visions and two very different musical traditions: Vivian’s days as frontman for the Bonzo Dog Band and his childhood in Leigh-on-Sea with Ki’s love of America’s Broadway.|$|E

In its final form, it was a surreal and dazzling cross-cultural mix of music hall, Broadway, and Thirties screwball comedies. But mostly, it was [...] "just being itself," [...] as Vivian would say. It played to sell-out audiences every single night of its run, attracted people from Scotland to the USA, and it garnered wonderful, if slightly puzzled, reviews from not only the Bristol press, but The Guardian and The Times.|$|E
