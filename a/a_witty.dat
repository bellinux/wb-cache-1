5|$|As Mr. Burns {{fights for}} {{life at the}} hospital, the Springfield police are working to find his assailant. Smithers wakes {{up the next morning}} and vaguely remembers {{shooting}} someone the night before in a drunken rage. Guilt-ridden, Smithers heads for a local church, and is promptly arrested when the confessional {{turns out to be a}} police sting. While passing the media on his way to the police station, Smithers makes <b>a</b> <b>witty</b> remark Sideshow Mel recognizes from an episode of Pardon My Zinger that aired at the same time as the shooting. Mel realizes Smithers must have watched it as well, giving him an alibi. As Smithers' memory clears, it turns out he had actually shot Jasper in his wooden leg. Meanwhile, the townsmen pull down the sun-blocker, which crushes Shelbyville to their delight.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18 he {{was given}} a {{separate}} establishment, and in dramatic contrast with his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was <b>a</b> <b>witty</b> conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 (equivalent to £ today) from his father. It was far too little for his needs – the stables alone cost £31,000 a year. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived a profligate life. Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour {{on the part of the}} heir apparent. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to Charles James Fox and other radically inclined politicians.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Bogarde {{embarked}} {{on his second}} career as an author. Starting with a first volume A Postillion Struck by Lightning (an allusion to the phrase My postillion has been struck by lightning), he wrote a series of 15 best-selling memoirs, novels, essays, reviews, poetry and collected journalism. As a writer Bogarde displayed <b>a</b> <b>witty,</b> elegant, highly literate and thoughtful style.|$|E
25|$|The {{unconventional}} {{music of}} Berlioz irritated the established concert and opera scene. Berlioz {{often had to}} arrange for his own performances as well as pay for them himself. This took a heavy toll on him financially and emotionally. The nature of his large works– sometimes involving hundreds of performers– made financial success difficult. His journalistic abilities became essential {{for him to make}} a living and he survived as <b>a</b> <b>witty</b> critic, emphasizing the importance of drama and expressiveness in musical entertainment. It was perhaps this expense which prevented Berlioz from composing more opera than he did. His talent in the genre is obvious, but opera is the most expensive of all classical forms, and Berlioz in particular struggled to arrange stagings of his operas, {{due in part to the}} unwillingness of conservative Paris opera companies to perform his work.|$|E

In the adaptation, Jefferson Cope {{was one of}} the orphans severely abused by Lady Boynton in his youth, and he decides to take his revenge by wiping out her financial empire and ensuring that she is kept in the dark, though she dies before she realises her financial ruin. Jinny (Ginevra, in the novel) is adopted like Raymond and Carol, and she also becomes the prime motivation for the murderer, whereas in the novel she was Mrs Boynton's sole biological child. Lady Westholme, a US-born Member of Parliament, becomes the unconventional British travel writer Dame Celia Westholme in the adaptation. Dr Gerard, a French psychologist in the novel, becomes a Scottish anesthesiologist, develops <b>a</b> <b>witty</b> personality and becomes an accomplice to the murderer (whereas in the novel, he is completely innocent).|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} in the 1590s, Armin joined a company of players patronised by William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos. With this company, about which little is known, he is presumed to have {{travelled}} from the western Midlands to East Anglia. The nature of his work for the company may be estimated from his parts in The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke. The preface to the 1609 quarto indicates that he played Blue John, a clown in the vein of Tarlton and Kempe; he also seems to have doubled in the role of Tutch, <b>a</b> <b>witty</b> fool of the type he later played in London. The late quarto is associated with a revival by the King's Revels Children, a short-lived troupe of boy players led by Nathan Field, but it was almost certainly written around 1597.|$|E
25|$|While at Harvard Kittredge {{also joined}} several clubs and societies, wrote light verse, and won {{numerous}} consecutive Bowdoin prizes for his essays and translations, including one from English into Attic Greek. He {{also became a}} member of the editorial board of the Harvard Advocate. In 1881 Kittredge was the prompter and pronunciation coach in a celebrated theatrical performance by undergraduates of Sophocles's Oedipus Rex in the original Greek that was attended by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Julia Ward Howe, William Dean Howells, Charles Eliot Norton, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and classicist B. L. Gildersleeve of Johns Hopkins University among other luminaries. As an undergraduate, Kittredge also read widely outside of class, and became known as <b>a</b> <b>witty</b> after dinner speaker. In 1882, he was elected Ivy Orator (chosen to deliver a humorous speech) of his graduating class. Graduating with Kittredge that year was Owen Wister, author of the first Western novel, The Virginian.|$|E

25|$|Although Art Deco is seen {{generally}} in individual urban buildings, in the Rubber Research Institute Building it is employed for {{a complex of}} linked, single-storey buildings set in a landscaped compound. The buildings are almost modular with identical facade elements. Unlike most other examples, these buildings are in facing brick, with monumental corner piers. These piers frame the window openings, which are divided into three vertical bands by two large, protruding plaster mullions. Three horizontal rendered beams appear to be threaded through these mullions, visually tying the piers together. On the flat, recessed brick pediment, a plaster motif of layered latex sheets hanging out to dry is <b>a</b> <b>witty</b> allusion to the industry these buildings serve. The buildings are grouped around green courtyards and linked by covered masonry walkways. The walkways have amusing spout details over the beams which throw the rainwater from flat roofs. Art Deco is continued into the interior on heavy, carved timber doors and steel roof lights. This building shows the inventive, even playful, nature of the Art Deco style.|$|E
25|$|At the 1924 general election, McKeag, who had {{reputation}} for being <b>a</b> <b>witty</b> and able debater was the Liberal Party candidate for Durham but lost to the Labour Party candidate Joshua Ritson who had held the seat since 1922. He fought Durham again in 1929 but was again defeated by Ritson. By {{the time of the}} 1931 general election however, the national mood was swinging against Labour. The crisis in the economy over the summer of 1931 which brought about the National Government of prime minister Ramsay MacDonald meant that McKeag fought the general election in October as a Liberal in support of the National Government, enabling him {{to take advantage of the}} public support for the coalition and win the seat by the narrow majority of 270 votes. When the Liberal Party led by Sir Herbert Samuel withdrew from the coalition in November 1933, McKeag refused to cross the floor into opposition with Samuel. He then associated himself with the Liberal National group in Parliament led by Sir John Simon at least to allow him to be the nominated National candidate at the 1935 general election, which he fought under the description Liberal National in a straight fight with the former Labour MP Joshua Ritson. Labour were confident of a political revival in 1935, attacking the government on domestic policy and the armaments programme insisting that a vote for the National Government meant a vote for war. Durham went solidly Labour with the party winning every seat in the County, including the Seaham constituency represented by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.|$|E
