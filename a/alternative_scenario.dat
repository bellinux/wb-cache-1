5|$|In an <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario,</b> the exozodiacal dust may be {{generated}} in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{hypothesis}} of LDR is in contradiction to some embryological studies on birds which show that, from five developmental sites, the digits that develop are the three middle digits (II, III, IV). This inconsistency has {{been a matter of}} debate for almost 200 years, and has been used by Alan Feduccia to support the controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but from some other group of archosaurs which had lost the first and fifth digits. To explain the discrepancy between morphological and embryological data in the context of bird origins, an <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> to LDR was developed by Tony Thulborn and Tim Hamley in 1982. In this scenario, the digits I and V of theropods were reduced in the process of Bilateral Digit Reduction (BDR), with the remaining digits developing to resemble the former digits I-III. Limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for the BDR hypothesis due to it - and other ceratosaurians - having a reduced first digit, with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among the tetanurans (the sister group of the ceratosaurians).|$|E
25|$|Various {{alternative}} phylogenetic placements of Xingxiulong were tested; out of these, {{the most}} plausible alternative involves it being placed as a basal {{member of the}} Massopoda, outside of either Massospondylidae or Sauropodiformes, which only requires two additional evolutionary steps. This is {{probably due to the}} curved top margin of the postorbital and the presence of a process behind the jaw joint on the articular, which are traits that, compared to either Massospondylidae or Sauropodiformes, can be regarded as relatively primitive. Such an <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> would involve significant mosaic evolution in this evolutionary grade. Placements that required three additional evolutionary steps placed Xingxiulong between Jingshanosaurus and Anchisaurus, or between Yunnanosaurus and Jingshanosaurus.|$|E

25|$|In an <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario,</b> wartime {{hysteria}} can {{be explained}} as the body’s suppression of normal physiological functioning {{in order to avoid}} the scenario which activates the danger instincts and releases the associated emotion of fear into consciousness. Hysterical soldiers often presented with symptoms of paralysis and diminished or lost sensory capacities, even in the absence of anxiety or depression.These physiological symptoms, although distressing in themselves, make it impossible for a soldier to be returned to the front line. Thus, the body compensates for its inability to suppress the danger instincts in the face of war by making it so that the soldier must avoid warfare altogether.|$|E
25|$|Mallory's {{unbroken}} snow-goggles {{were found}} in his pocket, suggesting that he and Irvine had made a push for the summit and were descending after sunset. On his attempt a few days earlier, Norton had suffered serious snow-blindness {{because he did not}} wear his goggles, so Mallory would be unlikely to have dispensed with them in daylight, and given their known departure time and movements, had they not attempted the summit pyramid it is unlikely that they would have still been out by nightfall. An <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> is that Mallory may have carried an extra pair and the pair he was wearing were torn off in his fall.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{literature}} assessment by Barker et al. (2007b:622), mitigation cost estimates depend critically on the baseline (in this case, a reference scenario that the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> is compared with), the way costs are modelled, and assumptions about future government policy. Fisher et al. (2007:204–206) (summarized by IPCC, 2007b:11) estimated macroeconomic costs in 2030 for multi-gas mitigation (reducing {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide and other GHGs, such as methane) as between a 3% decrease in global GDP to a small increase, relative to baseline. This was for an emissions pathway consistent with atmospheric stabilization of GHGs between 445 and 710 ppm CO2-eq. In 2050, the estimated costs for stabilization between 710 and 445 ppm CO2-eq ranged between a 1% gain to a 5.5% decrease in global GDP, relative to baseline. These cost estimates were supported by a moderate amount of evidence and much agreement in the literature (IPCC, 2007b:11,18).|$|E
30|$|The NAIADE multicriteria {{analysis}} aims at ranking <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> on {{the basis}} of their performance as to certain evaluation criteria. Towards this end, the impact matrix is used (criteria/alternatives matrix), incorporating scores that can take the following forms: crisp numbers, stochastic elements, fuzzy elements and linguistic elements (such as ‘good’, ‘moderate’ etc.) [54, 56]. The comparison of <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> is based on the concept of ‘distance’ between two <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> as to a certain evaluation criterion. When dealing with crisp numbers, this distance is calculated by subtracting respective crisp numbers. In any other case, the concept of ‘semantic distance’ is used, measuring the distance between two functions, via which the scores of the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> are expressed. The final ranking of alternatives is the outcome (intersection) of two separate rankings: the Φ+(a) ranking that is based on the ‘better’ and ‘much better’ preference relationships; and the Φ−(a) ranking that is based on the ‘worse and ‘much worse’ preference relationships (for more information see [56]).|$|R

500|$|Although often {{noted for}} the serious, {{religious}} {{nature of his}} song lyrics, George Harrison was an avowed fan of British comedy, beginning with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan's work in The Goon Show during the 1950s. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison writes of comedy – specifically, Monty Python's first TV series and the satirical Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band – as having [...] "filled that empty space for me" [...] in the late 1960s, when relationships with his Beatles bandmates had fractured. The Bonzo Dog Band (as they became known in 1969) were a favourite of the Beatles, who cast the group in their 1967 TV film Magical Mystery Tour. Harrison subsequently performed with the Bonzos' drummer, [...] "Legs" [...] Larry Smith, along with Eric Clapton {{and other members of}} Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, at John Lennon's [...] "Peace for Christmas" [...] charity concert, held at London's Lyceum Ballroom in December 1969.

500|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> of Fegelein's {{death is}} based on the 1948/49 Soviet NKVD dossier of Hitler written for Joseph Stalin. The dossier {{is based on}} the {{interrogation}} reports of Günsche and Heinz Linge (Hitler's valet). This dossier differs in part from the accounts given by Mohnke and Rattenhuber. After the intoxicated Fegelein was arrested and brought back to the Führerbunker, Hitler at first ordered Fegelein to be transferred to Kampfgruppe [...] "Mohnke" [...] to prove his loyalty in combat. Günsche and Bormann expressed their concern to Hitler that Fegelein would desert again. Hitler then ordered Fegelein to be demoted and court-martialed by a court led by Mohnke. At this point the accounts differ, as the NKVD dossier states that Fegelein was court-martialed on the evening of 28 April, by a court headed by Mohnke, SS-Obersturmbannführer Alfred Krause, and SS-Sturmbannführer Herbert Kaschula. Mohnke and his fellow officers sentenced Fegelein to death. That same evening, Fegelein was shot from behind {{by a member of the}} Sicherheitsdienst. Based on this stated chain of events, author Veit Scherzer concluded that Fegelein, according to German law, was deprived of all honours and honorary signs and must therefore be considered a de facto but not de jure recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.|$|E

2500|$|In Reilly: Ace of Spies, Robin Bruce Lockhart repeats one of Reilly's oft-recited {{tales of}} how, at the British Admiralty's request, Reilly located William D'Arcy {{in the south}} of France and {{approached}} him in disguise. According to Reilly, he boarded Lord de Rothschild's yacht attired as a Catholic priest and secretly persuaded D'Arcy to terminate negotiations with the Rothschilds and return to London to meet with the British Admiralty. Biographer Andrew Cook is skeptical about Reilly's involvement in the D'Arcy Affair since, in February 1904, Reilly was reportedly still in Port Arthur, Manchuria. Cook further claims that it was Reilly's intelligence chief, William Melville, and a British intelligence officer, Henry Curtis Bennett, who undertook the D'Arcy assignment. An <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> in The Prize by Daniel Yergin has the Admiralty creating a [...] "Syndicate of Patriots" [...] to keep D'Arcy's concession in British hands, apparently with the full and eager co-operation of D'Arcy himself.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, the United Nations {{stated that}} the rate of {{population}} growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion.

Another theory posits that the items were from a monastic library and hidden due to threats from Muslims who were moving eastward. This theory proposes that the monks of a nearby monastery heard about the fall of the Buddhist kingdom of Khotan to Karakhanids invaders from Kashgar in 1006 and the destruction it caused, so they sealed their library to avoid it being destroyed.
