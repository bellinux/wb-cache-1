30|$|Arc blow is a {{phenomenon}} in which the arc tends to become separated {{from the point of}} welding, as though a strong wind were blowing (Naidu et al. 2003). The reason for the occurrence of arc blow is imbalance in the magnetic field surrounding the workpiece (Gerbec 2009). Generally, this phenomenon occurs in three situations: (i) the direction of the current changes, (ii) there are magnetic materials around the welding arc, and (iii) there are magnetic materials {{near the edge of the}} plate (Naidu et al. 2003). Arc blow is generally found only with high DC welding currents. It can be prevented by reducing the current level, by using an <b>AC</b> <b>welding</b> current, and by demagnetizing the fixture (Gerbec 2009).

40|$|In {{numerical}} modelling {{of the resistance}} spot welding process, a significant input parameter {{is the value of}} the weld current and traditionally, the rms value corresponding to the actual, instantaneous current waveform is used. The rms value implies a constant weld current for the entire weld time instead of the real-time current waveforms. Although the rms value represents an effective approximation of the real-time current waveform, the influence of the peak current and of the current slopes in each half cycle on the welding process cannot be realised in modelling when the rms value is used. Mathematically, an alternating current waveform with higher peak value and lower current on-time in each half cycle may correspond to a rms value that is nearly similar corresponding to another waveform with lower peak value and larger current on-time in each half cycle. The resulting rate of heating and the subsequent size of the weld nugget may not be the same for both the current signals since the resistive heating in resistance spot welding is transient in nature. This is precisely observed in the present work through a detailed investigation using three different <b>ac</b> spot <b>welding</b> machines.

The variations exist in the values of peak current and in the current-on and -off times in every ac cycle. It is observed that real-time current wave form involving higher peak current leads to slightly larger weld nugget diameter compared to wave form with smaller peak current even if the overall rms value remains similar The real-time current wave form from a medium frequency dc confirms-to a fast rise to the set weld current and remains steady for the complete weld time. A detailed experimental study has depicted that-the real-time ac wave forms especially with high peak values and sharp rise characteristics offer a relatively smaller permissible range of weld currents compared to the wave forms with relatively flatter characteristics. The steady instantaneous current wave form confirming to the medium frequency dc machine has facilitated a larger permissible range of weld current.

40|$|In {{the single}} phase <b>AC</b> Resistance spot <b>welding</b> process, {{consistent}} weld quality cannot be guaranteed {{due to its}} highly coupled electrical-thermal-mechanical nature. As {{one of the most}} critical factors for weld quality, methods to control the welding current have been studied by researchers in both industry and academia for many years. However, real-time control of welding current is difficult because the controlled process is typically nonlinear, uncertain, time-varying and fast-response. For a dynamic system which is uncertain, repetitive and fast-response, adaptive learning control is a good solution. Iterative learning control has been developed by many researchers and proves to be effective for tracking control to certain extent. However, most of them are designed in the time domain, where the system time delay is a big problem for these controllers. In this thesis, a controller using Fourier series based learning control scheme is developed to control the current of RSW process. The control law is updated on-line in the frequency domain, and the stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically analyzed based on the Lyapunov theory. It has been shown that the asymptotic stability and good performance of the closed-loop system can be achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is experimentally verified on a 63 KVA single phase AC RSW machine.

Nowadays there are some problems existed in the spot welding industry, which includes low welding precision, low welding quality, small welding range and low anti-disturbance capability. The problems are caused by a lot of elements, among these elements; the most important one is low precision of welding current control. So how to control the welding current accurately is the problem we need to solve. Since 8 bit microcontroller system and 32 bit microcontroller have disadvantages in designing the RSW controller. 16 bit microcontroller plus DSP is a cost-effective chip to design the RSW control platform, it can implement not only the close loop control but also the complex welding control algorithm. It satisfies the requirement to control output welding current accurately. In this thesis the hardware system based on the 16 bit digital signal controller (DSC) dsPIC 30 F 6014 is designed and implemented, the system is comprised of signal input, signal output, user interface, communication, alarm and power six module. The hardware system is a cost-effective system that can implement the close loop control with complex algorithm. The control algorithm includes the line voltage compensation and constant current control algorithm. The principle of constant current control is that measuring the current effective value in each cycle and altering the control angle next cycle according to α = f(I%) to keep the welding current percentage unchangeable. In a word. It is done by changing the control angle α (trigger time) to alter the output welding current. Line voltage compensation must be applied since line voltage fluctuation will affect the welding current. Both hardware and software system of the AC RSW controller has been implemented successfully and the results prove it is able to control the welding control accurately and improve the welding quality greatly by comparing with other RSW control.

Houve uma reduÃÃo no limite de escoamento nas condiÃÃes soldadas com temperatura de 350 ÂC, sendo uma possÃvel causa a precipitaÃÃo de carbonetos devido ao preaquecimento e aos multipasses. Os ensaios de Charpy-V indicaram que, de uma forma geral, o aumento da temperatura de interpasse reduziu a tenacidade na zona fundida. A energia absorvida na interface sofreu reduÃÃo com o aumento da temperatura de interpasse, decorrente do aumento da descarbonetaÃÃo. O tempo de soldagem foi reduzido de forma considerÃvel com o aumento de temperatura de interpasse, entretanto, deve-se avaliar as alteraÃÃes na ZTA e ZF. Nickel alloys {{can be used}} to weld dissimilar joints of {{low alloy}} carbon steels. One of the purposes of this union is to avoid the formation of hydrogen induced cracking. According codes and standard there is a limitation that imposes the maximum interpass temperature at 150 <b>ÂC</b> for <b>welding</b> using nickel alloys. However, the low interpass temperature reduces productivity and increases manufacturing costs. A study that evaluates effect of the preheating and interpass temperature of dissimilar welds on the metallurgical changes and mechanical properties is of great relevance. In this way, the general objective {{of this study is to}} assess the effect of interpass temperature on metallurgical changes and mechanical properties of dissimilar welded joints among ASTM A 182 -F 22 steel and different nickel-based alloys. GMAW were carried out on joints of steel (ASTM A 182 -F 22) using different nickel-based alloys as filler metal and different interpass temperatures (35 ÂC, 150 ÂC and 350 ÂC). The heat input was kept constant (1. 0 kJ/mm). Based on the results obtained it was observed that increasing preheating temperature there is a tends to reduce the precipitates content, because of dilution. The distribution coefficient of Mo and Nb decrease with the increase of iron content in the fusion zone, making stronger the segregation of these elements. Interpass temperature tend to reduce the HAZ hardness, due to the in cooling rate reduction caused by increase interpass temperature. In the tensile tests failure in the base metal. There was a reduction in yield strength for welds produced with 350 ÂC preheat temperature, being a possible cause the precipitation of carbides due to preheating and multipasses. The Charpy-V tests indicated that, generally, the increase in interpass temperature reduced the toughness in the fusion zone. The absorbed energy by the interface dropped when interpass temperature increase. The welding time was considerably reduced with the interpass temperature increase, however, it should be to considerate changes in HAZ and fusion zone...|$|R
