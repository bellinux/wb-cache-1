Disney has distributed all subsequent Marvel Studios films. In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger from Paramount. The Incredible Hulk {{was not part of the}} deal, due to an agreement between Marvel and Universal, where Marvel owns the film rights and Universal owns the distribution rights, for this film as well as the right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not bought the film distribution rights to the Hulk <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Paramount for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Disney wants for its own theme parks.|$|E

500|$|In April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal {{holding the}} {{distribution}} rights to Hulk films {{may be an}} obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film, and reiterated this in October 2015, and July 2017.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Paramount Pictures for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company Disney wants for its own theme parks. In December, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.
