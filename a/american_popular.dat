5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> culture.|$|E
5|$|Blur is {{the fifth}} studio album by the English rock band Blur, {{released}} on 10 February 1997 by Food Records.

5|$|Chile and Peru both {{claim the}} pisco sour as their {{national}} drink, and each asserts {{ownership of the}} cocktail's base liquor—pisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> culture. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations {{in the style of}} preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates a yearly public holiday in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a more authentic black sound to popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, but the general style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1817 Captain George Woodbine, one of Nicolls's former {{subordinate}} officers, was present in Spanish East Florida together with the former British soldier and Scottish mercenary lieutenant of Simon Bolivar, Gregor MacGregor. Woodbine and MacGregor both left Spanish East Florida to rejoin the Latin American revolutionary movement prior to U.S. military intervention in East Florida. The names of Nicolls, Woodbine, and MacGregor had become associated with the arming of blacks as soldiers, militiamen, and even as mercenaries. The threat, real or imaginary, was an anathema to North <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> conceptions of the time.|$|E

5|$|Music of Turkey {{includes}} mainly Turkic {{elements as}} well as partial influences ranging from Central Asian folk music, Arabic music, Greek music, Ottoman music, Persian music and Balkan music, {{as well as}} references to more modern European and <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> music. The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries {{to a time when}} the Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia and Persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for Westernization.|$|E
5|$|Otis Ray Redding Jr. (September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, arranger, {{and talent}} scout. He is {{considered}} one of the greatest singers in the history of <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s, such as James Carr and Freddie Jackson. (Woodstra and Elewine) During his lifetime, his recordings were produced by Stax Records, based in Memphis, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|The New Thought movement, {{which emerged}} in the 1880s, was {{responsible}} for popularizing belief {{in the power of}} the mind to achieve prosperity.

By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E

5|$|The postwar {{drive-in}} theater boom {{was vital}} to the expanding independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, {{there were more than}} 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie.|$|E
5|$|With {{the premiere}} of Return of the Jedi in 1983 and the {{accompanying}} merchandising campaign, Jabba the Hutt became an icon in <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> culture.

5|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of diverse styles emerged in stark {{contrast}} to mainstream <b>American</b> <b>popular</b> music. Though these genres were not largely popular in the sense of selling many records to mainstream audiences, they were examples of popular music, as opposed to folk or classical music. In the early 1970s, African Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City developed hip hop culture, which produced a style of music also called hip hop. At roughly the same time, Latinos, especially Cubans and Puerto Ricans, in New York also innovated salsa music, which combined many forms of Latin music with R and rock. The genres of punk rock and heavy metal were most closely associated with the United Kingdom in the 1970s, while various American derivatives evolved later in the decade and into the 1980s. Meanwhile, Detroit slowly evolved a series of electronic music genres like house and techno that later became a major part of popular music worldwide.|$|E
