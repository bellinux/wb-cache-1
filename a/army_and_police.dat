Schools and several businesses, including the US Embassy in Kingston, closed on September2930 as the island braced for heavy rains. Public transit was suspended islandwide {{on the evening of}} September29, and shipping interests were cautioned to secure their vessels. At the height of the storm, <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> officials patrolled the island in case of emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Local officials, the Selbstschutz, and the Hilfspolizei (Auxiliary Police) {{played a}} key role in {{rounding}} up and massacring Jewish Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. These groups helped the Einsatzgruppen and other killing units to quickly identify Jews. The Hilfspolizei, consisting of auxiliary police organised by the Germans and recruited from former Latvian <b>Army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> officers, ex-Aizsargi, members of the Pērkonkrusts, and university students, assisted in the murder of Latvia's Jewish citizens. Similar units were created elsewhere, and provided much of the manpower for the Holocaust in Eastern Europe.|$|E

On the mainland, roughly 700 people evacuated to shelters in Huatampo, a city that at that time had a population of 9,000, and Yavaros prior to landfall, but within hours {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, all but 127 had returned home.|$|E

5|$|The Huế Phật Đản shootings {{were the}} deaths of nine unarmed Buddhist civilians on 8 May 1963, {{in the city of}} Huế, South Vietnam, {{at the hands of the}} army and {{security}} forces of the Roman Catholic fundamentalist government of Ngô Đình Diệm. The <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> fired guns and launched grenades into a crowd of Buddhists who had been protesting against a government ban on the flying of the Buddhist flag on the day of Phật Đản, which commemorates the birth of Gautama Buddha. Diệm's denial of governmental responsibility for the incident—he instead blamed the Việt Cộng—added to discontent among the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|The Special Air Service (formally 22 Special Air Service Regiment, or 22 SAS) is a {{regiment}} of the British Army {{and part}} of the United Kingdom's special forces. The SAS was sporadically assigned to operations in Northern Ireland {{in the early stages of}} the British Army's deployment in the province, during which they were confined to South Armagh. The first large-scale deployment of SAS soldiers in the Troubles was in 1976, when the regiment's D Squadron was committed. The SAS soon began to specialise in covert, intelligence-based operations against the IRA, using more aggressive tactics than regular <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> units operating in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police.</b> In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E

5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{stage of the}} revolt, in the early summer, al-Hajj Muhammad's fighters primarily operated in the Wadi al-Sha'ir area between Nablus and the coastal plain. Most of their actions consisted of attacks against British <b>Army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> patrols between Tulkarm and Nablus. On 21 June in the Battle of Anabta, al-Hajj Muhammad and his fasa'il ambushed a British Army force protecting a Jewish convoy passing near the village. Three British bomber planes were dispatched to aid the ambushed convoy. The ensuing battle lasted about seven hours and ended with the deaths of ~10 rebels and 2 British soldiers. A further 21 rebels and two British soldiers were wounded. The authorities consequently issued an arrest warrant for al-Hajj Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of October 2000, the IDF {{prohibited}} Israeli access to the tomb. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002, with severe damage to the historic core of the city, where 64 heritage buildings suffered serious damage or were destroyed. Some Breslov hasidim and others began {{to take advantage of}} the new circumstances to visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness, evading <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> checkpoints. Eventually Joseph’s tomb was once more open to visits. In May 2002, Israeli soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit the tomb. Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, the tomb was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards, in response to numerous requests, they renewed guarded tours of the tomb. One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite. These visits were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits, mainly by Breslav Hassidim. However, in October, citing security reasons, Israel re-imposed a ban on Jewish pilgrims obtaining special permits and travelling to the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{kept the}} control of the nation firmly within the hands of his {{brothers}} and their in-laws, and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Diệm; in 1960, a paratroop revolt was quashed after Diệm stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 palace bombing by two air force pilots failed to kill him. South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Diệm's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform. In the countryside, Catholics were de facto exempt from performing corvée labour. Discontent with Diệm and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Diệm's <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha.|$|E

5|$|The Oman Chairman of the National Committee for Civil Defence, General Malek Bin Sulaiman Al Ma'amari, remarked {{the nation}} had already {{developed}} a contingency plan, {{which included the}} activation of <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> personnel after the storm's passage. Significant damage was expected, especially in northeastern areas, along with up to 150mm (6in) of rainfall and very strong winds. Officials recommended citizens evacuate from potentially affected areas, and about 7,000people were forced to leave Masirah Island due {{to the threat of}} high surf and strong winds. Overall, more than 20,000people evacuated to emergency shelters. A state of emergency was declared for the nation. The Omani national weather service warned that the cyclone was expected to be worse than the destructive cyclone that hit Masirah Island in 1977. The Mina al Fahal oil terminal closed for over three days due to the threat of the storm. Omani officials closed government offices for two days and declared a five-day-long national holiday. Most businesses near the coastline were closed prior to the announcement. Authorities at the Muscat International Airport (then named as Seeb International Airport) canceled of all flights after 2000UTC on June 5 due to the cyclone.|$|E
