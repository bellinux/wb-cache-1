5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was cleared for the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E
