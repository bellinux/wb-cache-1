2500|$|After the 2008 general {{election}} which saw heavy losses for BN, Abdullah reshuffled his Cabinet. Within {{days of his}} appointment, new de facto Law Minister Zaid Ibrahim stated {{that the government had}} to openly apologise for its handling of the crisis, calling it one of his three main goals: [...] "In the eyes of the world, the judicial crisis has weakened our judiciary system." [...] However, he rejected the idea of reviewing the decision: [...] "I am not suggesting that we re-open the case. I am saying that it’s clear to everyone, to the world, that serious transgressions had been committed by the previous administration. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prime minister is big enough and man enough to say that we had done wrong to these people and we are sorry." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dickerson quickly wrote Hull to {{question}} what had prompted workers to strike. [...] On August 1, 1835, Hull {{replied with a}} copy of his original order and an explanation of what in his judgment incited the workers action: [...] "The regulation has met with disapprobation of the workmen generally and without stating their objections and without assigning their reasons for doing so have left the yard and ended their work. I cannot conceive of any good reason <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mechanics of this said yard have been acted upon by other causes." [...] Hull's [...] "acted upon by other causes" [...] is underscored [...] in the original and is his reference to the Board of Navy Commissioners resistance to the ten hour day. Hull was aware that his [...] navy yard workers were striking over more than the [...] newly imposed lunch restrictions. Hull like other shipyard commandants was aware of the ten-hour day movement, [...] as well as the Board of Navy Commissioners resistance to reducing the workweek. Hull too knew of the calls for general strike that summer by the Philadelphia shipyard workers and probably thought they were the proximate cause of the strike. He must have feared these calls had found an attentive audience.|$|E

I explain why it is less absurd to believe or assert (om 1) or (com 1) than to believe or assert (om) or (com) and show that despite appearances, subsequent iterations of (om 1) or (com 1) do not decrease the absurdity of believing or asserting them...|$|R

60|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of the Russian Revolution is as an attempt to realize Communism.

60|$|If {{a student}} of my own subject shows power and originality, I dare not advise him to adopt a {{scientific}} career; for, supposing {{he is able to}} maintain himself until he has attained distinction, I cannot give him the assurance that any amount of proficiency in the Biological Sciences will be convertible into, even the most modest, bread and cheese. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> case is as bad, or perhaps worse, with other branches of Science.

60|$|In all my idle speculations I am greatly {{assisted}} by various legends connected with my venerable house, which are current in the neighbourhood, and are so numerous {{that there is}} scarce a cupboard or corner that has not some dismal story of its own.

60|$|So {{far from}} regretting my marriage, {{it has made}} the {{happiness}} and honour of my life; and every unkindness received from my own house makes me press nearer to the tenderest and noblest of human hearts proved by the uninterrupted devotion of nearly five years. Husband, lover, nurse--not one of these, has Robert been to me, but all three together. I neither regret my marriage, therefore, nor the manner of it, because the manner {{of it was a}} necessity of the act.
