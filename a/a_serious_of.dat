25|$|While {{the link}} between ethnic {{heterogeneity}} and under provision of public goods is generally accepted, there is little consensus around the causal mechanism underlying this relationship. To identify possible causal stories, Humphreys and Habyarimana ran <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>of</b> behavioral games in Kampala, Uganda that involved several local participants completing joint tasks and allocating money amongst them. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, they find that participants did not favor the welfare of their co-ethnics disproportionately. It was only when anonymity was removed and everyone's ethnicity was known did co-ethnics decide to favor each other. Humphreys and Habyarimana argue that cooperation among co-ethnics is primarily driven by reciprocity norms that tend to be stronger among co-ethnics. The possibility of social sanctions compelled those who would not otherwise cooperate with their co-ethnics to do so. The authors find no {{evidence to suggest that}} co-ethnics display a greater degree of altruism towards each other or have the same preferences. Ethnic cooperation takes place because co-ethnics have common social networks and therefore can monitor each other and can threaten to socially sanction any transgressors.|$|E

Originally declining to comment about a possible loan Davies' agent, Lyle Yorks, told reporters that Davies was seeking a loan, in order to have more ample playing time while recovering from <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>of</b> injuries he suffered in an automobile accident in October 2009.

Kelly stated during an interview that she felt Becky was [...] "punching above her weight" [...] with Jason. Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason, stating: [...] "Both boys bring out different things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, {{and it was no}} strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her." [...] When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, he was asked if he thought that his character has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: [...] "I think he's turned it around. She was all over the place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And having a little girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!" [...] Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009; their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV, which aired adverts for the first wedding episodes. Their relationship was featured in <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>of</b> romanctic plots in which ITV dubbed the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] season of the soap, with advertisements airing.|$|E
2500|$|According to Diego Durán's History of the Indies of New Spain, and a {{few other}} sources that are also based on the Crónica X, the Flower Wars were an act of ritual between the cities of Aztec Triple Alliance and Tlaxcala, Huexotzingo and Cholula. This form of ritual was {{motivated}} by the Mesoamerican cultures in 1450 after <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>of</b> droughts and famine caused many deaths within the Mexican highlands. The droughts and damage to the crops were believed to be punishment by the gods for feeling disvalued instead of being honored properly. Therefore, the Flower Wars became a way to obtain human sacrifices in a very structured and ceremonial manner which were then used as offerings.|$|E

"Car Creation" [...] – The presenters {{take on the}} {{challenge}} of creating a vehicle, such as a police car, or hovercraft, mainly using a car they feel will be good {{as the basis for}} their design.

His senior minister, Sartaj Aziz, also expressed displeased after marking that: Sharif [...] "committed a blunder, failing to recognize that despite his heavy mandate, it was not advisable for him to dismiss (two) army chiefs in less than a year.

2500|$|In [...] "The Cool Wall", {{the segment}} focused on an {{argument}} {{between two of}} the presenters over which cars are cool and which are not, placing photographs of these on various sections of a large board divided into <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>of</b> categories: [...] "Seriously Uncool", [...] "Uncool", [...] "Cool", and [...] "Sub Zero". This segment was purely designed for comedy, as it was mainly handled by both Clarkson and Hammond since its introduction in the sixth episode of the first series, and both presenter often argued and attempted to put a car they liked into a category that the other refused to let it be a part of, with Clarkson basing some of his arguments by how the cars would impress actress Kristin Scott Thomas, and later, BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce. Cars were placed into a specific category depending on certain attributes, which, according to Andy Wilman, were not necessarily related {{to the quality of the}} car itself. An example of this is that a car considered to be [...] "fashionable" [...] may be deemed uncool if the impact it has is massive but short-lived and the perception of it is that it looks ridiculous. A notable rule of this segment was that the car becomes [...] "Seriously Uncool" [...] if a presenter buys one.|$|E
