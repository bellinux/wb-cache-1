5|$|Northern Ireland itself was, {{for many}} years, {{the site of}} a violent and bitter ethno-sectarian conflict—The Troubles—between those {{claiming}} to represent Irish nationalism, who <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> Roman Catholic, and those claiming to represent British unionism, who <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> Protestant. Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, while nationalists desire a united Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The cuckooshrikes {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds. They <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> greyish with white and black, although some minivet species are brightly coloured.|$|E
5|$|The recipes <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> English, but dishes include French {{and other}} foreign names, and {{imported}} ingredients such as spices.|$|E
50|$|While Sudan to {{the north}} <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> Muslim, South Sudan <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> Christian and African {{traditional}} animist, though Islam is not altogether absent.|$|R
50|$|Before World War II the (then German) {{inhabitants}} of the town <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> Protestants. Since {{the end of the}} war the population <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> composed of Roman Catholics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{town has}} a {{population}} of just over 5000 people. [...] Unusually for a small town in South Africa, Kenton <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> English-speaking, except for the suburb of Ekuphumleni, which {{has a population}} of around 3600 people and is exclusively Xhosa-speaking, the town <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> English-speaking. The village of Boesmansriviermond on the opposite banks of the Bushman's River <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> Afrikaans-speaking.|$|R
5|$|The typical age {{of onset}} is 20–40. It is unknown why males <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> affected, with rates in males being 17- to 70-fold those in females, despite thyroid overactivity being {{much more common}} in women.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few breeds that <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics of Dominican music {{include the}} West African use of call and {{response}} singing, clapping {{as a major}} part of rhythm and lyrical, dance and rhythmic improvisation. Lyrics are almost all in Dominican Creole French, and are traditionally sung by women (chantwèl), while the instrumental traditions <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> practiced by men. Drums, generically known as lapo kabwit, are the most prominent part of Dominica's instrumental tradition.|$|E
50|$|The {{tone of the}} {{examination}} <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> clinical. The syllabus is extensive and covers all aspects of clinical anaesthetic practice. In addition, the entire syllabus of the Primary FRCA examination (which <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> basic science) <b>is</b> included.|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> silts and sands, in {{contrast}} to underlying Trepassey Formation, which is mostly dark grey shales. There is a coarsening up sequence throughout the two formations, such that {{the top of the}} Fermeuse <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> sandstones.|$|R
50|$|The part {{north of}} Womma Road <b>was</b> <b>predominantly</b> residential, the area south of Womma Road {{which is now}} in Edinburgh North <b>was</b> <b>predominantly</b> industrial. It <b>was</b> served by the Womma and Broadmeadows {{stations}} on the Gawler railway line.|$|R
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> monogamous and both parents {{care for the}} young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their reproductive success. Males have also been found to pirate food from unmated females and juveniles during {{the breeding}} season.|$|E
5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E
5|$|Living strepsirrhines <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> arboreal, {{with only}} the ring-tailed lemur {{spending}} considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> insectivorous.|$|R
50|$|Petifu is a {{rural town}} in Port Loko District in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone. Petifu lies about 20 miles to Lungi. The town {{population}} <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> from the Susu, Temne and Fula ethnic group. The town <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> muslim.|$|R
50|$|South Guthrie <b>is</b> still <b>predominantly</b> black, while Guthrie <b>is</b> <b>predominantly</b> white, {{although}} the divisions {{are not as}} sharply defined as they were historically.|$|R
5|$|M. l. dulcis, {{commonly}} known as lavender-flanked fairywren, is found in Arnhem Land. It was described in 1908 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews, though this and subspecies rogersi were long considered forms of the lovely fairywren (M. amabilis) until integrades were noted over a wide area of northern Australia with subspecies assimilis. Like subspecies rogersi, females <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> blue-grey rather than grey-brown and have white lores and eye rings rather than the rufous coloration of the other subspecies.|$|E
5|$|M. l. rogersi {{occurs in}} the Kimberleys and was {{originally}} named by Mathews in 1912. It was {{also known as the}} lavender-flanked fairywren and considered as the same taxon. Though the males are similar to the widely occurring inland subspecies assimilis, the females <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> blue-grey rather than grey-brown. A broad hybrid zone with females of both subspecies has been recorded from northeastern Western Australia and the northwestern Northern Territory.|$|E
5|$|Most house sparrows do {{not move}} {{more than a few}} {{kilometres}} during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> migratory. Unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E

5|$|Over 2,400 {{species of}} mantis in about 430 genera are recognized. They <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> found in {{tropical}} regions, but some live in temperate areas. The systematics of mantises {{have long been}} disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 {{census of}} Association of Religion Data Archives has also {{reported}} that 46.5% {{of the total population}} was Christian, slightly larger than the Muslim population of 45.5%, while 7.7% were members of other religions. However, these estimates should be taken with caution because sample data is mostly collected from major urban areas in the south, which <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> Christian.|$|E
5|$|The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the {{prevailing}} winds {{in the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E

5|$|The {{biological}} {{interest is}} focused on the species-rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> grasses, although herbs and orchids are also found. The area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition. The site is small and isolated, and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land.|$|E
5|$|The geology is {{dominated}} by rocks Carboniferous in age but, as the parish straddles a complex section of the North Craven Fault, it is varied. To the north-east of the village the rocks <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> Bowland sandstones and shales, and to the south-east are largely massive limestones. The River Wharfe runs across the limestone, through an impressive gorge at Loup Scar. The mineral veins of the Bowland series have been exploited for lead ore.|$|E
5|$|The {{soil and}} {{topography}} in the catchment <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> sandy with very low water retention capacity. The land use {{pattern in the}} Pushkar valley that drains into the lake comprises 30% of the area under shifting sand dunes, 30% under hills (degraded and barren) and streams and 40% of the area is agricultural.|$|E
