5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, <b>and</b> <b>reflections</b> meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

The ARTEL workshop series brings together researchers and professionals from different back- grounds {{to provide a}} forum for discussing the multi-faceted area of awareness and reflec- tion. The theme of the 2013 workshop was: How can awareness <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> support learning in different settings (work, education, continuing professional development, lifelong learning, etc.). What are the roles that technology can play to support awareness <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> in these contexts? This theme was covered in several topics of the workshop. The main interests were about the theoretical discussion of awareness <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> in TEL <b>and</b> related concepts (e. g., collaborative learning, creativity techniques, experiential learning, etc.). The methodolo- gies to identify, study and analyse awareness <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> {{in the context of}} (technology- enhanced) learning. Besides theory and methodology the workshop informed about em- pirical studies about technology support for awareness <b>and</b> <b>reflection.</b> A special aim was to showcase technology (design, application, evaluation) supporting awareness and reflec- tion. Here, the central question was how awareness <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> technologies can help to enhance the learning experience, by researching learner’s awareness of social context, knowledge, artefacts and processes, <b>and</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> in specific contexts, such as higher education, work-integrated learning, learning networks, etc. The workshop included a paper session, demo and prototype slam as well as interactive sessions. The workshop provided a forum for presenting and discussing research on aware- ness <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> in TEL, <b>and</b> created an interactive experience that connects partici- pants’ research, current tools or latest prototypes and models with real end users’ learning experiences <b>and</b> requirements regarding <b>reflection</b> technology. Researchers <b>and</b> practition- ers came together to work on the future agenda of ARTEL research and development (see the topic map below) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, factors {{contributing}} {{to the formation of}} pulse wave were analyzed based on hemodynamic principles. It is considered that formation of pulse wave was related to its propagation <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> characteristics. Propagation of the pulse wave was characterized by pulse wave velocity, <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> of the pulse wave was characterized by reflection coefficient. Pulse wave velocity <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> coefficient were proposed as the eigenvectors of pulse wave in pulse diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine, and support vector machine (SVM) was used to recognize slippery pulse, stringy pulse and plain pulse. Pulse wave velocity <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> coefficient of the slippery, stringy and plain pulses in healthy people were calculated in this study, and SVM with Gaussian radial basis function was used for classifying. Results showed that pulse wave velocity <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> coefficient with physiological and pathological significance had advantages in distinguishing slippery pulse, stringy pulse and plain pulse, which offered a new idea for recognizing pulse condition...|$|R

5|$|With filming complete, MJZ {{contacted}} post-production company Asylum {{to begin}} work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life. The team, led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach, tripled in size as {{the scale of the}} work required became apparent, given the deadline of three weeks. Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy, requiring the creation of only minor elements such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors. The same was true for the training sequence, where only minimal tracking work and compositing of matte backgrounds was required. The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence. This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting <b>and</b> <b>reflections</b> from visors and armor, to particle effects for the background smoke and dust, plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games. The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies. While the Brute was partially animatronic, substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost twice the size and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made. Other elements, such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop-pods, were created entirely through the use of CGI. Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for compositing, Maya for animation, RenderMan and Mantra for rendering, SynthEyes for tracking, Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work.|$|E
