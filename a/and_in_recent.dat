5|$|Historically, {{frequent}} wars ravaged Badajoz's {{economy and}} people were poor. Agricultural land was not fertile with no industry of any major importance in its territory. However, the historic monuments in the town and also in Mérida were major attractions to visitors, leading {{to the growth of}} tourism, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years there has been some industrial development.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 the Silver Jubilee Bridge {{replaced}} the outdated Transporter Bridge <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years {{many of the}} old heavy chemical factories have closed to be replaced by more modern factories. Much of the land previously polluted by the old dirty chemical processes has been reclaimed, and there have been improvements in the cleanliness and environment of the town.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{there were}} {{continuing}} gradual economic improvements, {{among the most}} visible {{of which was the}} replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years, with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the island's populations have begun to increase after decades of decline.|$|E

Urban Aid grants, European Union grants and, more recently, Social Inclusion Partnership's have attempted to breathe new life into Coatbridge. Despite these efforts the town's population has continued to fall <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years the town has been dubbed the 'most dismal in Scotland'.|$|E

5|$|John Thomas Perceval, {{the son of}} Spencer Perceval, {{spent about}} a year at Brislington House, from 1831 until February 1832, {{followed}} by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington House Perceval experienced, {{in spite of the}} expense, a regime of deprivation, brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time he was completely under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or tied down in bed. Treatment consisted of cold baths and an operation to sever his temporal artery. He was later {{one of the founders of}} the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and acted as their honorary secretary for about twenty years. Perceval's two books about his experience in asylums were republished by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson in 1962, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years he has been hailed as a pioneer of the mental-health advocacy movement.|$|E
5|$|Power remains {{relatively}} inexpensive along the Columbia, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years high-tech companies like Google {{have begun to}} move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power. Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Auxois are still bred for meat production, and in 2001, 50% {{of the horses}} bred were intended for slaughter. However, the power and gaits of the breed make them valued for competitive and leisure driving, as well as equestrian tourism. The smaller horses of the breed are used for milk production. The Auxois is used for celebrations, such as weddings, and historical reenactments. It is also used for logging, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years, has been increasingly used in agriculture, being found in vineyards, gardens and farms. The use of them {{for the maintenance of}} rural roads is also in planning.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} bus operators within Sheffield: First South Yorkshire, Stagecoach Yorkshire, TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow, Powells, G Holmes and Sheffield Community Transport. First South Yorkshire, became {{by far the}} largest bus operator <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop. Recent developments have seen Stagecoach Sheffield taking over Yorkshire Terrier, Andrews and parent company Yorkshire Traction, thus forming one company and in the process expanding their bus services in the city. This has resulted in increased competition, and price drops on certain routes. A zero-fare bus service, the FreeBee (Operated by First South Yorkshire), operated a circular route around the city centre from the Sheffield Interchange. The FreeBee buses stopped in 2014 and is due to save £8 million.|$|E

5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
