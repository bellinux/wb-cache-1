Specific attention was given during inspection for quality control purposes in various industries like steel processing and textile manufacturing. <b>Automatic</b> <b>thresholding</b> problem has been addressed well by the commonly used Otsu method, which provides suitable results for thresholding images based on a histogram of bimodal distribution. However, the Otsu method fails when the histogram is unimodal or close to unimodal. Defects have different shapes and sizes, ranging from very small to large. The gray-level distributions of the image histogram can vary between unimodal and multimodal.

Furthermore, we propose a method to stabilize the differences and automatically identify a global threshold to achieve a high detection rate. For the TRECVID 06 submitted runs, we tested the algorithm under the following conditions: • CU-UO-All-Runtype: 1 corresponds to the Precision set as determined by <b>automatic</b> <b>threshold</b> selection; • CU-UO-All-Runtype: 2 corresponds to the F 1 set as determined by <b>automatic</b> <b>threshold</b> selection; • CU-UO-All-Runtype: 3 corresponds to the Recall set as determined by <b>automatic</b> <b>threshold</b> selection; • The other runs correspond to various manually selected threshold values. One important aspect of our system resides in the user control ability over the type of acceptable errors; according to this, the system will select automatically the most appropriate threshold to minimize the specified type of error (false negatives versus false positives).
