30|$|The first {{process of}} our system is joints {{mobility}} measurement. In {{the beginning of the}} joints mobility measurement, in order to let Xtion PRO LIVE detect the subject successfully, the subject needs to stand in the restricted position. After detecting successfully, the subject can start the measurement. In addition, during the assessment, the subject is asked to wear our sensing device on his/her wrist for detecting subject’s body temperature. There are three sensors installed on this device, including a body temperature sensor, an <b>accelerator</b> <b>sensor,</b> and a gyroscope sensor. After the subject completes a designated posture, the inspector can keep going on next movement. After all testing movements are completed, the results are then recorded into the database.|$|E

Vibrations during HDD testing process significantly contribute to testing errors. Isolator and pocket slot were used to reduce the vibration. The physical property of isolators was charged, {{that led to the}} results of HDD testing. Because of the error, the testing process needs to be redone. As a result, the testing time is extended. This research developed a system to detect isolator function using “Ariduino Due” microcontroller along with “Micro-electromechanical System – MEMS” <b>accelerator</b> <b>sensor.</b> For the precise analysis, the statistical method called t test was used to group isolators by their functioning conditions. It was found that, the measured vibration amplitude in any direction canbe used as the criteria for identifying the isolator conditions. This detective system can determine the bad isolator at early stage before the exceeding vibration will affect the testing process. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Early {{detection}} of respiratory overload {{is crucial to}} mechanically ventilated patients, especially during phases of spontaneous breathing. Although a diversity of methods and indices has been established, there is no highly specific approach to predict respiratory failure. This study aimed to evaluate acceleration sensors in abdominal and thoracic wall positions to detect alterations in breathing excursions in a setting of gradual increasing airway resistance. Methods Twenty-nine healthy volunteers were committed to a standardized protocol of a two-minutes step-down spontaneous breathing on a 5  mm, 4  mm and then 3  mm orally placed endotracheal tube. <b>Accelerator</b> <b>sensors</b> in thoracic and abdominal wall position monitored breathing excursions. 15 participants passed the breathing protocol (“completed” group), 14 individuals cancelled the protocol due to subjective intolerance to the increasing airway resistance (“abandoned” group). Results Gradual increased respiratory workload led to a significant decrease of acceleration in abdominal wall position in the “abandoned” group compared to the “completed” group (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), while these gradual accelerating changes were not observed in thoracic wall position (p[*]=[*] 0. 484). Thoracic acceleration sensors did not detect any time- and group-specific changes (p[*]=[*] 0. 746). Conclusions The abdominal wall position of the acceleration sensors may be a non-invasive, economical and practical approach to detect early breathing alterations prior to respiratory failure.

40|$|A {{dramatic}} change in the research activity has taken place when high temperature superconductors (HTSCs) having Tc of 90 K, above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77 K), was established in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -δ (YBCO). We have selected the well-studied material, YBCO, as our parent material, for its relatively less anisotropic and less toxic nature with easily reproducible phase over other cuprates. HTSCs are widely used in various fields including medical diagnosis like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), Transistors, Josephson Junction Devices, Circuitry connections, Particle <b>accelerators,</b> <b>Sensors,</b> Energy Storage etc. The in-homogeneities such as mesoscopic in-homogeneities (grain boundaries, voids, and cracks), secondary phases and microscopic in homogeneities such as oxygen deficiencies, chemical in-homogeneities, and local strains are induced in the HTSC systems during their preparation. Hence, HTSCs are defect ridden. Properties of HTSC are modified by doping and making composites of ferroelectric, dielectric and magnetic materials. Composites of YBCO with other materials started flourishing to enhance material property such as critical temperature Tc, critical current density Jc, transition width ΔTc, normal state resistivity etc. Substitution at the Cu site is most important among all the cations of YBCO, as Cu-O networks {{play a major role}} for the occurrence of superconductivity in these materials. Ion irradiation can also improve the material’s property by the addition of defects. The controlled defects produced by the collision cascade obtained by fast moving neutrons, point defects created by low energy ion impact and columnar defects generated by swift heavy ions result in significant enhancement of critical current density. Because of the huge energy loss, the ions in a medium can bring several changes in the target system such as annealing of defects, additional defects, resistivity enhancement, phase change. Ion irradiation can also modify the local geometrical arrangements through introduction of defects which induces resistivity changes in HTSC. Studies on ion beam irradiation of thin films of YBCO showed that Tc can be controllably reduced. In the present thesis, an attempt has been made to understand the interplay between the inhomogeneities, secondary phases and the thermal fluctuations around the superconducting transitio...|$|R

30|$|Theoretical {{studies of}} {{magnetohydrodynamic}} flow and heat transfer over stretching surfaces have received great attention {{by virtue of}} their numerous applications in the fields of metallurgy and chemical engineering. Such applications include geothermal reservoirs, wire and fiber coating, food stuff processing, reactor fluidization, enhanced oil recovery, packed bed catalytic reactors and cooling of nuclear reactors. The primary aim in extrusion is to maintain the quality of the surface of the extricate. When the magnetic strength is strong, Hall currents cannot be neglected. In an ionized gas where the density is low and/or the magnetic field is very strong, the conductivity normal to the magnetic field is reduced due to the free spiraling of electrons and ions about the magnetic lines of force before suffering collisions, and a current is induced in a direction normal to both electric and magnetic fields. Due to Hall currents, the electrical conductivity of the fluid becomes anisotropic and this causes the secondary flow. The Hall effect is important when the Hall parameter, which is the ratio between the electron-cyclotron frequency and the electron-atom-collision frequency, is high. Hall currents are of great importance in many astrophysical problems, Hall <b>accelerators,</b> Hall <b>sensors</b> and flows of plasma in MHD power generators.|$|R
30|$|Pal and Mondal [9] {{presented}} {{a model to}} {{study the effects of}} temperature-dependent viscosity and variable conductivity on mixed convective diffusion of species over a stretching sheet. When the conducting fluid is an ionized gas, and the strength of the applied magnetic field is large, the conductivity normal to the magnetic field is reduced due to the free spiraling of electrons and ions about the magnetic lines of force before collisions occur and a current is induced in a direction normal to both electric and magnetic fields. This phenomenon is known as the Hall effect or Hall current. The conductivity of the fluid is anisotropic and the effect of Hall current cannot be neglected when the medium is rarefied or if a strong magnetic field is present. The study of MHD viscous flows with Hall current has important applications in problems of Hall <b>accelerators</b> and <b>sensors</b> as well as flight magnetohydrodynamics. Pop and Watanabe [10] presented the problem of free convection flow of a conducting fluid which is permeated by a transverse magnetic field and the Hall effect is taken into account. Abd El-Aziz [11] investigated the effect of Hall currents on the flow and heat transfer of an electrically conducting fluid over an unsteady stretching surface {{in the presence of a}} strong magnetic field.|$|R

50|$|Physical {{analysis}} {{conducted on}} Toyota’s {{electronic engine control}} system including <b>accelerator</b> pedal position <b>sensors</b> (APPSs) in 2011 showed {{the presence of a}} significant number of tin whiskers. Tin whiskers are elongated or needle-like structures of pure tin that grow from pure tin and tin alloy surfaces. Toyota's APPS were found to use tin finishes. These tin finishes can produce conductive tin whiskers capable of creating unintended electrical failures such as short circuits. The use of tin finish in Toyota's APPS is therefore a cause for concern. Similarly in 2013, materials used in an automotive engine control unit (ECU) from a 2008 Toyota Tundra truck were analyzed. It was found that pure tin with a nickel underlayer was used as the connector finish in the unit, and analysis revealed tin whiskers on the connector surface. Further testing under a standard temperature-humidity cycling showed tin whisker growth, raising additional reliability and safety concerns. These studies show that poor design choices, {{such as the use of}} tin finishes, result in unintended failures.|$|R

40|$|To {{enable a}} new {{generation}} of digital computing applications, the greatest challenge is to provide a better level of energy efficiency (intended as the performance that a system can provide within a certain power budget) without giving up a systems's flexibility. This constraint applies to digital system across all scales, starting from ultra-low power implanted devices up to datacenters for high-performance computing and for the "cloud". In this thesis, we show that architectural heterogeneity is the key to provide this efficiency and to respond to many of the challenges of tomorrow's computer architecture - {{and at the same time}} we show methodologies to introduce it with little or no loss in terms of flexibility. In particular, we show that heterogeneity can be employed to tackle the "walls" that impede further development of new computing applications: the utilization wall, i. e. the impossibility to keep all transistors on in deeply integrated chips, and the "data deluge", i. e. the amount of data to be processed that is scaling up much faster than the computing performance and efficiency. We introduce a methodology to improve heterogeneous design exploration of tightly coupled clusters; moreover we propose a fractal heterogeneity architecture that is a parallel <b>accelerator</b> for low-power <b>sensor</b> nodes, and is itself internally heterogeneous thanks to an heterogeneous coprocessor for brain-inspired computing. This platform, which is silicon-proven, can lead to more than 100 x improvement in terms of energy efficiency with respect to typical computing nodes used within the same domain, enabling the application of complex algorithms, vastly more performance-hungry than the current state-of-the-art in the ULP computing domain...|$|R
