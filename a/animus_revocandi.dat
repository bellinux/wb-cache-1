25|$|Treasure trove had to {{be hidden}} with <b>animus</b> <b>revocandi,</b> that is, an {{intention}} to recover it later. If an object was simply lost or abandoned (for instance, scattered {{on the surface of}} the earth or in the sea), it belonged either to the first person who found it or to the landowner according to the law of finders, that is, legal principles concerning the finding of objects. For this reason, the objects found in 1939 at Sutton Hoo were determined not to be treasure trove; as the objects were part of a ship burial, there had been no intention to recover the buried objects later. The Crown had a prerogative right to treasure trove, and if the circumstances under which an object was found raised a prima facie presumption that it had been hidden, it belonged to the Crown unless someone else could show a better title to it. The Crown could grant its right to treasure trove to any person in the form of a franchise.|$|E
