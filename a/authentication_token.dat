In this way, a service provider sends a text message that includes one time authorization code (OTAC) which is enciphered by digital certificate to a user for authentication. According to a report, mobile text messaging provides high security when it uses public key infrastructure (PKI) to provide bidirectional authentication and non-repudiation, which accord with theoretical analysis.|$|E
50|$|RSA Security LLC, {{formerly}} RSA Security, Inc. {{and doing}} business as RSA, is an American computer and network security company. RSA {{was named after}} the initials of its co-founders, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, after whom the RSA public key cryptography algorithm was also named. Among its products include the RSA BSAFE cryptography libraries and the SecurID <b>authentication</b> <b>token.</b> RSA is known for allegedly incorporating backdoors developed by the NSA in its products. It also organizes the annual RSA Conference, an information security conference.|$|E
50|$|The {{necessity}} of consulting a CRL (or other certificate status service) prior to accepting a certificate raises a potential denial-of-service {{attack against the}} PKI. If acceptance of a certificate fails {{in the absence of}} an available valid CRL, then no operations depending upon certificate acceptance can take place. This issue exists for Kerberos systems as well, where failure to retrieve a current <b>authentication</b> <b>token</b> will prevent system access. No comprehensive solutions to these problems are known, though there are multiple workarounds for various aspects, some of which have proven acceptable in practice.|$|E

5000|$|Typically {{users who}} have {{forgotten}} their password launch a self-service application from an extension to their workstation login prompt, {{using their own}} or another user's web browser, or through a telephone call. Users establish their identity, without using their forgotten or disabled password, by answering a series of personal questions, using a hardware <b>authentication</b> <b>token,</b> responding to a password notification e-mail or, less often, by providing a biometric sample such as voice recognition [...] Users can then either specify a new, unlocked password, or ask that a randomly generated one be provided.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common domain {{validation}} techniques involves sending an email containing an <b>authentication</b> <b>token</b> or link to an email address that is likely to be administratively responsible for the domain.

50|$|Access Control Service, or Windows Azure Access Control Service (ACS) is a Microsoft-owned {{cloud-based}} {{service that}} provides {{an easy way}} of authenticating and authorizing users {{to gain access to}} web applications and services while allowing the features of authentication and authorization to be factored out of the application code. This facilitates application development {{while at the same time}} providing users the benefit of being able to log into multiple applications with a reduced number of authentications, and in some cases only one authentication. The system provides an authorization store that can be accessed programmatically as well as via a management portal. Once authorizations are configured, a user coming to an application via ACS arrives at the application entrance with not only an <b>authentication</b> <b>token,</b> but also a set of authorization claims attached to the token.|$|E
50|$|From September 2016 until February 2017, a major CloudFlare bug (nicknamed Cloudbleed) leaked {{sensitive}} data—including passwords and <b>authentication</b> <b>tokens</b> from customer websites, {{by sending}} extra data {{in response to}} web requests. The leaks resulted from a buffer overflow, which occurred, according to analysis by CloudFlare, on approximately 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests.|$|R
40|$|In recent times, {{much has}} been made of the security, or lack thereof, {{utilised}} within Facebook’s content distribution network (CDN). Their CDN is noted to enable public access to any resource via a GET request presuming the user knows the URL for the resource. This means that not only can users directly access material that they would otherwise not have access to but it also means that material that has been considered 'deleted' may still be accessible. noncdn is a content distribution network designed to provide light-weight authenticated access to content stored at edge nodes with easily replicated authentication access through time limited <b>authentication</b> <b>tokens.</b> noncdn provides 'volumes' as a container for handling access control and authentication nodes for generation and validation of <b>authentication</b> <b>tokens.</b> As tokens identify individuals, accesses can be logged and tracked to provide extra auditing functionality. ...|$|R

50|$|The C2DM service {{consisted}} of sub-services and interfaces necessary with maintaining security and reliability. When an application registered for C2DM messages and data, it received a C2DM Registration ID from the service. This identifier was {{unique to the}} application on the device, and was used to identify the device that the data or message request was intended for. This identifier was typically sent by the client application to a server owned by the developer or creator for tracking and statistical purposes. Upon sending a data or push request, the server sent an authentication request and the C2DM Registration ID of the device to the C2DM authentication service, which responded with an <b>authentication</b> <b>token</b> upon success. The third party server then submitted both identifiers within the final data request to be enqueued {{and sent to the}} device. When the device received the information from the C2DM, the request was removed from the C2DM queue.|$|E
5000|$|WSE 3.0 was {{released}} in October 2005 and has design time support with Visual Studio 2005. It includes policy framework enhancements including security based on policy assertions (associating CLR client proxies with policy files), turnkey security scenarios for securing end to end messages, extensibility mechanisms for user-defined policies in code and a simplified policy model applied to a message exchange instead of on a per-message level. It supports updated web services specifications and a native 64-bit runtime. WS-SecureConversation sessions can be canceled explicitly and sessions are reliable and usable in web farm scenarios as Security Context Tokens can contain the original client <b>authentication</b> <b>token</b> when sent from the client to the service, which enable sessions to be re-established if lost, e.g. when a service's appdomain is reset. WSE 3.0 is wire-level interoperable over HTTP with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and supports the same version of the WS-* specifications as WCF (WS-Security 1.1, SOAP 1.2, MTOM).|$|E
50|$|Upon {{allowing}} the application permission to receive and display notifications, the client application sends a registration API {{request to the}} Google Cloud Messaging interface to begin the registration process. The GCM Service receives and acknowledges the request and responds by giving the device a GCM Registration ID, a unique identifier that the developer later uses to send a notification to the individual device. The identifier is stored onto the device, and is typically sent to the developer's application server to be stored. The GCM Registration ID is a randomly-generated identifier that does not contain any personal or device information that could allow a developer to discover the personal identity of the user. When the developer wishes to send a notification event to a device, the process begins with an API POST request {{being sent to the}} GCM Authentication Service. The POST request includes the GCM Registration ID, priority, optional values and links, and the information that is to be displayed on the device upon its arrival. Upon successful verification of the GCM Registration ID and other credentials, an <b>authentication</b> <b>token</b> is returned. Both identifiers are then sent to the GCM Service to be enqueued and delivered to the device.|$|E
50|$|On 19 February 2017 Google {{discovered}} a flaw within Cloudflare's reverse proxies, which caused their edge servers to run past {{the end of}} a buffer and return memory that contained private information such as HTTP cookies, <b>authentication</b> <b>tokens,</b> HTTP POST bodies, and other sensitive data. Some of this data was cached by search engines. A member of the Project Zero team referred to this flaw as Cloudbleed.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} Drifting Keys (DKs), {{a simple}} {{new approach to}} detecting device impersonation. DKs enable detection of complete compromise by an attacker of the device and its secret state, e. g., cryptographic keys. A DK evolves within a device randomly over time. Thus an attacker will create DKs that randomly diverge {{from those in the}} original, valid device over time, alerting a trusted verifier to the attack. DKs may be transmitted unidirectionally from a device, eliminating interaction between the device and verifier. Device emissions of DK values can be quite compact - even just a single bit - and DK evolution and emission require minimal computation. Thus DKs are well suited for highly constrained devices, such as sensors and hardware <b>authentication</b> <b>tokens.</b> We offer a formal adversarial model for DKs, and present a simple scheme that we prove essentially optimal (undominated) for a natural class of attack timelines. We explore application of this scheme to one-time passcode <b>authentication</b> <b>tokens.</b> Using the logs of a large enterprise, we experimentally study the effectiveness of DKs in detecting the compromise of such tokens...|$|R
