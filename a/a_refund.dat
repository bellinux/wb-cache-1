5|$|The PC version {{received}} less favorable reviews overall. Critics of it noted the unrefined controls, limited framerate to 30 FPS, {{and a lack}} of anti-aliasing or other advanced graphics options. Ubisoft's DRM for the game, in particular, received many complaints since a constant Internet connection is required when launching the game, even though it was initially reported that the game would simply require a one-time-only activation. There were also a large number of reports that the PC version had crashing issues, glitches, and a small bracket of supported graphics cards, rendering the game unplayable for some. Ubisoft later announced that it was developing a patch that would enable offline authentication; players who were unwilling to wait could ask for <b>a</b> <b>refund.</b>|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{medical records}} show that {{epilepsy}} has been affecting people {{at least since the}} beginning of recorded history. Throughout ancient history, the disease was thought to be a spiritual condition. The world's oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in Akkadian (a language used in ancient Mesopotamia) and was written around 2000 BC. The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a Moon god, and underwent an exorcism. Epileptic seizures are listed in the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1790 BC) as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for <b>a</b> <b>refund,</b> and the Edwin Smith Papyrus (c. 1700 BC) describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions.|$|E
5|$|Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), {{students}} and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes.

The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.|$|E

Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for <b>a</b> <b>refund.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Brunei's {{stake in}} the {{ownership}} of the hotel drew controversy in April 2014 when he initiated {{the first phase of}} a three-phase plan to adapt Brunei's legal system to include aspects of Sharia law implicating his approval of the persecution of homosexuals in the complex legal system there (a two part system involving separate courts and legislation for Islamic and non-Islamic citizens). In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded <b>a</b> <b>refund</b> of its deposit.
