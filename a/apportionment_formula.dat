This paper analyzes a two-country model with an international investor considering acquisitions of already existing target firms in a high-tax country and a low-tax country. The investor is able to shift profits from one location to another for tax saving purposes. Two systems of corporate taxation are compared, a system with separate accounting and a system with tax base consolidation and <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment.</b> It is shown that, under separate accounting, the number of acquisitions is inefficiently ciently high in both the high tax and the low tax country.

40|$|First, {{this paper}} gives an {{overview}} of the progress Europe has made in its development of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). Second, we use firm level data from a listed multinational to investigate how several designs for the CCCTB <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> could affect the allocation of the consolidated tax base. The design is relevant in the light of member states’ concern for protecting their tax revenues, {{as well as for the}} multinational companies’ tax minimizing possibilities. Moreover, it plays an important role in achieving an efficient and simple tax system. Simulating different apportionment formulas, the results show that including more factors and using more equal weights distributes the common tax base more equally, which could reduce the incentive to shift factors from high to low tax countries. The results also indicate that simplifying the factor definitions, leads to rather minor changes in the allocation. Using unpublished data, this study allows to investigate the consequences of different formulas in detail, which contributes to the current discussion on corporate tax harmonization in the EU.

40|$|The {{draft for}} a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base Directive in the European Union {{includes}} the suggestion for an <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> which allocates taxable group profits to group member corporations. These allocated profits shall then be taxed in the respective Member States. The draft directive delegates {{the right to}} define one factor of the <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula,</b> the term "Employee" to the Member States, who are therefore free to choose a narrow or a broad definition, the latter including also atypical employment schemes. Using a game-theoretic approach the paper shows that the individually rational strategy of any Member State to define "Employee" broadly so as to maximize {{the volume of the}} apportionment factor and thus maximize the allocated share of taxable income is only the best solution when tax rate differences and differences in the volume of atypical employment schemes are disregarded. If such differentials and the corporate groups' reactions to different Member States' definitions are included in modelling the game's pay-offs a narrow definition of "Employee" yields the highest individual pay-offs to the Member States involved. This change of dominant strategies is triggered by the corporate group's shifting of the employment factor from high-tax to low-tax Member States. Our paper differs from previous research on the economic effects of the CCCTB <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> as it is the first paper identifying and analysing the employment factor and its distorting effects. The paper discusses possible tax minimizing strategies for corporate groups by shifting workforce and develops a model to quantify these potential relocations.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} impact of the apportionment formulae used to divide corporate income taxes among the states. Most apportionment formulae, by including payroll, turn the state corporate income tax at least partially into a payroll tax. Using panel data from 1978 - 1994, the results show that this distortion has an important effect on state-level employment. For the average state, reducing the payroll weight from one-third to one-quarter increases manufacturing employment around 3 % and the result is highly robust. The results also indicate that apportionment changes have important negative externalities on other states in that the effects of the <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> on aggregate employment is zero. Every job gained within a state from an apportionment change is taken from another state. This externality suggests that the U. S. {{would be better off if}} the <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> were set at a federal level.

40|$|The European Commission is {{currently}} working on a legislative draft to harmonise the corporate income tax provisions for multinational groups of companies throughout the European Union. For that purpose the European Commission has installed a working group with the mission to draft a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) applicable for multinational companies. As the EU member states are not willing to surrender their taxing power to the supranational level of the EU each group entity's tax base would be determined by apportionment of the group's overall taxable income according to a predefined micro-economic factor based formula whereas the group income will be calculated by consolidating earnings beforehand separately determined by each group entity (preconsolidation income). The situs state of the particular group entity would then apply its statutory corporate tax rate on the apportioned tax base. This paper evaluates the effects of this prospective apportionment procedure on any given corporate group entity and finds that the share of the group's income allocated to a particular entity using the <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> does regularly not equal the pre-consolidation income of the respective group entity. The reasons for this regular observable deviation can be found on the one hand in the concept of the <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> and on the other hand in the specifics of the definitions of the apportionment factors.

40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{the impact that}} switching to single factor sales apportionment would have on job creation and tax revenue for the State of New York. The estimates we present {{are based on a}} statistical examination of the experiences of other states that have modified their <b>apportionment</b> <b>formulae</b> during the last two decades. The analysis controls for other factors that can affect employment, such as state corporate tax rates, state trends, national unemployment rates, and the actions of other states regarding their <b>apportionment</b> <b>formulae.</b> We find that increasing the weight on the sales factor has significant positive effects on in-state employment. Based on the analysis, we estimate that switching to single factor sales will have a long-run impact of increasing the number of manufacturing jobs in New York by about 3. 5 %, or about 32, 000 jobs. We further estimate that the non-manufacturing sector would grow by about 1. 3 %, or 101, 000 jobs. Together, the additional jobs would have a significant positive impact on the personal tax revenue collected by the State of New York. We estimate the long-run increase in personal tax revenue at approximately $ 184 to $ 247 million per year, an increase equivalent to 0. 9 % to 1. 2 % of the New York’s fiscal year 1999 personal tax revenue of $ 20. 6 billion.
