500|$|The {{shipyard}} generated high {{employment to}} Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town's historian {{and member of}} parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: [...] "There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> there {{for an hour or}} two, reader, you will be black". According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir Charles Palmer, [...] "regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable".|$|E

2500|$|We {{seized the}} entire {{records of the}} Iraqi Nuclear program, {{especially}} the administrative records. We got a name of everybody, where they worked, what they did, {{and the top of}} the list, Saddam's [...] "Bombmaker" [...] was a man named Jafar Dhia Jafar, not Khidir Hamza, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> down the list of the senior administrative personnel you will not find Hamza's name in there. In fact, we didn't find his name at all. Because in 1990, he didn't work for the Iraqi Nuclear Program. He had no knowledge of it because he worked as a kickback specialist for Hussein Kamel in the Presidential Palace.|$|E

Eubulus, a comic author, offers these courtesans derision: [...] "plastered over with layers of white lead, … jowls smeared with mulberry juice. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out on a summer's day, two rills of inky water flow from your eyes, and the sweat rolling from your cheeks upon your throat makes a vermilion furrow, while the hairs blown about on your faces look grey, they are so full of white lead".|$|E
2500|$|After the {{announcement}} on August 20, 2008, that Season 5 of Atlantis would be its last, {{it was announced}} the following day (August 21, 2008) that the series would be continued {{with at least one}} 2-hour direct-to-DVD movie. More movies were expected to follow in the Atlantis series if the first movie was to be successful. Executive producer Joseph Mallozzi has said that the rise of the Canadian dollar and the decline of the American dollar has made life harder for Canadian television since it has become more expensive. He further stated [...] "Both MGM and Sci Fi have been great supporters of the show <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> by SG-1s example, fans can be assured {{that the end of the}} series will not be the end of Atlantis." ...|$|E
