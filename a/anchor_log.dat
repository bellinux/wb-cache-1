5000|$|An {{emerging}} stream restoration {{technique is}} {{the installation of}} engineered log jams. Reintroduction of large woody debris into a stream is a fairly recent method that is being experimented with in streams such as Lagunitas Creek in Marin County, California [...] and Thornton Creek, in Seattle, Washington. Because of channelization and removal of woody debris, many streams now lack the hydraulic complexity {{that is necessary to}} maintain bank stabilization and a healthy plant/animal habitat. Engineered log jams are individually designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific restoration projects, but there are overarching design elements. One element is to <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> along the stream bank in order to create a physical blockade against erosion. Large wood pieces, both living [...] and dead, play an important role in the long-term stability of engineered log jams. A second element of engineered log jams is to improve fish habitat. Log jams add diversity to the water flow by creating riffles, pools, and temperature variations. This is vital to fish because it provides the right circumstances to spawn, rest, feed, hunt, and hide.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of our {{participation}} in the Session track is to further evaluate our anchor expansion technique proposed {{in the previous year}} [1]. In particular, we aim to test the effectiveness of this approach on a more realistic dataset collected this year. SWIRL 2012 noted that there is still a large gap between the study of users and the study of IR algorithms [2], so the session data collected for this year’s session track aimed at addressing some of the suggestions made in the SWIRL 2012 report. We exploit the <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> to derive query expansions that are relevant to user information needs throughout the session. Anchor text has shown to be effective for a variety of information retrieval tasks. This include the diversity task in the TREC Web track [3]. Anchor text can be considered as a replacement to user queries as often web authors use similar labels to describe web pages to those used by searchers to find them [4].

40|$|Cable yarding systems (also {{sometimes}} {{known as}} skyline yarding systems) are a versatile means for transporting materials in mountainous terrain in situations {{that do not}} allow for conventional harvesting methods such as ground skidding or shovel-logging. Adequate ground anchors are necessary for the safe operation of cable yarding systems. Anchored guylines stabilize the yarding tower enabling the safe transport of payloads. Typically, the anchors employed in these operations are available stumps or trees. Where adequate stumps or trees are not available, a variety of alternative anchors can be applied. These includes buried deadman <b>anchors,</b> <b>log</b> decks, engineered earth anchors, rock bolts, and mobile equipment anchors such as bulldozers or skidders. This report {{provides an overview of}} cable yarding systems and the various anchoring systems {{that can be used to}} support them. The report describes mobile anchors in detail and presents the results of a series of physical load tests used to evaluate their stability. An analytical design solution for mobile anchor capacity based on force equilibrium analyses is presented. The information presented herein, including mobile anchor testing and analysis, is intended to serve as an instructive document outlining safe guidelines and considerations for implementation of mobile anchor systems. The intent is that this report and the field guide will expedite forest operations, reduce timber harvesting costs and, most importantly, protect workers involved in cable yarding operations...|$|R

They have cleaned the river as far down a Byron each year. Volunteer crews remove dead falls, and woody debris, which are anchored to the banks for shore protection and fish habitat; and remove garbage to allow canoe/kayak paddling. This will allow paddlers to start in Holly, do a small portage at Fenton dam, and continue on to Lake Ponemah. The more adventuresome can go as far as the dam in Byron. Every year Headwaters Trails hosts an annual Shiawassee River Paddle along the river between Holly and Fenton in June, known as the [...] "Adventure Paddle". In the October, it hosts [...] "Canoeing in Color", a time to see migrating birds and the changing of the leaves to brilliant fall colors. These paddles are to raise awareness of the river to the community and help support the efforts of Headwaters Trails to continue making improvements in the form of new places to put in the river as well as signage and fund the purchase of things like steel cables to <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> to the banks of the river. They work closely with the communities along the river to promote and conserve that trail as a place where paddle craft can go and where fish habitat is preserved. The number of Kingfishers, Blue Herons and other fishing birds is a tribute to that effort.|$|R

The links were carted to New Windsor, where they were put together, and floated down the river to West Point on logs late in April. Including swivels, clevises, and anchors, the chain weighed 65 tons. For buoyancy, 40 ft logs were cut into 16 ft sections, waterproofed, and joined by fours into rafts fastened with 12 ft timbers. Short sections of chain (10 links, a swivel, and a clevis) were stapled across each raft and later, in the river, the chain sections were united. Peter Townsend, owner of Sterling Iron Works, was paid by the Continental Congress to manufacture the chain.Captain Thomas Machin, the Artillery Officer and engineer who had installed the chain at Fort Montgomery, {{was assigned to the}} same task at West Point.

It flourished in 1970s and 1980s along with increase in exports of tropical timber from Sarawak. It later shifted its focus into steel boat building. Some of the vessels in demand are tug boats for towing logs, barges for carrying <b>logs,</b> <b>anchor</b> handlers, Offshore Support Vessels (OSV), ferries, and express boats for carrying passengers. Most of the boats built are of small and medium in size. There are a total of 40 shipyards in Sibu. A majority of the workers are welders. In 2003, 17 of the shipyards were relocated to Rantau Panjang Integrated Shipyard Shipbuilding Industrial Zone, Sibu. This included Yong Chin Kui, Far East, and TuongAik.

40|$|Result {{diversification}} {{deals with}} ambiguous or multi-faceted queries by providing documents that cover as many subtopics of a query as possible. Various approaches to subtopic modeling have been proposed. Subtopics have been extracted internally, e. g., from re-trieved documents, and externally, e. g., from Web {{resources such as}} query logs. Internally modeled subtopics are often implicitly rep-resented, e. g., as latent topics, while externally modeled subtopics are often explicitly represented, e. g., as reformulated queries. We propose a framework that: i) combines both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics; and ii) allows flexible combina-tion of multiple external resources in a transparent and unified man-ner. Specifically, we use a random walk based approach to estimate the similarities of the explicit subtopics mined {{from a number of}} heterogeneous resources: click <b>logs,</b> <b>anchor</b> text, and web n-grams. We then use these similarities to regularize the latent topics ex-tracted from the top-ranked documents, i. e., the internal (implicit) subtopics. Empirical results show that regularization with explicit subtopics extracted from the right resource leads to improved diver-sification results, indicating that the proposed regularization with (explicit) external resources forms better (implicit) topic models. Click <b>logs</b> and <b>anchor</b> text are shown to be more effective resources than web n-grams under current experimental settings. Combining resources does not always lead to better results, but achieves a ro-bust performance. This robustness is important for two reasons: it cannot be predicted which resources will be most effective for a given query, and it is not yet known how to reliably determine the optimal model parameters for building implicit topic models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The local {{magnitude}} scale M L is an empirically {{derived scale}} anchored to a zero magnitude reference event. Richter defined the amplitude of ground shaking at an epicentral distance of 100 km for a zero magnitude earthquake in southern California. The crustal attenuation characteristics of Taiwan {{result in a}} relatively high M L when compared to moment magnitude, M w. We therefore define a revised M L scale for crustal earthquakes in the Taiwan region that is more consistent with M w. Using observed peak ground shaking and M w, we determine a new log A 0 curve of ground shaking versus hypocentral distance, R, for a zero magnitude earthquake, and station correction factors. The log A 0 curve determined in this study is, log A (R) � 0. 332 � 1. 568 • log(R) � 0. 280. 0 Using this new log A 0 curve and station corrections, the new M L is more consistent with M w, with a 0. 2 magnitude unit uncertainty. The new log A 0 curve has a value of � 2. 80 at the distance of 100 km compared to the <b>anchor</b> point of <b>log</b> A 0 �� 3 at the same distance as defined by Richter for southern California. This means that the current M L estimates in Taiwan (which use Richter’s definition) average 0. 2 magnitude units larger than their M w. The station correction factors also determined are large, from � 0. 40 to 0. 52 magnitude units. The use of station corrections in routine seismic network operation in Taiwan will improve magnitude estimates. This is particularly important for smaller events when recording stations may be predominantly on either hard rock or soft soil sites, {{which could lead to}} under- or overestimates of the magnitude by up to half a magnitude unit...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{managers}} {{in recent years}} have begun to re-examine the possibilities of using uneven-age silvicultural systems in the Oregon Coast Range. This increasing interest is being driven by a variety of forest resource nianagement concerns, including wildlife habitat diversity, visual aesthetics, and long-term sustained yield. In an effort to begin systematic exploration of coastal uneven-age silvicultural techniques, Oregon State University (OStJ) researchers have established a demonstration site at Forest Peak on OSU's Dunn Forest. This case study involving a single treatment at a single site reports on the design, performance, and cost of the skyline logging operation during Septeither and October 1992 which was designed to achieve the goals of an uneven-age management prescription prepared by OSU silvicultural and wildlife specialists. The operation harvested 13. 9 MBF of 23 -inch average dbh Douglas-fir and grand fir timber. The study tracked the time spent in planning and laying out the logging system. Field and office planning and layout procedures took 93. 75 hours to conplete at a cost of 6. 47 /MBF. The project also involved detailed time studies and shiftlevel analyses of both the felling/bucking and the yarding phases of the logging operation. A two-nan felling crew produced 6. 44 MBF/Hr at a cost of 1 O. 44 /MBF. Cutting cycle time averaged 9. 22 minutes per tree, with nixnther of logs per tree, cutting method (wedges or no wedges), percent ground slope, and base dianeter the most influential factors affecting cutting cycle time. The six-man yarding crew using a Thunderbird TTY 5 O yarder and small Danebo MSP carriage yarded 4. 7 MBF/Hr at a cost of 58. 51 /MBF. Yarding cycle time averaged 5. 73 minutes per turn, with corridor yarding distance, lateral yarding distance, choker setting method (pre-set or hot-set), and number of logs per turn the most influential factors affecting yrding cycle time. The six-man crew plus the hook tender averaged 1. 82 hours for each change of yarding corridors. Corridor changes involved moving all rigging from one corridor to the next and repositioning the yarder if necessary. The hook tender alone spent an additional 1. 31 hours per corridor pre-rigging tail trees, <b>anchors,</b> etc. Total <b>logging</b> cost including planning and layout, felling and bucking, yarding, loading, and equipment move-in was 104. 03 /MBF...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Watershed Management, 2011 Whole tree {{materials}} that include trees with attached rootwads, logs, and branches {{are recognized as}} important components of streams flowing through coastal redwood forests of Northern California. As {{the understanding of the}} importance of large wood materials has emerged, they have been recognized as key physical elements missing from many streams due to the historic and systematic removal associated with timber harvest and stream cleaning practices. The recognition of the ecological importance of wood materials within stream and floodplain ecosystems has led scientists and managers to advocate for the re-introduction of large wood directly into these environments. However, common applications of instream wood restoration can fall short of producing features capable of inducing the physical changes necessary to achieve desired restoration objectives, such as the formation of deep pools and cover. Current research shows that natural wood jams, with increased wood piece counts and volumes, are more effective at producing the hydraulic and geomorphic conditions necessary for creating and sustaining complex habitat. This study hypothesized that wood jams constructed with whole tree materials, increased wood piece counts, and greater wood volumes would be more effective than simple structures at creating the hydraulic conditions necessary for increasing instream complexity, geomorphic function, and aquatic habitat quality. Results were based on an evaluation of changes to surface sediment textures and channel morphology at ten constructed wood features built with varying complexity and wood volumes. Eight of these features were complex wood jams constructed with whole tree materials including large diameter trees with attached rootwad, logs, and branches. Each complex jam was individually designed to interact with seasonal variations in stream flow, floodplain morphology, and the dominant sediment transport regime. Two of the studied features were ???simple structures??? constructed in 1995 and comprised of one or two <b>logs</b> <b>anchored</b> to imported boulders with cable. The simple structures were designed following a standard California restoration protocol. Results indicate that complex wood jams were more effective than simple fish habitat structures in achieving common restoration objectives that include: (1) increasing percentage pool cover; (2) increasing scour pool habitat; (3) metering and sorting salmon spawning gravels; and (4) improving habitat heterogeneity. In addition, the effectiveness of an individual constructed jam improved as the overall wood piece count and volume within the jam increased. The increase in pool depths demonstrate that complex wood jams were effective at improving over summering and overwintering pool habitats for steelhead trout, coho salmon, and Chinook salmon...|$|R
