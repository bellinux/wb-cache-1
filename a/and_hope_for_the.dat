25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} this {{approach}} is to look at mental illness or distress {{from the perspective of a}} spiritual crisis. Spiritual interventions focus on developing a sense of meaning, purpose <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> person in their current life experience. Spiritual interventions involve listening to the person's story and facilitating the person to connect to God, a greater power or greater whole, perhaps by using meditation or prayer. This may be a religious or non-religious experience depending on the individual's own spirituality. Spiritual interventions, along with psychosocial interventions, emphasize the importance of engagement, however, spiritual interventions focus more on caring and 'being with' the person during their time of crisis, rather than intervening and trying and 'fix' the problem. Spiritual interventions tend to be based on qualitative research and share some similarities with the humanistic approach to psychotherapy.|$|E

500|$|In June 1999, Time {{magazine}} {{published a}} special edition titled [...] "". Anne Frank was selected {{as one of the}} [...] "Heroes & Icons", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, [...] "The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world—the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future of human beings." [...] He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, [...] "The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Jacques-Belletête {{acted as}} the game's art director, being {{in charge of}} {{creating}} its look. The two key visual themes were the Icarus myth and the artwork of the Renaissance: both were woven in on a narrative and visual level. In terms of colors, the team drew inspiration from notable Renaissance artists, including Johannes Vermeer and Rembrandt. The color scheme was dominated by black and gold: black represented the game's dystopian aspects, while the gold both humanity <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future. The Renaissance styling originally permeated everything, but they were ending up with crates looking like baroque furniture, so they toned it down and blended it with modern and cyberpunk elements. During development, the team coined the term [...] "cyber-renaissance" [...] to define their blending of Renaissance styling, cyberpunk elements, and the Icarus myth. An extensive amount of concept art was created for the game: while the majority was handled by artists Richard Dumont and Eric Gagnon, other contributors included Jim Murray, Brian Dugan, Theirry Doizon, Trong Nguyen and Sébastien Larroudé.|$|E
500|$|Musicologist and pianist Guthrie Ramsay Jr. {{describes}} Illmatic as “an artistic emblem” that “anchors {{itself in}} the moment while reminding us that powerful musical statements often select past material and knowledge {{for use in the}} present <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future.” Kevin Coval considers the sampling of artists Craig G and Biz Markie in 'Memory Lane' as an attempt to build upon the hip hop tradition of Queens, most notably the Juice Crew All Stars. These samples are intended to serve as tributes to “Nas's lyrical [...] and around-the-way influences. He is repping his borough’s hip hop canon.” The involvement of older artists, including Nas’s father, has also been cited as a formative influence in the making of Illmatic. Author Adam Mansbach argues, “It's the presence of all these benevolent elders –his father and the cadre of big brother producers steering the album – that empowers Nas to rest comfortably in his identity as an artist and an inheritor of tradition, and thus find the space to innovate.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{final stage}} of the rally took place on Sunday morning. After {{conducting}} the entire race in France the organisers only paid {{lip service to the}} principality by holding a Super Special Stage there. It involved two laps of part of the Circuit de Monaco for a total distance of , with two cars on the road at the same time but starting at two different points along the track so that they did not interfere with each other. Because the Service Park was in Valence, repairs, adjustments, refuelling and tyre changes were carried out on Saturday night ahead of the drive down to the coast. The decision about which tyres to fit on the cars was taken out of the teams' hands. ACM ordered that all the cars would drive on the snow tyres that the teams had been allocated, but had not been used because of the dry weather, a decision that was described as [...] "absurd" [...] because the cars ended up drifting through the corners. Loeb's, Sordo's and Grönholm's lead times so far ahead of anyone else's, so the interest in Stage 15 was on Hirvonen and Atkinson. Only eight-tenths of a second made the difference between a fourth-place position and five points, and fifth-placed position and four points. Hirvonen, who was in fourth place, completed the stage in , and admitted, [...] " [...] a few small mistakes, and that can be it. Nothing more I can do. We'll see how Chris drives <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best.". Atkinson drove opposite Grönholm on the stage, with Hirvonen watching from the sidelines. To beat Hirvonen, he had to complete the stage in [...] He was one-tenth of a second quicker than that, which won him the stage and fourth place in the rally.|$|E

It's real distinct, and I can't count her beat half the time. Instead, I just put a little guitar line over it, like the lick in 'Tattooed Love Boys'" [...] (Guitar Player, 1981). He joked about his other strategy: [...] "I've never told them I can't work out their time at all! They are used to me coming in a bar too late; they think that's the way I play.

You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best. If you want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds.
