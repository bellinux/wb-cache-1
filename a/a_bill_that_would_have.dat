5|$|Stanley's {{administration}} {{was affected by}} the United States' entry into World War I. The legislature established and funded a state Council of Defense, but Stanley vetoed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> banned the teaching of German in public schools.|$|E
5|$|During Washington's administration, the President {{was given}} broad powers for {{removing}} {{officials in the}} executive branch. Congress passed a bill sponsored by James Madison that gave the President the power to remove public officials whose appointments mandated Senatorial approval. In 1789, Vice President John Adams cast the deciding vote in the Senate against <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> mandated senatorial consent {{for the removal of}} Senate-confirmed federal and cabinet appointments. The bill had been sponsored by Pennsylvania Senator William Maclay.|$|E

5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{allowed the}} {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; {{despite the fact that}} the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E
5|$|The state's liquor {{prohibition}} law was a {{major political}} issues at the time, and Talbot was a strict prohibitionist. During this term he vetoed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since {{it was the first}} victory for a Democrat in that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E

5000|$|Legislatively, in {{the first}} quarter of the year 82 {{relevant}} bills were introduced around the country. At the close of the quarter, most of the bills remained pending. For example, legislators in Hawaii introduced <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> create <b>an</b> energy storage tax credit. In California, the state Senate had <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> [...] "create <b>a</b> new energy storage rebate program." ...|$|R

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{provided}} {{funds to}} protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site {{to protect it from}} the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, {{failed to make the}} statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E

25|$|In 1917, during World War I, a rule {{allowing}} cloture of {{a debate}} {{was adopted by the}} Senate on a 76-3 roll call vote at the urging of President Woodrow Wilson, after a group of 12 anti-war senators managed to kill <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> allowed Wilson to arm merchant vessels in the face of unrestricted German submarine warfare.|$|E

County Executive Isiah Leggett, who supported the bill, said the fees would have helped close the budget gap and help fund improvements to the county's emergency services. Opponents of the bill were skeptical that insurance companies would pay the fees and wondered if the fees would reduce emergency service calls.|$|E
25|$|The Government (usually {{through the}} Minister of Finance) {{has the power}} (given by the House's Standing Orders) to veto any bill (or {{amendment}} to <b>a</b> <b>bill)</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{a major impact on}} the Government's budget and expenditure plans. This veto could be invoked at any stage of the process, but if applied to a bill as a whole would most likely be employed at the Second Reading stage. This has not occurred since the veto power was introduced in 1996, although many amendments have been vetoed at the Committee of the whole House stage (see below).|$|E
25|$|House rules forbid {{members to}} accept travel {{expenses}} from lobbyists, and require that members inquire into {{the sources of}} funds that nonprofits use to pay for trips. DeLay denied knowing that lobbyists had paid for travel expenses. In July 2000, DeLay voted against <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> restricted Internet gambling. Both eLottery and the Choctaws opposed the bill. Rudy, who was then DeLay's deputy chief of staff, doomed the bill by engineering a parliamentary maneuver that required a two-thirds majority vote, rather than a simple majority, for the bill to pass. Rudy's actions on behalf of Abramoff's clients during this time were mentioned in Abramoff's guilty plea in January 2006.|$|E

In an interview with Newsweek in 2007, she affirmed her support for an amendment to the state constitution denying benefits to same-sex couples. She later signed a bill ordering a non-binding referendum for a constitutional amendment to deny the benefits. Although the referendum passed in April 2007, with 53 percent of voters supporting a constitutional amendment, a bill to place such an amendment on the ballot in November 2008 stalled in the state legislature.|$|E
25|$|The sale of {{the team}} to a large {{corporation}} drew the ire of Colorado U.S. Senator Edwin C. Johnson, who introduced <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> exempted teams owned by beer or liquor manufacturers from the antitrust exemption granted to Major League Baseball by the Supreme Court. He argued that Busch had bought the team solely to sell beer, and {{that as a result}} other companies would have to buy baseball teams to remain competitive, leading to monopolies in both businesses. When it was pointed out to him that no one had objected to brewer Jacob Ruppert's ownership of the New York Yankees, he responded that Ruppert had always kept both businesses separate.|$|E
25|$|This {{observation}} is being {{shared by many}} Americans today and {{is considered by many}} experts to be indicative of the current climate. However, the U.S. Labor Department is examining regulations that give workers unpaid leave to deal with family or medical emergencies (a review that supporters of the FMLA worry might be a prelude to scaling back these protections, as requested by some business groups). Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut proposed legislation that would enable workers to take six weeks of paid leave. Congress was also expected to reconsider the Healthy Families Act, <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> required employers with at least fifteen employees to provide seven paid sick days per year.|$|E
