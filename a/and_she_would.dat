5|$|Teresa Geter {{was a big}} contributor, as well, {{with five}} blocked shots. Clement was able to play the game, but it set her rehab back, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not play again for over a month.|$|E
5|$|At Kanshi Ram's funeral ceremonies in 2006, Mayawati {{stated that}} both Kanshi Ram and herself had been, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{continue}} to be, observant of Buddhist traditions and customs. She has stated her intention to formally convert to Buddhism when the political conditions enable {{her to become}} Prime Minister of India. Her act of performing the last rites (traditionally done by a male heir) was an expression of their views against gender discrimination. When she was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, she publicly called Bhikkhus to prayer.|$|E
50|$|Sprague {{stated that}} she was a fan of Feldman's ever since {{childhood}} <b>and</b> <b>she</b> knew <b>she</b> <b>would</b> marry him some day.|$|R
60|$|Lastly, {{she pictured}} to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps {{even with the}} dream of Wonderland of long ago: <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a {{pleasure}} in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Cromarty {{admitted}} that she was nice looking; but was critical as to her carriage <b>and</b> manner. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> be admired by young officers, no doubt, but {{there was too much}} life and animation about her, <b>and</b> although <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not exactly say that she stooped, she was likely to do so in time.|$|R
5|$|De Soto was {{originally}} a privately owned vessel, built for passenger service between New York and New Orleans. With {{the outbreak of}} the Civil War in 1861, she was purchased by the Navy, commissioned as USS De Soto, and sent to assist with the blockade of Confederate ports. De Sotos speed made her an effective pursuit ship, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> capture or bring about the destruction of a total of eighteen blockade runners during the war.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen and locks her in a crate telling {{her that if she}} is not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> die. He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Jaime Lannister {{arrives in}} King's Landing bearing Myrcella's body, {{and returns to}} his sister Cersei Lannister. Cersei recounts the prophecy which Maggy the Frog told her as a child, when she was told all her {{children}} would die before her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be left with nothing. Jaime promises {{that they will have}} revenge against all who have wronged the Lannisters, heightening the importance of he and Cersei staying close.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> so <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> <b>and</b> no {{one would}} have {{wondered}} in those days.|$|R
60|$|Then she thought, (in a dream {{within the}} dream, as it were,) how this same little Alice would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> keep, through her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> gather around her other little children, {{and make their}} eyes bright and eager with many a {{wonderful}} tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little Alice of long-ago: <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.|$|R
50|$|Sarah Fullerton {{has been}} a rising star on the curling scene in Prince Edward Island. In 2003, she {{captured}} the P.E.I 11 <b>and</b> under title. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> also win the 15 and under title in 2006, and between 2006 <b>and</b> 2009 <b>she</b> <b>would</b> capture the 17 and under title three times.|$|R
5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the film was released, late Muppet creator Jim Henson {{proposed}} a live-action show based on the film, titled Little Mermaid's Island. Ariel was to be portrayed by Marietta DePrima, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> interact with various puppet characters created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Two episodes of this series were filmed but not aired due to complications after Henson's death.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki {{was born}} in Osaka, Japan on November 5, 1996, as the {{youngest}} of three children. She began aspiring to become a singer at a young age, taking dance lessons through the encouragement of her mother, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> begin participating in singing competitions {{by the age of}} six. After being inspired in high school by the character Sheryl Nome from the anime series Macross Frontier, she decided that she wanted to become an anison singer. She applied for the Animax All-Japan Anisong Grand Prix in 2010 but failed to qualify.|$|E

5|$|The Cookes {{enforced}} {{a strict}} moral code {{on the children}} especially on their sexual misconduct and punished them severely for any infractions. Around {{the time he was}} ten, Kali was found in the room of Emma Rooke and severely punished by Amos Starr Cooke for suspected indecency. Emma was not punished because Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau may possibly have been with Emma and others in the room at the time. Emma was nine years old at the time, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> one day marry Alexander Liholiho, i. e. King Kamehameha IV.|$|E
5|$|While at Busen, Abbe also {{enrolled}} in Hajime Tanabe's philosophy class at Kyoto University (then known as Kyoto Teikoku Daigaku, or 'Kyoto Imperial University'). During this period, his sister Toyoko began studying Tendō-ryū naginata under a female instructor named Mitamura Chiyo (in Japan, arts {{focusing on the}} handling of naginata have been practiced almost exclusively by women since the Edo period), <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> continue practicing that art {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was caught}} by {{surprise}} at Le Mans but made a forced march north to Alençon, from where he could escape into the safety of Normandy. Suddenly, however, Henry turned back south towards Anjou, {{against the advice of}} his officials. The weather was extremely hot, the King was increasingly ill and he appears to have wanted to die peacefully in Anjou rather than fight yet another campaign. Henry evaded the enemy forces on his way south and collapsed in his castle at Chinon. Philip and Richard were making good progress, not least because it was now obvious that Henry was dying and that Richard would be the next king, and the pair offered negotiations. They met at Ballan, where Henry, only just able to remain seated on his horse, agreed to a complete surrender: he would do homage to Philip; he would give up Alice to a guardian <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> marry Richard {{at the end of the}} coming crusade; he would recognise Richard as his heir; he would pay Philip compensation, and key castles would be given to Philip as a guarantee.|$|E
60|$|And {{he remembered}} Hugh Mountjoy. Iris {{would be with}} him--the man whose affection was only brought out in the {{stronger}} light by his respect, his devotion, <b>and</b> his delicacy. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> be in his society: <b>she</b> <b>would</b> understand {{the true meaning of}} this respect <b>and</b> delicacy: <b>she</b> <b>would</b> appreciate the depth of his devotion: <b>she</b> <b>would</b> contrast Hugh, the man she might have married, with himself, the man she did marry.|$|R
50|$|She {{announced}} her pregnancy on June 11, <b>and</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not {{play in the}} 2016 ANZ Championship.|$|R

5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
5|$|She was {{selected}} {{to play in a}} four-game test series in Canberra against Japan's wheelchair basketball team held in March 2002, the first Australian hosted international for the team since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, and at the 2002 World Cup event in Japan, but did not do so. She quit the sport after being told that neither insurance nor the Australian Paralympic Committee would cover her against injury during a tour in the United States, as her tendonitis was considered a there, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have to pay the costs for injury treatment herself. She quit wheelchair basketball. She had a child, which caused a recurrence of her original illness.|$|E

5|$|Tegetthoff {{was laid}} down in 1876 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. The ship was launched in 1878, and completed in 1881. She conducted her sea trials in October of that year, and was finally ready for commissioning in September 1882; Kaiser Franz Joseph attended the commissioning of the ship in Pola. Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship's completion; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish the ship in November 1881. At the time, she was {{the largest and most}} powerful ship in the Austro-Hungarian fleet, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> keep that distinction until {{after the turn of the}} century. She was, nevertheless, a political compromise, and was much smaller than foreign casemate ships, particularly British and French vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jamie presents Dylan {{with the}} contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. Not knowing {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. They {{come to the conclusion that}} sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{developed}} {{as a vehicle for}} Eve under the working title The Opposite Sex; UPN executives approached the rapper about a television project after the success of fellow musician Brandy in another of the network's sitcoms—Moesha. Eve's series was created as part of the network's attempt to appeal to a younger audience. After being picked up, the show was renamed Eve to attract the rapper's fans. The series was set in Miami, but filmed at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Eve said that she was intimidated at first by the process of preparing for and filming a sitcom, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> later regret not fully committing to her character. The show was distributed by UPN in its original run, and later by TV One. UPN had promoted Eve as part of its new comedy block, one of four new comedies developed by the network.|$|E
