5|$|Boniface {{clashed with}} Henry's half-brothers, the Lusignans, {{who arrived in}} England in 1247 and competed for lands and {{promotions}} with the queens' Savoy relatives. Boniface's quarrel with Aymer de Valence over a hospital in Southwark led to the archbishop's palace at Lambeth being plundered and one of Boniface's functionaries being kidnapped. The dispute with Aymer was only settled in early 1253. Boniface was once more absent from England from October 1254 to November 1256, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> that time in Savoy where he attempted to help his brothers rescue their eldest brother Thomas who was being held captive at Turin.|$|E

When he returned from the war, Morris began and ran an academy that trained both boys and girls together, a rarity at the time.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{started his}} cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. He {{struggled}} {{to break into}} the first team with his new county, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his time with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team.

The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|Kimball {{graduated}} from high school in May 1914, and one week later, he was called to serve as a missionary in the Swiss–German Mission. Less than two months later, his mission call was halted by the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and the subsequent outbreak of World War I.

5|$|Later in June, {{the ship}} rejoined the 9th Destroyer Flotilla <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the next two}} years escorting convoys. Late in 1940 the Flotilla was redesignated as the 9th Escort Group. Havelock was {{attached}} to Force H in Gibraltar to reinforce the escort during Operations Tiger in May 1941. The ship returned to the Western Approaches command afterwards as her anti-aircraft capability was believed by Admiral James Somerville to be too weak for operations in the Mediterranean.|$|E

The ship played a minor role in World War II as she was initially assigned to the Northern Patrol, but became a training ship in late 1940 and continued in that role for the rest of the war. Cardiff was sold for scrap in early 1946 and subsequently broken up.|$|E

The season marked the second time that the Ivy League had three 20-win teams (Harvard, Penn and Princeton).|$|E
5|$|The Chili Peppers {{collaborated with}} {{producer}} Rick Rubin for their second record with Frusciante, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Rubin {{felt that it}} was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting, so he suggested an old Hollywood Hills mansion, and the band agreed. Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their time smoking marijuana. Around this time, Frusciante started a side collaboration with Flea and Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins called The Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly ten to fifteen hours of material, none of which has ever been released.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and {{told him she was}} dying. He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E

5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: {{at the time of}} the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{accepted}} his narrow defeat <b>and</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the next year}} working on the second volume of Twenty Years of Congress. The book continued to earn him enough money to support his lavish household and pay off his debts. Although he spoke to friends of retiring from politics, Blaine still attended dinners and commented on the Cleveland administration’s policies. By {{the time of the}} 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially {{in his home state of}} Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
