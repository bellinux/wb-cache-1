5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare reform bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n <b>alternative</b> <b>that</b> would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The binary GCD {{algorithm}} is an efficient <b>alternative</b> <b>that</b> substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the binary representation used by computers. However, this alternative also scales like O(h²). It is generally {{faster than the}} Euclidean algorithm on real computers, even though it scales in the same way. Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b. The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases (k-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed. Lehmer's GCD algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.|$|E

In 1941, he derived the exact {{distribution of the}} ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin–Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the <b>alternative</b> <b>that</b> they follow a stationary first order autoregression.|$|E
5|$|MDSHA has {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} east–west corridor between the MD 28–MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95–MD 198 interchange, a corridor that forms the most direct route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also {{conducted a study}} concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred <b>alternative</b> <b>that</b> came out {{of the study was to}} expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.|$|E

25|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>that</b> he did {{consider}} practical was tightened government fiscal policy, {{based on}} using tax revenue {{to reduce the}} national debt.

Still, Jevons admitted that the overall impact of such a measure, even if it were implemented, would be minimal. In short, the prospect that society would voluntarily reduce consumption was dim.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} relative state formulation, Everett proposed {{that there is}} one universal wavefunction that describes the objective reality of the whole universe. He stated that when multiple subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) that is always described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic <b>alternative).</b> <b>That</b> is, they become entangled such that one cannot define one without the other. Thus, each subsystems state can only be described relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).|$|E
