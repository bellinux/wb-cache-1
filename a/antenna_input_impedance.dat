The antenna response is numerically investigated by applying a semi-infinite substrate and by generating a constant voltage source to drive a signal on the antenna.

Further, we explain the mechanism underlying the preferable uses of several millimeter length DC bias striplines in a typical THz coplanar stripline dipole antenna design. The antenna, consisting of a center dipole connected to long bias striplines, has a traveling wave characteristic supporting an attenuated current, rather than a resonant characteristic supporting a standing wave of current.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{successful}} {{operation of}} a pulsed monostatic borehole radar system requires that cur- rent on the antenna due to transmitter pulses subsides quickly. Deterioration of the radar antenna feed-point current settling times when deployed in water-¯lled boreholes showed that the radar system's performance is highly environmentally sensitive. Electromagnetic models are used to investigate this e®ect, since measuring the feed-point and radiative characteristics of an insulated antenna deployed in a borehole is practically impossible at present. A transmission line model for insulated antennas is utilized to model the borehole radar antenna in electrically dense media. Predicted <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> values however do not correspond well to those from numerical ¯eld simulation software and the model is shown to be inadequate for modelling insulated antennas in environments of low conductivity. Radiated ¯eld results are however found to be accurate. A study of the feed-point and radiative characteristics of the borehole radar antenna {{in a range of}} di®erent borehole environment is performed using electromagnetic ¯eld simulation software. Results con¯rm that the borehole radar antenna has longer feed- point current settling times and degraded radiated pulse waveforms when deployed in water-¯lled boreholes. Simple lumped element networks with driving-port impedances approximately equal to <b>antenna</b> <b>input</b> <b>impedances</b> are synthesized from simulated <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> results for a range of borehole environments.
