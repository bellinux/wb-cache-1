40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how different emotional abilities affect the emergence of task and relationship leaders in a group of 41 students. To conduct this investigation, leadership is envisioned as a dynamic network of leadership perceptions. The emergence of leadership and the role played by emotional abilities in this process are analyzed using Stochastic Actor Oriented Models (SAOMs). The results suggest that emotional abilities play complementary roles in emergent leadership. Whereas the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> perceive and manage emotions facilitate the emergence of relationship leaders, the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> and understand them facilitate the emergence of task leaders. Highlights ► Emotional intelligence and the emergence of relationship and task leadership. ► Leadership envisioned as a dynamic network of leadership perceptions. ► Longitudinal network analysis (SAOM). ► <b>Abilities</b> <b>to</b> perceive and manage emotions facilitate the emergence of relationship leaders. ► <b>Abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> and understand emotions facilitate the emergence of task leaders. ► Leaders need emotional intelligence...|$|R
