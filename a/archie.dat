5|$|In March 2008, the BBC {{announced}} that Larry Lamb had been cast as <b>Archie</b> Mitchell, {{the brother of}} Peggy's late husband Eric. <b>Archie</b> was scripted as a love-interest for Peggy and Peggy's backstory was retconned to incorporate a romantic history with <b>Archie.</b> Portrayed as an adulterous villain, <b>Archie</b> began controlling Peggy, changing her clothing and her hair style and instructing her on how to behave.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm {{leaves the}} table {{only to return}} furious; <b>Archie</b> was lying. A heated debate ensues, and the four men wrestle over the bill until Anya tells them that the meal can be free. Malcolm insists {{it is not about}} the bill, and fetches a knife and {{chopping}} board. <b>Archie</b> and Malcolm are to play stabscotch, with the winner paying. Malcolm is quick but <b>Archie</b> is slower, repeatedly stabbing himself. Craig pulls the knife from <b>Archie,</b> inadvertently slashing Anya. She collapses as blood splatters. Anya is dead, and Malcolm formulates a story blaming <b>Archie,</b> but <b>Archie</b> has called a prison contact who will remove the body.|$|E
5|$|Peggy {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with her brother-in-law, <b>Archie,</b> father of Ronnie (Samantha Womack) and Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons). They get engaged and <b>Archie</b> begins subtly controlling Peggy. They marry, but it ends {{a few hours later}} when it is revealed that <b>Archie</b> lied to Ronnie about her infant daughter's death. Peggy has <b>Archie</b> evicted from The Queen Vic, and tries unsuccessfully to coerce Phil into murdering him. Peggy files for divorce and <b>Archie</b> plots revenge on the entire Mitchell family. When Peggy loses the bail surety she has paid on behalf of her daughter Sam (who breaks the conditions of her bail following coercion from <b>Archie),</b> the Mitchells are forced to use The Queen Victoria to gain a collateral Loan from Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). <b>Archie</b> blackmails Ian to sell the loan to him, and when the Mitchells are unable to meet the loan repayment, <b>Archie</b> evicts them and assumes ownership of the pub. However, <b>Archie</b> is murdered on Christmas Day 2009 by an unknown assailant. Peggy grieves for <b>Archie,</b> but she and various other members of her family become suspects for his murder. Following a police enquiry, Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) is posthumously found guilty of the murder, though unbeknown to everyone, the actual murderer is Bradley's wife, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), after <b>Archie</b> raped her. In his will, <b>Archie</b> leaves The Queen Vic to Roxy, who reinstates Peggy.|$|E
5000|$|Martin Balsam as Murray Klein (1979-1981). Murray was <b>Archie's</b> Jewish partner, {{who held}} liberal views {{similar to those}} of <b>Archie's</b> {{son-in-law}} Michael Stivic. Unlike Mike, Murray was much more tolerant and patient with <b>Archie's</b> views.|$|R
30|$|It {{was shown}} that <b>Archie’s</b> law {{included}} a variable term describing the connectivity of the conducting phase (cementation factor). Ewing and Hunt (2006) stated that <b>Archie’s</b> law has a theoretical foundation {{as it can}} be derived by applying continuum percolation theory to fractal porous media. Furthermore, a reasonable physical phenomenon at the elevated temperature could be explained by <b>Archie’s</b> model by the cementation exponent profile (Glover 2009).|$|R
5000|$|Roger Livesey {{was cast}} as <b>Archie's</b> father Billy, despite being {{only one year}} older than Olivier. George Relph, the actor who {{originated}} the role in the play, died in April 1960. Alan Bates played <b>Archie's</b> cynical son Frank.|$|R
5|$|Since <b>Archie</b> Comics {{partnered with}} Marvel Comics for the 1994 {{one-shot}} comic <b>Archie</b> Meets the Punisher, the <b>Archie</b> characters {{have had a}} tradition of team-ups with characters from other fictional universes. Following the success of <b>Archie</b> meets KISS in 2012 and <b>Archie</b> meets Glee in 2013, the <b>Archie</b> Creative Summit held in March 2014 included a brainstorming session for new crossovers. Godzilla and Friday the 13th were considered, but the Predator received the most support. Artist Fernando Ruiz was at the summit and liked the premise, but did not believe it would actually be made, or {{that he would be}} involved if it was.|$|E
5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners <b>Archie,</b> Malcolm and Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} <b>Archie</b> both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with <b>Archie</b> unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. <b>Archie,</b> Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that <b>Archie</b> has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but <b>Archie</b> stops him. He reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archie</b> is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells <b>Archie</b> if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches <b>Archie</b> in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells <b>Archie</b> to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said <b>Archie</b> raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As <b>Archie</b> picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E
5000|$|Hilda debuted as [...] "Hilda the Witch" [...] in <b>Archie's</b> Mad House #19 (June 1962) as an ugly witch {{with dark}} hair and green skin. She was {{featured}} throughout the series in solo stories, {{as well as the}} [...] "host" [...] of the comic book (in a role similar to the Crypt-Keeper from the Tales from the Crypt comic book series). During her early appearances in <b>Archie's</b> Mad House, she was not connected to the Sabrina stories. However, a prototype of the [...] "Aunt Hilda" [...] character named [...] "Greta the Fairy Witch Mother" [...] (who debuted in <b>Archie's</b> Mad House #28 and was similar in physical appearance to Hilda the Witch) appeared in early Sabrina stories. Eventually, Hilda the Witch and Greta the Fairy Witch Mother evolved into the Aunt Hilda character in <b>Archie's</b> Mad House #37 (although the Greta character reappeared one last time in <b>Archie's</b> Mad House #45).|$|R

While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess <b>Archie</b> raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that <b>Archie</b> underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering <b>Archie.</b> Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that <b>Archie</b> once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when <b>Archie</b> was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found <b>Archie</b> dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away with it as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E

5|$|The next day, <b>Archie</b> follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} <b>Archie</b> as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening <b>Archie,</b> but Regina says that Henry is missing again. <b>Archie</b> conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. <b>Archie</b> goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured <b>Archie</b> and Henry trapped.

Peggy's daughter Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook), who has been in Brazil on the run from police due to her involvement in the murder of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), returns to Walford, thinking the charges have been dropped. She is subsequently arrested, and the Mitchells put up £250,000 bail to have her released. <b>Archie</b> convinces Sam to leave again, paying for her to go. Phil is then forced to take out a loan from Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian accepts, on the condition that if the loan is not paid back within a certain time, he becomes owner of The Queen Victoria. <b>Archie</b> and Janine learn of this and try to get Ian to sell the loan to them. When Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) leaves him, Janine gets him drunk and has sex with him, making an audio recording of them together. <b>Archie</b> and Janine blackmail Ian into selling them the loan and <b>Archie</b> tells the Mitchells they are trespassing.
