500|$|Ginsburg {{volunteered to}} write the brief for Reed v. Reed, , wherein the Supreme Court {{extended}} the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to women for the first time. She argued and won Frontiero v. Richardson, , which challenged a statute {{making it more difficult}} for a female service member to claim an increased housing allowance for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 in her favor. The Court again ruled in Ginsburg's favor in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, , where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children. She argued it discriminated against female workers denying them the same protection as their male counterparts. Ginsburg filed an amicus brief <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> counsel at oral argument for the case Craig v. Boren, , in which she challenged an Oklahoma statute which set different minimum drinking ages for men and women. For the first time, the Court imposed what is known as [...] "intermediate scrutiny" [...] on laws discriminating based on gender, a heightened standard of Constitutional review. Her last case as a lawyer before the Court was 1978's Duren v. Missouri, , which challenged the validity of voluntary jury duty for women as she deemed women's participation in government service as vital and that jury duty should not be optional. At the end of Ginsburg's oral presentation, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked Ginsburg, [...] "You won't settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?" [...] Ginsburg said she considered responding, [...] "We won't settle for tokens", but instead opted not to answer the question.|$|E

2500|$|On July 6, 2004, Kerry {{announced}} that Edwards {{would be his}} running mate; the decision was widely hailed in public opinion polls and by Democratic leaders. Though many Democrats supported Edwards' nomination, others criticized the selection for Edwards' perceived lack of experience. In the vice presidential debate, Dick Cheney told Edwards they had never met because of Edwards' frequent absences from the Senate, but that was later proven to be incorrect. Videotape later surfaced of Cheney and Edwards shaking hands off-camera during a taping of Meet the Press on April 8, 2001. On February 1, 2001, Cheney thanked Edwards by name <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> him during a Senate prayer breakfast. However, George W.
