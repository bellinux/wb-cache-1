5|$|A 3km {{protection}} zone, 10km {{surveillance zone}} and a restricted zone encompassing 2000km2 were set up. Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed {{on the evening}} of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken. Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although <b>a</b> <b>vet</b> from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.|$|E

Abi decides to continue studying, but when Max goes to prison for a while she has to take a job, and struggles to find time for her studies. However, Max is proven innocent, and returns home to support his family. In an argument between Jay and Dexter, Abi discovers that on their holiday Jay kissed a barmaid while they were arguing over the suspected pregnancy.

25|$|It is {{also common}} to try {{multiple}} anti-inflammatories over a further 4–6 week period, if necessary, since an animal will often respond to one type but fail {{to respond to}} another.

25|$|In 1989, Burns {{was hired}} to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, {{who had once been}} a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by <b>a</b> <b>vet.</b> Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E

25|$|Together with Keith Mann and Danny Attwood, Horne {{was part}} of a small Animal Liberation Front cell that raided Harlan Interfauna, a British company in Cambridge that {{supplies}} laboratory animals and organs, on 17 March 1990, Horne's 38th birthday. The activists entered Interfauna's animal units through holes they punched in the roof, removing 82 beagle puppies and 26 rabbits. They also removed documents listing Interfauna's customers, which included Boots, Glaxo, Beechams, and Huntingdon Research Centre, {{as well as a number}} of universities. <b>A</b> <b>vet</b> who was an ALF supporter removed the tattoos from the dogs' ears, and they were dispersed to new homes across the UK. As a result of evidence found at the scene and in one of the activists' homes, Mann and Attwood were convicted of conspiracy to burgle and were sentenced to nine months and 18 months respectively.|$|E
25|$|Once ashore, {{the pilot}} whale is killed by cutting the dorsal area {{through to the}} spinal cord with a special whaling knife, a mønustingari (spinal cord cutter), and after cutting it, the whaler must {{make sure that the}} whale is dead, he can do this by {{touching}} the whale's eye; before he cuts the neck open, so that as much blood as possible can run from the whale {{in order to get the}} best quality of meat. The neck is cut with a grindaknívur, but only after it has been killed. The mønustingari is a new invention which has been legal to use to kill pilot whales with since 2011, and since 1 May 2015 it is the only weapon allowed to slaughter a whale. The length of time it takes for a whale to die varies from a few seconds to a few minutes. Other observers complained that it took up to fifteen minutes for certain whales to die, they noted several cuts were sometimes made before a successful death and that some whales were not even killed properly until <b>a</b> <b>vet</b> finishes the job. With the new law which prohibits the whale hunters to stab the whales from the boats, this should not take place any more. According to the new Whaling Law (Grindalógin), it is only allowed to kill the whales from the shore, that means it is not the men who hunt the pilot whales with their boats who are slaughtering the whales, but men who are waiting on the beach with blowhole hooks with rope and spinal cord knives.|$|E
500|$|Eye {{prolapse}} is {{a common}} problem among Pugs and other brachycephalic breeds (see Brachycephalic syndrome) and {{can be caused by}} a trauma to the head or neck, or even by the owner using a tight leash instead of a harness.

500|$|Icke {{has emerged}} as a {{professional}} conspiracy theorist within a global counter-cultural movement that combines New World Order conspiracism, the truther movement and anti-globalization, with an extraterrestrial conspiracist subculture (Roswell, alien abduction, crop circles, men in black, The X-Files). Thanks to Icke's prominence, public figures are regularly asked whether they are lizards. An Official Information Act request was filed in New Zealand in 2008 to ask this of John Key, the prime minister, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was asked the same during a Q in 2016. (Both men said they were not lizards. Key added that he had taken the unusual step of consulting not only a doctor but <b>a</b> <b>vet.)</b> In a 2013 survey in the United States by Public Policy Polling, 4% believed that [...] "'lizard people' control our societies." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the {{introduction}} of muzzling for greyhounds in 1993, deaths to hares are less common, falling {{from an average of}} 16% to about 4% of hares coursed (reducing to around 150–200 hares per year). Muzzled dogs are more likely to buffet a hare than to bite it, a factor that may still affect the hare's subsequent survival. Hares can either die due to injuries sustained by contact with the much larger dogs or due to capture myopathy. The report from the official Countryside ranger at the Wexford Coursing Club meeting in December 2003 confirms that, exceptionally, 40 hares died at the event and the report of the veterinary surgeon who examined the hares blames the [...] "significant stress" [...] of being [...] "corralled and coursed". Coursing supporters deny that hare coursing is cruel and say that hares that are injured, pregnant or ill are not allowed to run. Hares are reported to be examined by <b>a</b> <b>vet</b> before and after racing.|$|E
