500|$|The film {{features}} a prevalent Moroccan chant {{of the phrase}} deshi basara (proper transliteration: Tījī basara’ah) (Arabic: تيجي بسرعة), which translates to [...] "rise up" [...] (literally: [...] "come quickly"). In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant {{to be used in}} the film's score. When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, [...] "The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing.</b> We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she had on her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing,</b> it can be here today and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends I have and the loved ones that I have and the people that I care about in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing.</b> I had a really good time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E

2500|$|If two {{translations}} are parallel, we can {{slide the}} mirror pair {{of the second}} translation to cancel the inner mirror of the sequence of four, much as in the rotation case. Thus the composition of two parallel translations produces a translation by {{the sum of the}} distances in the same direction. Now suppose the translations are not parallel, and that the mirror sequence is A1, A2 (the first translation) followed by B1, B2 (the second). Then A2 and B1 must cross, say at c; and, reassociating, we are free to pivot this inner pair around c. If we pivot 90°, <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> happens: now A1 and A2 intersect at a 90° angle, say at p, and so do B1 and B2, say at q. Again reassociating, we pivot the first pair around p to make B2 pass through q, and pivot the second pair around q to make A1 pass through p. The inner mirrors now coincide and cancel, and the outer mirrors are left parallel. Thus the composition of two non-parallel translations also produces a translation. Also, the three pivot points form a triangle whose edges give the head-to-tail rule of vector addition: 2(p c) + 2(c q) = 2(p q). ∎ ...|$|E

We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E

This done, they start for Lippstadt, are received there under joyous clangorous outburst of all the bells and all the honors, that same afternoon; and towards sunset, Hamm being the Night-quarter ahead, are crossing VELLINGHAUSEN BATTLE-GROUND,--where doubtless Ferdinand again, like a dutiful apprentice, will explain matters to his old master, so far as needful or permissible. The conversation, I suppose, may have been lively and miscellaneous: Ferdinand mentions a clever business-person of the name of Roden, whom he has known in these parts; [...] "Roden?" [...] the King carefully makes note;--and, in fact, we shall see Roden presently; and his bit of DIALOGUE with the King (recorded by his own hand) is our chief errand on this Journey. From Hamm, next morning (June 6th), they get to Wesel by 11 A.M.

Once I found his {{favorite}} fishing ground, and came every day to watch him from a thicket on the shore. It was of little use {{to go in a}} canoe. At my approach he would sink deeper and deeper in the water, as if taking in ballast. How he does this is a mystery; for his body is much lighter than its bulk of water. Dead or alive, it floats like a cork; yet without any perceptible motion, by an effort of will apparently, he sinks it out of sight. You are approaching in your canoe, and he moves off slowly, swinging his {{head from side to side}} so as to look at you first with one eye, then with the other. Your canoe is swift; he sees that you are gaining, that you are already too near. He swings on the water, and sits watching you steadily. Suddenly he begins to sink, deeper and deeper, till his back is just awash. Go a little nearer, and now his body disappears; only his neck and head remain above water. Raise your hand, or make any quick motion, and he is gone altogether. He dives like a flash, swims deep and far, and when he comes to the surface will be well out of danger.|$|E
