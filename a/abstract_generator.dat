The so-called generator-based design methodology is one possibility {{to reduce the}} manual effort by substituting design steps with procedural automation. Recent work already discussed {{a high degree of}} technology-independence of procedural generators. However, same generator code creates always the same structure which reduces flexibility. Moreover, recent generators behave like black-boxes with implicit behavior. This work utilizes an abstract layout placement graph in order to include layout relations and/or layout shapes automatically within a post-processing step. As the result, <b>abstract</b> <b>generator</b> descriptions are much more robust and handle the great amount of advanced process design rules which is of high practical relevance when targeting multiple technologies.

40|$|Current {{design of}} analog {{integrated}} circuits {{is still a}} time-consuming manual process resulting in static analog blocks which can hardly be reused. In order to address this problem, a new framework to ease reuse-centric bottom-up design of analog integrated circuits is introduced. Our IIP Framework (IIP: Intelligent Intellectual Property) enables the development of highly technology-independent analog circuit generators applicable in multiple design environments. IIP Generators are parameterizable descriptions of each view of an analog block, i. e., layout, schematic, and symbol. They allow the adaptation of complex layouts within seconds to minutes in order to incorporate hardly estimable parasitics and further considerations into the design flow. Due to the <b>abstract</b> <b>generator</b> description, valid design data is created for very different technologies such as 28 nm and 180 nm bulk CMOS, 28 nm FD-SOI, and others.

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Generators</b> for {{synthetic}} RDF datasets {{are very}} important for testing and benchmarking various semantic data management tasks (e. g. querying, storage, update, compare, integrate). However, the cur-rent generators do not support sufficiently (or totally ignore) blank node connectivity issues. Blank nodes are used for various purposes (e. g. for describing complex attributes), and {{a significant percentage of}} resources is currently represented with blank nodes. Moreover, several semantic data management tasks, like isomorphism checking (useful for checking equivalence), and blank node matching (useful in comparison, version-ing, synchronization, and in semantic similarity functions), not only have to deal with blank nodes, but their complexity and optimality depends on the connectivity of blank nodes. To enable the comparative evalua-tion of the various techniques for carrying out these tasks, in this paper we present the design and implementation of a generator, called BGen, which allows building datasets containing blank nodes with the desired complexity, controllable through various features (morphology, size, di-ameter, density and clustering coefficient). Finally, the paper reports experimental results concerning the efficiency of the generator, as well as results from using the generated datasets, that demonstrate the value of the generator. ...|$|R

When considering efficiency, it is not deemed good practice to create different memories from scratch for every unique ASIC. In an era where technology is ever improving and constantly changing, {{there is a need for}} versatile and technology adaptive memory generators. There are innumerable types of memory designs; in industry, large teams are often devoted to elaborate custom memory designs. This is generally not possible in academia, as resources and funds are limited, and tight deadlines push for simpler, scalable and customizable memory architectures. This session discusses a design flow methodology for developing a memory generator capable of handling different memory designs and scaling across technology nodes. A highly automated flow, utilizing the power of Cadence SKILL scripting, allows for smaller teams to generate dense and efficient memory designs, as would be useful in academia. A generator is introduced for a. 18 um technology, developed in 4 to 6 weeks, and is capable of being ported to different technologies by simply changing some technology specific parameters in the scripting.

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Generators</b> and {{batteries}} do not furnish any {{of their}} internal energy to their external circuit, but only dissipate it internally to perform work on their own internal charges to form a source dipole. Once formed, the dipole's broken symmetry extracts observable energy from the virtual particle exchange between dipole charges and active vacuum. The extracted observable energy is reradiated as the energy flow through all space surrounding the external circuit. The tiny Poynting fraction intercepted by the surface charges enters the circuit to power it, while the huge nonintercepted Heaviside fraction misses the circuit and is wasted. So electrical loads are powered by energy extracted from the vacuum, not by chemical energy in the battery or shaft energy input to the generator. Any EM system may be asymmetrically regauged freely, changing {{the energy of the}} system by changing its potential. By placing the source dipole in a closed current loop with external loads and losses, half the free excitation energy then discharged by the circuit destroys the source dipole while half powers loads and losses. This applies Lorentz symmetrical regauging so that additional internal generator/battery energy must be made available to dissipate on the internal charges to reform the dipole. Such self-crippling EM power systems exhibit COP 1. 0 EM systems are given, as are recognized examples of such processes. We also propose the ubiquitous unaccounted Heaviside energy as the &quot;dark matter &quot; gravitational energy long sought by astrophysicists...|$|R

Persistence of the generator response is not due to retention of Na by a diffusion barrier, and ionic contributions to the electrogenesis by Ca and C can also be excluded.

This paper provides limit loads for circumferential through-wall cracks in steam generator tubes under combined internal pressure and bending loads. Such limit loads are developed on the basis of three dimensional finite element analyses assuming elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior. As for the crack location, both the top of the tubesheet and U-bend regions are considered. The analysis results can be directly applied to the practical integrity assessment of cracked steam generator tubes, because the comparison between experimental data and FE results shows a very good agreement...|$|R
