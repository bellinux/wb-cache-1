5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (<b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E
5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> political force for good. Much {{of her life}} has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned {{to do at the}} Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in such fashion {{went beyond the}} common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as Thailand, where white elephants are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent {{the message that the}} ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat of}} the 1745 Jacobite rising {{decimated}} the antiquated social structure based around clans lorded over by chieftains. This liberalized the Scottish way of life by allowing citizens to own land and keep the profits instead of giving all profits to the chieftains who owned all the land. Their literate foundation allowed the Scots to become economically literate {{and take advantage of}} trade. Edinburgh and Glasgow became epicenters of intellectual thought. There existed in Scotland a clergy who believed that <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> religious foundation was required for, and compatible with, a free and open sophisticated culture, which moderated hardline conservatives. Herman presents biographies of Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), Robert Adam, Adam Smith, and others to illustrate the Scottish development.|$|E

25|$|Forgiveness in Hinduism {{does not}} {{necessarily}} require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and {{letting go of the}} harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> ethical life (dharmic life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger (akrodhi).|$|E

25|$|The human chain {{helped to}} {{publicise}} the Baltic cause {{around the world}} and symbolised solidarity among the Baltic peoples. The positive image of the non-violent Singing Revolution spread among the western media. The activists, including Vytautas Landsbergis, used the increased exposure to position the debate over Baltic independence as <b>a</b> <b>moral,</b> <b>and</b> not just political question: reclaiming independence would be restoration of historical justice and liquidation of Stalinism. It was an emotional event, strengthening the determination to seek independence. The protest highlighted that the pro-independence movements, established just a year before, became more assertive and radical: they shifted from demanding greater freedom from Moscow to full independence.|$|E
25|$|Both the Qur'anIslam's sacred textand {{the spoken}} or acted {{example of the}} Prophet Muḥammad (Sunnah) {{advocate}} {{the rights of women}} and men equally to seek knowledge. The Qur'an commands all Muslims to exert effort in the pursuit of knowledge, irrespective of their biological sex: it constantly encourages Muslims to read, think, contemplate and learn from the signs of God in nature. Moreover, Muḥammad encouraged education for both males and females: he declared that seeking knowledge was a religious duty binding upon every Muslim man and woman. Like her male counterpart, each woman is under <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> religious obligation to seek knowledge, develop her intellect, broaden her outlook, cultivate her talents and then utilise her potential to the benefit of her soul and her society.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1890, at {{the same}} time as his volume of {{collected}} works, Caragiale published and staged his rural-themed tragedy Năpasta—both writings were presented for consideration to the Romanian Academy, in view of receiving its annual prize, the Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award. Caragiale's conflict with the National Liberals reached its peak, as two of their representatives inside the forum, historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and future Premier Dimitrie Sturdza, reported unfavorably. Additional criticism was voiced by the poet Gheorghe Sion, who also defended the a work by Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (itself up for review). When the Junimist Iacob Negruzzi defended his friend, Sturdza contrasted Caragiale's works with his own version of didacticism, claiming that it altogether lacked <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> national quality.|$|E

25|$|Hankey (letter to McKenna 15 August 1911) {{complained of}} Wilson’s “perfect {{obsession}} for military operations on the Continent”, scoffing at his bicycling trips and {{accusing him of}} filling the War Office with like-minded officers. At Nicholson’s request Wilson prepared a paper (dated 15 August), based {{on the evolution of}} his ideas over the previous ten years. He argued that British aid would be necessary to prevent Germany defeating France and achieving domination of the continent, and that this would have both <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> a military effect on the outcome. He argued that by Day 13 of mobilisation France would have the upper hand, outnumbering the Germans by 63 divisions to 57 along the frontier, but by Day 17 Germany would outnumber France by 96 divisions to 66. However, because of road bottlenecks in the passable parts of the war theatre, the Germans would at most be able to deploy 54 divisions in the opening phase, allowing the 6 infantry divisions of the BEF a disproportionate effect on the outcome. Ernest May (in Knowing One’s Enemies: Intelligence Assessments Between the Two World Wars 1984) later claimed that Wilson had “cooked” these figures, but his arguments were challenged by Edward Bennett, who argued that Wilson’s numbers were not far wrong (Journal of Modern History, June 1988).|$|E

[...] Jay Vroom, president of CropLife America, said in a press release that [...] "...our industry has <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> ethical obligation...to know how these products impact humans."

500|$|Joanna Bullivant, {{writing in}} Music and Letters, {{maintains}} {{that in his}} music Bush subordinated all ideas of personal expression to the ideology of Marxism. The critic Hugo Cole thought that, as a composer, Bush came close to Paul Hindemith's ideal: [...] "one for whom music is felt as <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> social force, and only incidentally {{as a means of}} personal expression". [...] The composer Wilfrid Mellers credits Bush with more than ideological correctness; while remaining faithful to his creed even when it was entirely out of fashion, he [...] "attempt to re-establish an English tradition meaningful to his country's past, present and future". [...] Hall describes Bush as [...] "a key figure in the democratisation of art in Britain, achieving far more in this regard than his pedagogic, utopian patrons and peers, the labour romantics." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Eastwood {{directed}} his first western, High Plains Drifter, {{in which he}} also starred. The film had <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> supernatural theme, later emulated in Pale Rider. The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film {{as to whether the}} stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and allegory, influenced by Leone. The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was [...] "as derivative as it was expressive," [...] with Arthur Knight of the Saturday Review remarking that Eastwood had [...] "...absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society." [...] John Wayne, who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film's release in which he complained that, [...] "The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great." ...|$|E

[...] Kennedy had planned that Ngô Đình Diệm would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. recalled that the US President was [...] "somber and shaken". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was [...] "particularly abhorrent" [...] and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that [...] "It shook him personally ... bothered him as <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam." [...] When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied [...] "No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country." ...|$|E
