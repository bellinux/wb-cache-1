5|$|The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call is clearer <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> {{than the}} similar {{vocalisation}} of the jackdaw, and always {{very different from}} that of its yellow-billed congener, which has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls. Small subspecies of the red-billed chough have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.|$|E
5|$|Stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not. Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call {{is similar}} in {{character}} {{to that of other}} corvids, particularly the jackdaw, although it is clearer <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> than the call of that species. In contrast, the Alpine chough has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls quite unlike the crows. Small subspecies of both choughs have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.|$|E

5|$|The band {{started their}} second US tour in April 1969 with little support from their almost-bankrupt American label and without an album to promote, {{because of a}} delay in the {{manufacturing}} of the new LP. During the tour, Deep Purple showed a remarkable progress as performers and a musical direction more oriented towards a heavier <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> sound than before. Doubts about compatibility of vocalist Rod Evans with the hard rock music that other band members wanted to pursue brought about the decision of searching for a substitute, which was found in Ian Gillan of the band Episode Six. Gillan formed a songwriting duo with Episode Six's bassist Roger Glover, who was also invited to join Deep Purple and replaced Nick Simper. The band's new line-up, identified as Mark II, debuted live in London on 10 July 1969.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, the guqin's strings {{were always}} made of various {{thicknesses}} of twisted silk, {{but since then}} most players use modern nylon-flatwound steel strings. This was {{partly due to the}} scarcity of high quality silk strings and partly due to the newer strings' greater durability <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> tone.|$|E
25|$|At dawn of {{the third}} day, there was thunder, lightning, a dense cloud upon the {{mountain}}, and a very loud blast of the horn. Moses led the people {{to the foot of}} the mountain. Mount Sinai was all in smoke, the mountain trembled violently, the blare of the horn grew louder <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> and God answered Moses in thunder.|$|E
25|$|The accompaniment becomes {{gradually}} thicker <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> {{until the}} whole orchestra is {{playing at the}} very end. Just before the end (rehearsal number 18 in the score), there is a sudden change of key to E major, though C major is reestablished after just eight bars. Six bars from the end, the bass drum, cymbals and tam-tam make their first entry, and the trombones play raucous glissandi while the whole orchestra beats out the rhythm that has been played on the snare drum {{from the very first}} bar. Finally, the work descends from a dissonant D-flat chord to a C major chord.|$|E

5000|$|In Uzbekistan the {{kettledrum}} {{is called}} naqara or nagora. Dulnaqara: a large kettledrum {{that gives a}} low <b>and</b> <b>loud</b> sound (i.e. [...] "tum"). Reznaqara is a small kettledrum that gives a high <b>and</b> <b>loud</b> sound (i.e. [...] "tak"). Koshnaqara is a small-paired kettledrum, a pair of clay pots with goatskin tops.|$|R
25|$|Higher wind {{pressures}} {{increased the}} speaking volume of theatre organ pipes, {{and they were}} placed in chambers, usually high in the auditorium. The fronts of these chambers were covered {{with a set of}} swell shades which opened and closed like venetian blinds. When closed, the sound of the organ was reduced to a whisper. With a foot pedal, the organist could gradually open the shutters to produce louder <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> sounds from the same pipes. Although this type of swell chamber was not new, theatre organ developments permitted a much broader dynamic range than ever before.|$|E
500|$|Mixing on [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] was {{completed}} on 14 October, with Starr's drum fills given {{prominence in the}} mix. Relative to the stereo version, {{the contrast between the}} song's quiet <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> moments is less pronounced in the mono mix, where Harrison's second vocal part also arrives earlier on the opening line.|$|E
500|$|Lennon wanted [...] "Revolution 1" [...] to be {{the next}} Beatles single, but McCartney was {{reluctant}} to invite controversy, and argued along with Harrison that the track was too slow for a single. Lennon persisted, and rehearsals for a faster <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> re-make began on 9 July; recording started the following day. This proved an immense success.|$|E

500|$|Back in Liverpool, {{the group}} played an {{engagement}} on 17 December 1960, at the Casbah Coffee Club, with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe, playing bass {{with them for}} four shows. Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing after the residency in Hamburg, and {{was struck by how}} powerful Best's drumming now was, pushing the group to play harder <b>and</b> <b>louder.</b> (It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to [...] "Crank it up" [...] = play as loud as possible).|$|E
500|$|Following the announcement, King {{traveled}} to Miami {{where he worked}} with Martin and Remi to finish the track. Gleyder [...] "Gee" [...] Disla recorded the song at the Instrument Zoo and Hit Factory Criteria in Miami <b>and</b> <b>Louder</b> than Life Labs in New York City. Enrique Larreal provided the vocal engineering and editing, while David Cabrera served as an additional vocal producer. Disla mixed [...] "Vida" [...] at Instrument Zoo, while Ari Blitz and Larry Ryckman served as the mastering engineers. Martin, King and Domingo Ramos sang the background vocals. Vincent Henry and Dan Warner played the guitar, the latter also provided the ukulele, Hal Riston played the horn and Robert Villahara {{was responsible for the}} percussion.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{theme of}} the game {{features}} a neo-Gregorian chant, which was performed in studio by a 135-voice choir. Much of the underscore music that plays when the player is exploring the game, rather than during cinematic scenes, is based upon that opening scene. The composers made use of silence in many scenes, to build up tension for moments of a [...] "pounce" [...] effect, creating the effect with music that something is catching the listener. They deliberately saved the most intense music for the final chapter of Phantasmagoria, when the game becomes the most intense. During some chase scenes, drums and low strings {{are used in the}} score to simulate a heartbeat, which grows louder <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> during more dangerous moments.|$|E

500|$|Chas Newby, the ex-Black Jacks guitarist, {{was invited}} to play bass for four concerts, as bassist Stuart Sutcliffe had decided to stay in Hamburg. Newby played with the group at Litherland Town Hall and at the Casbah. He was shocked at the vast {{improvement}} in their playing and singing, and remembered Best's drumming to be very powerful, which pushed the group to play harder <b>and</b> <b>louder.</b> It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to [...] "crank it up" [...] (play as loud as possible). When the group returned to Hamburg, by which time McCartney had switched to bass, Best was asked to sing a speciality number, [...] "Peppermint Twist", while McCartney played drums, but always felt uncomfortable being {{at the front of}} the stage.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, back in Springfield, Marge {{feels that}} Homer always gets {{to go on}} better adventures while she is left at home; she and Lisa decide to be adventurous too and go to buy a musical {{doorbell}} which plays the song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You". After installation, Lisa rings the doorbell, despite Marge's insistence that they should let visitors do the ringing first. The doorbell starts to [...] and repeatedly plays the song. Marge attempts to cut the wires to the doorbell, but fails to, since Homer traded their tools for M. She pulls out a wire, which instead causes the doorbell to play faster <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> disturbing the neighborhood. The doorbell store's mascot, Señor Ding-Dong, appears and uses his whip to silence the doorbell, but then finds {{he is unable to}} leave in his Chevrolet as it won't start.|$|E
500|$|... "If I Were a Boy" [...] is a midtempo pop and R ballad, with folk {{rock and}} soft rock influences. The song was {{composed}} using common {{time in the}} key of G major and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It {{was written in the}} common verse-chorus form; the verses are supported by four chords and follow a vi-IV-I-V chord progression in the form Em7–B–G–D/F. Ed Masle of The Arizona Republic noted that the progression is reminiscent of Nirvana's 1991 song [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Instrumentation is provided by a piano, acoustic guitars, live drums, and strings as well as hand claps which are used throughout the song. Beyoncé's vocals span the range from a low of F♯3 to the high of E5. Her singing gets higher <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> as she employs melodic crescendos. Critics noted that Beyoncé delivers a tormented performance with unwavering sentiments.|$|E
