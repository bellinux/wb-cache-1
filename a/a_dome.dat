5|$|Alternative {{theories}} are that La Reforma is <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> which was eroded {{to form a}} circular pattern or a set of tectonic blocks. Although the dome {{was thought to be}} formed by the older Comondú volcanics, {{it appears to be a}} product of La Reforma activity.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{architectural}} style and exterior decoration {{of the building}} is entirely Western, the interior decorations is entirely Thai. The central hall, situated under <b>a</b> <b>dome,</b> is decorated with murals of the god Indra, Varuna, Agni and Yamaall depicted in Thai style. Below them are Thai inscriptions composed by King Rama VI himself.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{architectural}} prominence, {{very little}} is known of the church's history and its precise architecture. Most of {{the information on the}} church's original appearance is derived from the epigram in honour of Juliana and her family, which was inscribed in pieces {{in various parts of the}} church. The epigram claims that the church was laid out as a replica of the ancient Jewish Temple with the precise proportions given in the Bible for the Temple of Solomon, and using the royal cubit as a unit of measure, as in its model. Richard Martin Harrison, the site's chief excavator, has reconstructed the church as a roughly square basilica, ca. 52 m long on the sides, with a central nave and two side aisles, fronted by a narthex and preceded by a large atrium of 26 m length. To the north of the atrium, remains of another building have been identified as either the church's baptistery or Juliana's palace. An oval substructure in the building's center indicates the position of the ambon, while strong foundations throughout the building indicate, according to Harrison, the presence of <b>a</b> <b>dome,</b> bringing the estimated height of the building to over 30 m. The area of the altar was not sufficiently excavated, and its shape remains unknown. The possible presence of <b>a</b> <b>dome,</b> although not universally accepted, is of major importance, since it would mean that it was St. Polyeuctus, and not Justinian's churches (Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the Hagia Sophia), which first combined the traditional basilica with <b>a</b> <b>dome.</b> From the epigram, we know that the interior featured two storeys with colonnades and galleries. Based on the epigram and the substructures, Harrison also posited the existence of a pair of two-storey exedrae, composed of three niches with a pier in between, on the northern and southern sides of the ambo. The spaces around the domed western bay would have been covered with barrel or cross-vaults.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{alterations}} {{were made}} by the Caliphs Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1009 and Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah in 1125. The Caliph al-Hafiz (1129–1149) made significant further changes, adding a fourth arcade with keel arches, and <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> with elaborate carved stucco decorations in front of the transept. Since then, the mosque has been greatly enlarged and modified over the years. Of the original building little remains other than the arcades and some of the stucco decoration.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> glass <b>dome.</b> It {{limits the}} {{spectral}} response from 300 to 2,800 nanometers (cutting off the part above 2,800 nm), while preserving the 180° field of view. It also shields the thermopile sensor from convection. For first class and secondary standard pyranometers (see ISO 9060 classification of thermopile pyranometers) <b>a</b> second glass <b>dome</b> is used. This construction provides an additional “radiation shield”, {{resulting in a}} better thermal equilibrium between the sensor and inner dome, compared to using <b>a</b> single <b>dome.</b> The effect of having <b>a</b> second <b>dome</b> is <b>a</b> strong reduction of instrument offsets.|$|R

5|$|On December 19, 2006, a {{large white}} plume of {{condensing}} steam was observed, leading some media people to assume {{there had been a}} small eruption. However, the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume. The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> in the crater.|$|E
5|$|The Grade II listed {{main wings}} (known as East and West Market) are {{separated}} by the Grand Avenue, a wide roadway roofed by an elliptical arch with decorations in cast iron. At the two ends of the arcade, four prominent statues represent London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Dublin depicting bronze dragons charged with the City's armorial bearings. At {{the corners of the}} market four octagonal pavilion towers were built, each with <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> displaying carved stone griffins.|$|E
5|$|The Sugar Bowl eruptive {{period was}} short and {{markedly}} different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions. During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce <b>a</b> <b>dome,</b> then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.|$|E

5|$|The mosque is {{designed}} in non-Ottoman architectural style, with glass walls, two minarets and <b>a</b> <b>dome.</b> The mosque is proposed {{to have a}} bazaar {{as well as other}} secular areas intended for interfaith interactions. As the mosque will be one of Europe's biggest, and the largest mosque in Germany, it has been criticized for its size, particularly the height of the minarets.|$|E
5|$|The planned mosque {{will not}} be in the Ottoman {{architecture}} style. It will have a concrete and glass dome, and two 55 meter high minarets. The mosque will have the bazaar and entrance on the ground floor, lecture halls in the basement, the prayer area on the upper floor and include a Muslim library. A well is intended to be placed in the center to connect the two levels and to create a pleasant atmosphere. The mosque consists of flat-like wall screens which form <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> in the center.|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} Mott Avenue station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system, {{despite the fact that}} the station had become part of the subway system just two decades earlier. From 2009 to 2012, a $117 million renovation took place on the station, replacing the 1950s design of the station house with metallic facades and <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> enclosure, and upgrading several features including staircases and employee areas. Elevators from the station house to the platforms were added, as were yellow tactile warning strips on the platform edges, making the station ADA-accessible. A glass artwork titled Respite was installed as part of the MTA's Arts for Transit program. The renovated station was unveiled on May 11, 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside <b>a</b> <b>dome,</b> whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E
5|$|The 10th-century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn al-Faqih {{wrote of}} a local legend related {{by the people of}} Lajjun regarding the source of the abundant spring used as the town's primary water source over the ages: there is just outside al-Lajjun a large stone of round form, over which is built <b>a</b> <b>dome,</b> which they call the Mosque of Abraham. A copious stream of water flows from under the stone and it is reported that Abraham struck the stone with his staff, and there immediately flowed from it water enough to suffice for the supply {{of the people of the}} town, and also to water their lands. The spring continues to flow down to the present day.|$|E

5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a single {{elongated}} nave. It is surmounted by <b>a</b> <b>dome</b> and finishes with a single apse in its eastern part. The dome is supported by arches {{to the north and}} south and vaults to the west and east. The apse is five-sided on the outside and round on the inside. To the west of it is the sanctuary which features three vaults which hosted the bema, the prothesis and the diaconicon. The sanctuary was separated {{from the rest of the}} nave via two pillars. Three buttresses support the south wall and the apse. The entrance to the church is on the south wall. The church has a total of 16 windows: three on the apse, one on the south wall, four on the north wall and one on the narthex.|$|E
