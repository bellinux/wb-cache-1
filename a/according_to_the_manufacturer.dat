5|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E

25|$|Despite the above, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea {{certified}} the Grenfell {{tower building}} work as allegedly conforming to “the relevant provisions”. Council building inspectors visited the site 16 times from August 2014 to July 2016. Kooltherm, a phenolic insulation, {{was also used}} on Grenfell. Kooltherm was never tested with polyethylene core aluminium panels <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> The manufacturer, Kingspan, “would {{be very surprised if}} such a system … would ever pass the appropriate British Standard 8414 large-scale test”. Kooltherm’s LABC certificate states phenolic products, “do not meet the limited combustibility requirements” of building regulations.|$|E
25|$|Pillbox {{formed by}} a metal turret, {{which could be}} rotated through a full 360 degrees, set above a steel and brick-lined pit. It was {{designed}} for a machine gun to be fired either through the front loophole which was further protected by shutters, or through the circular opening in the roof in a light anti-aircraft role. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> it was suitable for Vickers, Bren, Hotchkiss or Lewis machine guns in either a ground defence or anti-aircraft role, or a Boys anti-tank rifle or rifle grenade for ground defence. Weapon change requires selection of appropriate bracket. The army did not favour the design - most were installed at airfields.|$|E

500|$|The {{loudspeaker}} cabinet measures [...] The extremely rigid 55-litre cabinet {{is constructed}} using 19mm high-density particle board that is strategically damped in places, and extensively braced. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> {{there is an}} array of stressed steel rods inside the enclosure to control energy flows. The techniques employed ensure that energy that would have caused the unwanted motion of the front panel and drivers is cancelled by a similar but opposite energy from the upward facing units, resulting in the minimum amount of resonances. The cabinets were initially made by Linn in their own factory, but the manufacturing was later outsourced to furniture-makers Leon Levin of Glasgow.|$|E
2500|$|The Lexus LFA's {{frame is}} made from an {{in-house}} designed and manufactured carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) center monocoque with aluminum front and rear subframes. The subframes, which can be removed and replaced minimizing potential repair costs, are joined to the monocoque using a newly developed aluminum flanged collar designed to create a stronger joint. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> {{the quality of the}} CRFP material matches that of aeronautical grades and is woven by a laser monitored circular loom, one of only two in the world. Overall 65% of the vehicle's total body mass is CFRP material while the remaining 35% is aluminum. Manufacturer data indicates that the use of CFRP saves [...] over equivalent aluminum materials.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Escort {{was sold}} as a two-door saloon (with {{circular}} front headlights and rubber flooring on the [...] "De Luxe" [...] model). The [...] "Super" [...] model featured rectangular headlights, carpets, a cigar lighter and a water temperature gauge. A two-door estate was introduced {{at the end of}} March 1968 which, with the back seat folded down, provided a 40% increase in maximum load space over the old Anglia 105E estate, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> The estate featured the same engine options as the saloon, but it also included a larger, [...] clutch, stiffer rear springs and in most configurations slightly larger brake drums or discs than the saloon. A panel van appeared in April 1968 and the 4-door saloon (a bodystyle the Anglia was never available in for UK market) in 1969.|$|E
