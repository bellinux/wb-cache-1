40|$|Employee {{participation}} in the capital or profit of the firm {{is regarded as a}} suitable way to increase labour productivity if the employees' performance can not be monitored directly. Nonetheless employee {{participation in}} <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> is currently used by few German firms. In this paper we show that the direct effect on productivity of employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> is only small and is furthermore statistically insignificant. The study was conducted using the representative data of the 1999 and 2000 waves of the IAB establishment panel. This result contradicts previous studies, some of which have derived impressive positive productivity effects. The methodological innovation in this study is the consideration of unobserved heterogeneity between firms that use employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> and firms that do not. It emerges here that firms which offer employee participation are more productive on average as a result of unobserved factors. Thus the cause for their higher productivity can not be attributed to the existence of employee participation. In addition it is shown that the production functions of firms with and without employee participation differ greatly from each other.

40|$|Various {{intentions}} are pursued {{with the introduction}} of models of profit-sharing and capital participation for employees. In this paper the effect of employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> as an incentive to increase performance is examined as a way of raising the productivity within an individual firm. Linking employees' pay with the success of the firm can lead to an improvement in the overall success of the firm via an increase in the employees' performance, and thus to higher individual remuneration. Using the data from the 1998 IAB establishment panel this paper first ascertains that firms not using employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> have poorer average productivity values. The median for western German firms not using employee participation is 64 % of the value for the firms that do use it (eastern German firms: 72 %). In addition to this there are also clear productivity deficits. The results of the econometric estimation model confirm the mainly positive effect of employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> which was determined both in the literature analysis carried out by the OECD (1995) and in our own.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{monetary policy}} transmission mechanism {{is based on}} the fact that, {{in the wake of a}} restrictive monetary policy stance, the interest rate rises and that therefore interest-rate-related variables, such as corporate <b>asset</b> <b>formation,</b> dec 1 ine or increase less sharply than at the given interest rate. For some years now economists -especiaIly in the Anglo-Saxon countries -have been discussing the credit channel approach, which embraces the credit supply as weIl as the interest rate channeL A crucial factor in this context is that information between the lender and the borrower is asymmetric. This primarily affects small enterprises, whose creditworthiness is, as a rule, not as good as that oflarge firms and which are heavily reliant on bank credit. The credit channel theory states that, for small enterprises, a stricter monetary policy stance results in a higher cost of borrowed funds than for larger enterprises or even in credit rationing. The result is that this group of enterprises cuts its <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> particularly sharply [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The paper uses an {{endogenous}} switching {{regression model}} {{to measure the}} impact of participation in micro-irrigation development on households’ welfare. The model takes into account selection bias associated with programme participation and endogeneity problems often encountered in most programme evaluations. A total of 482 households (195 irrigation users and 287 non-users) were used to generate all the necessary variables. To capture {{the impact of the}} irrigation on household welfare, two indicators were consideredv namely household farm income (Y) and household fixed <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> (F) (evaluated at market Price during the survey period). The results show a positive and significant impact of irrigation use on the two outcome variables: income by 8. 8 per cent and <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> by 186 per cent as compared to non-users. This shows how important the micro-irrigation schemes are in improving the welfare of poor farmers in the research areas. Furthermore, the empirical results show that the probability of using one of the water sources (irrigation scheme) is associated with farm experience (age as proxy), farmer-to-farmer contact (the existence of an irrigation user neighbour), family size, the state of credit constraint, the number of visits by extension agents and the cost of irrigation development.

We {{assume that}} the teachers <b>formation</b> <b>policies</b> {{were based on the}} mass teachers certification {{in a short period of}} time, rather than the teachers formation itself. In this documental and bibliographic-analytical research, we initially tried to understand the historic of teachers formation in Brazil and its development from Colonial Times until now, as well as the teachers formation thematic in space and time, outlining the globalization scenery and the implications that affect education and society. This new educational context, lined from the new world order spread trough international organisms and media and state organs, unleashed a meaningful change analysis in education. Proceeding the discussion, we analyzed the Professionals <b>Formation</b> <b>Policies</b> of Basic Education in Brazil, through the Leis de Diretrizes e Bases Nacionais nº 9394 / 96 (Brazilian Education Basic Tenets Law) and other rules determined by MEC, which orient the professional formation of Basic Education.

Based on Adorno (1996) Theorie der Halbbildung (Semi-culture Theory), we also approach the semi-formation (Halbbildung) as a determination of capitalist contemporary society opposing the formation (Bildung), as well as its possible relation with the massification, the teaching cultural industry and the teacher semi-formation.

The Idealist model, which is {{manifested}} in the rhetoric of the emerging global governance regime of telecommunication networks, amounts to a policy of exclusion in developing countries not only in the sense of teledensity, but also regarding the network <b>policy</b> <b>formation</b> process as well. The scope of the policy sphere has been reduced to purportedly competitive markets ignoring socio-economic development, the economy as a whole, local production and technology capabilities, research and development, innovation systems and the potential for using markets as instruments. Disconnecting long-range planning of the government and "independent regulator's" policies can be added to the list of excluded possibilities. Based on Turkey's experience, the strategic model is more appropriate both for understanding the <b>formation</b> of network <b>policies</b> and for designing participatory <b>policy</b> <b>formation</b> mechanisms. As the number of agents involved in the <b>policy</b> <b>formation</b> process diversifies and increases in the true sense, outcomes more closely resemble a Strategic approach.

In Germany, as in other countries where the hypothesis was tested, social security is thus good for growth. A possible explanation for this unconventional finding is that compulsory saving in the form of pension contributions tends to displace intra-family transfers, rather than <b>asset</b> <b>formation.</b> However, the negative effect of social security on fertility tends to erode the system’s own contributory base, because it reduces the number of future contributors.

This bias may be explained by severe difficulties in measuring price and capital replacement trends in first years of transition. Alternative estimates of physical volume indexes of fixed assets and investment in fixed capital by fifteen main industrial sectors and branches during 1991 - 2003 are derived and industry-specific investment and fixed assets trends are discussed.
