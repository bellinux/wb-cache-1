40|$|Dry olive mill residue (DOR), the {{by-product}} of the two-phase extraction process, is very rich in organic matter and nutritionally relevant cations. For this reason, the agronomic {{use of this}} waste has been suggested although DOR exhibits significant phytotoxicity. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of Paecilomyces farinosus on both organic matter modification and detoxification of this waste. Humification ratio in DOR colonized by the fungus for 20 weeks was increased by about 65 % with respect to the <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> and humification index reached 0. 38, a value that characterizes well-humified materials. High performance size-exclusion chromatography of humic acids from fungal cultures showed a marked increase in both weight-averaged and number-averaged molecular weights with respect to <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls.</b> Water-soluble phenols were reduced by 45 % in 20 -week-old P. farinosus cultures on DOR and mass-balance ultra-filtration showed that the relative abundance of the molecular weight fraction of phenols above 30 kDa increased from 31 to 72 % suggesting the occurrence of polymerization. Experiments performed with alfalfa grown on soils containing 2. 5 % (w/w) of <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls</b> and fungaltreated DOR showed that phytotoxicity was totally suppressed in the waste that underwent fungal treatment.

X-ray diffraction analysis, infrared spectra, and {{a negative}} electrophoretic mobility strongly indicated that fenamiphos was intercalated within the bacterially inaccessible interlayer spaces of CTMA−clay. The bacterium hydrolyzed, within 24 h, 82 % of the fenamiphos sorbed by the CTMA−clay complex. There was a concomitant accumulation of hydrolysis product, fenamiphos phenol, in nearly stoichiometric amounts. During the same period, in <b>abiotic</b> (uninoculated) <b>controls,</b> 4. 6 % of the sorbed insecticide was {{released into the}} aqueous phase as compared to 6. 0 % of the sorbed fenamiphos in another <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> where activated carbon, a sink for desorbed fenamiphos, was present. Thus, within 24 h, the bacterium hydrolyzed 77 % more fenamiphos sorbed by organo clay than the amounts desorbed in <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls.</b> Such rapid degradation of an intercalated pesticide by a bacterium has not been reported before. Evidence indicated that extracellular enzymes produced by the bacterium rapidly hydrolyzed the nondesorbable fenamiphos, even when the enzyme itself was sorbed.

40|$|Understanding {{the links}} between {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry in a spatial context within tropical forest plant communities is an unresolved problem. High plant diversity [...] phylogenetic, functional, and genetic [...] often characteristic of tropical forests, is poorly understood {{in the context of}} soils. I collected and georeferenced a large sample of surface soil cores (n= 625, 6. 25 cm diameter x 10 cm depth) from the Barro Colorado Island (BCI) 50 ha (0. 5 km 2) Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP), Republic of Panama (9. 15 N, 79. 8 W) [...] described in Chapter One. In Chapter Two, I tested a commonly made assumption in research on plot scales in tropical forests, that <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls</b> entirely explain plot scale soil heterogeneity. To do this, I analyzed a high spatial resolution and multiple spatial scale (multiscale) set of topography features from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), a bedrock map, and the geospatial soil chemical observations to test if <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls</b> (erosion, hydrology, bedrock) were sufficient to explain soil heterogeneity in the BCI tree community. In Chapter Three, I evaluate whether spatial variation in soil organic matter (SOM) and patterns of correlation with rock-derived nutrients are consistent with plants changing soils through litterfall. In Chapter Four, I document the first use of high-throughput DNA sequencing data for observing plant species roots in a tropical forest rhizosphere. The main findings of my dissertation are that at the plot scale in a tropical forest soil chemical heterogeneity was weakly related to <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls</b> and rock-derived macronutrients vary in association strength with soil organic matter {{in a manner consistent with}} plants exerting strong biotic controls on the spatial heterogeneity of soil calcium.

In this study, mixrotrophic iron-oxidizing bacterial consortia consisting of Comamonas testosteroni, Alicyclobacillus ferrooxydans and Pantoea septic which were isolated from Indonesian mineral ores were examined to determine their abilities to recover nickel from limonite and saprolite ores in the bioleaching experiments using stirred tank reactors. The nickel bioleaching experiments inoculated with the bacterial consortia were carried out using coarse limonite ores and weathered saprolite ores with pulp density of 10 % w/v. <b>Abiotic</b> <b>controls</b> were also carried out replacing the inocula by the sterile medium. The bioleaching processes were monitored by measuring Ni and Fe contents and pH of the leaching solution {{as well as the}} total bacterial enzymatic activity measured as FDA hydrolytic activity. The effect of leaching on the mineralogy of laterite ores was investigated by the scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). After 28 days of incubation, the FDA hydrolytic activity was observed in both bioleaching experiments containing limonite (17. 2 μg fluorescein/mL) and saprolite ores (16. 9 μg fluorescein/mL). The leached Ni and Fe in the bioleaching experiments containing limonite ores (30 % Ni and 5. 6 % Fe) was greater than that in <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls</b> (1 % Ni and 0. 1 % Fe) with the pH range of 2. 5 to 3. 5. However, the bacterial consortia were less capable of bioleaching of Ni (2. 5 %) with the similar leached Fe (6 %) from the saprolite ores. In <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls,</b> the medium pH remained relatively constant (pH 6). It was concluded that these bacterial isolated as the consortium were capable of nickel bioleaching (precious metal) more effectively than iron (gangue metal), thus being applicable to the commercial processing of the difficult-to-process low-grade nickel laterite ores in Indonesia...|$|R

Heterogeneity in soil properties increased Cv(?) to values commensurate with field observations and weakened signatures of hysteresis at all of the studied locations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of lithotrophic Fe(II) -oxidizing bacteria on patterns of ferric oxide deposition in opposing gradients of Fe(II) and O 2 was examined at submillimeter resolution {{by use of}} an O 2 microelectrode and diffusion microprobes for iron. In cultures inoculated with lithotrophic Fe(II) -oxidizing bacteria, the majority of Fe(III) deposition occurred below the depth of O 2 penetration. In contrast, Fe(III) deposition in <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> cultures occurred entirely within the aerobic zone. The diffusion microprobes revealed the formation of soluble or colloidal Fe(III) compounds during biological Fe(II) oxidation. The presence of mobile Fe(III) in diffusion probes from live cultures was verified by washing the probes in anoxic water, which removed ca. 70 % of the Fe(III) content of probes from live cultures but did not alter the Fe(III) content of probes from <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls.</b> Measurements {{of the amount of}} Fe(III) oxide deposited in the medium versus the probes indicated that ca. 90 % of the Fe(III) deposited in live cultures was formed biologically.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{provides}} experimental evidence for biologically induced precipitation of magnesium carbonates, specifically dypingite (Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 5 H 2 O), by cyanobacteria from an alkaline wetland near Atlin, British Columbia. This wetland {{is part of}} a larger hydromagnesite (Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 4 H 2 O) playa. Abiotic and biotic processes for magnesium carbonate precipitation in this environment are compared. Results Field observations show that evaporation of wetland water produces carbonate films of nesquehonite (MgCO 3 · 3 H 2 O) on the water surface and crusts on exposed surfaces. In contrast, benthic microbial mats possessing filamentous cyanobacteria (Lyngbya sp.) contain platy dypingite (Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 5 H 2 O) and aragonite. Bulk carbonates in the benthic mats (δ 13 C avg. = 6. 7 %, δ 18 O avg. = 17. 2 %) were isotopically distinguishable from abiotically formed nesquehonite (δ 13 C avg. = 9. 3 %, δ 18 O avg. = 24. 9 %). Field and laboratory experiments, which emulated natural conditions, were conducted to provide insight into the processes for magnesium carbonate precipitation in this environment. Field microcosm experiments included an <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> and two microbial systems, one containing ambient wetland water and one amended with nutrients to simulate eutrophic conditions. The <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> developed an extensive crust of nesquehonite on its bottom surface during which [Mg 2 +] decreased by 16. 7 % relative to the starting concentration. In the microbial systems, precipitation occurred within the mats and was not simply due to the capturing of mineral grains settling out of the water column. Magnesium concentrations decreased by 22. 2 % and 38. 7 % in the microbial systems, respectively. Laboratory experiments using natural waters from the Atlin site produced rosettes and flakey globular aggregates of dypingite precipitated in association with filamentous cyanobacteria dominated biofilms cultured from the site, whereas the <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> again precipitated nesquehonite. Conclusion Microbial mats in the Atlin wetland create ideal conditions for biologically induced precipitation of dypingite and have presumably played a significant role in the development of this natural Mg-carbonate playa. This biogeochemical process represents an important link between the biosphere and the inorganic carbon pool. </p...|$|R
