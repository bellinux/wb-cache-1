3000|$|For example, {{humanitarian}} law rules do prohibit {{the use of}} starvation {{as a method of}} warfare and the targeting of essential resources (being classed as civilian objects), 12 thereby providing limited protection of materials. The rules on access to humanitarian aid are more developed for international armed conflicts. For non-international armed conflicts, however, the <b>applicable</b> <b>treaty</b> rules do not explicitly refer to humanitarian aid (Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs 2011, 25 – 26). Regardless, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs has interpreted Common Article 3 to include a principle that civilian populations may not be intentionally subjected to situations that would, {{due to a lack of}} access to essential supplies, threaten their dignity or result in “serious mental or physical suffering” (Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs 2011, 26). However, these rules are constructed as ‘negative’ obligations—prohibitions of certain conduct requiring parties to refrain from interfering with access to essential supplies. Whilst the same obligations can be found under economic, social and cultural rights, human rights law goes further, requiring states parties to not only respect the rights (i.e. refrain from interfering with their enjoyment) but also protect and fulfil the rights by providing the means and/or substance for the right to be effectively realised (Shue 1980, 260; Eide 1987). 13 [...]...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{tendency}} of investment tribunals to resort to teleological interpretation and to the protection and promotion of foreign investments as a standard goal of investment treaties. It further explores how this tendency relates {{to the rule of}} interpretation envisaged in Articles 31 – 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties considering that the convention rule requires that text, context, and purpose are to be equally assessed when searching for the meaning of a treaty provision. The article’s particular focus is on whether investment tribunals have begun to create specific rules for interpreting investment treaties that favor one of the elements of interpretation over the others, namely, the purpose of the treaty. This method of teleological interpretation is set against the general background of investment arbitration, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and cases where investment tribunals’ reliance on the preamble of the <b>applicable</b> <b>treaty</b> was decisive for the final outcome of the case. These cases, which revolved around the goal to protect and promote foreign investments and teleological interpretation, lend support to the proposition {{that there has been a}} departure from the general rule. However, they equally show the unreliability of telos in a treaty: purposes may be different, even conflicting, and their clear meaning can easily escape interpreters. Despite a growing number of cases where the purpose of a treaty comes to the forefront of legal reasoning, the functional correlation between the purpose of a treaty and the legitimacy of a claim still remains unclear...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Washington State UniversityInternational water law, an {{outgrowth}} of international law, is a conglomeration of tenets from international conventions and treaties that recognize rules codified by contesting states, customary law, judicial decisions, and writings of qualified legal practitioners. A set of water management principles (WMPs) are presented, which {{form the basis for}} the development of a model transboundary agreement (TBA), or template treaty, for international river basins. The relevant tenets of international water law, which support the selection of the WMPs, are identified and analyzed. This study is undertaken because the world community has not yet agreed upon a universally <b>applicable</b> <b>treaty</b> to manage the uses and protection of shared water resources. The set of WMPs are largely adopted from The International Law Association's 1966 Helsinki Rules, the United Nation 1997 Convention on Non-navigable Watercourses, and existing TBAs. These include the concept of equitable and reasonable utilization as the guiding principle of international watercourse management. A few existing concepts refined by the author are presented (e. g., the establishment of emergency contingency plans; the mapping and monitoring of all water wells within a basin), as are relatively recent concepts that have not typically been incorporated into most existing TBAs (e. g., acceptance of aquifers [groundwater] as a resource often situated primarily below basins, and the need to conjunctively manage this resource along with surface water). Chapter One addresses WMPs, Chapter Two presents the template treaty, Chapter Three presents a proposed TBA for the Pilcomayo River Basin (PRB) of Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay ("proposed PRB treaty"), and Chapter Four discusses plans for promoting the template treaty and the proposed PRB treaty.

40|$|In {{a globalized}} market for private equity investments, {{the risk for}} {{international}} double taxation has made the applicability of tax treaties all the more important. The study is concerned with private equity fund structures, where a Luxembourgian SIF or SICAR is used as fund vehicle, where the investor is resident in Finland and where the target company is resident in a third state. In such triangular investment structures {{the determination of the}} <b>applicable</b> tax <b>treaty</b> may not always be clear due to differing tax and private laws of the states involved as well as their different interpretations of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Conflicting laws and interpretations of states lead to classification conflicts, which in turn may result in double taxation or double non-taxation; both of which are undesired outcomes in view of many states. The problems with and risks for double taxation are not limited to the determination of the correct <b>applicable</b> tax <b>treaty.</b> There may also exist a conflict regarding the determination of which tax treaty article shall be applied to a certain item of income. In this study that item of income consists of the proceeds from the realized private equity investment. To solve these questions states employ different methods of classification of foreign entities and foreign-sourced income. Classification in Finland is not regulated by law and is thus open to wide interpretation in Finnish courts. Entity and income classification by the Finnish courts is, however, subject to EU law. Classification may not result in taxation which is in conflict with EU law; i. e. EU law may have a strong guiding effect in the classification process. When the <b>applicable</b> tax <b>treaty</b> and tax treaty article has been determined the foreign-sourced income shall be classified for domestic tax law purposes to determine the tax consequences for the recipient of the income. The study consequently considers tax consequences for different Finnish investors. Tax regimes may not necessarily be permanent. Due to tax laws being strongly affected by fiscal interests of states lightly taxed investment structures run the risk of seeing tax benefits limited by changes in prevailing tax regimes. The OECD has recently begun its work on the BEPS project, which may {{have a significant impact on}} the tax treaty applicability in private equity fund structures.

40|$|This {{new version}} of the Documentary Supplement adds a few new sources as it deletes some others. The {{additions}} and deletions should not be looked upon as our assessment of the relative importance of either. All <b>applicable</b> <b>treaties,</b> law, and other regulations are equally important {{to the extent that they}} apply to an issue at hand; in attempting to compile a book of reasonable length, the difficulty is in deciding which sources apply to enough issues to warrant inclusion. Our standard here is simply this: as part of our plenary instruction, do we as instructors refer explicitly to such a source, with the expectation that students will have to actually read its various portions? Our focus on plenary instruction permits us to produce a document for general and repeated use; instruction in specialty subjects may involve its own set of supporting documents. The second aspect of the standard is critical, as our model of instruction places a premium on students digging into the treaties themselves in order to build their understanding. Most notably, we have included that portion of Army Regulation 190 - 8 that includes guidance on the conduct of GC III Article 5 Tribunals. It is the only extract we offer, but it is impractical to include the entire lengthy regulation. We include any portion with trepidation, as a new version AR 190 - 8 is expected to be reissued soon, which will force a further update of this supplement. Nevertheless, it is a risk worth taking given the importance of AR 190 - 8 to our current instruction...|$|R

The Tribunal, SADC’s judicial organ, is situated in Windhoek, Namibia and became operational in 2005. The Tribunal enjoys a wide mandate {{to hear and determine}} disputes between states, states and SADC, and between natural and legal persons and states or SADC. It is mandated to develop its own jurisprudence having regard to <b>applicable</b> <b>treaties,</b> general rules and principles of public international law, and principles and rules of law of member states. Being new in the field, the Tribunal has not as yet developed a significant jurisprudence although it has delivered a number of judgments some of which are referred to in the study. The Tribunal is expected to develop its own jurisprudence having regard to the jurisprudence developed by other international courts involved in the judicial settlement of disputes. The study offers a comparative review and analysis of the jurisprudence of two selected courts: the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). The focus is on four selected areas considered crucial to the functioning of the Tribunal and the selected courts. The study discusses the parties with access to the Tribunal and compares this with access to the ICJ and ECJ. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is contrasted with that of the two selected courts. The sources of law available to the Tribunal are discussed and contrasted to those of the two courts. Lastly, the enforcement of law in SADC is contrasted to what applies in relation to the selected courts. In each selected area, similarities and differences between the Tribunal and the two courts are noted and critically evaluated. Further, rules and principles developed by the two selected courts are explored in depth with a view to identifying those which could be of use to the Tribunal. Recommendations are made on rules and principles which could be of use to the Tribunal and on possible improvements to the SADC treaty regime. Constitutional, International and Indigenous LawLL.

40|$|In my pro gradu thesis, I {{introduce}} the applicable principles of automatic exchange of account information in international tax {{matters in the}} context of the United States’ Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, regulation and contrast this with the OECD's Global Forum drafted Common Reporting Standard, or CRS. The recently implemented policies require that certain actors in the financial sector, such as banks and investment entities report their foreign clients and their account information to their respective tax residence jurisdictions, and with FATCA that they report to the United States of America. I describe some of the practical application problems, that these requirements regarding financial account information may cause in the private sector and at the administrative level, especially with respect to these two different automatic exchange of financial account information systems, FATCA and CRS. I focus on the differences between these two systems by comparing them to one another. The chosen perspective is global compliance and application, instead of any particular jurisdiction applying FATCA and/or CRS. I use certain jurisdictions as examples of the treaty implementation to further demonstrate the differences between the two systems. The main research method is a fiscal policy approach with a socio-economic focus as well as some methods of comparative law. The key sources are the <b>applicable</b> <b>treaties</b> and the material containing the detailed rules for the application of the systems. As additional source material I also use academic articles and government announcements, which specify the interpretation of the applicable rules. I approach the subject by dividing the pro gradu thesis into chapters that cover the principle of automatic exchange of information or AEoI focusing on the financial account information exchange in the two major <b>applicable</b> <b>treaties.</b> The main chapters of this thesis {{introduce the}} implemented practices from these agreements by emphasizing their significant differences and their possible effects in practice. In the early chapters, I briefly introduce the EU legislation about AEoI as a reference point. The first chapter of this thesis introduces the scope of the topic of AEoI and the interdisciplinary connections to other fields of international tax law. I give some background information about the history of AEoI legislation process and explain the international public pressure for the agreements. The next chapter briefly describes the legislation process of FATCA and the overall system of AEoI in FATCA. Later, I examine the specifics of the agreement focusing on the obligated parties and financial accounts. The second main chapter is a similar description of the multilateral CRS and its background. This leads to the main chapter of this thesis and the further analysis of the research question: What are the main differences between FATCA and the CRS and how will the differences affect the practical applicability of the principle of AEoI for financial accounts in tax matters? The final chapter binds together specific differences between of the application of the automatic exchange of financial account information principles based on the treaties and introduced academic material as well as speculation about the future of AEoI in the light of these agreements and their differences reflecting on global fiscal policy. Finally, I summarize my arguments in the Conclusion chapter. From the technical perspective, the most significant areas of divergence include the option to use account balance de minimis thresholds for identification and reporting purposes to exclude or lighten the due diligence requirements of the financial institutions under FATCA but not under CRS. This has led to implementation, cost and system design issues for many jurisdictions. The treaties have a large amount of very specific definitions, which are used for the implementation of the AEoI, some of these terms do not correspond to one another in the two systems. CRS relies primarily on domestic legislation and practices, whereas FATCA refers mostly to US policy. Additionally, FATCA has a broader set of excluded accounts compared to CRS. Finally, one of the most important differences is the extent of reciprocity in the automatic exchange of financial account information between FATCA and the CRS. FATCA is not truly reciprocal but has a strong economic incentive for compliance. CRS, on the other hand, is truly reciprocal, but lacks efficient compliance incentives and enforcement of sanctions. Neither of the systems do a very good job of regulating trusts and seem to leave them outside of the general reporting requirements, if they are carefully set up in a way to circumvent both systems...|$|R
