25|$|The Charlestown Railway and Harbour Company was {{incorporated}} on 8 August 1859, with capital of £72,000. The Act empowered {{the new company}} to take {{over some of the}} network of the Elgin Railway, between Charlestown and a junction with the West of Fife Mineral Railway at Dunfermline (Townhill Junction), and to improve the harbour at Charlestown. <b>Authorised</b> <b>capital</b> was £72,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} multiplied as directors' {{personal involvement}} and commitments were disclosed, but the creditors {{were interested in}} retrieving something from the mess, and after considerable negotiation an agreement was reached, ratified as the Neath & Brecon Amalgamation and Arrangement Act of 26 July 1869. This authorised the conversion of debts into 6% debentures and extinguished nearly all other claims against the company. The 1867 Act granting additional capital was repealed, and the <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> was now £1,280,000. The line {{was said to have}} really cost £300,000 in cash.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{both the}} railway and the canals were leased to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, with a 999-year lease {{starting}} in June 1864, but in 1874 the lease became a takeover, and the canals {{were just a}} small part of a bigger undertaking. Users of the canals were unhappy with the high tolls and the lack of modernisation, and so in November 1888, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company was formed, with the intent of obtaining the canals from the railway company. They obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, which created the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, with an <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> of £1.5 million, and powers to buy the canals, by compulsory purchase if agreement could not be reached with the railway company. The transfer did not occur until 1895, when agreement was finally reached, and the Dearne and Dove Canal became part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation along with the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Act <b>authorised</b> share <b>capital</b> of £70,125; {{a second}} Act was obtained on 4 June 1829, <b>authorising</b> further share <b>capital</b> of £8,053, and sanctioning the Leith Branch. The third Act, on 27 June 1834, authorised a further £54,875 to build branches to Fisherrow, and [...] "allowing {{a certain amount}} of passenger traffic by horse-drawn railway coaches".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>authorised</b> share <b>capital</b> {{was more}} than doubled, an {{additional}} £130,000 being authorised by this second Act of 2 July 1855, the Rhymney Railway (Amendment) Act.|$|R

500|$|The Ebbw Vale proprietors {{formed the}} West Somerset Mineral Railway for the purpose, and {{obtained}} Parliamentary authority on 16 July 1855 for a standard gauge [...] line from Watchet Quay to Heath Poult (or [...] "Exton"). The <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> was £50,000. The first sod was cut at Roughmoor on 29 May 1856 and a locomotive was {{obtained in the}} following November; however it was put out of action in January 1857 by serious damage to the boiler.|$|E
500|$|On 20 April 1900 {{his company}} was floated on the stock market, {{becoming}} a limited company {{under the name of}} William Ford Stanley and Co Ltd. Around 25,000 shares in his company sold at £5 each, giving an <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> of £120,000. Stanley retired from the company (although still acting as Chairman of the Board and Managing Director), leaving Henry Thomas Tallack (a business partner) and his brother Joseph to run the day-to-day operations. By 1903 (when the company reached its golden jubilee), it claimed to be the [...] "largest business {{of its kind in the}} world".|$|E
500|$|The GNER had {{authority}} for a railway from York to Newcastle; it opened to Darlington in 1841 having {{spent all of}} its <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> and could not start work on the extension to Newcastle. At the time Parliament was considering the route of a railway between England and Scotland and favoured a railway via the west coast. Railway financier George Hudson chaired a meeting of representatives of north-eastern railways that wished a railway to be built via the east coast. In the 1830s a number of railways had opened in the area between Darlington and Newcastle, and Robert Stephenson was engaged to select a route using these railways as much as possible. The Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway (N) differed slightly from the GNER route in the southern section before joining the Durham Junction Railway at Rainton and using the Pontop & South Shields Railway from Washington to Brockley Whins, where a new curve onto the Brandling Junction Railway allowed direct access to Gateshead. This required the construction of [...] of new line, [...] less than the GNER route, but trains would need to travel [...] further.|$|E

50|$|On 26 June 1846 the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway (C&DJR) was {{authorised}} by Act of Parliament {{to construct}} the line; The <b>authorised</b> share <b>capital</b> was £600,000, a considerable sum for the time.|$|R
2500|$|A small local railway company built {{a branch}} line from Firsby {{junction}} to Spilsby, which it opened on 1 May 1868. The branch {{was just over}} [...] long and connected Spilsby to the King's Cross, London to Cleethorpes main line. The only other railway station on the branch line was Halton Holegate Halt. Necessary parliamentary permission was obtained by an Act in July 1865 which incorporated The Spilsby & Firsby Railway Company with an <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> of £20,000 and loans of £8,333 {{for the construction of}} the four-mile-long single-track branch.|$|E
2500|$|Despite its healthy {{level of}} <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> and dividends, {{the onset of}} the Depression in 1930 induced the board to propose a merger of the company with its great Edinburgh rival McEwan’s to form a new combine to be known as Scottish Brewers Ltd. with effect from 6 December 1931. While both {{companies}} continued to produce their own ales marketed under their own names, they now shared financial and technical resources; and exports were handled by a new company, McEwan-Younger Ltd. From 1951 to 1970 this fell under the Directorship of Stenhard Landale FRSE.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aim of the}} {{improvements}} was to increase the minimum depth from [...] to [...] By early 1796, the Beeston cut was operational, with the Cranfleet cut following in 1797, and the Holme cut in 1800, with the whole works being finished by 1 September 1801. The cost exceeded the <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> by a large margin, with the extra being borrowed, but the company continued to pay a 7 per cent dividend on the original shares and on those created to finance the new work. In 1823 and again in 1831, the Newark Navigation Commissioners proposed improvements to the river, so that larger vessels could be accommodated, but the Trent Navigation Company were making a good profit, and {{did not see the}} need for such work.|$|E

50|$|There {{remained}} {{the issue of}} actually obtaining the Act of Parliament incorporating the company, but this went through without great difficulty and on 8 July 1853 the Peebles Railway was <b>authorised,</b> with <b>capital</b> of £70,000.|$|R
50|$|The act for the {{incorporation}} of the company received the Royal assent on 4 July 1836, <b>authorising</b> a <b>capital</b> of £100,000 and the facility to raise a loan of a further £30,000. A second act was obtained on 23 March 1840.|$|R
2500|$|As the {{extractive}} {{industries of}} West Fife developed, {{increasing numbers of}} pits needed a railway connection, and on 14 July 1856 the West of Fife Mineral Railway was authorised, to build a line between Dunfermline and Killairnie, {{on the way to}} Saline. Good quality blackband ironstone and limestone were known to be available as well as coal. The Dunfermline starting point was to be at or near the Elgin Railway Junction (which became Whitemyre Junction), and the termination was to be [...] "at a Point in a Field or Enclosure on the Estate of Killairnie, adjoining the Junction of the Turnpike Road from Redcraigs to Saline, with the New Road leading there from to North Steelend". There was to be a branch to Kingseat. <b>Authorised</b> <b>capital</b> was £45,000, and passenger operation had been mentioned in the prospectus and was authorised in the Act, although passengers were never actually carried. It opened as far as Steelend on 25 June 1858. The opening of the West of Fife, which was a railway of standard gauge using modern wagons, offering direct transit onward to the main line network, changed the nature of the mineral lines in the area, and the old waggonway lines suffered.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1790s, the Navigation faced calls for a bypass of the river at Nottingham, where the passage past Trent Bridge was dangerous, and the threat of a canal running parallel to the river, which was proposed by the Erewash and the Trent and Mersey Canal companies. In order to retain control of the whole river, they supported the inclusion of the Beeston Cut in the bill for the Nottingham Canal, which prevented the Erewash Canal company from getting permission to build it, and then had the proposal removed from the Nottingham Canal company's bill in return for their support of the main bill. The parallel canal was thwarted in May 1793, when they negotiated the withdrawal of the canal bill by proposing a thorough survey of the river which would result in their own legislation being put before parliament. William Jessop performed the survey, assisted by Robert Whitworth, and they published their report on 8 July 1793. The major proposals included a cut and lock at Cranfleet, where the River Soar joins the Trent, a cut, locks and weirs at Beeston, which would connect with the Nottingham Canal at Lenton, and a cut and lock at Holme Pierrepont. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1794, and the existing proprietors subscribed the whole of the <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> of £13,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ), themselves.|$|E
2500|$|A sale notice {{produced}} in 1874 {{in preparation for}} an auction of the quarry and plant claimed that development work at Rhosydd had cost £150,000. The auction took place in Manchester on 27 June 1874, and the quarry was sold for just £29,500. The buyers created the New Rhosydd Slate Quarry Company Ltd on 10 October, and whereas the previous company had been dominated by Englishmen, three-quarters of the initial shares in the new company were bought by local people, from Ffestiniog, Porthmadog and the surrounding area. There were bankers, doctors, magistrates, merchants, quarry agents, solicitors and [...] "gentlemen". The new company set its <b>authorised</b> <b>capital</b> at £80,000, consisting of 1,600 shares valued at £50 each, but only £44,000 was subscribed. Richard Hughes of Ynystowyn, Porthmadog acted as secretary until 1921, and the company office was in Ynystowyn. All of the directors were Welshmen, and remained so {{for the life of}} the quarry. Good dividends were paid between 1876 and 1889, but then profitability declined. In 1900, a large section of the underground workings collapsed, in what was known as the [...] "great fall". The company now had to create a new quarry, with the only finance coming from their revenue account. Evan Jones took on the job of opening up new workings in 1906, when the previous agent, William W Morris, was retired, having shown that he was unable to complete such a task.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} the canal gained its Act of Parliament on 11 April 1826, the {{estimated}} cost of construction, to be funded by shareholders, was put at £295,000. The <b>authorised</b> share <b>capital</b> was £300,000, and the company had powers to borrow a further £100,000.|$|R
50|$|The Act <b>authorised</b> the <b>capital</b> but {{the company}} had {{to raise the money}} themselves, and this proved {{extremely}} difficult. In fact two years of strenuous attempts to secure subscriptions were almost completely fruitless, and it appeared likely that the scheme would have to be abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the threat}} of the {{railways}} taking trade from the canals, the Don Navigation Company decided to purchase the Barnsley Canal, and to lease the Dearne and Dove for a year, after which they would buy it. The agreement with the Dearne and Dove went ahead, with the River Don Navigation taking over the canal from 1 January 1846, and paying £210,000 for it on 2 January 1847, but they failed to reach agreement with the Barnsley Canal. Tolls were reduced by 60 per cent in 1846, with free passage for empty boats from 1847, with the result that much of the coal traffic which had previously used the Barnsley Canal now used the Dearne and Dove. The South Yorkshire, Doncaster & Goole Railway Company was authorised in 1847, and the Act of Parliament allowed them to amalgamate with the Don Navigation Company, and hence the Dearne and Dove, once they had raised half of their <b>authorised</b> <b>capital.</b> The amalgamation took place on 19 April 1850. The railway company opened their line from Doncaster to Swinton in November 1849, which was followed by a branch to Elsecar in February 1850, and another branch to Worsbrough in June 1850. At Elsecar, the canal basin was moved, and about [...] of the canal were filled in {{to make way for the}} railway. While the takeover was beneficial to traffic on parts of the Don Navigation, tonnage carried on the Dearne and Dove fell.|$|E
