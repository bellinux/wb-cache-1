5000|$|Americus's {{innovation}} was {{the addition}} of an [...] "escapement" [...] to Silbermann's realization of a string striking action design. Unlike Cristofori's design (to which of course Americus had no access) which interposed an intermediate lever between the lever that the key lifts and the striking hammer, Americus placed an upstanding wooden [...] "jack" [...] pivoting from this lever acting directly on a leather clothed notch in the hammer butt. An <b>adjustable</b> <b>screw</b> mounted underneath the hammer flange support rail, known as a [...] "set-off", impacts upon the jack, disengaging it from the hammer which is thus launched into free flight before it strikes its course of strings.|$|E

50|$|The Wide Range pickup was {{conceived}} to be sonically closer to Fender's single coil pickups than Gibson humbuckers. Due {{to the difficulty}} of machining AlNiCo magnets into screw-type pole pieces, this concept called {{for the use of the}} more easily machinable CuNiFe (Copper/Nickel/Iron) rod magnets as pole pieces within the coil structures, to function more like a regular Strat pickup than a Gibson humbucker. Whereas Gibson humbuckers use a single bar magnet under the coils of the pickup, Wide Range pickups have individual CuNiFe magnets that were threaded and slotted to resemble the <b>adjustable</b> <b>screw</b> type poles of a Gibson humbucker. The pickup bobbins were wound with approximately 6800 turns of copper wire around the pole-pieces and the Wide Range pickup has a DC resistance of around 10 kΩ.|$|E
5000|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method of presetting torque {{is with a}} calibrated clutch mechanism. One common form uses a ball detent and spring, with the spring preloaded by an <b>adjustable</b> <b>screw</b> thread, calibrated in torque units. The ball detent transmits force until the preset torque is reached, {{at which point the}} force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball [...] "clicks" [...] out of its socket. The advantage of this design is greater precision and both tangible and audible feedback on reaching the desired torque. The wrench will not start slipping once the desired torque is reached, it will only click and bend slightly at the head, the operator can continue to apply torque to the wrench without any additional action or warnings from the wrench. For this reason, it is important to stop applying torque as soon as the wrench gives the click sound.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1942 Daimler {{had also been}} working on an {{upgraded}} D-series engine that could run on either C2 or C3 fuel. The first of these, which appeared in late 1944, were a small series of DB 605DM, followed by the main production series, the DB 605DB/DC. These engines were fitted with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>screw</b> stop which allowed the use of either B4 fuel with MW-50, or C-3 fuel without MW-50, {{in which case the}} engine was designated DB 605DB, or the use of C-3 fuel with MW-50, in which case the engine was given the -DC suffix instead. In its DB-suffix form the engine generated 1,800 PS (1,775 hp) for take-off at 1.8 ata, while the DC was capable of 2,000 PS (1,973 hp) at 1.98 ata. If MW-50 was not available for use with the B4 fuel the throttle was limited to 1.45 ata for the entire flight. Thus, this series was ideally suited to catering for the chaotic fuel supply situation prevalent during the last months of the Third Reich. These engines were mainly used in the Bf 109G-10 and K-4 series.|$|E

40|$|Contact between rough {{surfaces}} produces a complex contact profile. The contact area is usually estimated according to roughness statistics {{in conjunction with}} surface models or by examining the surfaces before and after contact. Most of the existing literature on loaded surface profiles is theoretical or numerical in nature.

The system allows the measurement of contact area, deformation and contact resistance {{in terms of the}} contact force and plane displacement, all whilst the surfaces are actually in contact. This paper presents the initial study of the methodology and focuses on the method for determining the real contact area. The laser performs the scan through a transparent flat slide supported in a fixed position above the base. A test contact is mounted on a force sensor on an <b>adjustable</b> <b>screw</b> support such that this sub-assembly can move into contact with the fixed transparent surface.

40|$|Business process {{standardization}} (BPS) is {{an important}} instrument for transforming an organization from function orientation to process orientation. But, standardization initiatives' implementation success is highly volatile. One major reason for failure is the behavior and the underlying job-related attitude of the affected employees. Recent research examining BPS implementation success proposes that different factors of employees' current jobs (e. g., job characteristics) influence employees' acceptance of BPS-induced changes. Besides these motivational aspects, IS {{research has shown that}} non-adoption of a system is influenced by inertia of the employees. Our research-in-progress paper draws on these findings and aims to analyze the role of inertia in the context of BPS.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of proteinuria in patients suf-fering from {{congestive heart failure}} is a common clinical occurrence. Since such patients, without any intrinsic renal disease, frequently have both an elevated renal venous pressure and a reduced renal blood flow (1), {{it would seem that}} either one or both of these factors may lead to protein-uria. Proteinuria has been produced experimentally by partial obstruction either of the renal artery or of the renal vein (2 - 5). In most of this work, however, studies of renal hemodynamics were in-complete, or when adequate pressure and blood flow measurements were made (6, 7), the ex-periments were such {{that it was impossible to}} de-termine specifically which hemodynamic factor was responsible for the {{appearance of}} the pro-teinuria. The present study was undertaken in an at-tempt to define further the hemodynamic changes responsible for the excretion of protein by the acutely congested kidney. METHODS Experiments were performed on 26 adult female mon-grel dogs weighing between 10 kg. and 30 kg. The ani-mals were anesthetized by the intravenous administra-tion of 0. 45 to 0. 79 ml. per kilogram of a 6 per cent solu-tion of sodium pentobarbital.

40|$|AbstractCoronary {{thrombolysis}} {{in patients}} frequently unmasks high grade residual stenosis. To determine whether beneficial effects of reperfusion are compromised by critical residual coronary stenosis, 14 dogs were instrumented with an external left anterior descending coronary artery balloon occluder, Doppler flow probe and <b>adjustable</b> <b>screw</b> clamp. In {{eight of the}} dogs, critical stenosis (abolition of reactive hyperemia after a 20 s occlusion; 95. 7 ± 1. 0 % cross-sectional area reduction) was induced before occlusion and maintained. In the control group (n = 6), no stenosis was induced Each dog was subjected to 2 h of myocardial ischemia followed by balloon deflation and 24 h of reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow assessed with microspheres was similar during balloon inflation in both groups and indicative of profound ischemia. Transmural {{blood flow to the}} reperfused zone assessed 1 min after balloon deflation was significantly greater in control dogs without residual stenosis (383 % of normal compared with 120 % of normal in dogs with stenosis) (p < 0. 01). Compromise of transmural flow persisted in dogs with stenosis (85 % compared with 121 % of normal in control dogs after 1 h, p < 0. 05; and 49 % compared with 68 % after 24 h of reperfusion, p < 0. 05). Diminution of subendocardial blood Row after reperfusion was particularly marked. The extent of infarction was greater in the heart of dogs with residual stenosis. Thus, residual critical coronary stenosis compromises nutritional perfusion and salvage of reperfused myocardium after recanallzation. These observations underscore the need for prompt identification of patients with high grade residual stenosis early after coronary thrombolysis and the potential value of angioplasty or coronary surgery in selected patients soon after initial recanalization...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to propose a new 2 -DOF robotic {{platform}} with hybrid parallel-serial structure and to undertake its parametric design {{so that it can}} follow the whole range of ankle related foot movements. This robot can serve as a human ankle rehabilitation device. The existing ankle rehabilitation devices present typically {{one or more of the}} following shortcomings: redundancy, large size, or high cost, hence the need for a device that could offer simplicity, modularity, and low cost of construction and maintenance. In addition, our targeted device must be safe during operation, disallow undesirable movements of the foot, while adaptable to any human foot. Our detailed study of foot kinematics has led us to a new hybrid architecture, which strikes a balance among all aforementioned goals. It consists of a passive serial kinematics chain with two <b>adjustable</b> <b>screws</b> so that the axes of the chain match the two main ankle-axes of typical feet. An active parallel chain, which consists of two prismatic actuators, provides the movement of the platform. Thus, the platform can follow the foot movements, thanks to the passive chain, and also possesses the advantages of parallel robots, including rigidity, high stiffness and force capabilities. The lack of redundancy yields a simpler device with lower size and cost. The paper describes the kinematics modelling of the platform and analyses the force and velocity transmission.

With a diameter of 3. 5 m and a weight of only 140 kg, the mirror could be incorporated into a telescope and launched to a high orbit by the Shuttle or number of other vehicles. Such a space mission would complement those already planned for scaled down tests of the unfolding of the NGST mirror segments (NEXUS) and the sunshade (ISIS). Much would be learned by running the mirror at cryogenic temperature, with a new infrared array to make preliminary observations in the 2 - 4 microns dark sky window, and a CCD to check optical image quality.
