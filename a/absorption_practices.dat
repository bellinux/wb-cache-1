40|$|AbstractSpray columns can {{potentially}} be utilized for absorbing CO 2 from large point {{sources such as}} flue gas exhausted by power plants. Low gas phase pressure drop, {{and the lack of}} internals which are susceptible to corrosion, make spray columns well suited for aqueous amine <b>absorption.</b> Design <b>practices</b> for spray columns are highly empirical and application specific. There is a paucity of data on absorption of CO 2 in aqueous amine sprays. Mass transfer data for CO 2 -amine systems is required for robust design of spray columns. Further, the absorption efficiency of sprays is greatly influenced by the surface area of drops, which in turn depends on the droplet size distribution. However, experimental data for droplet size distributions inside aqueous amine sprays is non-existent. Measurement of droplet size distributions is critical in providing a fundamental insight into spray absorption. This work presents molar flux data coupled with droplet size distribution data for CO 2 absorption into Monoethanolamine (MEA) spray. Both the molar flux measurements and the droplet size measurements are made inside a 0. 2 m glass column. The droplet size distributions are measured using a Phase Doppler Interferometer (PDI). Further, a novel method is utilized to quantify the available surface area from the droplet size distribution measurements.

Here evidence is presented for local absorption by showing a correlation between the observed X-ray hardness ratios (an indicator of absorption) and the 6 cm radio data (a measure of the stellar wind column density).

Na pesquisa exploratória, dois atletas executaram projeções (Ippon-Seoi-Nage) e quedas da conseqüente (Zempô-Kaiten-Ukemi) para cada segmento do corpo avaliado (pulso e quadril), em sete tipos de tatame (seis sintéticos e uma de palha). Um acelerômetro triaxial foi fixado no atleta que era projetado (primeiramente no punho e depois no quadril), para as medidas respectivas do impacto. Para a pesquisa de campo, 63 judocas, executando as mesmas técnicas, responderam um protocolo sobre a percepção do desconforto sobre cada tipo de material. Os dados foram coletados por meio do programa SAD 32 e as curvas experimentais do acelerômetro foram importadas para o software de MATLAB (versão 5, 1999), para parametrização e derivação a fi m obter o a, q e jerk, respectivamente. Os resultados obtidos para a percepção subjetiva e na parametrização das curvas (a and q), classificaram os tatames quanto ao desconforto, sendo esta classifi cação na ordem crescente para o segmento do punho: A, B, F, G, D, C, E; e para o quadril: A, F, B, C, G, D, E. Acredita-se que os procedimentos descritos aqui para a realização do a, q e os índices do jerk serão úteis para a classifi cação do desconforto fornecido por outros materiais submetidos ao impacto tal como sobresolas e solas de sapatas esportivo. ABSTRACT This study, characterized both as {{field and}} investigative had {{the objective of}} investigating the comfort provided by different tatamis for the fall <b>absorption</b> <b>practice</b> (ukemi). In the investigative research performed at laboratory, seven types of tatamis were tested (six synthetic and one straw made) in which 2 athletes performed projections (Ippon-Seoi- Nage) and consequent falls (Zempô-Kaiten-Ukemi) for each body segment evaluated (wrist and hip). A triaxial accelerometer was fastened to the athlete, first at the wrist {{and then at the}} hip, for the respective impact measures. For the field research, 63 judo fi ghters, performing the same fall projection, who inferred in a protocol the discomfort perception about each type of material, tested the same tatamis. The data were collected through the SAD 32 program and the experimental acceleration curves were imported for the MATLAB (version 5, 1999) software, which were parameterized and derived in order to obtain the a, q and jerk calculations, respectively. The results obtained for both the subjective perception, in the parameterization of curves (a and q) and for the values of jerk, ended up by classifying the tatamis with regard to the discomfort characteristic, being this classifi cation in crescent order for the wrist segment: A, B, F, G, D, C, E; and for the hip: A, F, B, C, G, D, E.

40|$|THE method usually {{employed}} for {{the determination of}} oxygen in natural waters is that described in Standard Methods of Water Analysis (1925). The basis of this method is the Winkler chemical method for the estimation of dissolved oxygen. A sample of the water to be examined is collected in a bottle of about 250 c. c. capacity. The usual Winkler reagents are added and the iodine liberated is titrated against a standard sodium thiosulphate solution. The amount of oxygen originally present in the sample can then be deduced. 1 The disadvantages of this method for the determination of oxygen in the field come mainly under two categories: inaccuracy, and the bulkiness of the apparatus that {{must be taken into}} the field. The inaccuracies arise chiefly from the contami-nation of the water sample with atmospheric air during the taking of the sample and during the addition of the reagents. The error is often quite large when dealing with very low oxygen concentrations.

If an individual becomes engulfed in the tail, they will be sent downward until entering Cell's body and being integrated into his core. This method differs from the other in that the absorbed individual will remain both completely intact within Cell's body, as was the case with Android #18. Removing the androids from Cell's body previously could cause him to revert to a prior form, though his body has been shown to remember the biological makeup of a transformation in the event that it no longer can be achieved with the subject inside of him and he has had it previously.|$|R

Time-resolved LII signals were measured at 610 nm (20 nm FWHM) at different heights above the burner exit surface and at different laser fluences. The averaged soot temperature over 10 ns around the laser peak was determined from spectrally resolved LII signals over the spectral range of 5002 ̆ 013630 nm. Flame temperature and soot primary particle diameter and aggregate size at several flame heights were obtained using the NO-LIF thermometry and from image analyses of sampled soot. The time-resolved LII signal and the averaged soot temperature were modeled using two LII models. To achieve reasonable agreement between the modeled and experimental LII signal and soot temperature at low laser fluences, {{it is necessary to}} use flame height-dependent soot <b>absorption</b> functions.

40|$|Conventional {{control systems}} express control {{solutions}} {{by means of}} expressions, usually mathematically based. In order to completely express the control solution, {{a vast amount of}} data is required. In contrast, knowledge-based solutions require far less plant data and mathematical expression. This reduces development time proportionally. In addition, because this type of processing does not require involved calculations, processing speed is increased, since rule process is separate and all processes can be performed simultaneously. These results in improved product quality, better plant efficiency, simplified process, etc. Within this project, conventional PID control has already been implemented, with the control parameter adjustment and loop tuning being problematic. This is mainly due to a number of external parameters that affects the stability of the process. In maintaining a consistent temperature, for example, the steam flow rate varies, the hot well temperature varies, the ambient may temperature vary. Another contributing factor, the time delay, also affects the optimization of the system, {{due to the fact that}} temperature measurement is based on principle of <b>absorption.</b> The normal <b>practice</b> in industry to avoid an unstable control condition is to have an experienced operator to switch the controller to manual, and make adjustments.

30|$|Herron et al. [1], in a {{very recent}} review, examine the main routes for CO 2 capture from {{stationary}} sources with high CO 2 concentrations derived from post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion processes. In post-combustion, flue gases formed by combustion of fossil fuels in air lead to gas streams with 3 – 20 % CO 2 in nitrogen, oxygen, and water. Other processes that produce even higher CO 2 concentrations include pre-combustion in which CO 2 is generated at concentrations of 15 – 40 % at elevated pressure (15 – 40  bar) during H 2 enrichment of synthesis gas (syngas) via a water–gas shift reaction (WGS—see Fig.  1) and oxy-combustion in which fuel is combusted {{in a mixture of}} O 2 and CO 2 − rather than air, leading to a product with 75 – 80 % CO 2. CO 2 capture can be achieved by absorption using liquid solvents (wet-scrubbing) or solid adsorbents. In the former approach, physical solvents (e.g., methanol) are preferred for concentrated CO 2 streams with high CO 2 partial pressures, while chemical solvents [e.g., monoethanolamine (MEA)] are useful in low-pressure streams. Energy costs for MEA wet-scrubbing are reportedly as low as 0.37 – 0.51  MWh/ton CO 2 with a loading capacity of 0.40  kg CO 2 per kg MEA. Disadvantages of this process are the high energy cost for regenerating solvent, the cost to compress captured CO 2 for transport and storage, and the low degradation temperature of MEA. Alternatives include membrane and cryogenic separation. With membranes, there is an inverse correlation between selectivity and permeability, so one must optimize between purity and separation rate. Cryogenic separation insures high purity at the expense of low yield and higher cost. Currently, MEA <b>absorption</b> is industrially <b>practiced,</b> but is limited in scale: 320 – 800 metric tons 9 CO 2 /day (versus a CO 2 generation rate of 12, 000 metric tons per day for a 500  MW power plant). Scale-up would be required to satisfy the needs of a solar refinery. Alternatives, such as membranes, have relatively low capital costs, but require high partial pressures of CO 2 and a costly compression step to achieve high selectivity and rates of separation.|$|R

Even if these services are diverse and delivered by various entities such as government agencies, enterprises or NGOâ€™s, they do have something in common; they cannot generate incomes, but costs for implementing entities. But costs according to the sound financial management principle calls for tracing money with eligible activities using at least some if not all of management accounting concepts. Without some specifics from the donor or a mutual accepted best practice model, most of the ESF beneficiaries are reporting their efforts to actual researches and specialized literature regarding management accounting implementation in services delivering activities. This study was realized in March 2012 by applying an investigation instrument, an on-line questionnaire collecting both opinions and factual data as well to a number of 962 members of a practice community for ESF interventions implementation. This technique was used to test hypotheses regarding the premises for a future improvement of the existing accounting system model by incorporating management accounting. 130 members of this community answered anonymously, revealing an important concern for management accounting usage, even if only less than 15 % declared that they organize it continuously. The rest of more than 85 % perceive an important concern about tracing money with budget breakdowns and activities within their projects, just about 65 % of them considering also that their work is different now in an ESF project than in past situations. More than 83 % of the ones organizing management accounting stated that their actual work is different than in past situations. Analyzing all the answers, we may consider that our hypothesis is correct and there is a real opportunity for accounting system improvements, by incorporating management accounting.

40|$|In this paper, we {{will discuss}} a study whose concern is to {{identify}} and develop areas of food distri­bution by testing a model that allows the practitioners {{to participate in the}} exploring of their own stories of everyday practice. The fundamental reason for engaging the practitioners in the research was to facilitate them in obtaining tools to reflect on practice and to inform about future actions. Our in­tention was to use PAR as the approach as to building a bridge between theory and practice for which the SDM proved to be suitable for gaining and analysing data. Some of the links between the PAR approach and the SDM are that both consist of continuous cycles of reflection and learning. The stories should be used as a powerful vehicle to discover new knowledge and to deepen the under­standing of professional practice issues. Reflection and story telling are closely related to the proces­sing of information and gaining new insights from experiences. To take stories from practitioners’ own experience {{is similar to that of}} the ‘look phase’ of PAR, which implies that what is happening is described and thus clarifies the core problem of what the practitioners would like to change. The ‘think phase’ of PAR, and the structured dialogue in the SDM, involves detailed de­scriptions, explanations and the exploring of the issues that are aggregated and focused on in the structured dialogue around questions such as: What can we do to move on; what actions could be taken; what happens if nothing is done; and what are the possible effects. Actual stories were used as “triggers” when probing questions were asked in a dialogical and structured form. The process involves the combination of having a dialogue and writing memo notes. The dialogue on various strategies, in­clu­ding weaknesses and strengths, continues until each action and the expected benefits of a chosen action have been adequately discus­sed. The dialogue has a constant focus on what is of greatest im­por­tance for a chosen action from an ethical, legal, economic, colla­borative and organisational point of view. Furthermore, the dialogue evaluation emphasises on how participants reflect on what the expected change is, how change comes about, and what the consequences of the change imply. Our conclusion is that the PAR approach and the use of SDM are suitable and systematic methods to generate data and to encourage collaboration between various professional groups, i. e. an active participation through dialogue where there are no restrictions in the communication and everybody’s voice is heard equally. In this study, as to critically reflect on how the SDM embodies a participatory and an ‘action’ oriented approach implies that, as a platform, an actual, real, case from practice was used. Chosen jointly and in agreement by the practitioners, the case should always be one with which all can be familiar and treat as their own. The starting point was our perception that the practitioners are the experts in their particular everyday work, and that they are able to identify problems them­selves, which would be resolvable through actions and changes in the daily routines. Another benefit of involving the practitioners was how their motivation to make changes to a particular problem they had deemed important to resolve increased. The systemic issues, which were identified in the study, call attention to the importance of systematic collaboration, and by using the SDM, issues that concern the organisation and its practice directly may be explored. This cyclical process provided an expanded understanding about the food distribution context. In addition, the dialogue has developed over time from focusing on formal aspects, such as routines, competence levels, responsibility and how to fill in forms, to include more organisational aspects. The practitioners felt that structured dialogues and ref­lecting gave them a better understanding about the food distribution context. The reciprocal relations that were rendered in the non-restrictive communication – down-up and up-down in PAR – were identified as important. Another important insight was that support from the parent organisation was necessary when actions were to be taken and changes in practice were to be made. In closing, the study stems from our shared deep engagement and <b>absorption</b> in <b>practice</b> and together we saw how stories unfolded. It became clear that a greater understanding of and by the various professional groups would have to be obtained in order to achieve changes in the practice of food distribution to elderly persons for which such understanding is a necessary starting point...|$|R
