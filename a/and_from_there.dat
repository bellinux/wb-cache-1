5|$|A {{very small}} number of Muslims managed to escape to France <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to the Muslim North Africa. Some revolted against this orderfor example, a revolt broke out in the Serra d'Espadà. The crown's troops {{defeated}} this rebellion in a campaign which included the killing of 5,000 Muslims. After the defeat of the rebellions, the entire Crown of Aragon was now nominally converted to Christianity.

5|$|Abu Bakr {{was born}} around 1321 to his sultan father an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341) and his {{concubine}} mother, Narjis. Narjis also {{gave birth to}} Abu Bakr's younger full brothers Ramadan (died 1343) and Yusuf (died 1346). Information about Abu Bakr's early childhood is unavailable in the Mamluk sources. The first mention of Abu Bakr came in 1332. At that time, Abu Bakr {{had been sent to}} the desert fortress of al-Karak to join his half-brothers Ahmad and Ibrahim in their military training. Also during that year, Abu Bakr left al-Karak to accompany his father and half-brothers Anuk and Ahmad at al-Aqaba <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. However, an-Nasir Muhammad had them return to al-Karak before the trek to Mecca.|$|E

Since the show's fourth season (2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished {{his share of the}} directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production.

5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of her American-Hawaiian career, American sailed in {{scheduled}} service from New York and Philadelphia around South America via the Straits of Magellan, up to San Francisco <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to Honolulu. Along the way, she was refueled with coal at Saint Lucia in the British West Indies and at Coronel in Chile. The Chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned too quickly and dangerously sent sparks flying from the ship's funnel; the quality and fire danger were key reasons that all subsequent American-Hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel.|$|E
5|$|Attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, {{and under}} command of Captain Hamilton Hutchins, she sailed on 16 December 1907 with the Great White Fleet. The fleet left from Hampton Roads, passed by Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and then {{passed through the}} Straits of Magellan. From there she passed by {{the west coast of}} South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908 and moved on to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later the {{warships}} sailed for Honolulu, Hawaii, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving 9 August. The fleet made Sydney, Australia, on 20 August, and after a week sailed for Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|By now, the War of the Spanish Succession {{had broken}} out, and news of its {{declaration}} reached Benbow on 7 July. He detached Whetstone and six ships to search off Port St Louis in Hispaniola for a French squadron under Admiral Jean du Casse, which he believed would {{call at the}} port on his voyage to Cartagena, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> he might raid English and Dutch shipping. After Whetstone had left, Benbow took his squadron and sailed for Cartagena, anticipating that either he or Whetstone would find Du Casse and bring him to battle.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was carried}} on a chair to the local tobacco shop, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> {{he went to the}} hospital.

He transferred to a private clinic in Bologna, where his injured leg remained in a plaster cast for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of his doctors and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensity}} of the situation, Texas put to sea on 13 May and headed directly to operational duty without benefit of the usual shakedown cruise and post-shakedown repair period. After a five-day stop at Hampton Roads from 14–19 May, she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher's force off Veracruz on 26 May. She remained in Mexican waters for just over two months, supporting the American forces ashore. On 8 August, she left Veracruz and set a course for Nipe Bay, Cuba, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> steamed to New York, where she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August.|$|E

After {{spending}} time in training at military bases in several U.S. states, she received orders assigning her to the Company 'D' WAC Detachment of the Manhattan District, United States Army Corps of Engineers. Her secret assignment was to lead a group of 15 to 20 women from the WAC, stationed in Des Moines, Iowa, to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to Santa Fe, New Mexico. She and the women under her command arrived at Los Alamos, New Mexico on October 21, 1943.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E
