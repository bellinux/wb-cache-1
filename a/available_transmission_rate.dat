In this work, {{we focus on}} a system architecture research of increasing SI-POF <b>transmission</b> <b>rate</b> with existing off-the-shelf components. In order to improve the transmission efficiency of the PAM transmission and avoid the error propagation problem in DFE, we propose a novel pseudo-noise sequence assisted pulse-amplitude modulated (PN-PAM) transmission scheme for short range optical communication systems. This novel scheme is a SCM in nature and is incorporated with a minimum phase pre-filter and a simplified trellis-based equalizer at the receiver side. The coefficients of minimum phase pre-filter could be obtained from a pseudo noise (PN) sequence-based channel estimation with very short training symbol length. A comparison between the capacities of the novel PAM scheme and the existing DMT scheme over SI-POF is carried out with the same experimental setups. It is shown that this proposed PAM transmission scheme is suitable for other short range optical communication systems due to its advantage of low PAPR.|$|R

In addition, our measurements show that the impact of probing in terms of end-to-end performance can be devastating. In particular, the probing functionality can pose a significant degradation in the end-to-end throughput of a single flow, by at least 35 % and as high as 90 %, depending on the probing frequency and network density.

40|$|The {{transition}} from wired to wireless networks {{have opened up}} new horizons forresearch. IEEE 802. 11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) have become increasingly popular due to the recent availability of affordable devices providing multiple and high rate capabilities. Optimizing the performance of wireless networks for emerging network applications is an important and a highly challenging issue. In the next generation WLAN standard, termed IEEE 802. 11 n, new PHY and MAC layer enhancements have been introduced. These improvements have given birth to high throughput and high data rates {{to keep up with}} current and upcoming Internet applications. In this thesis, we investigate various issues related to the new 802. 11 n and legacy standards. The fundamental problem is that 802. 11 WLANs exhibit rich channel dynamics including random channel errors due to interference, mobility-induced channel variation, and contention from hidden stations. As a result, the throughput of IEEE 802. 11 devices is affected due to the wireless channel conditions. In particular, rate control is a fundamental resource management issue for 802. 11 devices; its goal is to optimize the link throughput in various wireless environments. In this thesis, we concentrate on this important issue of rate adaptation for 802. 11 -based WLANs. All the IEEE 802. 11 standards do not specify any algorithm for automatic rate control. The basic idea of rate adaptation is to estimate the current channel condition and dynamically select the best rate out of multiple <b>available</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rates.</b> Many rate adaptation schemes have been proposed in recent years, some of them are not relatively easy to implement by requiring modifications or additions to the IEEE 802. 11 standard.

We also implement this scheme in real hardware devices and then evaluate their performance compared to the existing rate control mechanisms. The experiments prove that our rate adaptation algorithm allows the current wireless hardware to have a greater adaptability to a variety of channel conditions. For future work, we will study other wireless networks such as IEEE 802. 11 p for vehicular Ad-hoc networks and IEEE 802. 16 mesh networks.
