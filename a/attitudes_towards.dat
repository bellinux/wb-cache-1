40|$|Identifying the consumers' <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> television/radio/press {{advertising}} is especially important, a fact which is highlighted by {{national and international}} speciality literature.

Thus, a positive <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the commercial for a brand determines a positive <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the respective brand and, eventually, may result {{in the formulation of}} the purchase intent. It is hard to say which aspects of advertising have the greatest influence on the formation of consumer attitudes and purchase intent formulation, but not impossible to find out. In this context, through this study, we aim at contributing to the determination of the consumers' <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> televised advertising aimed at promoting food products...|$|R

Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all kinds of cases.

Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E

40|$|<b>Attitude</b> <b>towards</b> {{school is}} an {{important}} predictor of academic well-being (McCoach, 2002; McCoach & Siegle, 2003; Patrick, Anderman, & Ryan, 2002). Furthermore, the underlining motivational and affective components and their relationship with academic achievement are not yet well established. The present research aimed to explore the relationship between <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> school including the motivation and emotions connected to the academic setting, and achievement. The general hypothesis is that the <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> school mediates the effects of motivational and affective aspects on academic achievement. To test this hypothesis we adopted two methods. First, we examined the structural relationships between <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> school, motivations, emotions and achievement. Second, we verified the efficacy of an educational training focused on motivation and emotions (Friso, Moè & Pazzaglia, 2004) in improving the <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> school.

40|$|In recent decades, {{magazine}} advertisers {{have used}} {{an increasing number}} of open ads.

We also assessed the effects of openness in relation to an individual's need for cognition. As expected, openness was found to have an overall negative effect on the <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the ad, brand beliefs, and the <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the brand. The negative effect of openness was related to the difficulty participants experience searching for an interpretation.

40|$|Background: Mobile {{commerce}} (m-commerce) is {{a result}} of the phenomenal growth in Internet usage combined with the increasing number of mobile phone users. Entering mobile websites or apps in purchase-, sale- or trade purposes by using a tablet or smart phone, is the definition of m-commerce. To comprehend an individual’s attitude (affect, beliefs and cognition) is of importance in order to find out how the <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> an object will affect the consumer. Up until today, no consensus is drawn regarding the consumers <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> mobile shopping. Generation Y is seen as the most frequent users of mobile devices, even though previous research has not focused on exploring their <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> m-commerce. Research questions: 1. How are the components of attitude associated with the m-commerce factors? 2. What kind of function does each m-commerce factor fulfil? Purpose: The purpose is to explore Generation Y’s <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> m-commerce.

Method and results Multilevel analyses revealed that a positive team climate was positively associated with both a rejecting and responsive <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> aggression. Senior staff members and females showed a less responsive <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> aggression, whereas a relatively high percentage of females in a team and a positive <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> external professionals were associated with a more responsive <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> aggression.

40|$|Nowadays, {{consumers}} {{are exposed to}} a growing volume of television advertisements, most of them incorporating music. The challenge for companies is to compete for viewers’ attention within {{a few seconds of}} advertising. One way of achieving this attention is through music. For this reason, the purpose of this research was to investigate what impact the use of music in television advertising can have on a consumer’s brand attitude. In order to gain insight into the relationships between music components and consumer’s <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the music as well as between the <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the advertising music and <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the brand, a qualitative research approach was pursued. More specifically, a case study and related interviews were conducted with 18 undergraduate students. Their statements were evaluated in order to answer the research questions. The findings of this study show that music components can have an influence on <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the music. However, it is not likely that only one single component forms theattitude. Moreover, a relationship between a consumer’s <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the advertising music and <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the brand exists, but other elements of the ad might influence <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the brand, additionally. The results suggest the need for further research in this area to investigate other contributing components to a consumer’s <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the brand.

5|$|Public <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> feral cats vary widely, {{ranging from}} seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the correlations between patient's trust in medical service/patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy and patient's overall satisfaction with medical service/sub satisfaction in current medical experience and find inspiration for future reform of China's health delivery system on improving patient's overall satisfaction with medical service and sub satisfaction in considering patient's trust in medical service and patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy. Methods This study collaborated with the National Bureau of Statistics to collect a sample of 3, 424 residents from 17 provinces and municipalities in a 2008 China household survey on patient's trust in medical service, patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy, patient's overall satisfaction and sub satisfaction in current medical experience. Results Patient's overall satisfaction with medical service and most kinds of sub satisfaction in current medical experience were significantly influenced by both patient's trust in medical service and patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy; among all kinds of sub satisfaction in current medical experience, patient's trust in medical service/patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy had the largest influence on patient's satisfaction with medical costs, the influences of patient's trust in medical service/patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy on patient's satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction and satisfaction with treatment process were at medium-level, patient's trust in medical service/patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy had the smallest influence on patient's satisfaction with medical facilities and hospital environment, while patient's satisfaction with waiting time in hospital was not influenced by patient's trust in medical service/patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy. Conclusion In order to improve patient's overall satisfaction with medical service and sub satisfaction in considering patient's trust in medical service and patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy, both improving patient's interpersonal trust in medical service from individual's own medical experience/public trust in medical service and improving patient's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> health policy were indirect but effective ways. </p...|$|R
