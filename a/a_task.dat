Experiment 2 found that among participants who had been ego-depleted during <b>an</b> initial <b>task,</b> forming implementation intentions improved subsequent perfor-mance on <b>a</b> Stroop <b>task</b> to the level exhibited by non-depleted controls. Thus, implementation intentions help to enhance peoples ability to self-regulate their behavior...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Task {{demonstration}} is one effective {{technique for}} developing robot motion control policies. <b>As</b> <b>tasks</b> become more complex, however, demonstration can become more difficult. In this work we introduce {{a technique that}} uses corrective human feedback to build a policy able to perform <b>an</b> undemonstrated <b>task</b> from simpler policies learned from demonstration. Our algorithm first evaluates and corrects the execution of motion primitive policies learned from demonstration. The algorithm next corrects and enables the execution of <b>a</b> larger <b>task</b> built from these primitives. Within a simulated robot motion control domain, we validate that a policy for <b>an</b> undemonstrated <b>task</b> is successfully built from motion primitives learned from demonstration under our approach. We show feedback to both aid and enable policy development, improving policy performance in success, speed and efficiency. ...|$|R
