5|$|Foreseeing {{another war}} in Europe, Szilard {{moved to the}} United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of {{creating}} a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atomic bomb, but the Interim Committee chose to use them against cities without warning.|$|E

5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased {{in proportion to the}} size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was {{sufficiently}} impressed to persuade his brothers {{to agree to}} experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E

5|$|The Cook Islands compete {{as a part}} of netball's Oceania region. More than 1,000 {{players have}} {{registered}} to play the sport. Participation in the game grew during the 1970s. Much of this is possible because of the national governing organisation, the Cook Islands Netball Association which is a member of Oceania Netball Federation. Because of the level of organisation and the game's development, the country has participated at several international events including the Pacific Games, the Commonwealth Games, the World Games, the Oceania Netball Tournament, the World Youth Netball Championship, and the International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament. <b>A</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cook Islands success can be found by looking at the national team: It {{is one of the top}} ranked in the world.|$|E
5|$|The elder Sellers was {{convinced}} {{the machine was}} a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens to build a similar machine, using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it. Meanwhile, Redheffer's machine appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that the machine was genuine, and that Redheffer had discovered perpetual motion.|$|E
5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E

5|$|American {{officials}} {{decided to}} release the prisoners after a few weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because {{it was thought that}} <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion. Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite. Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming. When the prisoners traveled through Detroit on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged effigies of the Indians.|$|E
5|$|Columbus is a {{historic}} statue in Providence, Rhode Island, United States on Elmwood Avenue in Columbus Square. Columbus is a bronze cast of a sterling silver statue which was created by Rhode Island's Gorham Manufacturing Company for the 1892 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The original silver statue was not meant for permanent exhibition, but rather as <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skills of the Gorham Company, and was later melted down. The bronze cast was dedicated November 8, 1893 as {{a gift from the}} Elmwood Association to the City of Providence. It stands upon a granite base {{at the center of a}} grassy triangle at the intersection of Reservoir Avenue and Elmwood Avenue. The statue features Christopher Columbus, was created in 1893 by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 was {{presented}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1998, where developers showed off <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. In the months leading to the game's release, the game's publisher, Interplay Productions, ran a program that allowed Descent fans to submit a digital photo of themselves along with a pilot name to the company. These photos would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches. The winner was awarded a prize of US$50,000.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, Howe defied naval {{convention}} {{by ordering}} his fleet to turn towards the French {{and for each}} of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent. This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains, {{and as a result}} his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered; in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe's fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade {{for the remainder of the}} war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prowess and bravery of their respective navies.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced {{on a scale of one}} for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the Great White Fleet {{was ordered}} by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt {{to circle the}} world, as <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> might of the United States Navy. Kentucky was {{attached}} to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, and was commanded by Captain Walter C. Cowles, while the fleet as a whole was commanded by Rear Admiral Evans, Kentuckys former flag officer. On 16 December 1907, the fleet saluted the presidential yacht , and left from Hampton Roads. The fleet then sailed south, passing Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and going through the Straits of Magellan. From there she passed the west coast of South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet arrived at San Diego on 14 April 1908 and continued to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later it arrived at Honolulu, and from there sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving on 9 August. On 20 August, the fleet reached Sydney, Australia, and a week later sailed for Melbourne.|$|E
