5|$|A {{few days}} after his arrival in Buenos Aires in the United Provinces (formally named the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Republic</b> in 1826), San Martín was interviewed by the First Triumvirate. They {{appointed}} him a lieutenant colonel of cavalry, {{and asked him to}} create a cavalry unit, as Buenos Aires did not have good cavalry. He began to organize the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers with Alvear and Zapiola. As Buenos Aires lacked professional military leaders, San Martín was entrusted with the protection of the whole city, but kept focused in the task of building the military unit.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} four, Sarmiento {{was taught}} to read by {{his father and his}} uncle, José Eufrasio Quiroga Sarmiento, who later became Bishop of Cuyo.

He developed scholarly and oratorical skills, qualities which de Oro was famous for.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Battle of Caseros the San Nicolás Agreement was signed. It {{was meant to}} comply with the {{constitutional}} mandate of the Federal pact that presided over the Argentine Confederation, convening a Constitutional Assembly to meet in Santa Fe. This agreement was not accepted by the province of Buenos Aires, since it reduced its influence and power over the other provinces. Buenos Aires thereupon seceded from the confederation, thus Argentina got divided into two rival, independent states which fought to establish dominance. On the one side were the Federalists of the Argentine Confederation, led by Justo José de Urquiza. On the other, the Autonomists of Buenos Aires. The civil war was only brought to an end with the decisive victory of Buenos Aires over the Federation at the 1861 Battle of Pavón. The bonaerense liberal leader Bartolomé Mitre was elected the first President of a united <b>Argentine</b> <b>Republic</b> in 1862.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the most promising fiscal strategy to boost long-term economic growth in Argentina and quantify its effects. To this end, the authors updated a growth-diagnostics study for Argentina and corroborated that low appropriability of social returns and insufficient public infrastructure are key constraints to private investment. Further, low appropriability stands out among the key constraints to productivity-enhancing activities. Because low appropriability is largely rooted in macroeconomic volatility, {{the authors argue that}} a cycle-adjusted fiscal rule {{is one of the most}} promising fiscal reforms the country could implement to tackle this problem, and discuss the specific design features that such a rule could include. Then, the authors construct a model reflecting the stylized facts of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Republic's</b> fiscal federalism structure to assess the effect that a cycle-adjusted fiscal rule, in different variants, would have on the volatility of key macro variables. The authors find that the rule would meaningfully reduce macroeconomic volatility, thereby contributing to improved appropriability and long-term growth. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{codification}} in Argentina {{was part}} of a process being undertaken around the world, due to the advantages that such a systematic approach granted. Indeed, there had been earlier codifications; those completed {{toward the end of the}} 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century had a strong influence on the compilation of the Civil Code of Argentina. Stemming from these, there were separate attempts at civil codification in the <b>Argentine</b> <b>republic</b> during the first half of the 19th century, but it was finally achieved in 1869.|$|E
25|$|After the {{independence}} from Spain in 1816, {{the city and}} province of Buenos Aires {{became the focus of}} an intermittent Argentine Civil War with other provinces. A Federal Pact secured by Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1831 led to the establishment of the Argentine Confederation and to his gaining the sum of public power, which provided a tenuous unity. Ongoing disputes regarding the influence of Buenos Aires, between Federalists and Unitarians, and over the Port of Buenos Aires (the prime source of public revenue at the time) fueled periodic hostilities. The province was declared independent on September 11, 1852, as the State of Buenos Aires. Concessions gained in the 1859 Pact of San José de Flores and a victory at the Battle of Pavón led to its reincorporation into the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Republic</b> on December 17, 1861. Intermittent conflicts with the nation did not truly cease until 1880, when the city of Buenos Aires was formally federalized and, thus, administratively separated from the province.|$|E

500|$|In the book's final chapters, Sarmiento {{explores the}} {{consequences}} of Facundo's death for the history and politics of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Republic.</b> He further analyzes Rosas's government and personality, commenting on dictatorship, tyranny, the role of popular support, {{and the use of}} force to maintain order. Sarmiento criticizes Rosas by using the words of the dictator, making sarcastic remarks about Rosas's actions, and describing the [...] "terror" [...] established during the dictatorship, the contradictions of the government, and the situation in the provinces that were ruled by Facundo. Sarmiento writes, [...] "The red ribbon is a materialization of the terror that accompanies you everywhere, in the streets, in the bosom of the family; it must be thought about when dressing, when undressing, and ideas are always engraved upon us by association".|$|E
500|$|Facundo {{was first}} {{translated}} in 1868, by Mary Mann, {{with the title}} Life in the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Republic</b> in the Days of the Tyrants; or, Civilization and Barbarism. More recently, Kathleen Ross has undertaken a modern and complete translation, published in 2003 by the University of California Press. In Ross's [...] "Translator's Introduction," [...] she notes that Mann's 19th-century version of the text was influenced by Mann's friendship with Sarmiento and {{by the fact that}} he was at the time a candidate in the Argentine presidential election: [...] "Mann wished to further her friend's cause abroad by presenting Sarmiento as an admirer and emulator of United States political and cultural institutions". Hence this translation cut much of what made Sarmiento's work distinctively part of the Hispanic tradition. Ross continues: [...] "Mann's elimination of metaphor, the stylistic device perhaps most characteristic of Sarmiento's prose, is especially striking".|$|E
