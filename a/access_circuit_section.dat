40|$|Debugging {{electronic}} circuits is traditionally done with bench equipment {{directly connected to}} the circuit under debug. In the digital domain, the difficulties associated with the direct physical <b>access</b> to <b>circuit</b> nodes led to the inclusion of resources providing support to that activity, first at the printed circuit level, {{and then at the}} integrated circuit level. The experience acquired with those solutions led to the emergence of dedicated infrastructures for debugging cores at the system-on-chip level. However, all these developments had a small impact in the analog and mixed-signal domain, where debugging still depends, to a large extent, on direct physical <b>access</b> to <b>circuit</b> nodes. As a consequence, when analog and mixed-signal circuits are integrated as cores inside a system-on-chip, the difficulties associated with debugging increase, which cause the time-to-market and the prototype verification costs to also increase. The present work considers the IEEE 1149. 4 infrastructure as a means to support the debugging of mixed-signal <b>circuits,</b> namely to <b>access</b> the <b>circuit</b> nodes and also an embedded debug mechanism named mixed-signal condition detector, necessary for watch-/breakpoints and real-time analysis operations.
