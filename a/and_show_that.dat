25|$|Although a given {{root system}} {{has more than}} one {{possible}} set of simple roots, the Weyl group acts transitively on such choices. Consequently, the Dynkin diagram is independent of the choice of simple roots; it is determined by the root system itself. Conversely, given two root systems with the same Dynkin diagram, one can match up roots, starting with the roots in the base, <b>and</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the systems are in fact the same.|$|E

Wilder also drives an Australian Moke which he had a local engineering student convert to a hybrid, and an electric powered Tesla sports car.|$|E
25|$|The many anecdotes about Democritus, {{especially}} in Diogenes Laërtius, attest to his disinterest, modesty, and simplicity, <b>and</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> he lived exclusively for his studies. One story has him deliberately blinding himself {{in order to}} be less disturbed in his pursuits; it may well be true that he lost his sight in old age. He was cheerful, and was always ready to see the comical side of life, which later writers took to mean that he always laughed at the foolishness of people.|$|E
40|$|Contrary to a {{frequent}} contention, systems competition cannot work when governments respect the Subsidiarity Principle. The principle implies that governments step in where markets fail. Reintroducing markets {{through the back}} door of systems competition will again result in market failure. Three models are presented which illustrate this wisdom. The first is concerned with congestion-prone public goods <b>and</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> fiscal competition may be ruinous for the governments. The second considers the insurance function of redistributive taxation <b>and</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> systems competition may suffer from adverse selection. The third studies the role of quality regulation <b>and</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> systems competition may be a competition of laxity resulting in inefficiently low quality standards. ...|$|R
