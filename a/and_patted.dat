500|$|Tyutcheva was {{eventually}} fired. She took her story to {{other members of}} the family. While Rasputin's visits to the children were, by all accounts, completely innocent in nature, the family was scandalized. Tyutcheva told Nicholas's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, that Rasputin visited the girls, talked with them while they were getting ready for bed, and hugged <b>and</b> <b>patted</b> them. Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff. Xenia wrote on March 15, 1910 that she couldn't understand [...] "...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a khlyst!)" ...|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room <b>and</b> <b>patted</b> the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E

[...] / [...] "Yes, absolutely", answered the Grandpa, <b>and</b> <b>patted</b> the grandson's second head. (Often added: [...] "And they strolled off together, wagging their tails").|$|E

50|$|Matthews {{started to}} write poetry, {{juvenile}} books, a play, fantasy and mystery short stories, which she signed under different names: Patricia Ernst, P.A. Brisco <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> A. Brisco. Using the names Patty Brisco <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> Brisco, she wrote gothic novels.|$|R

2500|$|During {{this action}} McCarthy had killed 22 of the enemy, taken 50 prisoners and {{captured}} 3 machine-guns and 500 yards (460 m) of the German front. The battalion historian wrote that following McCarthy's feat, [...] "the prisoners {{closed in on}} him from all sides ... <b>and</b> <b>patted</b> him on the back!" [...] For this McCarthy was awarded the Victoria Cross that, within his battalion and in some quarters of the London press, {{came to be known}} as the [...] "super-VC".|$|E
2500|$|Later in the year, in November, {{she played}} the role of the Mona Lisa in the two-part episode [...] "Mona Lisa's Revenge" [...] in The Sarah Jane Adventures. In December, Jones starred in the Manchester Royal Exchange's {{production}} of Blithe Spirit, by Noël Coward, which ran until late January 2010. Jones was nominated for the Times Breakthrough Award at the 2010 South Bank Show Awards, the last ever ceremony, but lost to David Blandy. When discussing her nomination she said, [...] "You do question 'What am I breaking through?' Am I breaking through the perception of people who just thought I was a screaming banshee in Coronation Street? Is it that I've worked hard and I've got better? Is it that now it's alright to say that I'm alright? I don't know what I was breaking through, but I knew that it was nice to feel included <b>and</b> <b>patted</b> on the back for a lot of hard work". Jones was described by Andrew Billen of The Times as being in a category of [...] "those brave, talented few who earn their wings on a soap and then fly gloriously beyond it". In March 2010 Jones starred in Five Days, a non-connected sequel to the 2007 series of the same name, as the female lead DC Laurie Franklin. Later in the year, she starred as Sarah in Single Father on BBC1, a character who {{falls in love with a}} widower, Dave (David Tennant), who was married to her best friend before her death.|$|E
40|$|Quality {{by design}} (QbD) and process {{analytical}} technology (PAT) have become {{priorities for the}} Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Numerous recent initiatives within CDER and FDA have had the objective of encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to utilize QbD <b>and</b> <b>PAT</b> in their product development and manufacturing processes. Although sterile products may be a minority compared to non-sterile dosage forms (e. g., solid orals), their absolute requirement for sterility make design {{and control of the}} manufacturing processes extremely critical. This emphasis on the manufacturing process makes the sterile drug product an obvious target for QbD <b>and</b> <b>PAT.</b> Although the FDA encourages QbD submissions, the utilization of QbD <b>and</b> <b>PAT</b> for sterile products so far is still limited. This paper will examine the present state of QbD <b>and</b> <b>PAT</b> for sterile products and review some examples currently in use. Additional potential applications of QbD <b>and</b> <b>PAT</b> for sterile product development and manufacturing will also be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 in yeast are mRNA {{decapping}} activators/ translational repressors {{thought to}} play key {{roles in the}} transition of mRNAs from translation to degradation. However, {{little is known about}} the physical and functional relationships between these proteins and the translation machinery. We describe a previously unknown type of diauxic shiftdependent modulation of the intracellular locations of Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1. Like the formation of P bodies, this phenomenon changes the spatial relationship between components involved in translation and mRNA degradation. We report significant spatial separation of Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 from ribosomes in exponentially growing cells. Moreover, biochemical analyses reveal that these proteins are excluded from polysomal complexes in exponentially growing cells, indicating that they may not be associated with active states of the translation machinery. In contrast, under diauxic growth shift conditions, Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 are found to co-localize with polysomal complexes. This work suggests that Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 functions are modulated by a relocalization mechanism that involves eIF 4 A. Pulldown experiments reveal that the intracellular binding partners of Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 change as cells undergo the diauxic growth shift. This reveals a new dimension to the relationship between translation activity and interactions between mRNA, the translation machinery and decapping activator proteins...|$|R
