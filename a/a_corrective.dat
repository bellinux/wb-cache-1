5|$|Hubble {{accommodates}} five science instruments {{at a given}} time, {{plus the}} Fine Guidance Sensors, which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for science (astrometry). Early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during the Shuttle servicing missions. COSTAR was strictly <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> optics device rather than a true science instrument, but occupied {{one of the five}} instrument bays.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} would go on for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup {{continues to be a}} difficult issue for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union would go on to describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a liberation from fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following the spill, {{they found that the}} in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>corrective</b> power increases, even optimally {{designed}} lenses {{will have}} distortion {{that can be}} noticed by a user. This particularly affects individuals that use the off-axis areas of their lenses for visually demanding tasks. For individuals sensitive to lens errors, {{the best way to}} eliminate lens induced aberrations is to use contact lenses. Contacts eliminate all these aberrations since the lens then moves with the eye.|$|R
5|$|While many of {{the costs}} of fossil fuels are well known, others (pollution related health problems, {{environmental}} degradation, the impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources) are indirect and difficult to calculate. These are traditionally external to the pricing system, and are thus often referred to as externalities. <b>A</b> <b>corrective</b> pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax, could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy.|$|E
5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was bored by {{the manner in which}} they taught him Classics. Instead he developed a keen interest in Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came to be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E
5|$|The {{penalty is}} a fine not {{exceeding}} S$5,000 and, {{in the case of}} a second or subsequent conviction, a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both. In addition, where a person who is 16 years of age or above is convicted of an offence under section 17, and if the court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the protection of the environment and environmental public health that he should be required to perform unpaid work in relation to the cleaning of any premises, the Court shall, in lieu of or in addition to any other order, punishment or sentence and unless it has special reasons for not so doing, make <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> work order requiring him to perform such work under the supervision of a supervision officer.|$|E

25|$|Related {{areas of}} study also {{includes}} the disciplines of semiotics (the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols), literary criticism (the historical and ideological analysis of literature, cinema, art, or published material), translation (the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another), and speech-language pathology (<b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the cognitive level).|$|E
25|$|The first remake, debuting in 1990, was {{directed}} by special effects artist Tom Savini. It {{was based on the}} original screenplay, but included more gore and a revised plot that portrayed Barbra (Patricia Tallman) as a capable and active heroine. Tony Todd played the role of Ben. Film historian Barry Grant saw the new Barbra as <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> on the part of Romero. He suggests that the character was made stronger to rectify the depiction of female characters in the original film.|$|E
40|$|The {{emphasis}} on the equal and eternal responsibility of subjects of different gender and social positions in M. F. Roos's dialogue books promoted a special combination of radical equality in anthropology and a conservative understanding of society. A Pietist teaching on salvation permeates the Orthodox principles on vocation in such a way, that the vocation to community life as a Christian farmer, soldier, or housewife forms a synthesis of both theologies. The result is that in these dialogue books we encounter neither a biblical complement nor <b>a</b> Pietist <b>corrective,</b> but rather <b>a</b> Pietist complement and <b>a</b> biblicistic <b>corrective...</b>|$|R

25|$|Assad {{called his}} {{domestic}} reforms <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> movement, and it achieved some results. He tried to modernize Syria's agricultural and industrial sectors; {{one of his}} main achievements was {{the completion of the}} Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River in 1974. One of the world's largest dams, its reservoir was called Lake Assad. The reservoir increased irrigation of arable land, provided electricity, and encouraged industrial and technical development in Syria. Many peasants and workers received increased income, social security, and better health and educational services. The urban middle class, which had been hurt by the Jadid government's policy, had new economic opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Merleau-Ponty {{emphasized}} {{the body as}} the primary site of knowing the world, <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness {{as the source of}} knowledge, and maintained that the body and that which it perceived could not be disentangled from each other. The articulation of the primacy of embodiment led him away from phenomenology towards what he was to call “indirect ontology” or the ontology of “the flesh of the world” (la chair du monde), seen in his final and incomplete work, The Visible and Invisible, and his last published essay, “Eye and Mind”.|$|E
25|$|In Elliott's model, {{market prices}} {{alternate}} between an impulsive, or motive phase, and <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> phase on all time scales of trend, as the illustration shows. Impulses are always subdivided into {{a set of}} 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. In a bear market the dominant trend is downward, so the pattern is reversed—five waves down and three up. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.|$|E

40|$|In recent debates {{the neglect}} of the {{material}} dimension of religion and the foregrounding of beliefs in the modern academic study of religion {{has been attributed to}} a Protestant bias. <b>As</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>a</b> number of researchers have shifted their attention to the study of bodily performances, sensory experiences and sacred objects in religious traditions. In this article I will enquire how David Chidester’s analysis of the cultural, political and economic uses of ‘fetishes’ under 19 th century colonial conditions in southern Africa and in European centres of theory formation on the one hand, and under 20 th and 21 st century American imperial conditions on the other, may inform the comparative study of religions. Central to my argument will be that the realisation that religions are necessarily concretely mediated should not preclude the possibility of a systemic critique of power relations that are at work in the uses of objects in religions, the comparison of religions and the comparative study of religions. </span...|$|R

25|$|The leg can be {{lengthened}} or shortened during surgery. Unequal {{legs are}} the most common complaint by patients after surgery with over lengthening the most common problem. Sometimes the leg seems long immediately after surgery when in fact both are equal length. An arthritic hip can develop contractures that make the leg behave as if it is short. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. If the legs are truly equal, the sense of inequality resolves within a month or two of surgery. If the leg is unequal, it will not. A shoe lift for the short leg, or in extreme cases, <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> operation may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Insertional {{mutagenesis}} – If the DNA {{is integrated}} in a sensitive {{spot in the}} genome, for example in a tumor suppressor gene, the therapy could induce a tumor. This has occurred in clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) patients, in which hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> transgene using a retrovirus, and {{this led to the}} development of T cell leukemia in 3 of 20 patients. One possible solution is to add a functional tumor suppressor gene to the DNA to be integrated. This may be problematic since the longer the DNA is, the harder it is to integrate into cell genomes. CRISPR technology allows researchers to make much more precise genome changes at exact locations.|$|E
25|$|De Camp had {{the mind}} of an educator, and a common theme in many of his works is <b>a</b> <b>corrective</b> impulse {{regarding}} similar previous works by other authors. A highly rational and logical thinker, he was frequently disturbed by what he regarded as logical lapses and absurdities in others' writings. Some, like Asimov, felt de Camp's conscientiousness about facts limited the scope of his stories: de Camp was reluctant to use technological or scientific concepts (e.g., hyperspace or faster-than-light travel) {{if he did not}} think them possible. Thus, his response to Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court was to write a similar time travel novel (Lest Darkness Fall) in which the method of time travel was rationalized and the hero's technical expertise both set at a believable level and constrained by the technological limitations of the age.|$|E
