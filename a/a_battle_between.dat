5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a strong}} belief that the race would be <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Carrera Jeans–Vagabond {{teammates}} Visentini and Roche. El Mundo Deportivo stated that Visentini had the edge in the time trial discipline and sprinting, while Roche had the advantage in climbing mountains. However, unlike Visentini, Roche came into the race in great shape after winning the Tour de Romandie and placing second in the Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Critérium International. Cycling expert and author Bill McGann thought that the race would be disputed between Visentini and Gianbattista Baronchelli.|$|E

5|$|By {{the eighth}} game, the {{competition}} {{had become more}} than a battle for hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success in sport was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to allow students to watch the game on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5–3, and Soviet officials stated they would claim the overall victory if the game ended in a draw {{as a result of}} scoring more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied in the third period to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Briskin was {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} related to the control of MGM. As part of <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Joseph R. Vogel and Joseph Tomlinson, Briskin was brought in {{as a member of}} the Board of Directors of MGM, along with MGM's former production head, Louis B. Mayer, and also as a producer for the studio. However, the special board meeting which was held to appoint the two executives was held to be illegal by the Delaware Chancery Court, and the Mayer and Briskin appointments were overturned. The conflict continued on throughout the year, until MGM held a stockholders' meeting in October. During the meeting, the shareholders agreed to expand the board by adding ten new directors. Tomlinson's group was clearly routed, gaining only a single seat of the ten; that single seat was Briskin.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, Vígríðr or Óskópnir {{is a large}} field foretold to host <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> {{the forces}} of the gods and the forces of Surtr as part of the events of Ragnarök.
