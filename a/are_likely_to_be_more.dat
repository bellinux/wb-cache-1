5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E

25|$|The {{morphology}} and kinematics of lenticular galaxies each, to a degree, {{suggest a}} mode of galaxy formation. Their disk-like, possibly dusty, appearance suggests they come from faded spiral galaxies, whose arm features disappeared. Alternatively, as lenticular galaxies <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> luminous than spiral galaxies, which suggests {{that they are not}} merely the faded remnants of spiral galaxies. Rather, lenticular galaxies might result from galaxy merger, which increase the total stellar mass and give the newly merged galaxy its disk-like, arm-less appearance.|$|E
25|$|Allergic {{diseases}} are strongly familial: identical twins {{are likely to}} have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in non-identical twins. Allergic parents {{are more likely to have}} allergic children, and those children's allergies <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> severe than those in children of non-allergic parents. Some allergies, however, are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to ragweed. It seems that the likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system, but the specific allergen is not.|$|E
25|$|Dr. David C. Lane {{proposes a}} {{checklist}} consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical. One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have {{high standards of}} moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret {{the behavior of a}} spiritual teacher by following Ockham's razor and by using common sense, and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of infants who have survived following an incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [...] will eventually recover near-normal lung function, since lungs {{continue to grow}} during the first 5–7 years and {{the damage caused by}} bronchopulmonary dysplasia is to some extent reversible (even in adults).

500|$|There {{are three}} basic forms of {{contemporary}} street performance. The first form is the [...] "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually {{has a distinct}} beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with street theatre, puppeteering, magicians, comedians, acrobats, jugglers and sometimes musicians. This type {{has the potential to}} be the most lucrative for the performer because there <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the walk-by act, has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, café busking, is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses public transport as a venue.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} Census Bureau does not treat New England towns as [...] "incorporated places", it does {{classify}} cities in New England as such. [...] The rationale behind {{this is that}} cities <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> thoroughly built-up and therefore more readily comparable to cities in other states than towns are. Boroughs in Connecticut and incorporated villages in Vermont are also treated as incorporated places.|$|E

2500|$|It is also {{important}} for voters of a local agency to make Proposition 218 compliance a campaign issue in local governing body elections.

2500|$|Additionally, in {{some cases}} the abuser will {{purposely}} abuse the mother or father in front of the child to cause a ripple effect, hurting two victims simultaneously. Children may intervene when they witness severe violence against a parent, which can place a child at greater risk for injury or death. [...] It has been found that children who witness mother-assault are more likely to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Consequences to these children <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> severe if their assaulted mother develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and does not seek treatment due to her difficulty in assisting her child with processing his or her own experience of witnessing the domestic violence.|$|E
2500|$|Wireless power {{uses the}} same fields and waves as {{wireless}} communication devices like radio, another familiar technology that involves electrical energy transmitted without wires by electromagnetic fields, used in cellphones, radio and television broadcasting, and WiFi. [...] In radio communication the goal is the transmission of information, so the amount of power reaching the receiver is not so important, {{as long as it}} is sufficient that the information can be received intelligibly. [...] In wireless communication technologies only tiny amounts of power reach the receiver. [...] In contrast, with wireless power the amount of energy received is the important thing, so the efficiency (fraction of transmitted energy that is received) is the more significant parameter. [...] For this reason, wireless power technologies <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> limited by distance than wireless communication technologies.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reasons that}} CCS is {{expected}} to cause such power price increases are several. Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing [...] significantly raises the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition, there are added investment and capital costs. The process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with CCS by about 25% for a coal-fired plant, and about 15% for a gas-fired plant. The cost of this extra fuel, as well as storage and other system costs, are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30–60%, depending on the specific circumstances. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> expensive than mature CCS technology; the total additional costs of an early large-scale CCS demonstration project {{are estimated to be}} €0.5-1.1 billion per project over the project lifetime. Other applications are possible. In the belief that use of sequestered carbon could be harnessed to offset the cost of capture and storage, Walker Architects published the first [...] gas CAES application, proposing the use of sequestered [...] for Energy Storage on October 24, 2008. To date the feasibility of such potential offsets to the cost have not been examined.|$|E
2500|$|Companies {{that seek}} growth capital will often {{do so in}} order to finance a {{transformational}} event in their life cycle. [...] These companies <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> mature than venture capital funded companies, able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions, acquisitions or other investments. Because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth, so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion, sales and marketing initiatives, equipment purchases, and new product development. [...] The primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone. By selling part of the company to private equity, the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners. Capital {{can also be used to}} effect a restructuring of a company's balance sheet, particularly to reduce the amount of leverage (or debt) the company has on its balance sheet. [...] A Private investment in public equity, or PIPEs, refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company. [...] PIPE investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time. The Registered Direct, or RD, is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital. [...] A registered direct is similar to a PIPE but is instead sold as a registered security.|$|E
