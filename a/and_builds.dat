40|$|A Study of the Success of Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> Procurement Method for Building Projects in Sri Lanka Design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> {{procurement}} {{method is}} a delivery method {{in which the}} design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> contractor is contractually responsible for the design <b>and</b> <b>build.</b> According to Konchar and Sanvido (1998), the design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> procurement system has been shown {{as a method of}} efficient delivery and has gained its popularity abroad. However it does not receive the same popularity in the Sri Lankan construct industry because the traditional procurement method has been widely adopted in the Sri Lankan construction industry. This study first conducts a literature review to identify the factor that affects the selection of the design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> procurement method in general and then it gives an overview of the Sri Lankan Construction industry. In this research, the success of adopting Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> procurement method is investigated through analyzing the feedback of project stakeholders in the Construction industry in Sri Lanka by questionnaires. In this study, the surveyed parties include professional from consulting firms and construction firms (contractors) who has handle both private and public sector projects in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the popularity of the procurement method adopted in Sri Lanka is discussed the {{gain a better understanding of}} trends of the construction industry. The characteristics of different Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> procurement methods are also introduced and discussed. Apart from the above objective, this research also provides information for the stakeholders in the construction industry for reviewing and selecting an appropriate procurement method for the up-coming projects respectively.

40|$|Design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> is {{a popular}} form of {{procurement}} worldwide. In its conventional form, {{it is characterised by}} the integration between design and construction. Novation, a variant of design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> where design responsibility is transferred from designer to contractor as procurement evolves, has gained in popularity. However, the characteristics of the process, although well identified, continue to create confusion and problems for clients and contractors alike. This paper focuses on the dynamics of design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> novation from the principal contractor's and architect's perspectives. It embraces key aspects of both the pre-contract and post-contract environment. Its contribution forms a part of a major UK Government funded research project investigating design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> best practice. The findings presented in this paper broadly indicate that contractors believe novated design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> can be disadvantageous and that considerable fragmentation can be created in what should be an integrated procurement approach...|$|R

5|$|After {{they drive}} {{together}} and work naturally as a team, Speed begins {{to suspect that}} Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With {{the help of his}} family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The Racer family bands together <b>and</b> <b>builds</b> the new Mach 6 in 32 hours.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} movement, {{there is a}} brief fourteen-bar {{transitional}} passage in E minor for solo violin and strings only. This leads into the lively and effervescent finale, the whole of which is in E major and whose opening {{is marked by a}} trumpet fanfare. This movement is in sonata rondo form with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition leads into a brief second B major theme which is played by the soloist <b>and</b> <b>builds</b> to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in G major. The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a counter-melody in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of E Major. There is almost a small cadenza {{near the end of the}} movement when the woodwinds play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes {{in time with the}} music increases the player's score <b>and</b> <b>builds</b> up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score multiplier by one, up to a maximum of four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} if the various risk sources in Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> projects can be classified into three risk groups of cost, time and quality using the discriminant analysis technique. Literature search was undertaken to review issues of risk sources, classification of the identified risks into a risk structure, management of risks and effects of risks all on Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> projects as well as concepts of discriminant analysis as a statistical technique. This literature review was undertaken through the use of internet, published papers, journal articles and other published reports on risks in Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> projects. A research questionnaire was further designed to collect research information. This research study is a survey research that utilized cross-sectional design to capture the primary data. The data for the survey was collected in Nigeria. In all 40 questionnaires were sent to various respondents that included Architects, Engineers, Quantity Surveyors and Builders who had used Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> procurement method for their recently completed projects. Responses from these retrieved questionnaires that measured the impact of risks on Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> were analyzed using the discriminant analysis technique through the use of SPSS software package to build two discriminant models for classifying risks into cost, time and quality risk groups. Results of the study indicate that time overrun and poor quality are the two factors that discriminate between cost, time and quality related risk groups. These two discriminant functions explain the variation between the risk groups. All the discriminating variables of cost overrun, time overrun and poor quality demonstrate some relationships with the two discriminant functions. The two discriminant models built can classify risks in Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> projects into risk groups of cost, time and quality. These classifications models have 72 % success rate of classification of risks in Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> projects. These models are strongly recommended for use of clients, Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> contractors <b>and</b> Risk Managers for the management, control and mitigation of future risks in new Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> projects. These models will offer appreciable improvements in risk management and mitigations which can enhance better management of future Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> projects. This study also recommends that clients and contractors using Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> approach should watch out for emerging issues of cost overrun and poor quality in their projects as these can dictate classification of newly encountered risks...|$|R
40|$|Design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> {{procurement}} {{method is}} one of the procurement methods where the contractor is responsible to carry out both the design and construction work of the project. Design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> contract give convenience to the client by combining project cost, schedule, design and quality into one single point of responsibility. Even though, design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> contract give many benefits to contractor and client but there are contractors and clients who still feel less excited with the benefits offered. The number of projects procured under design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> method are also decreasing in recent years. Therefore, this research purpose is to identify the conflicts in design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> construction project <b>and</b> propose the solution to overcome the conflicts in design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> contract. A research questionnaire was designed and distributed to 92 grade 7 contractors in Pahang state. The data obtained from respondents were analyzed using mean value analysis. The result of the survey indicated that five mostly occurred conflicts in design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> projects are variation order, delay in work activities, client delay (lack of payment), client lack interaction with contractor and time overrun or project delay. By referring to the literature review, contract form (Standard Form of Design <b>and</b> <b>Build</b> Contract â€“ PWD Form DB (Rev. 1 / 2010), Standard Form of Contract Be Used Where Drawings and Specifications Form Part of the Contract â€“ PWD Form 203 (Rev. 1 / 2010) and Agreement and Conditions of PAM Contract 2006 with Quantities and interview with two experts from Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Pahang (PKNP) which are an engineer and an quantity surveyor, five solution flowcharts was proposed to overcome the five mostly occur conflicts in design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> projects. The result of this research will help the construction team, design team and client of design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> projects to systematically and effectively manage their conflicts and indirectly will help them in maintaining their good relationship. In the future study, it is proposed for the future researcher {{to increase the number of}} respondent by expanding the scope of study. When the scope of study is bigger, the researcher can know the various types of conflicts and propose a more accurate solution to overcome the conflict...|$|R
