During the triage phase of a potential adverse event report, {{it is important to}} determine if the [...] "four elements" [...] of a valid ICSR are present: (1) an identifiable patient, (2) <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> <b>reporter,</b> (3) a suspect drug, and (4) an adverse event.|$|E

5000|$|No {{release is}} {{required}} for publication, as news, of a photo taken of <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> person when the person is in a public place. In general, no release {{is required for}} publication of a photo taken of <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> person when the person is in a public space unless the use is for trade or direct commercial use, which is defined as promoting a product, service, or idea. [...] Publication of a photo of <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> person, even if taken when the person is in a public place, that implies endorsement, without a model release signed by that person, can result in civil liability for whoever publishes the photograph.|$|R

50|$|Data ‘obviously about’ an {{individual}} will include his medical history, criminal record, {{record of his}} work, or his achievements in a sporting activity. Data that is not ‘obviously about’ a particular individual may include information about his activities. Data such as personal bank statements or itemized telephone bills will be personal data about the individual operating the account or contracting for telephone services. Where data is not ‘obviously about’ <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> individual {{it may be helpful}} to consider whether the data is being processed, or could easily be processed, to learn, record or decide something about <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> individual. Information may be personal data where the aim, or an incidental consequence, of the processing, is that you learn or record something about <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> individual, or the processing could affect <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> individual. Data from a Tracker would be to identify the individual or his activities. It is therefore personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998.|$|R
40|$|The {{parameters}} of a linear compartment model are usually estimated from experimental input-output data. A problem arises when infinitely many parameter values can yield the same result; {{such a model}} is called unidentifiable. In this case, one can search for <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> reparametrization of the model: a map which reduces the number of parameters, such that the reduced model is <b>identifiable.</b> We study <b>a</b> specific class of models which {{are known to be}} unidentifiable. Using algebraic geometry and graph theory, we translate a criterion given by Meshkat and Sullivant for the existence of <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> scaling reparametrization to a new criterion based on the rank of a weighted adjacency matrix of a certain bipartite graph. This allows us to derive several new constructions to obtain graphs with <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> scaling reparametrization. Using these constructions, a large subclass of such graphs is obtained. Finally, we present a procedure of subdividing or deleting edges to ensure that a model has <b>an</b> <b>identifiable</b> scaling reparametrization...|$|R
