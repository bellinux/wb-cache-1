5|$|Bennett {{had been}} {{impressed}} in Leipzig {{with the concept}} of chamber music concerts, which had been, apart from string quartet recitals, <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> London. He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including piano trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven, works for piano solo, and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the piano virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and Frédéric Chopin's pupil, the 13-year old Carl Filtsch.|$|E

5|$|It bred on rocky, {{isolated}} islands {{with easy}} access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply, <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks. When not breeding, they spent their time foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|A gold dollar coin {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{several times in}} the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. Congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the California gold rush, and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the hoarded Flying Eagle cents re-entered circulation. Many {{remained}} there {{only a few}} years, being pulled out from among the new bronze cents in Treasury Department redemption programs in the 1860s and 1870s—thirteen million copper-nickel cents were retired by exchange for other base-metal coinage. By the 1880s, it was <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> circulation. The 2018 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1857, 1858 large letters, and 1858 small letters each at $30 in G-4 Good condition, the next to lowest collectable grade (AG-3). The 1856 is $6,500 in that grade, rising to $20,000 in uncirculated MS-63. The 1858/7 starts at $75 in G-4, rising to $11,000 in MS-63. An 1856 cent in MS-66 condition sold at auction in January 2004 for $172,500.|$|E

The men squad plays in First League, Israel's First tier league, and the women squad Maccabi Bnot Ashdod plays in top division.Ashdod plays host to many national and international sporting tournaments, including the annual Ashdod International Chess Festival. The city has a cricket team, <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> Israel. It is run and organized by citizens of Indian descent. Ashdod's beaches are a venue for water sports, like as windsurfing and Scuba diving. The Ashdod Marina offers yachting services.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, William de Valence {{began to}} build a much larger castle around the {{original}} keep from the 1280s onwards, demolishing Marshal's earlier work. As part of the extremely expensive construction work, Valence used oak trees drawn from several royal forests. Valence was building {{at the same time}} that his nephew Edward I was constructing his major castles in the north of Wales, and the concentric castle that he built at Goodrich is both very similar in design and <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> England itself. Valence's son, Aymer de Valence built an additional line of outer defences before his death in 1324, including the external barbican, inspired by that at the Tower of London, and for which the earlier Valence barbican at Pembroke may have been an experimental forerunner. The effect was an early success in converting a fortress into a major dwelling, without damaging its defensive arrangements, and influenced the later castle conversion at Berkeley.|$|E

50|$|Several {{years after}} its introduction, N. bicalcarata was still very much <b>a</b> horticultural <b>rarity.</b> <b>In</b> Veitch's {{catalogue}} for 1889, N. bicalcarata was priced at £3.3s per plant, while the famous giant-pitchered N. northiana and N. rajah were selling for £2.2s.|$|R
5|$|In September 1933, Bruce was {{appointed}} by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London was {{due in part to}} the free rein that Lyons gave him <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.|$|E
5|$|Secular {{portraiture}} was <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> European art before 1430. The format did {{not exist}} as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end {{of the market in}} betrothal portraits or royal family commissions. While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed. Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer; his seminal 1432 Léal Souvenir is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance. His Arnolfini Portrait is filled with symbolism, as is the Madonna of Chancelor Rolin, commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.|$|E
5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) {{are called}} {{to the scene of}} an {{accident}} where a pedestrian has been run over by a bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away.|$|E
50|$|After a long hiatus, the I.T.S. regrouped in 2002 to {{play some}} gigs and decided to remaster the {{original}} album, which had become <b>a</b> sought-after <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> the Motorpsycho catalogue. It was finally released in 2003 in its definitive form including all songs from the 1995 sessions.|$|R
50|$|Other {{facilities}} include seven stadiums, a Palace of Sports, a circus, a zoo {{botanical gardens}} and parks. Rostov-on-Don hosts the North Caucasian Science Center and research institutes.

50|$|This {{species can}} be found in most of Europe, {{northern}} Africa, and western Asia. It is <b>an</b> extreme <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> Britain, although it used to be widespread throughout England and Wales. Most of the specimens seen in Britain are thought to be captive-bred releases. These butterflies mainly inhabit woodland, especially with sallows (willows).|$|R
5000|$|Filer & Stowell {{produced}} {{a line of}} steam locomotives from the 1880s for the logging industry.

[...] "A large number" [...] were produced, mostly for customers in the southern and south-eastern United States.|$|R
25|$|The Mary Tyler Moore Show, {{originally}} known {{simply by}} the name of the show's star, Mary Tyler Moore, is an American sitcom created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns that aired on CBS from 1970 to 1977. Its central character is a never-married, independent career woman, <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> American television in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|This {{prompted}} significant {{interest in}} Lehrer's works and helped secure distributors for his {{material in the}} UK. It was there that his music achieved real popularity, {{as a result of}} the proliferation of university newspapers referring to the material, and the willingness of the BBC to play his songs on the radio (something that was <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> the United States). By the end of the 1950s, Lehrer had sold 370,000 records.|$|E
25|$|Tied matches are <b>a</b> <b>rarity</b> <b>in</b> cricket {{and there}} had been only two County Championship ties in the {{previous}} 21 years. Essex and Somerset had tied in 1926, then Worcestershire and Somerset in 1939. In 1947, there were two tied matches: Essex v Northamptonshire and Hampshire v Lancashire. Playfair noted that these were the 20th and 21st tied matches in the history of first-class cricket worldwide since the earliest known instance in 1783.|$|E
