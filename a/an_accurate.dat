5|$|British Open Championship Golf was {{the third}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was directed by Rex Bradford, designer of the early golf title Mean 18. The team sought to create <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> simulation of tournament golf play, which they felt was missing in the genre. To achieve this goal, they focused on recreating the atmosphere of a tournament, and included reactive crowds and announcers. The game was placed in competition with popular golf series such as Links and PGA Tour.|$|E
5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally construct <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> {{image of}} {{the environment in which}} they are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{efficient and}} accurate algorithms for simulating {{the rotation of}} a three-dimensional rigid object and compares them to several prior methods. The paper considers algorithms which exactly preserve angular momentum and either closely preserve or exactly conserve energy. First, we introduce <b>a</b> second-order <b>accurate</b> method that incorporates a third-order correction; then <b>a</b> third-order <b>accurate</b> method; and finally <b>a</b> fourth-order <b>accurate</b> method. These methods are single-step and the update operation is only a single rotation. The algorithms are derived in a general Lie group setting. Second, we introduce a near-optimal energy-correction method which allows exact conservation of energy. This algorithm is faster and easier to implement than implicit methods for exact energy-conservation. Our third-order method with energy conservation is experimentally seen to act better than <b>a</b> fourth-order <b>accurate</b> method. These new methods are superior to naive Runge-Kutt [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In general, {{diffusion}} damping produces {{its effects}} {{independent of the}} cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model-dependent phenomena. This means that without <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.|$|E
