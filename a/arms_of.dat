5|$|Due to {{the history}} of Canada, {{heraldry}} in the country has incorporated aboriginal and First Nations symbols and elements. The Coat of <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> Nunavut, for example, includes elements such as an inukshuk, a qulliq, and an igloo, all of which are references to the Inuit peoples who live in the area, while the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Canadian Heraldic Authority include ravens, a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation. In addition, some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield, a reference to a drumhead; an example is the coat of <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Nunavut.|$|E
5|$|English {{heraldry}} flourished as {{a working}} art up to around the 17th century, when it assumed a mainly ceremonial role. The Royal <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> England continued to embody information relating to English history. Although the Acts of Union 1707 placed England within the Kingdom of Great Britain, prompting new, British Royal Arms, the Royal <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> England are still used occasionally in an official capacity, and has continued to endure {{as one of the}} national symbols of England, and has a variety of active uses. For instance, the coats of <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> both The Football Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board have a design featuring three lions passant, based on the historic Royal <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> England. In 1997 (and again in 2002), the Royal Mint issued a British one pound (£1) coin featuring three lions passant to represent England. To celebrate St George's Day, in 2001, Royal Mail issued first– and second-class postage stamps with the Royal Crest of England (a crowned lion), and the Royal <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> England (three lions passant) respectively.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally in England, {{officers}} <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> are <b>of</b> three ranks: kings <b>of</b> <b>arms,</b> heralds <b>of</b> <b>arms,</b> and pursuivants <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> Officers <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> whose appointments are of {{a permanent}} nature are known as officers <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> in ordinary; those whose appointments {{are of a}} temporary or occasional nature are known as officers <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> extraordinary.|$|R

40|$|Extra {{chromosomal}} {{material on the}} long <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> chromosome 15 was found in an infant with growth retardation, dysmorphic features, skeletal abnormalities, and congenital heart defect.

Thus, the patient was partially trisomic for the short <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> chromosome 8 (p 12 leads to pter). Comparison of the clinical data obtained from patients with partial trisomy <b>of</b> the short <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> chromosome 8 with those of full trisomy 8 (Warkany's syndrome) suggests {{that most of the}} clinical features of Warkany's syndrome require excess material from both the short and long <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> chromosome 8...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Elizabeth I in 1603, the throne of England was {{inherited}} by the Scottish House of Stuart, resulting in the Union of the Crowns: the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under James VI and I.

Nevertheless, although referencing the personal union with Scotland and Ireland, the Royal <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> England remained distinct from the Royal <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> Scotland, until the two realms were joined in a political union in 1707, leading to a unified Royal coat of <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom.|$|E
