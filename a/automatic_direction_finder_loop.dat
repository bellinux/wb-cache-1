50|$|After an investigation, it was {{determined}} that the pilot ignored the prescribed instrument landing procedures. The pilot instead relied on visual reference, using the copilot's <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF).

50|$|The {{production}} UC-43 {{differed in}} minor details {{from the service}} test YC-43. Two distinguishing external features of the UC-43 are the circular <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> antennae mounted between the main landing gear and landing lights near the lower wingtips. They were all powered by the 450 horsepower (336 kilowatt) Pratt & Whitney R-985 engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{communication}} systems include VHF and UHF communications, voice-activated intercom and an IFF transponder. The flight systems include a VOR/ILS, linked VHF omnidirectional antenna radio ranger {{linked to the}} instrument landing system. Other navigation tools include distance measuring equipment (DME), an <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF), a Northrop Grumman inertial navigation system and a Trimble GPS system.|$|R

50|$|NDB {{navigation}} {{consists of}} two parts â€” the <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF) equipment on the aircraft that detects an NDB's signal, and the NDB transmitter. The ADF can also locate transmitters in the standard AM medium wave broadcast band (530 kHz to 1700 kHz at 10 kHz increments in the Americas, 531 kHz to 1602 kHz at 9 kHz increments {{in the rest of}} the world).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF) {{indicator}} instrument {{can be a}} fixed-card, movable card, or a Radio {{magnetic indicator}} (RMI). An RMI is remotely coupled to a gyrocompass so that it automatically rotates the azimuth card to represent aircraft heading. While simple ADF displays may have only one needle, a typical RMI has two, coupled to different ADF receivers, allowing for position fixing using one instrument.|$|R
50|$|On December 5, 1949 a plane he was {{piloting}} crash {{landed in}} Guangxi province. The plane was flying from Hong Kong to Kunming. Its <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> failed. Additional technical trouble caused a forced landing 180 {{miles west of}} Nanning. McGovern and the other passengers were captured by Chinese guerrilla fighters. On January 4, 1950 they reached Nanning and were told they were prisoners. He was later released in May 1950.|$|R
5000|$|When Prochnow {{arrived at}} the region where he {{believed}} Norfolk Island was, {{he was unable to}} see the island. He informed Auckland Air Traffic Control (AATC), but at this point there was no immediate danger. He continued searching; after locating more homing beacons from other islands, he realised his <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> had malfunctioned and he was now lost somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. He alerted AATC and declared an emergency.|$|R
50|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF) is {{a marine}} or {{aircraft}} radio-navigation instrument that automatically and continuously displays the relative bearing {{from the ship}} or aircraft to a suitable radio station. ADF receivers are normally tuned to aviation or marine NDBs operating in the LW band between 190 - 535 kHz. Like RDF units, most ADF receivers can also receive medium wave (AM) broadcast stations, though as mentioned, these are less reliable for navigational purposes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of 121.5 MHz beacons, the {{frequency}} is known in aviation as the [...] "VHF Guard" [...] emergency frequency, and all U.S. civilian pilots (private and commercial) are required, by FAA policy, to monitor this frequency when {{it is possible to}} do so. The frequency can be used by <b>Automatic</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> (ADF) radionavigation equipment, which is being phased out in favor of VOR and GPS but is still found on many aircraft.|$|R
500|$|A new KA1-1-01 Head-Up Display (HUD) {{was added}} providing, among other things, double {{the field of}} view of the {{original}} ASP-17BTs-8 electro-optical sight. Other systems and components incorporated during the upgrade include a Multi-Function Display (MFD), RSBN-85 Short Range Aid to Navigation (SHORAN), ARK-35-1 <b>Automatic</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> (ADF), A-737-01 GPS/GLONASS Receiver, Karat-B-25 Flight Data Recorder (FDR), Berkut-1 Video Recording System (VRS), Banker-2 UHF/VHF communication radio, SO-96 Transponder and a L150 [...] "Pastel" [...] Radar Warning Receiver (RWR).|$|R
25|$|U-546 {{was fixed}} with the FuMB-26 Tunis antenne. The FuMB 26 Tunis {{combined}} the FuMB Ant. 24 Fliege and FuMB Ant. 25 Cuba II antennas. It could be mounted {{in either the}} <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> Antenna <b>Loop</b> and separately on the bridge.|$|R
50|$|A great {{advance in}} the RDF {{technique}} {{was introduced in the}} form of phase comparisons of a signal as measured on two or more small antennas, or a single highly directional solenoid. These receivers were dramatically smaller, more accurate, and simpler to operate. Combined with the introduction of the transistor and integrated circuit, RDF systems were so reduced in size and complexity that they once again became quite common during the 1960s, and were known by the new name, <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder,</b> or ADF.|$|R
50|$|U-1308s <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> Antenna <b>Loop</b> {{was located}} on the {{starboard}} side of the bridge. It was used to detect and get bearings from the radio signals of Allied surface ships. U-1308 would have been outfitted with a late-war version which look slightly different from the earlier model.|$|R
50|$|On 21 December 1978, Cessna 188 pilot Jay Prochnow radioed in a Mayday call to {{air traffic}} control. Prochnow, {{previously}} a {{pilot in the}} United States Navy, had lost his bearings on a flight from Pago Pago to Norfolk Island when his <b>Automatic</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> (ADF) malfunctioned. At the same time, Gordon Vette was serving as captain of ANZ Flight 103 from Fiji to Auckland (with his flight engineer Gordon Brooks), making him the closest person to Prochnow that air traffic control could find. Vette agreed {{to help in the}} search for the lost Cessna.|$|R
50|$|During the {{helicopter}} missions (the first, third and fifth missions), {{the goal is}} to take off in {{the helicopter}}, program the ADF (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder)</b> to set the correct course, maneuver the helicopter to the landing area while hailing nearby planes to determine if they are friend or foe and engaging in firefights if the player responds incorrectly, and finally land the helicopter safely without detection through use of whisper mode. Their helicopter is equipped with missiles, guns, chaffs, flares, Radio Communications, a Status terminal, a Turbo engine and a whisper mode.|$|R

25|$|The {{replacement}} of ground-based BTDF {{systems in the}} aviation role was due primarily to two factors. One was the move to ever-shorter wavelengths, which so shortened the required antennae that RDF could be carried out on a small aircraft receiver a few centimetres in length. Rotating loops were practical at these frequencies, and most aircraft used one. The second advance was {{the introduction of the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF), which completely automated the RDF procedure. Once an ADF system was tuned to a station, either an airway beacon or an AM radio station, they continually moved a pointer to indicate the relative bearing with no further operator involvement.|$|R
50|$|In particular, {{the ability}} to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison RDF, which {{is perhaps the most}} widely used {{technique}} today. In this system the loop antenna is replaced with a single square-shaped ferrite core, with loops wound around two perpendicular sides. Signals from the loops are sent into a phase comparison circuit, whose output phase directly indicates the direction of the signal. By sending this to any manner of display, and locking the signal using PLL, the direction to the broadcaster can be continuously displayed. Operation consists solely of tuning in the station, and is so automatic that these systems are normally referred to as <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{success of}} King Radio {{began with the}} highly popular KY 90 VHF {{communications}} radio, known for its clarity and low cost. Over the years King Radio produced many hits such as the KDF 800 <b>Automatic</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> and the KX 155 Navigation/Communication radio. Many of these products can still be found on aircraft flying today.In 1970 King Radio released the KX 175 the first low cost all solid state VHF navigation and communications unit with TSO design approval, {{which was the first}} affordable general aviation digitally synthesized radio, which together with its derivatives, the KX170B and KX 175B, became {{what is known as the}} most reliable radio of its times, for use in general aviation.|$|R
50|$|The flight {{controls}} of the Valiant {{consisted of two}} channels of power control with full manual backup; flying in manual was allowed but limited, being intended to be used only {{in the event of}} complete electrical failure. The {{flight controls}} reportedly required considerable effort to manually operate. All three axis of the flight controls featured a dynamic artificial feel system, the pressure for which was provided via a ram-air inlet. A Smith Aerospace autopilot and instrument landing system (ILS) functionality was installed along with various navigational aids, such as the Marconi Company-built Green Satin doppler radar, Gee radio navigation, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> (ADF), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), and radar altimeters. Provisions for additional equipment and sensors, such as side looking airborne radar, were also made.|$|R
5000|$|Basic GPS service {{failed to}} meet the accuracy, availability, and {{integrity}} (the ability of a system to provide timely warnings to users or to shut itself down when it should not be used for navigation) requirements critical to safety of flight. The bottom line for assessing a navigation system is its [...] "availability". A system that fails to meet prescribed standards for accuracy, integrity, or other specifications is not truly available for use, although even the raw GPS signal in Alaska was better than the FAA's legacy systems. The traditional VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF) ground-based en-route system has an availability rate of 98.5%. The GPS signal had an availability of about 99.9% and was available over a much wider area.|$|R
5000|$|RDF {{systems can}} be used with any radio source, {{although}} the size of the receiver antennas are a function of the wavelength of the signal; very long wavelengths (low frequencies) require very large antennas, and are generally used only on ground-based systems. These wavelengths are nevertheless very useful for marine navigation as they can travel very long distances and [...] "over the horizon", which is valuable for ships when the line-of-sight may be only a few tens of kilometres. For aerial use, where the horizon may extend to hundreds of kilometres, higher frequencies can be used, allowing the use of much smaller antennas. An <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder,</b> often capable of being tuned to commercial AM radio transmitters, is a feature of almost all modern aircraft.|$|R
