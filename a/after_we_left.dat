25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying there alone, separated from the Armenians. He declared that we were powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his arms about him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was only}} from 9 January 1970, when the Supreme Court of Judicature Act came into force, that Singapore {{established}} its own Supreme Court, {{consisting of a}} Court of Appeal, Court of Criminal Appeal and High Court. In moving the Second Reading of the Bill in Parliament, the then Minister for Law and National Development, Mr. E.W. Barker, noted that [...] "the Supreme Court of Judicature Bill ... as its very name suggests, provides a proper basis for the administration of justice in our courts which should really have been introduced soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Malaysia. Unfortunately, the many and varied problems which we {{had to deal with}} upon leaving Malaysia had forced us to continue with the existing system of administration of justice until the present day. All that the Bill purports to do is to set out logically the consequences that flow from our becoming independent on our own with an independent system of administration of justice separate from the system that was introduced to us while we were part of Malaysia ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{reminds me}} of a circumstance. Just <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Julesburg, on the Platte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If that isn't like you!" [...] he ejaculated. [...] "Your {{very first}} words <b>after</b> <b>we</b> are <b>left</b> alone! It brings back the East, Carley." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} I did, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> were <b>left</b> {{together}} alone, {{was to make}} a third attempt to get up from my seat on the sand. Mr. Franklin stopped me.|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> a while <b>we</b> <b>left,</b> {{promising}} to go again, {{and to see}} after the safety of Sam.|$|R
6000|$|... "Were you praying with us, Slidder?" [...] I asked, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Mrs Willis, {{and were}} {{walking up the}} alley, {{followed}} by Dumps.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were married}} {{within a week}} <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> you, and Master Cap {{departed}} next day. You have forgotten to inquire about your friend Saltwater." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Garvin {{was alone}} last night. He {{had gone out}} shortly <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left,</b> and had not waited for the doctor. She was greatly worried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a learned}} man," [...] Ram Singh remarked, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> him behind, [...] "but, like many another, he is {{intolerant}} towards opinions which differ from his own. He will know better some day." ...|$|R
60|$|Once {{only did}} my cousin address me, {{and that was}} soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the town behind us. He motioned the men away, and rode to my side. Then {{he looked at me}} with mocking, hating eyes.|$|R
60|$|They telegraphed {{the moment}} they reached Fernandina, and {{proposed}} stopping at St. Augustine, but it was thought they could make better time by keeping right on to Fernandina. The telegram reached Savannah <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> on the tug.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we had Hackenhaven with us. But he fell {{overboard}} just <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the wreck, and {{the sharks}} caught him," [...] answered Gibson, with a bitter {{shake of his}} face.|$|E
6000|$|... [1] This {{complaint}} {{was not in}} one respect justified by what followed, for <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Spearman's we only saw our tents {{for a day or}} two, and at rare intervals, until Ladysmith was relieved.|$|E
6000|$|... "True for you, lad; but General Herkimer was {{to begin}} an advance on the mornin' <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> camp, {{and he should be}} nearabout. To run upon his {{sentinels}} in the darkness might not be agreeable." ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, {{the thought}} of being with Miss Burroughs and the {{anticipation}} of a sleigh-ride alone with her <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> Uncle Beamish with his sister, had put me into such a glow that I scarcely knew it was cold weather.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} will go to sea again, as soon as your ship can be got ready, cousin Miles," [...] he commenced, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> were <b>left</b> with the fruit and wine. [...] "These are {{stirring}} times in commerce, and the idle man misses golden opportunities." ...|$|R
50|$|The station {{signed on}} with former Jacksonville and Denver radio {{personality}} Greg Tanner in afternoons. Following his exit, former KISS night jock and current morning host Wes McKane held down PM drive. <b>After</b> <b>Wes</b> <b>left</b> to do nights at KDWB in the Twin Cities, Mat Mitchell, formerly nights at Mix 93.3 in Kansas City, held down afternoons. When Mat left to do mornings at Channel 963 in Wichita, then night host Van McNeal did afternoons. Van later left {{to do the same}} shift on sister station WMYX, which opened the door for Kraig Karson, the station's first night host, to do afternoons. Kraig currently hosts afternoons from 2-7pm each weekday.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir," [...] {{answered}} Jack, [...] "all {{that might}} have happened had she been above water, or any part of her above water; but you'll remember, maty, that soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> her she went down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} had better find out first what the {{officers}} did <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left,</b> and a few hours can't make much difference, for I'll get rid of plenty of the queer to keep us going before we've been out a day." ...|$|E
6000|$|One day, {{some weeks}} <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Scrymgeour's house-boat, I {{was alone in}} my rooms, very busy smoking, when William John entered with a telegram. It was from Scrymgeour, and said, [...] "You have got me into a dreadful mess. Come down here first train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you going}} to do?" [...] Sir John asked the slaves, when they were within {{a quarter of a mile}} of the islet. [...] "I should think, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> have <b>left</b> the boat, it will be best for you to sit quietly on your benches till our pursuers arrive." ...|$|R
6000|$|I saw her smile, and asked, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the asylum, {{what he had}} said. Jack had stated {{his opinion}} of the {{principal}} officer of Bethlehem Hospital in these words: [...] "Don't you listen to him, Mistress; he's a poor half-witted creature. And short, too--not above six inches taller than I am!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the {{sanctuary}} I asked Harût when this figure {{was brought to}} their land. He replied that it came when they came, at what date he could not tell us as it was so long ago, and that with it came the worship and the ceremonies of their religion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} so {{strongly}} impressed with this feeling at times that it makes me quite superstitious. When we had that terrible storm <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Callao, I thought it meant that--that we were all going down, and we should never be heard of again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{plenty of}} room. We {{shall have to}} put several ashore at the Cape, where I hope to get a doctor, too, for our doctor died soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> port, and we are much in want of one, having a good many sick men on board." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And this miserable misguided {{creature}} {{who has been}} your companion. The last we saw of these two men, Hugh, they were quarrelling in the highway, like cat and dog, and there are signs about their faces that the interview became still more hostile than it had been, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> them." ...|$|E
60|$|It rained on the {{following}} morning; <b>after</b> which <b>we</b> <b>left</b> for the exit of the Teesta, proceeding northwards, sometimes through a dense forest of Sal timber, sometimes dipping into marshy depressions, or riding through grassy savannahs, breast-high. The coolness of the atmosphere was delicious, {{and the beauty of}} the jungle seemed to increase the further we penetrated these primaeval forests.|$|R
50|$|During {{their first}} break-up, {{frontman}} Steve Ewing has made several solo records {{under the name}} Stevie E. and is currently assisting several growing local St. Louis rock bands including Zamudio, The Dead End, and Lojic. Guitarist Jerry Jost was almost chosen as the replacement guitarist for Limp Bizkit <b>after</b> <b>Wes</b> Borland <b>left</b> the band in 2002. The other members still reside in St. Louis and are involved in several musical projects.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very sorry," [...] said Annie, [...] "but that is {{not easy}} to do. But don't let us think {{anything}} more about that. And, don't you feel very glad that the poor old creature, who looked so happy as she sat singing and clapping her hands on her knees, didn't die until <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the church? If it had happened while we were there, I don't believe--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From Clawbonny--but from Grace," [...] he answered, with {{a slight}} change of colour. [...] "I desired the poor girl {{to let me know}} how things passed off, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> them; and as for Lucy, her pot-hooks are so much out of the way, I never want to see them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Chapeau. [...] "When {{the moment}} for {{starting}} came, he insisted on being carried with the army; he followed us in a carriage, but the jolting of the road {{was too much for}} him--the journey killed him. He died at Fougères, on the third day <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Laval." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father {{had gone}} to Toledo on business, and very foolishly I took his dare. Everything went all right until <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> The Inn, {{although}} one of the men--his companion referred to him once or twice as The Oskaloosa Kid--attempted to be too familiar with me. Mr. Paynter prevented him on each occasion, and they had words over me; but <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the inn, where they had all drunk a great deal, this man renewed his attentions and Mr. Paynter struck him. Both of them were drunk. After that it all happened so quickly that I could scarcely follow it. The man called Oskaloosa Kid drew a revolver but did not fire, instead he seized Mr. Paynter by the coat and whirled him around and then he struck him an awful blow behind the ear with {{the butt of the}} weapon.|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] Sir John Boswell said, [...] "I have {{no doubt}} they have all surrendered. I before thought it {{probable}} that {{a good many of}} them would have remained hidden, trusting {{to be able to make}} a raft <b>after</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left,</b> and so get away, believing rightly enough that we should be disinclined to search every foot of the island for them. As it is, I doubt not, all are here." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were very}} few passengers. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the harbor, my {{attention}} was attracted by a young English lady--traveling, apparently, with her mother. As we passed her on the deck she looked at Romayne with compassionate interest so vividly expressed in her beautiful face that I imagined they might be acquainted. With some difficulty, I prevailed sufficiently over the torpor that possessed him to induce him {{to look at our}} fellow passenger.|$|R
6000|$|I led {{her out of}} {{the court}} into the air. As I passed the [...] "bar," [...] I saw Ambrose, deadly pale, looking <b>after</b> us as <b>we</b> <b>left</b> him: the magistrate's {{decision}} had evidently daunted him. His brother Silas had dropped in abject terror on the jailer's chair; the miserable wretch shook and shuddered dumbly, like a cowed dog.|$|R
