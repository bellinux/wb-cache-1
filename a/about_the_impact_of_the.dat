25|$|In November 1996, Oregon voters passed Ballot Measure 47, which lowered {{property}} tax rates and imposed restrictions on raising those rates. Due {{to the passage}} of the measure, the city delayed the project because of concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measure on funding for building and maintaining the park. The estimated cost to build Town Center Park at that time was $3.3 million. Plans for building the park later moved forward, and construction of the regional visitor’s center began in June 1998. The building opened at Town Center Park in April 1999 at a cost of $1.5 million.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, British Defence Minister Philip Hammond {{visited the}} United States to seek {{clarification}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new American military strategy {{on the availability}} of the F-35 for Britain's new carriers. In May 2012, Hammond announced that the UK coalition government had reverted to the previous government's plan to operate the F-35B STOVL variant, due to rising estimated shipbuilding costs associated with the F-35C, and an earlier estimated in-service date for the F-35B. In July 2012, Hammond stated that an initial 48 F-35Bs would be purchased to equip the carrier fleet, but a final figure of F-35 purchases would not be decided until the Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2015 — it was also suggested that the UK may later purchase F-35A variants to replace the country's Eurofighter Typhoon fleet.|$|E

25|$|Born in Watkins, Minnesota, McCarthy {{became an}} {{economics}} professor after earning a graduate degree from the University of Minnesota. He served as a codebreaker for the United States Department of War during World War II. McCarthy {{became a member of}} the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (the state affiliate of the Democratic Party) and won election the House of Representatives in 1948. He served until winning election to the Senate in 1958. McCarthy was a prominent supporter of Adlai Stevenson II in the 1960 presidential election and was himself a candidate for the Democratic vice presidential nomination in 1964.

25|$|According to the X-Chromosome SNP analyses, {{the authors}} {{reported}} a high genetic homogeneity between berbers and Arabs in NW Africa, so {{they suggested that}} the Arabisation of this area was a cultural phenomenon, which did not imply a replacement of the ancestry population. Our results give support the hypothesis of an early settlement of northwest Africa. The original berber population seem to have received a low genetic influx from the surrounding areas. Different hypothesis have been suggested to explain the genetic differentiation of the Moroccan population. An initial genetic drift could have caused differences in allele frequency distribution {{that have not been}} re-established due to a certain level of geographic isolation. The Strait of Gibraltar has been described by several authors as an important genetic barrier. Even a certain level of genetic exchange probably occurred between NW Africa and the South of the Iberian Peninsula, sharp frequency changes have been described in this area. Also the Sahara desert has been suggested as responsible of the genetic isolation of NW African populations from Sub-Saharan populations. There is no consensus <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Neolithic demic diffusion in the Mediterranean area. According to our results, a low impact of the Neolithic expansions and/or later migration events on NW African populations would have occurred.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the {{university}} made proposals to significantly develop Didsbury, bringing the School of Health, Psychology and Social Care and the Institute of Education onto the Didsbury site, after {{the closure of}} the Elizabeth Gaskell campus. Plans involved the creation of £19 million multi-storey teaching blocks and upgraded buildings, and improved access to facilities such as the library and sports centre. The plans were criticised by local residents, whose main concern was parking, since the plans could lead to 1900 new students on site and 240 new staff. By 2008, plans had changed and it was decided to close the Didsbury campus and move the 2740 students to a new facility in Hulme, later named Birley Fields. This new campus, close to the All Saints campus in the city centre, was designed to replace all of {{the university}}'s other Manchester campuses, with funds arising from the land that was sold off. Reactions to the announced closure were mixed; local traders and businesses were worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss of students, but many residents supported the move, especially those who had opposed expansion. The Didsbury campus finally closed in August 2014, and the new £140 million Birley Fields campus opened on 2 October 2014, after two years of construction. In total, the university spent £350 million on investing in new facilities at Birley Fields, as well as the All Saints and Cheshire campuses.|$|E

Evidence from Japan and South America indicates [...] bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments, causing damage to native pollinators. Greater use of native pollinators, such as Bombus ignitus in China and Japan, has occurred as a result. In addition, mounting evidence indicates mass-produced bumblebees may also carry diseases, harmful to wild bumblebees and honeybees.|$|E
500|$|It {{was only}} {{as late as}} December 1917 that a War Cabinet Committee on Manpower was established, and the British {{government}} refrained from introducing compulsory labour direction (though 388 men were moved {{as part of the}} voluntary National Service Scheme). Belgian refugees became workers, though they were often seen as [...] "job stealers". Likewise, the use of Irish workers, because they were exempt from conscription, was another source of resentment.

500|$|A superfiring layout was {{eventually}} adopted as standard. This involved raising {{one or two}} turrets so they could fire over a turret immediately forward or astern of them. The US Navy adopted this feature with their first dreadnoughts in 1906, but others were slower to do so. As with other layouts there were drawbacks. Initially, there were concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blast of the raised guns on the lower turret. Raised turrets raised the centre of gravity of the ship, and might reduce {{the stability of the}} ship. Nevertheless, this layout made the best of the firepower available from a fixed number of guns, and {{was eventually}} adopted generally. The US Navy used superfiring on the , and the layout was adopted in the Royal Navy with the [...] of 1910. By World War II, superfiring was entirely standard.|$|E
500|$|The British viewed Trenton and Princeton as minor American victories, {{but with}} these victories, the Americans {{believed}} that they could win the war. American historians often consider the Battle of Princeton a great victory, on par with the battle of Trenton, due to the subsequent loss of control of most of New Jersey by the Crown forces. Some other historians, such as Edward Lengel consider it {{to be even more}} impressive than Trenton. A century later, British historian Sir George Otto Trevelyan would write in a study of the American Revolution, when talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victories at Trenton and Princeton, that [...] "It may be doubted whether so small a number of men ever employed so short a space of time with greater and more lasting effects upon the history of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Court {{published}} its decision, analysts {{offered a}} range of opinions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court's ruling. An academic co-author of an amicus brief on behalf of Bowman filed by the American Antitrust Institute expressed relief that the loss was on a narrow basis rather than providing a broad affirmation {{of the lack of}} patent exhaustion for self-replicating technologies. Kevin Rodkey argued that an analysis under Quanta Computer leads to the conclusion that patent rights covering self-replicating seeds are exhausted on the first authorized sale, including subsequent generations, and that seed companies can only exclude subsequent replantings with carefully written license restrictions. Ronald Mann writing in SCOTUSblog noted: [...] "The tenor of the Court came through most clearly when the Court ridiculed what it called Bowman’s 'blame-the-bean defense' – the argument that Bowman did not make new seeds, because it was the seeds themselves that replicated." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the IWST launches, there were Combat Training Launches (CTLs). IWST launches were part of training, and launch crews were permitted technical holds in the countdown {{so they could be}} fully trained in launch procedures. A CTL was for an already trained crew, and was to demonstrate their proficiency [...] The first launch was viewed by the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Mountbatten and Lady Mountbatten. The first three CTLs, like the IWST launches, used Douglas missiles taken off the assembly line; but there were concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British weather on the missiles. Henceforth, a missile would be randomly chosen, and the missile and its crew flown to Vandenberg for testing. Twelve CTLs were carried out between 6 October 1959 and 18 June 1962; a planned CTL on 8 October 1962 was cancelled {{in the wake of the}} decision to withdraw the Thor missiles from service.|$|E
500|$|District {{residents}} {{protested the}} route cuts with a picket line {{in front of}} WMATA's downtown headquarters in August 1991. Prince George's County residents were also angered by the bus route changes, arguing that Metro had promised more (not less) bus service and complaining {{that they would be}} forced to use a rail station located in the District of Columbia's most violent and crime-prone neighborhood. More than 1,000 people packed [...] "raucous" [...] public hearings for three nights in the District and Prince George's County in early September, denouncing Metro and claiming they were [...] "becoming a victim of transportational apartheid." [...] Worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cuts as well as a possible bus boycott, D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon announced on September 11, 1991, that she would seek an alternative to the changes proposed by WMATA. Suburban commuters were angry that Metro would keep the bus routes open in Anacostia (at an estimated cost of $4 million) when their bus service had been cut at the time Metrorail stations opened in their areas; D.C. residents countered that poor African American District citizens could ill afford the same transit changes and fare increases that wealthy, white suburbanites were asked to absorb.|$|E
500|$|After {{providing}} {{teams with}} the ultrasoft compound for the Monaco and Canadian Grands Prix, tyre supplier Pirelli made the supersoft, soft and medium compounds {{available for the}} race despite the ultrasoft compound being specifically designed for street circuits. Pirelli explained {{the decision not to}} provide the ultrasoft tyres as being a result of a lack of available performance data on the circuit, while most teams opted for a full complement of soft and supersoft tyres and taking only the minimum number of medium compound tyres dictated by the rules. In preparing for the race, Pirelli acknowledged concerns about the circuit's high speed straights and direction changes causing [...] "standing waves" [...] over longer runs, a phenomenon whereby the energy passing through the wheel is strong enough to shift the build of the tyre, compromising its rigidity and increasing the likelihood of tyre failures. Further concerns were raised <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporary surface used to protect the cobblestones through the Old City section on the tyres, amid fears that predicted high temperatures throughout the weekend would cause this surface to break up. Following the first free practice session, {{it was found that the}} metal bolts used to anchor segments of kerbing to the roadway had started working loose and had been cutting into the rubber of the tyres, necessitating minor modifications to the circuit in order to correct the issue.|$|E

500|$|Raj Lyubov is the {{anthropologist}} in the colony, a scholar {{who holds the}} honorary rank of [...] "captain". He is depicted as being from an Indian heritage. Selver is initially a servant in the central camp; Lyubov enlists him as an assistant, and builds a relationship of trust with him. The two of them compile a dictionary of the Athshean and Terran languages. When Selver's wife Thele is raped and killed by Davidson, Selver attacks Davidson, who nearly kills him; Lyubov rescues Selver, and nurses him back to health. During {{the attack on the}} colony's headquarters, Selver tells the Athsheans to leave Lyubov's house alone, but Lyubov leaves his house and is killed by a collapsing building. As he dies, Lyubov warns Selver <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> killings on the Athshean society. In comparison to Davidson, Lyubov reflects a lot upon his actions, and tries to analyze them in a detached manner. His contradictory position of being a colonial officer despite recognizing the damage that the colony is doing to the Athsheans gives him migraines. He feels a strong sense of guilt at the impacts of the colony, and is willing to destroy his own reputation {{in order to protect the}} Athshean people. He is one of the only Terrans to treat the Athsheans as human beings, although this loses him the respect of his fellow Terrans.|$|E
