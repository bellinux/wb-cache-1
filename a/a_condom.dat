5|$|A prostitute is {{available}} {{as soon as}} the game starts. Should Larry have unprotected intercourse with her, he will contract a sexually-transmitted disease and die shortly thereafter. This fate may be avoided by buying <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> at the convenience store.

5|$|In 1967 activist Bill Baird {{was arrested}} for distributing a {{contraceptive}} foam and <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> to a student during a lecture on birth control and abortion at Boston University. Baird's appeal of his conviction resulted in the United States Supreme Court case Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972), which extended the Griswold holding to unmarried couples, and thereby legalized birth control for all Americans.|$|E

50|$|Different {{modes of}} condom failure result in {{different}} levels of semen exposure. If a failure occurs during application, the damaged condom may be disposed of and <b>a</b> new <b>condom</b> applied before intercourse begins - such failures generally pose no risk to the user. One study found that semen exposure from <b>a</b> broken <b>condom</b> was about half that of unprotected intercourse; semen exposure from <b>a</b> slipped <b>condom</b> was about one-fifth that of unprotected intercourse.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} in their early teens. One of these girls was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle {{a place to sleep}} at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they taught her how to put <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' booking agent, Allan Williams, {{decided to}} send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed, Derry and the Seniors, proved {{successful}} there. Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best {{a few days before}} their departure. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson (after McCartney or Best had set fire to <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> in their living quarters as a light source to gather their possessions as their host had cut off power to their room).|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increased}} use of condoms, contact dermatitis to rubber is being seen more often. To develop <b>a</b> rubber <b>condom</b> suitable for use by rubber sensitive people, <b>a</b> "hypoallergenic" <b>condom,</b> which is washed in ammonia to reduce the residues of rubber accelerators, has been manufactured. Fifty patients allergic to various rubber accelerators were patch tested with <b>an</b> ordinary <b>condom</b> and the new washed condom. Fifty patients undergoing routine patch test investigation who were not allergic to rubber were also tested as controls. Twenty two of the rubber sensitive patients had a positive reaction to the new rubber condom compared with four of the control patients. Washing rubber condoms in ammonia does not appear to reduce the residues of rubber accelerators sufficiently for their use by rubber sensitive people. <b>A</b> non-allergenic <b>condom</b> is required...|$|R
50|$|The condom {{challenges}} are two viral Internet challenges.

50|$|Male <b>condoms</b> have <b>a</b> {{tight ring}} {{to form a}} seal around the penis while female <b>condoms</b> {{typically}} have <b>a</b> large stiff ring {{to keep them from}} slipping into the body orifice.

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van der Sloot gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have <b>a</b> <b>condom.</b> Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home. Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E
5|$|Koschmider had {{converted}} {{a couple}} of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing the Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.|$|E

25|$|The most {{effective}} way to prevent sexual transmission of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: cybersex, phonesex or masturbation from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk. Although <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with <b>a</b> <b>condom.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use <b>a</b> <b>condom.</b> Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E

25|$|While penetrative rape {{generally}} {{does not}} involve the use of <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> in some cases <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> is used. This significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and disease transmission, both to the victim and to the rapist. Rationales for condom use include: avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV), especially in cases of rape of sex workers or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists); eliminating evidence, making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability); giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape); and thrill from planning {{and the use of}} the condom as an added prop. Concern for the victim is generally not considered a factor.|$|E
25|$|However, those {{involved}} in prostitution who are HIV positive and who seek to diminish the risk of contagion {{by the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> may be taking the first step in respecting the life of another even if the evil of prostitution remains in all its gravity.|$|E

25|$|Anal {{intercourse}} {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for vaginal intercourse during menstruation. The likelihood of pregnancy occurring during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening.

40|$|Efficiency {{in obtaining}} {{biological}} evidence is paramount in the forensic investigation of sexual assaults. The {{objective of this}} study was to quantitatively compare the cellular yield between cotton swabs and nylon flocked swabs in post-coital samples. Swabs were used to sample dilutions of neat semen; flocked swabs yielded more spermatozoa than cotton swabs. 7 couples donated post-coital swabs: oral, dried secretions; inside/outside of <b>a</b> used <b>condom.</b> Swabs were collected at 1 -hour and 24 -hour post-coital intervals. Flocked swabs from oral samples and samples from inside <b>a</b> used <b>condom</b> yielded more spermatozoa than cotton swabs. Cotton swabs from dried secretions samples and samples from outside <b>a</b> used <b>condom</b> yielded more nucleated epithelial cells than flocked swabs. Possible explanations are the capillary action and liquid dynamics that occur when swabs absorb a sample; the fibrous matrix of cotton swabs protects epithelial cells, and the spiral arrangement of flocked swabs release spermatozoa efficiently...|$|R
