40|$|The {{importance}} of relationship management in business-to-business service provision contexts has been acknowledged for several years. This paper examines clients' expectations of their advertising agencies {{with regards to}} agency creativity, and also aspects of long-term business relationships. A qualitative study was undertaken with 15 clients of advertising agencies. The way clients define agency creative varies from creativity of the message to creativity of the media used to deliver the message. Clients who valued the relationship with their agencies alluded to partnerships, alliances and even described the relationship using a marriage <b>analogy.</b> <b>Advertising</b> agencies should effectively evaluate the four key findings that emerged from this study to foster long-term relationships with their clients...|$|E
40|$|The {{main point}} this study {{wants to make}} is that the use of <b>analogies</b> in <b>advertising</b> for really new {{products}} is a more effective means of communicating a new product’s distinctive benefits to consumers than is the use of literal similarity comparisons. This hypothesis was tested by means of an experiment with a 3 (comparison type: explicit analogy, implicit analogy, literal similarity) x 2 (product: Auto Mower, Smart Pen) design. The results showed a significant effect of the use of implicit <b>analogy</b> in <b>advertising</b> on consumer’s benefit comprehension for one of the two really new products. The use of analogies in the ads did not increase consumer preference to a greater degree than did the use of literal similarities. We did, however, find a positive effect of benefit comprehension on product preference. We discuss these findings and outline directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE – Sport events {{organizers}} {{have recently}} undertaken to disclose {{to the general}} public instances where firms have conspired to ambush the official sponsors. In doing so, they have sought to sensitise audiences to sponsors' valuable contribution. However, what is the effect of such disclosure on ambush marketers' brands? This study aims to answer this question, using an experimental approach. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – Two successive experiments were conducted. The first study used a student sample (n= 120) and a fictitious brand. The second study used a before-and-after experiment with control groups (n= 480), using four real brands and print disclosure articles. Data was collected from six French metropolitan areas and analysed using Repeated Measure ANOVA and MANOVA. FINDINGS – Ambush marketing disclosure is associated with lower attitudes towards the ambusher's brand. Two variables moderate this effect: involvement in the event and attitude towards sponsorship, both of which worsen the negative influence of ambush disclosure on audiences' attitudes. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – While the empirical work reflects one national context and one specific sport event, these findings are the first to empirically support the notion that disclosure of ambush practices adversely impacts ambushers' brand. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – These results offer official sponsors and event organisers an effective alternative strategy to legal protection, with demonstrated effects on the core target audience of the event. ORIGINALITY/VALUE – The literature has alluded to possible perverse effects of ambush marketing. This study is the first to draw an <b>analogy</b> with corrective <b>advertising</b> to test and demonstrate the impact of ambush disclosure on ambushers' brands.
