5|$|A charter {{purporting}} {{to be from}} King Æthelberht, dated 28 April 604, survives in the Textus Roffensis, {{as well as a}} copy based on the Textus in the 14th-century Liber Temporalium. Written mostly in Latin but using an Old English boundary clause, the charter records a grant of land near the city of Rochester to Justus' church. Among the witnesses is Laurence, Augustine's future successor, but not Augustine himself. The text turns to two different <b>addressees.</b> First, Æthelberht is made to admonish his son Eadbald, who had been established as a sub-ruler in the region of Rochester. The grant itself is addressed directly to Saint Andrew, the patron saint of the church, a usage parallelled by other charters in the same archive.|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and <b>addressees</b> and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E

25|$|The first 14 {{letters are}} thought to {{comprise}} the first published collection and are written by the heroines Penelope, Phyllis, Briseis, Phaedra, Oenone, Hypsipyle, Dido, Hermione, Deianeira, Ariadne, Canace, Medea, Laodamia, and Hypermestra to their absent male lovers. Letter 15, from the historical Sappho to Phaon, seems spurious (although referred to in Am. 2.18) because of its length, its lack of integration in the mythological theme, and its absence from Medieval manuscripts. The final letters (16–21) are paired compositions comprising {{a letter to a}} lover and a reply. Paris and Helen, Hero and Leander, and Acontius and Cydippe are the <b>addressees</b> of the paired letters. These are considered a later addition to the corpus because they are never mentioned by Ovid and {{may or may not be}} spurious.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Thebaid, Statius' {{relationship}} to Domitian and his court {{caused him to}} fall out of favor with critics and readers, but in recent times, the Silvae have been rehabilitated by scholars. Domitian is an important presence in the Silvae, and many of the poems appear to flatter the emperor and court. The content of the Silvae is primarily dictated by the needs of Statius' patrons, and many of the <b>addressees</b> come from the wealthy, privileged class of landowners and politicians. Statius' flattery of these elites has been interpreted in two ways by scholars; some maintain that the collection is highly subversive and is a subtle criticism of Domitian and the Roman aristocracy. Others urge a reading of the Silvae as individual pieces that respond to specific circumstances with their own unique viewpoints.|$|E

40|$|This study quantitatively and qualitatively {{examines}} honorific usage {{in casual}} first-encounter conversations between two relatively {{young people from}} similar backgrounds. The issues of concern are the frequency of use of <b>addressee</b> and referent honorifics, different types and forms of referent honorifics, reasons behind speech style shifts between honorific and non-honorific forms, and gender differences in honorific usage. Overall, <b>addressee</b> honorifics were predominantly used compared to plain forms, while the use of referent honorifics was limited in the data. The rate of honorific usage ranged greatly depending on the speaker and the conversation. Using too few <b>addressee</b> honorifics, however, has a possibility of offending the <b>addressee</b> in this speech context. Additionally, {{it was found that}} female speakers did not necessarily speak more politely (i. e., use more honorifics) than male speakers. The <b>addressee's</b> gender seemed to influence the rate of use of honorifics. Female speakers' use of <b>addressee</b> honorifics was higher in mixed-sex conversations than in single-sex conversations while the opposite was true with male speakers. As for referent honorifics, both genders tended to use more of them in single-sex conversations. As for speech style shifts between honorific forms and non-honorific forms, several contexts in which these were observed are reported. Self-directed questions and expression of feelings, thoughts, and opinions were the two most likely contexts for speech style shifts between <b>addressee</b> honorifics and plain forms. It appears that such style shifts occur to separate the utterances from the main course of conversation to signal that the utterance is not deliberately addressed to the <b>addressee,</b> that the focus is on meaning, or that the utterance constitutes a subspace embedded in the main floor rather than the main floor itself. Additionally, utterance type, increased familiarity with the <b>addressee,</b> speech style adjustment, and the introduction of new topics are suggested as possible contexts for speech style shifts between referent honorifics and non-honorific forms...|$|R

2500|$|Wessely was an {{advocate}} of the educational and social reforms outlined in Emperor Joseph II's Toleranzedict (Patent of toleration). He even risked his reputation for piety by publishing a manifesto in eight chapters, entitled Divrei Shalom ve-Emet (Words of Peace and Truth), in which he emphasized the necessity for secular instruction, {{as well as for}} other reforms, even from the points of view of the Mosaic law and the Talmud. This work has been translated into French as Instructions Salutaires <b>Addressées</b> aux Communautés Juives de l'Empire de Joseph II. (Paris, 1792), into Italian by [...] (Goerz, 1793), and into German by David Friedländer under the title Worte der Wahrheit und des Friedens (Berlin, 1798). By thus espousing the cause of reform, as well as by his support of M. Mendelssohn, Wessely incurred the displeasure of the rabbinical authorities of Germany and Poland, who threatened him with excommunication.|$|E
2500|$|... "As a final {{observation}} {{it should}} be noted that because many of the scientific discoveries and theories referred to in the Bahá'í Writings were yet unknown to the contemporaries of Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá, They obviously could not have used the technical terms applied for their description nowadays. Instead, They had to make use of and sometimes redefine already existing concepts and terms (e.g. the ether concept or the idea of the four elements of ancient Greek philosophy) in a way that they would accurately explain what They had in mind. On a superficial level, this might give the impression that the Central Figures of the Faith did not actually formulate any new ideas about physical reality. [...] When we study Their Writings more closely, however, we come to realise that this only seems to be the case because Their references to such topics were purposely made in such a way that they would neither offend Their <b>addressees</b> who believed in certain (erroneous) contemporary scientific concepts, nor make use of a terminology that had not yet been developed by contemporary scientists." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gigantomachy frieze on {{the outside}} walls of the Pergamon altar avoids {{to a great extent}} any direct {{references}} to contemporary military campaigns— except for the [...] "Star of Macedonia" [...] on the round shield of one of the Giants on the eastern frieze, or a Celtic oblong shield in the hand of a god on the northern frieze. The struggle of the Olympian gods, supported by Heracles, the astrological deities governing the days and hours and originating in the ancient race of the Titans, personifications of the forces of war and fate, sea creatures, and Dionysus with his followers, appears much rather to be a cosmological event of general ethical relevance. It can perhaps be interpreted in the sense of stoicism, and was certainly not designed without political considerations, {{as was the case with}} all artistic image metaphors depicting the struggle between the good and just principle— the Olympian gods and their helpers— and evil— the chaotic forces of nature in the form of the earthbound Giants. The scanty remnants of the dedicatory inscription also seem to indicate that the altar was consecrated to the gods because of [...] "favors" [...] they had bestowed. The divine <b>addressees</b> could be especially Zeus, father of the gods, and his daughter Athena, since they appear in prominent locations of the Gigantomachy frieze. An important dating criterion is also the incorporation of the altar from the perspective of city planning. As the most important marble edifice of the Hellenistic residence and indeed erected in a prominent position, it was assuredly not begun only at the conclusion of numerous initiatives to upgrade the acropolis of Pergamon under Eumenes II.|$|E
40|$|In the {{management}} of cooperation, the fit of a requested action with what the <b>addressee</b> is presently doing is a pervasively relevant consideration. We present evidence that imperative turns are adapted to, and reflexively create, contexts in which the other person {{is committed to the}} course of action advanced by the imperative. This evidence comes from systematic variation in the design of imperative turns, relative to the fittedness of the imperatively mandated action to the <b>addressee’s</b> ongoing trajectory of actions, what we call the “dine of com­mitment”. We present four points on this dine: Responsive imperatives perform an operation on the deontic dimension of what the <b>addressee</b> has announced or already begun to do (in particular its permissibility); local-project imperatives formulate a new action advancing a course of action in which the <b>addressee</b> is al­ready actively engaged; global-project-imperatives target a next task for which the <b>addressee</b> is available on the grounds of their participation in the overall event, {{and in the absence of}} any competing work; and competitive imperatives draw on a presently otherwise engaged <b>addressee</b> on the grounds of their social commit­ment to the relevant course of actions. These four turn shapes are increasingly complex, reflecting the interactional work required to bridge the increasing distance between what the <b>addressee</b> is currently doing, and what the imperative mandates. We present data from German and Polish informal and institutional settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of an author and an <b>addressee</b> is inherent to every communicative process. The author and the <b>addressee</b> are considered important stylistic factors, since they determine a great deal the overall composition of the text. When writing his text, the author caters for the expectations and the competence of the <b>addressee,</b> {{and on the other}} hand, the <b>addressee</b> receives and interprets his text according to how it is formulated and how it complies with the conventions for the text type in question. The relation between the author and the <b>addressee</b> is reflected in the text and this reflection could be called "polarity". Polarity may be perceived in the composition of the rhetorical perspective, for it is expressed by the use of the second person singular and of the first person singular or plural, by the use of rhetorical questions and exclamatory phrases, by anticipating the reactions of the <b>addressee,</b> etc. The relation between the partners in the communication is governed by norms and since norms do not coincide in all cultures, we have to bear in mind that to render successfully the original and to meet with the expectations of our <b>addressee</b> we have to cross the cultural barrier and adjust the polarity of the text.
