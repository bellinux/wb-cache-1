40|$|Problem statement: Nowadays, {{women have}} <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>place</b> in literature, {{both as a}} writer but also {{the role of the}} book and that is why I have chosen to examine how {{educators}} reason about their use of literature in preschool to combat the stereotype of gender roles. Motivation: An earlier survey shows that women now have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>place</b> in the recently released children's literature and, therefore, it is interesting to see how educators see their work on countering gender patterns using picture books. It is also interesting to examine whether the female roles in the books are consistent with the research I've used. Approach: I chose to use qualitative interviews with teachers in two preschools and also examined the recently released children’s books they worked with. Results: The results of my survey shows that teachers thoughts about their work on combating gender pattern occurs on an individual plan and depend on how the teacher interprets the guidelines. My survey also shows that the gender roles in the newly released picture books are consistent with earlier research I’ve used. Conclusion: It is therefore important that educators are aware of how easily gender patterns are induced, it happens on a daily basis through words and expectations that educators have on children...|$|R
