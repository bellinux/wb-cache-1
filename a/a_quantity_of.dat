5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} {{the definition of a}} unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E

In the last illustration, {{she is wearing}} a cloak and hood, and a muff and mittens fashioned from the wool.

5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E
5|$|All Assay Commission medals are {{extremely}} rare. Except for the 1977 medal, none {{is believed to}} have been issued in <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> greater than 200, and in most years fewer than 50 were struck. Additional copies of several 19th-century issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended such practices in the early 20th century. The obverse of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's series of medals honoring Secretaries of the Treasury. The later pieces were struck with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou obverse, and an unknown number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck than the originals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E

5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, {{they said that they}} would only help him if he pleaded guilty, an option which Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but that court refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Leftover waters {{from the}} storm led to an {{increase}} in mosquitoes in Texas, which prompted a widespread application of larvicide via airplane.

This followed a delivery of 2flood specialists, 20laborers, 2portable water treatment plants, 7trucks, and <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> insecticides and water treatment tablets. Residents in Laredo, Texas provided citizens of its neighboring city Nuevo Laredo, Mexico with food and water. The Mexican government provided temporary homes for the affected citizens of the flood. American officials distributed typhoid vaccinations, water purification tablets, and insecticides to the American cities along the Rio Grande. Safe water was eventually restored to Laredo, Texas on July12. All emergency work related to the disaster was finished by September3.|$|E

Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> rabbit-wool.

5|$|On 18 February 1817 Alceste {{entered the}} Gaspar Strait between Bangka and Liat, {{traversing}} largely uncharted waters. Some hours later the frigate struck a hidden reef and grounded, sustaining severe damage to her hull. Despite Maxwell's {{best efforts to}} free his ship the carpenter reported that Alceste was taking on water and would rapidly sink if refloated. Ordering the ship to be abandoned, Maxwell gave the ship's barge to the ambassador and supervised {{the construction of a}} raft which, with the remaining boats, safely convoyed the crew, passengers and <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> supplies to a nearby island, formed largely of impenetrable mangrove swamps. The last to leave Alceste, Maxwell arrived on shore on the morning of 19 February. A council of officers subsequently decided that Amherst would take the ship's boats and 50 men and attempt to reach Batavia, four days sail away. It was essential that Amherst reach Batavia quickly, as the supplies salvaged from the wreck, especially of drinkable water, would only last a few days shared among all 250 survivors.|$|E
5|$|Searches were resumed for {{the lost}} Endeavour Reef cannons, but expeditions in 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unsuccessful. They were finally {{recovered}} in 1969 by a research team from the American Academy of Natural Sciences, using a sophisticated magnetometer to locate the cannons, <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> iron ballast and the abandoned bower anchor. Conservation work on the cannons was undertaken by the Australian National Maritime Museum, after which two of the cannons were displayed at its headquarters in Sydney's Darling Harbour, and eventually put on display at Botany Bay and the National Museum of Australia in Canberra (with a replica remaining at the museum). A third cannon and the bower anchor were displayed at the James Cook Museum in Cooktown, with the remaining three at the National Maritime Museum in London, the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.|$|E
5|$|The grenade {{had several}} faults with its design. In tests, {{it failed to}} adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and, if the user was not careful after freeing the grenade from its casing, it could easily stick to his uniform. The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the grenade {{for use by the}} British Army, but {{personal}} intervention by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, led to the grenade going into production. Between 1940 and 1943, approximately 2.5 million were produced. It was primarily issued to the Home Guard, but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, accounting for six German tanks; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead, including the First Special Service Force; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign. The French Resistance were also issued <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> the grenades.|$|E

5|$|The {{need for}} tanks to equip {{armoured}} units led the War Cabinet {{to approve the}} manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940. Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943, but none were used in action. Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas. <b>A</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941, while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942, and these {{proved to be the}} most suitable type for jungle warfare. A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign. The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee. Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions, but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas, they did not see action. An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944. The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors.|$|E
5|$|These probes {{intensified}} on 30 March, {{as one of}} the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies {{was strongly}} attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol {{at the time of the}} attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to link up with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and link up with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1080s, the {{majority}} of officials drafted came from a regionally diverse background; afterwards, intraregional patterns of drafting officials became more common. Hartwell writes that during the Southern Song, the shift of power from central to regional administrations, the localized interests of the new gentry, the enforcement of prefectural quotas in preliminary examinations, and the uncertainties of a successful political career in the factionally split capital led many civil servants to choose positions {{that would allow them}} to remain in specific regions. Hymes demonstrates how this correlated with the decline in long-distance marriage alliances that had perpetuated the professional elite in the Northern Song, as the Southern Song gentry preferred local marriage prospects. It was not until the reign of Emperor Shenzong (r. 1068–1085) that the now heavily populated regions of South China began providing <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> officials in policy-making posts that were proportionate to their share of China's total population. From 1125 to 1205, about 80% of all those who held office in one of the six ministries of the central government had spent most of their low-grade official careers within the area of modern southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. Almost 100% of these officials were born and buried within this southeastern macroregion.|$|E
