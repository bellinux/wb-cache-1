A monstrous {{creature}} appears and dismembers Mitch before raping Sandy. Found distraught, Sandy receives treatment from Sharon and chief medical officer Karl (Barry Houghton), who discovers that the assault has triggered an accelerated pregnancy despite the regular intravenous injections of contraceptives given to {{the women in the}} team. When further explosions within the catacombs scupper chances of deeper investigation, the surviving members of the team <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> nothing to do but await the arrival of a Xeno rescue shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the other}} notes issued by this banks range from scarce to rare. The {{banknotes}} from the First National Bank of Porto Rico are particularly scarce, {{this is because}} the institution's issues didn't even reach quantities of 20. Only two bills from the $100 denomination have been known to survive, similarly two from the $20 issue <b>are</b> <b>left,</b> <b>with</b> one of them being acquired by Amon G. Carter before his death. Carter was known to exhibit the piece, but didn't make it available for sale. More than a dozen $10 banknotes survived, seldom appearing at auctions. Other extremely rare banknotes include the 2 and 4 real notes of 1813 and all of the denominations issued by the Caja de Ahorros de Ponce. In contrast, the paper money used by the Puerto Rico Railroad Company is still known to appear occasionally in the market. Outside of these, the clandestine bills issued by the Central Republican Board of Cuba and Puerto Rico, range from scarce (5-peso bill) to extremely rare (20-peso notes).|$|E

Therefore, a competitive advantage is created for the sophisticated users while unsophisticated users <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> an “information overload”. Two-tiered reporting can be damaging to unsophisticated users specifically in situations where important information is being eliminated or when too much information is being extracted.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at San Diego State University, USA, {{found that}} narcissism revealed {{a positive relationship}} with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making false allegations). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed to}} strike an {{extraordinary}} {{balance between the}} psychological and the supernatural {{in such a way}} as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|Regina argues with Horace {{about her}} {{contempt}} for him; and, when he suffers a heart attack, she makes {{no effort to}} get him his medicine from upstairs. Horace climbs the stairs to get his medicine but collapses on the way up. The final scenes of the film involve a dying Horace surrounded by family, a doctor and servants who await the chance he may survive. Eventually, Horace dies, leaving no one to contradict Regina if she accuses her brothers of theft. She thus blackmails her brothers, demanding that she be given 75% ownership of the mill business, and they <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> {{no choice but to}} accept her demands.|$|E

25|$|Besides the cardinality, which {{describes}} {{the size of}} a set, ordered sets also form a subject of set theory. The axiom of choice guarantees that every set can be well-ordered, which means that a total order can be imposed on its elements such that every nonempty subset has a first element with respect to that order. The order of a well-ordered set is described by an ordinal number. For instance, 3 is the ordinal number of the set {0, 1, 2} with the usual order 0 < 1 < 2; and ω is the ordinal number of the set of all natural numbers ordered the usual way. Neglecting the order, we <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> the cardinal number |N|nbsp&=nbsp&|ω|nbsp&=nbsp&.|$|E
25|$|Hybridization capture {{with the}} {{selector}} probe set is performed on tumor DNA from a biopsy and sequenced {{to a depth}} of ~10,000× coverage. The biotinylated selector probes bind selectively to the regions of the DNA library that were chosen to be where the recurrently mutations occur in the given cancer type. In this way you <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> a smaller library that is enriched for only the regions you want, which can then be sequenced. This allows the determination of patient specific mutations. Hybridization capture with the same selector is then performed on ctDNA from the blood to quantify the previously identified mutations in the patient. CAPP-Seq can be applied to ctDNA from multiple blood samples at different time points in order to follow tumor evolution.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{agree that}} Aix was born from its sources {{of water to}} Ancient Rome, on {{the remains of a}} Celtic habitat. The first {{occupation}} of the site has been dated by Alain Canal to the first century BCE, however there is nothing to suggest these remains were a fixed habitat. We <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> the remains in public institutions and {{it would be difficult to}} draw a sketch of ancient Aquae. The administrative situation of the place is known by epigraphy, which teaches us that Aix was, in the 1st century AD, a vicus, with a board of decemlecti (a council of ten members), and was administratively part of Vienne. Some citizens lived there with, apparently, quite important resources to offer to the gods, a sacred wood, a vine or to build a funeral arch for the case of the Campanii family.|$|E

25|$|A recent law journal note {{summarized}} the justifications for regulating payday lending. The summary notes {{that while it}} is difficult to quantify the impact on specific consumers, there are external parties who are clearly affected by the decision of a borrower to get a payday loan. Most directly impacted are the holders of other low interest debt from the same borrower, which now is less likely to be paid off since the limited income is first used to pay the fee associated with the payday loan. The external costs of this product can be expanded to include the businesses that are not patronized by the cash-strapped payday customer to the children and family who <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> fewer resources than before the loan. The external costs alone, forced on people given no choice in the matter, may be enough justification for stronger regulation even assuming that the borrower him or herself understood the full implications of the decision to seek a payday loan.|$|E

500|$|In this definition, Durkheim avoids {{references}} to supernatural or God. Durkheim {{argued that the}} concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural—that which cannot be rationally explained—from natural, that which can. Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural. Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as Buddhism, where the Four Noble Truths are much more important than any individual deity. With that, Durkheim argues, we <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> the following three concepts: the sacred (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the beliefs and practices (which create highly emotional state—collective effervescence—and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the moral community (a group of people sharing a common moral philosophy). Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion. He defined sacred things as: ...|$|E
