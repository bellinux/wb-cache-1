5|$|The {{incidence}} of AML increases with age; {{the median age}} at diagnosis is 63 years. AML <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 90% of all acute leukemias in adults, but is rare in children. The rate of therapy-related AML (that is, AML caused by previous chemotherapy) is rising; therapy-related disease currently <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 10–20% of all cases of AML. AML is slightly more common in men, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1.|$|E
5|$|Another {{classification}} scheme considers genetic and demographic factors. Type 1 {{has a positive}} family history, starts {{before the age of}} 40, and is associated with the human leukocyte antigen, HLA-Cw6. Conversely, type 2 does not show a family history, presents after age 40, and is not associated with HLA-Cw6. Type 1 <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 75% of persons with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Croup affects about 15% of children, {{and usually}} {{presents}} {{between the ages}} of 6 months and 5–6 years. It <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 5% of hospital admissions in this population. In rare cases, it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased prevalence in autumn.|$|E

5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} by far the main {{contributor}} to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains at least 73 known carcinogens, including benzopyrene, NNK, 1,3-butadiene and a radioactive isotope of polonium, polonium-210. Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking (70% for women). Smoking <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 85% of lung cancer cases.|$|E

Cumulative {{sales of the}} Nissan Leaf, the second all-time best selling plug-in car and the top selling all-electric car ever, passed the 15,000 unit mark in September 2016, and also <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 50% of total sales in the all-electric passenger car segment since 2010.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{people have}} fewer than 36 {{repeated}} glutamines in the polyQ region {{which results in}} production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results {{in the production of}} a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 7% of HD carriers.|$|E

5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the effects of {{exposure}} are worldwide. Environmental lead is ubiquitous, and everyone has some measurable blood lead level. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s {{as a result of}} the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead is one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.|$|E
5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s {{by the collapse}} of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 10% of the archipelago. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E

Four of the five most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers.

5|$|While bubbles {{can form}} {{anywhere}} in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain ("the bends") <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 60% to 70% of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site. Neurological symptoms are present in 10% to 15% of DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances being the most common symptom. Skin manifestations are present in about 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS ("the chokes") is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre-breathing protocols. The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types.|$|E
5|$|With {{extensive}} sand beaches, seabird breeding areas, {{and good}} dive {{sites in the}} Reef Observation Area {{to the south of}} the island, North Island is considered an attractive tourist site. However, all of the island's limited anchorage and jetty space is occupied by commercial fishers, so landings from private or charter boats are possible only by prior arrangement. Moreover, visitors are not permitted to camp on the island. North Island <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 3.5% of private recreational boat trips to the Houtman Abrolhos and about 1% of commercial charter boat trips. The most recent tourism plan for the Houtman Abrolhos supports the continued use of North Island by private charter boats {{and the use of the}} airstrip for tourism purposes, but recommends against the establishment of a land-based tourist site there.|$|E

5|$|People with {{epilepsy}} are at {{an increased}} risk of death. This increase is between 1.6 and 4.1 fold greater than that of the general population and is often related to: the underlying cause of the seizures, status epilepticus, suicide, trauma, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications. The risk of suicide is increased between two and six times in those with epilepsy. The cause of this is unclear. SUDEP appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 15% of epilepsy related deaths. It is unclear how to decrease its risk. The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly. Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have little increased risk. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40–60% of deaths are possibly preventable. In the developing world, many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus.|$|E
5|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} state commission includes {{officials from}} the Bulgarian ministries of defence, economy and finance and, according to the caretaker government's deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, {{the main reason for}} choosing the Swedish contestant is the favourable financial terms offered by Saab, including a lease option and offset agreements. In his words, the Swedish offer <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese one accounts a price of about one and a half billion BGN for the aircraft alone. The decision is pending the approval of the next regular Bulgarian government and, more importantly, of the Bulgarian Parliament. The second-place offer is to be retained as a back-up option, should the negotiations with Saab not be concluded successfully, as the financial resources for this program are budgeted until the end of 2017. The new fighters are to replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as to fill the gap left by the retirement of the country's dedicated Su-22 reconnaissance airplanes.|$|E
