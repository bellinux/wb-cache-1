5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{virtually}} complete collection {{of all of}} Dylan's 1967 recordings in Woodstock was released on a bootleg five-CD set, The Genuine Basement Tapes. The collection, which contains over 100 songs and alternate takes, was later remastered and issued as the four-CD bootleg <b>A</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>With</b> Roots. On November 4, 2014, Columbia/Legacy issued , an official 6-CD box set containing 139 tracks which comprises nearly all of Dylan's basement recordings, including 30 never-bootlegged tracks. A companion 2-CD set containing highlights from the recordings, The Basement Tapes Raw, was also released.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, after {{wrapping}} up the production and recording of their debut album, Into the Rush, Aly & AJ began recording their first Christmas album. Antonina Armato and Tim James {{who worked on the}} duo's debut album and several other Disney-related acts, were recruited to executive produce the effort. They anticipated finishing the album {{by the end of the}} summer, in order for it to be released for the holiday season. Aly & AJ thought it ironic that they were prepping a Christmas album during the hottest days of the year. Alyson Michalka told the Saginaw News that producers Armato and James filled the studio with Christmas decorations, Christmas cookies, and <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> gifts to open after they were done, in order for them to get in the Christmas spirit.|$|E
5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E

5|$|Later that evening, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that Quagmire could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while Quagmire says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E
5|$|Mel learns {{from her}} spy Azmus that {{northern}} mercenaries {{have been seen}} near the border – allies of the Marquise of Merindar – and that other allied forces are planning on eradicating the Hill Folk to take their colorwoods for payment. Mel sends Azmus to tell Shevraeth and rides out to warn the Hill Folk, but is shocked to encounter Shevraeth already on the road. Initially, he assumes she is plotting with Merindar against him, but lets her go when she tells him about the plans against the Hill Folk. An outnumbered Mel bravely tries to stop a group of mercenaries marching towards nearby forests, and is only saved by forces sent by Shevraeth. The Hill Folk now safe, Mel returns to Shevraeth, where she learns that he successfully put down Merindar's revolt. She also learns {{that he has been}} her secret admirer. After finally calling him by his first name, Vidanric, they kiss. The two return to Remalna-city, and find that Flauvic has secretly bewitched the entire capitol. As Flauvic prepares to complete his victory, the Hill Folk come to Mel's rescue and turn him into <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>With</b> the realm now secure, Shevraeth and Mel marry and are crowned as king and queen.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the classic}} and still {{important}} results of the theory is a theorem of Stallings about ends of groups. The theorem states that a finitely generated group {{has more than one}} end if and only if this group admits a nontrivial splitting over finite subgroups that is, if and only if the group admits a nontrivial action without inversions on <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> finite edge stabilizers.|$|E

After the tree has fallen, he is hakinta (having chopped) and the tree hakita (chopped).|$|E

25|$|Despite their similarities, works {{produced}} by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was omnidirectional, growing like <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists {{would not necessarily}} fall under one another's influence. Despite a growing awareness, a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group unity that would attain a maxima circa 1912, deep-seated differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers.|$|E
25|$|The work {{represents}} {{at least}} four nude women (or bathers) relaxing in a highly abstract landscape with vegetation and a small body of water visible through reflections and from {{the woman on the}} left whose legs are submerged from the knees down. The central figure holds the trunk of <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> her left arm and a woman with her right, forming a tight central mass. The two nudes at the center, treated in a light color, stand-out against a darker background. They are flanked on both sides by a standing and a sitting nude.|$|E
25|$|The April 14, 1968 Easter Sunday {{performance}} originally scheduled on West Virginia University {{property was}} cancelled when university administrators {{backed out of}} the previous arrangement with Paine and declared the performance unconstitutional. Paine then bargained with the First Presbyterian church to use their parking lot. In the mounting tension the church elders refused to allow the band to use the church facilities when the local paper ran a photo of the Mind Garage in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> Paine and friends standing about. At the last moment Rev. Jennings Fast of Wesley Methodist Church provided a place for the service.|$|E

25|$|Their nests may {{be located}} in the trees or on the ground. Ground nests, {{frequently}} located near leaf litter, may be fabricated within sunken areas of the soil or beneath logs. Ground nests have both advantages and disadvantages. Floods or wet soil may force golden mice to leave their ground nests and relocate into the trees. However, if the ground nest is undisturbed, it can lower the risk for predation for the following reasons: the nest is well hidden, a mouse on the ground is more likely to escape a predator, and less energy is required to build a nest on the ground since the mouse doesn't have to keep running up and down <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> nesting materials.|$|E
25|$|Phylogeny {{as applied}} to {{historical}} linguistics involves the evolutionary descent of languages. The phylogeny problem {{is the question of}} what specific tree, in the tree model of language evolution, best explains the paths of descent of all the members of a language family from a common language, or proto-language (at the root of the tree) to the attested languages (at the leaves of the tree). The Germanic languages form <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> Proto-Germanic at its root that is a branch of the Indo-European tree, which in turn has Proto-Indo-European at its root. Borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the Germanic branch within Indo-European less clear than the positions of the other branches of Indo-European. In the course of the development of historical linguistics, various solutions have been proposed, none certain and all debatable.|$|E
25|$|An 18-year-old diver from Scarborough, Ontario {{drowned in}} a slow {{whirlpool}} in the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. He had been swimming for 10 minutes, before approaching the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother tried to help him, but was pulled underwater several times. Resuscitation efforts by security staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's Director of Engineering denied the pond had an undertow. A nearby life ring had been tied to <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> 6 metres (20feet) of rope, not enough to reach {{the middle of the}} pool. A high diver who worked at the park for seven years said he told his supervisor of the undertow during the previous season. He claimed unauthorized swimmers frequently used the pond, and that there were 30 to 40 at one time. The park's Director of Safety and Security said he was never informed of the undertow, and only saw bathers in the pool once. The previous Director also denied hearing a complaint, and no official record of it exists. Security and extra signs were posted after the incident. Wonderland said the man shouldn't have been throwing frisbees in the area.|$|E

500|$|Circa 1950, Julian {{moved his}} family to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, {{becoming}} the first African-American family to reside there. [...] Although some residents welcomed them into the community, there was also opposition. Before they even moved in, on Thanksgiving Day, 1950, their home was fire-bombed. Later, after they moved in, the house was attacked with dynamite on June 12, 1951. [...] The attacks galvanized the community, and a community group was formed to support the Julians.
