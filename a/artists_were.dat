Hugh Cott was chief instructor; the artist camouflage officers, who called themselves camoufleurs, included Steven Sykes and Tony Ayrton.

Max Dupain, Sydney Ure Smith and William Dobell were {{among the members of}} the group, which worked at Bankstown Airport, RAAF Base Richmond and Garden Island Dockyard.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the high}} value placed on works of art, even famous <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> of low social status among the Greeks and Romans, who {{regarded}} artists, artisans, and craftsmen alike as manual labourers.

5|$|Overseeing {{the visual}} effects {{department}} for New Moon was Susan MacLeod, {{who had previously}} worked with Weitz during the production of The Golden Compass. MacLeod enlisted Tippett Studio to create the computer generated wolves, while Prime Focus of Vancouver handled {{the effects of the}} vampires. To prepare for the aggressive task of making the wolves look real, Tippet artists studied wolf culture. They also were able to reflect leadership and human muscle size by adjusting certain features of the wolves, such as their fat and tallness. In February 2009, a group of <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> able to travel to Wolf Mountain Sanctuary, outside of Los Angeles, and see real wolves. The <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> able to observe the behavior of both the timber and arctic wolves, who ran in packs of three to five. The idea was to give everyone a deeper feeling of the creature that they were creating.|$|E

5|$|Some {{critics and}} historians argue that one {{characteristic}} of the Silver Age was that science fiction and aliens replaced magic and gods. Others argue that magic was {{an important element of}} both Golden Age and Silver Age characters.

Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} I have {{examined}} how Swedish <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> {{portrayed in the}} Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. I have been using a critical discourse analysis to analyze twelve articles, whereof six interviews with female performing artists and six with male performing artists. The main findings show that the journalist mostly describes the artists in ways {{that can be seen}} as normative for the female and male gender. The female <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> described  as strong and caring about relationships, while the majority of the male <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> described as brave and tough. Both the female and male performing <b>artists</b> <b>are</b> described as outreach and people who are not affraid to express themselves. ...|$|R

The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Wright is {{currently}} rated {{as one of}} the leading indigenous British painters of his generation, largely for the distinctive realism in his portraiture. Perhaps due to the unusually cosmopolitan nature of his experience, he was favoured by patrons at the highest level of society in an age in which foreign <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> usually preferred. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are included amongst the collections of many leading galleries today.|$|E
5|$|Although some nudes {{by foreign}} <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> held in private English collections, {{the country had}} no {{tradition}} of depicting unclothed figures and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in paintings of nudes, and the reaction of uneducated audiences to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of males in a similar state of undress were generally well received.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 2001, advocates began {{lobbying}} for a Grammy category specifically for cajun and zydeco music. Award recipients, in chronological order, included Terrance Simien and the Zydeco Experience, BeauSoleil avec Michael Doucet, Buckwheat Zydeco, and Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band; no artist received the award more than once. Awards {{were presented to}} the engineers, mixers, and/or producers {{in addition to the}} performing artists. The group Pine Leaf Boys holds the record for the most nominations, with four. Though nominated each year the honor was presented, the group failed to receive an award. Doucet and Cedric Watson each received three nominations. 2009 marked the only year in which a musician received more than one nomination as well as the only time two <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> nominated for works appearing on the same album—Doucet was nominated as a member of BeauSoleil for Live at the 2008 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival as well as for his solo album From Now On, and Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys were also nominated for their contribution to the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival compilation album.

5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques. When the Khmer Rouge {{came to power in}} 1975, <b>artists</b> <b>were</b> among those viewed {{as a threat to the}} regime's agrarian socialist vision, and several of the performers on the album are believed to have been among those killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide of 1975-1979.
