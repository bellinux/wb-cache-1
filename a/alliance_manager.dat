40|$|Purpose : Strategic alliances involve uncertainty, interdependence, and vulnerability, {{which often}} create adverse situations. This paper seeks to {{understand}} how <b>alliance</b> <b>managers</b> respond to these adverse situations by examining the influence of four exchange variables on response strategies. Design/methodology/approach : A scenario-based experiment provides empirical support for a typology consisting of seven conceptually and empirically distinct response strategies: exit, opportunism, aggressive voice, creative voice, considerate voice, patience, and neglect. Findings : The results indicate that economic satisfaction, social satisfaction, alliance-specific investments, {{and the availability of}} attractive alternatives differentially and interactively affect response strategies. Research limitations/implications : The study offers two main contributions to alliance literature. First, the seven response strategies accurately represent reactions that <b>alliance</b> <b>managers</b> use to deal with adverse situations. Second, the study findings validate and extend previous alliance research by highlighting that a comprehensive response strategy typology is necessary to disentangle the effects of the four exchange conditions on response strategy use, which fosters theory development and managers’ ability to manage their alliances effectively. Originality/value : The study contributes to the process perspective on strategic alliances by highlighting the various response strategies that <b>alliance</b> <b>managers</b> use to deal with adverse situations and their antecedents...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{sources of}} failure in {{strategic}} alliances drawing on field research {{into one of}} the most prominent alliance collapses in recent years. The alliance of Volvo and Renault married the two largest enterprises in their respective countries for economic objectives that virtually all industry experts applauded. Three years after its founding, the allies split apart in a bruising argument that left observers reassessing the future of alliances and of European integration. We believe that an explanation of the paradox of `good motive-unhappy outcome' here is to be found in the `dark side' of <b>alliances</b> that invites <b>managers</b> to make fatal errors. We identify six factors that undermined the Volvo-Renault alliance: misalignment of senior and operating <b>managers,</b> path dependence, <b>alliance</b> recontracting, leadership style, cultural differences, and time. Alliances are vulnerable to these and other errors. Lessons about them are relevant to all <b>alliance</b> <b>managers</b> and senior executives of corporate allies. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the successful implementation of alliances as a way of creating competitive advantage. As managers in technology intensive industries try {{to meet the challenges of}} rising costs, shortened product lives, and intense competition, they are turning to strategic alliances. Alliances allow a firm to specialize in those activities of the value chain that are essential to its competitive advantage, while entrusting other activities to their partner firms. Much of the past research on strategic alliances has focused on the characteristics of, and motivations for, alliances. There has been little work on how alliances are implemented. This study examines the successful management of strategic alliances for product development.;The purpose was to: (1) develop a synthesized model of alliance management, (2) empirically test the model using data collected from <b>alliance</b> <b>managers,</b> and (3) identify determinants of successful alliance management and performance. The study, as part of an integrated multi-method research program, included a literature review, pilot study, model development, data collection, and model testing. The results of the literature review and pilot study were the basis for the development of the strategic alliance management model. Data to test the model was collected from managers in North American firms involved in thirty-eight product development alliances. The model was tested using Partial Least Squares (PLS) with data collected by questionnaires. The model explains approximately 61 percent of the observed variance in strategic performance.;Based on the results of the study, recommendations are made to practicing managers involved in product development alliances. Essentially three sets of activities, or steps, make up successful <b>alliances,</b> and <b>managers</b> can take specific actions to manage these steps. These activities are initiating, maintenance, and building actions. In evaluating <b>alliance</b> performance, <b>managers</b> can assess operational and strategic performance.

40|$|Project Alliances (PAs) demand {{particular}} knowledge skills, {{attributes and}} experiences of <b>alliance</b> <b>managers</b> (AMs) and key team members of non owner participants (NOPs) in PAs. The ambience of a PA is quite different {{to that of other}} relationship-based procurement types such as partnering or public private partnerships (PPPs). Therefore, AMs and their senior team members need to be not only technically competent and have sound project management (PM) skills but they also need high-level advanced PM skills to create, nurture and develop a culture of collegiality, shared responsibility and commitment to a best-for-project outcome. This paper draws upon extensive PA literature, several recent Australasian studies on PAs (predominately undertaken in Australia), and others elsewhere as well as results from a recent research project undertaken with the Australasian Alliancing Association in which 10 <b>Alliance</b> <b>managers</b> and 3 of unit managers they report to were interviewed.

Results were used to develop a profile of the skills, attributes and experience needed of AMs and were able to develop a framework to differentiate between new and inexperienced AMs, emerging proficient and expert levels of preparedness for the AM role. A capability maturity model was developed to not only profile AM stages of development but to also be used as a developmental tool by those pursuing careers in alliancing. While results may be specific to Australasia and for AMs, the profile and results presented may form the basis for wider application.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} display, {{distribution}} unlimited"When the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) took power in Japan in 2009, both Japanese and American observers feared sea changes in Japanese security policy. Compared to the longgoverning and familiar Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the DPJ seemed young and inexperienced, farther left and less ideologically coherent, {{and eager to}} make policy change for change's sake. The DPJ has appeared to earn this reputation {{over the last three}} years, as exemplified by its early mishandling of reorganization plans for U. S. military installations in Okinawa, which prompted widespread criticism both within Japan and from U. S. <b>alliance</b> <b>managers</b> and observers. This notion of a hapless DPJ is only partly correct. The DPJ government has indeed begun to popularize and politicize Japanese security policy, leaving security decisions more exposed to political and public leverage. This reflects the party's anti-bureaucratic policymaking instincts, its top-heavy structure, and its promotion of two-party competition. In some ways, though, the party has been a victim of its own success. It has stumbled most badly over the most high-profile, politically salient issues: military base politics, incidents surrounding territorial disputes, North Korea crisis management. This has reflected poor coordination more than misguided or unpopular policy stances. But at the same time, on many substantively important but less politically salient issues [...] arms non-export policies, military-military relations with South Korea, the updating of National Defense Program Guidelines [...] the DPJ is quietly progressing along a security policy trajectory that is familiar, constructive, and not particularly worrying for either the U. S. or the Japanese public. This pattern may be somewhat reassuring for American <b>alliance</b> <b>managers,</b> but it suggests the need to watch for gradual politicization of previously under-the-radar security matters. It also suggests that the handling of security policy has new potential to vex all incumbent Japanese governments, DPJ-led or otherwise, and thereby to contribute to governance destabilization across the board in Japan.
