5|$|Also in August 2014, 4chan was {{involved}} in the Gamergate controversy, which began with unsubstantiated allegations about indie game developer Zoë Quinn from an ex-boyfriend, followed by false allegations from anonymous Internet users. The <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> followed by a harassment campaign against several women in the video game industry, organized by 4chan users.|$|E
5000|$|Disjunctive <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> <b>allegations</b> in a {{pleading}} {{joined together}} by an [...] "or".

5|$|Holley {{returned}} to work with Jackson for the Dangerous World Tour (June 1992–November 1993), a 69 date concert series which was attended by almost 3.5 million fans. The tour was cut short, however, after child sexual abuse <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> levelled against Jackson and he cancelled {{the remainder of the}} tour due to the stress caused by the accusations.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Minnesota Majority, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, {{conducted a study}} in which they flagged 2,803 voters for examination, including some 1,359 they suspected were ineligible convicted felons in the largely Democratic Minneapolis–St. Paul area who voted illegally in the Senate race. Subsequent investigations of Minnesota Majority's claims by election officials found that many of their <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> incorrect.|$|E
5|$|These <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> {{brought to}} the {{attention}} of the Ethics Education Committee of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) in 2007, and a response was given in 2008. In regard to Redondasuchus, the SVP found no plagiarism involved, while in the case of Heliocanthus and Rioarribasuchus, the SVP did not try to resolve the issue.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduate}} school Ahn moved to Seattle {{and worked as}} a psychotherapist. In late 2002 he was dismissed from his job as the supervisor of a group home for at-risk youth in Seattle, after one of the residents accused him of hugging her and holding her hand. In a 2013 retrospective he penned for news portal Rappler, Ahn contended that her <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> false; made in retaliation for his sanctioning her with loss of privileges for illegal possession of a controlled substance. Thereafter he left the social services and found work in retail management.|$|E
5|$|<b>Allegations</b> <b>were</b> {{made against}} the state police, state {{government}} and the chief minister Narendra Modi, citing that government authorities were involved and various police personnel {{played a role in}} the massacre: a number of eyewitnesses reported police officers favouring the mob by allegedly injuring or killing Muslims and damaging public and private property. All <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> proved to be false and the government and police were cleared of wrongdoing by a Special Investigation Team. The initial report on the case was filed by the Gujarat police, accusing 46 people, all of whom the Special Court deemed unreliable. In 2008, the Supreme Court of India formed a Special Investigation Team to investigate the case. In 2009, the team submitted its report, which accused 70 people of wrongdoing, 61 of whom were charged. On 29 August 2012, the Special Court convicted 32 people and acquitted 29 due to insufficient evidence. Among those convicted were Maya Kodnaniformer Cabinet Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat and former Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Narodawho was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment, and Bajrang Dal's Babu Bajrangi, who received a life sentence.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{attacked}} Barreto's {{report in}} three ways. First, {{he claimed that}} Barreto, supposed author of the report, was not capable of writing it. Then {{he argued that the}} <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> exaggerated semi-truths or outright lies. And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and taking advantage of the natural resources of the region.|$|E
5000|$|This key {{piece of}} {{evidence}} was used to convince the Guatemalan populace and the world that Rodrigo Rosenberg had himself killed. [...] The <b>allegation</b> <b>was</b> that he himself contacted the killers via cellphone to give them instructions for the killing. This <b>allegation</b> <b>was</b> based on information that placed the calls made to the killers within Rodrigo Rosenberg’s apartment.|$|R
5000|$|According to the documentary, {{support for}} this <b>allegation</b> <b>was</b> said {{to have come from}} various sources: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{defendant}} {{responds to}} the plaintiff’s allegations in a document called an answer, in which the defendant must admit or deny an allegation or state {{that he or she}} does not know if the <b>allegation</b> <b>is</b> true, in which case the <b>allegation</b> <b>is</b> taken as denied. The defendant may also raise affirmative defenses (defenses that defeat the plaintiff’s claims even if the plaintiff’s <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> true), for example, that the time period for filing the suit has expired, that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid, or that the complaint has already been settled in previous litigation. The defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a fellow defendant.|$|R
5|$|Following its collapse, {{there was}} some {{speculation}} about whether Great Southern had disclosed to the market issues with the rate of return {{it was going to}} achieve on some of its timber investments. During parliamentary committee inquiries, these <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> extended to the possibility that the auditors had been misled. It was also noted that, at the time that difficulties were emerging for Great Southern, its CEO sold some of his shares {{at the top of the}} companies' fortunes for $32.6 million.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{surrounding}} these <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> {{around since}} Moreno González was declared dead by the Mexican government in 2010. The mysticism and spiritual {{teachings of the}} drug lord have {{played an important role}} in the Knights Templar Cartel's propaganda and recruitment in Michoacán. By spreading such rumors, the cartel hoped to gain a level of consensus from the public in their fight against the self-defense militias and state forces in the state.|$|E
5|$|That same year, he {{illustrated}} the pro-occupation book Zóó zag Brussel de Dietsche Militanten under the pen name Kaproen. In the 1970s Willy denied rumors, based on drawing style, {{that he had}} been the real artist behind Kaproen, but in 2010 these <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> confirmed after an investigation demanded by his own family. Unlike his partners, Vandersteen was later not persecuted for his part in publishing the antisemitic drawings, which were considered collaboration with the Nazis.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Although the snuff film <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> disproven, the Italian courts {{decided to}} ban Cannibal Holocaust {{due to the}} genuine animal slayings, citing animal cruelty laws. Deodato, Franco Palaggi, Franco Di Nunzio, Gianfranco Clerici, {{producer}} Alda Pia and United Artists Europa representative Sandro Perotti each received a four-month suspended sentence after they were all convicted of obscenity and violence. Deodato fought in the courts for three additional years to get his film unbanned. In 1984, the courts {{ruled in favor of}} Deodato, and Cannibal Holocaust was granted a rating certificate of VM18 for a cut print. It would later be re-released uncut.|$|E
5|$|Driberg made {{no secret}} of his homosexuality, which he practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist Aleister Crowley and the Kray twins, along with honoured and respected figures in the worlds of literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Numerous <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> {{made that}} the {{government}} of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} was {{opposed by the}} Cistercian monasteries of Yorkshire, and by the archdeacons of York. The Cistercians opposed {{on the grounds that}} the Second Lateran Council in 1139 had given the religious houses of a diocese the right to participate in the election of the bishop. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to recognise William's election due to allegations of simony, or the acquisition of church positions by bribery, and of interference by King Stephen. In 1143, Pope Innocent II ruled that William could be confirmed in office if he swore under oath that the <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> false. After he swore the oath, Henry of Blois, who was also papal legate, found William innocent, and he was consecrated as archbishop on 26 September 1143.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} dogged by {{financial}} controversy with the Australians accused by the British press of being {{interested only in}} money. The <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> refuted by the Australian press but it later became clear, when an England team arrived in Australia the following winter, {{that there had been}} a financial dispute between Alexander and the English team manager James Lillywhite, resulting in the two teams at first boycotting each other. The dispute was never evident while Murdoch's team was in England as they completed all their scheduled fixtures, winning eighteen matches and losing seven with seven drawn.|$|E
