25|$|One {{of the few}} successes was the {{development}} in the 1970s of the <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drug</b> artemisinin, which is a processed extract of Artemisia annua, a herb traditionally used as a fever treatment. Researcher Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant. She says she was influenced by a traditional source saying that this herb should be steeped in cold water, after initially finding high-temperature extraction unsatisfactory. The extracted substance, once subject to detoxification and purification processes, is a usable <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drug</b> – a 2012 review found that artemisinin-based remedies were the most effective drugs {{for the treatment of}} malaria. For her work on malaria, Tu received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Despite global efforts in combating malaria, it remains a large burden for the population. Although WHO recommends artemisinin-based remedies for treating uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin resistance can no longer be ignored.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{illicit trade}} in {{counterfeit}} <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> {{is a major}} setback to the fight against malaria. Information on public awareness and ability to identify counterfeit drugs is scanty. Aim. Therefore, the present study aimed at assessing public awareness {{and the ability to}} identify counterfeit <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> based on simple observations such as appearance of the drugs, packaging, labelling, and leaflets. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was conducted using interviewer administered structured questionnaire and a checklist. Respondents were required to spot the difference between genuine and counterfeit <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> given to them. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20. Results. The majority of respondents, 163 (55. 6 %), were able to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs.</b> Respondents with knowledge on health effects of counterfeit drugs were more likely to identify genuine and counterfeit drugs than their counterparts (P= 0. 003; OR = 2. 95; 95 % CI: 1. 47 – 5. 65). The majority of respondents, 190 (64. 8 %), perceived the presence of counterfeit drugs to be a big problem to the community. Conclusions. A substantial proportion of respondents were able to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs.</b> Public empowerment in identifying counterfeit drugs by simple observations is a major step towards discouraging the market of counterfeit drugs...|$|R
40|$|Inappropriate use of <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> is a {{prevalent}} {{problem in}} Sudan. In {{the context of}} escalating health care costs and spreading drug resistant parasites, improving the use of antimalarials becomes mandatory rather than an option. This indicator –based {{study was designed to}} assess the prescribing and dispensing practices of <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> among health care providers in health centers of Khartoum state, and to compare these practices with the National protocol for treatment of malaria (NPTM). 24 health centers and 30 patients from each health center were included. The results showed that 77. 6 % of patients presented with history of fever, 98. 6 % had the blood film for malaria (BFFM) done, and 52. 2 % were physically examined. However, only 64. 6 % {{of the total number of}} patients were actually diagnosed correctly. More than 90 % of <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> were prescribed by generic names. Chloroquine had the highest rate of prescriptions. The dosage schedule was written in 83. 5 % of prescriptions, and was correct in only 71. 9 % of them. <b>Antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> were not always prescribed alone. In 44. 4 % antibiotics were prescribed, and in about 52 % of prescriptions analgesics were prescribed. Prescribing antimalarial injections was high, accounting for more than 35 % of prescriptions. Key <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> were in stock in 29. 2 % of health centers. Less than 50 % of patients knew the dose of their prescribed <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs</b> adequately, and labelling practices were very poor. Knowledge about the NPTM and the recommended lines of treatment varied among prescribers and dispensers. When comparing existing practices with the NPTM (standard) it was found that only 38. 6 % of patients were managed according to the NPTM. Some prescribers stated that the NPTM was not suitable for treating all cases of uncomplicated malaria and some of the health care providers suggested introduction of new <b>antimalarial</b> <b>drugs.</b> Although training was found to have significant effect on prescribing treatment in correct dose, less than 40 % of prescribers and dispensers had previous training in the NPTM.
