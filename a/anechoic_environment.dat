With the appropriate coordinate system, the resulting ITD varies primarily with azimuth, while the IID varies with azimuth and elevation.

40|$|International audienceWell-established {{solutions}} {{capable of}} scanning electromagnetic fields in <b>anechoic</b> <b>environments</b> essentially {{rely on the}} massive use of absorbers, {{in order to keep}} under check energy scattered by the metallic parts of an automatic positioning system. Solutions of this kind are convenient whenever the field to scan is the result of line-of-sight (LOS) propagation. In complex media, where multi-path propagation imply non-LOS contributions, the introduction of absorbing materials can irremediably alter the behavior of the medium under test and therefore the field to be scanned. In this case, a field scanner rather needs to be as transparent as possible. This paper introduces the main ideas behind an alternative automatic positioning system designed in order to ensure a low perturbation of the response of a medium. The impact of the scanner is assessed when used in a reverberation chamber with a varying degree of reverberation, in order to emulate the conditions found in realistic complex media. Expected applications are mainly found in sounding propagation in complex media...|$|R

Using virtualization techniques, we show that auditory spatial representations of the world beyond the peripersonal space of blind listeners are compressed compared to those for normally sighted controls. Blind participants overestimated the distance to nearby sources and underestimated the distance to remote sound sources, in both reverberant and <b>anechoic</b> <b>environments,</b> and for speech, music, and noise signals.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} of the complex received signal in body area networks for two environments at the opposite ends of the multipath spectrum at 2. 45 GHz.

It is found that in <b>anechoic</b> <b>environments</b> the assumption of Gaussian distributed quadrature components will not always yield a satisfactory fit. Using a complex received signal model which considers a non-isotropic scattered signal contribution along with the presence of an optional dominant signal component, we use an autocorrelation function originally derived for mobile-to-mobile communications to model the temporal behavior of a range of dynamic body area network channels with considerable success. In reverberant environments, it was observed that the real part of the complex autocorrelation function for body area network channels decayed slightly quicker than that expected in traditional land mobile channels...|$|R

30|$|On-body {{propagation}} {{is one of}} {{the dominant}} propagation mechanisms in wireless body area networks (WBANs). It is characterized by near-field body-coupling and strong body-scattering effects. The temporal and spatial properties of on-body channels are jointly affected by the antenna polarization, the body posture, and the body motion. Analysis on the time variant properties of on-body channels relies on a good understanding of the dynamic body scattering, which is highly dependent on specific scenarios. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to provide a canonical description of on-body channels in both time and space domains to investigate the on-body propagation over the trunk surface of a walking human. The scattering from the arms and the trunk in different dimensions is considered with a simplified geometrical description of the body and of the body movements during the walk. A general full-wave solution of a polarized point source with multiple cylinder scattering is derived and extended by considering time evolution. The model is finally validated by deterministic and statistical comparisons to different measurements in <b>anechoic</b> <b>environments.</b>|$|R

This study proposes a new validation step using small anechoic boxes, called ABoxes. These boxes allow emulation of the complete acoustic sensor network in a laboratory environment to obtain first impressions, reducing costs and labor. The new validation-step we are proposing simulates an open-field environment by setting up an electro-acoustic chain in individual small anechoic boxes, isolating every node from one another. Two different designs are being presented: the first ABox has modular pieces making it easier to build; the second and improved ABox design is more complex due to the application of advanced room acoustics theory. Both boxes were built using materials and components that can easily be obtained in a standard hardware store. With this method, basic testing of an acoustic wireless sensor network is possible and future work could expand the field of application of this validation step.
