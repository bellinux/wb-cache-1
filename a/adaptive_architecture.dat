40|$|Abstract—Multi-cores {{have become}} {{ubiquitous}} {{both in the}} general-purpose computing and the embedded domain. The current technology trends show {{that the number of}} on-chip cores is rapidly increasing, while their complexity is decreasing due to power and thermal constraints. Increasing number of simple cores enable parallel applications benefit from abundant threadlevel parallelism (TLP), while sequential fragments suffer from poor exploitation of instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Recent research has proposed <b>adaptive</b> multi-core <b>architectures</b> that are capable of coalescing simple physical cores to create more complex virtual cores so as to accelerate sequential code. Such <b>adaptive</b> <b>architectures</b> can seamlessly exploit both ILP and TLP. The goal {{of this paper is to}} quantitatively characterize the performance potential of <b>adaptive</b> multi-core <b>architectures.</b> Previous research have primarily focused on only sequential workload on adaptive multi-cores. We address a more realistic scenario where parallel and sequential applications co-exist on an adaptive multi-core platform. Scheduling tasks on <b>adaptive</b> <b>architectures</b> reveals challenging resource allocation problems for the existing schedulers. We construct offline and online schedulers that intelligently reconfigure and allocate the cores to the applications so as to minimize the overall makespan under the constraints of a realistic <b>adaptive</b> multi-core <b>architecture.</b> Experimental results reveal that <b>adaptive</b> multi-core <b>architectures</b> can substantially decrease the makespan compared to both static symmetric and asymmetric multi-core <b>architectures.</b> Index Terms—Scheduling, <b>adaptive</b> multi-cores, dynamic heterogeneous multi-core, ILP, TLP, malleable and moldable tasks.

40|$|Today’s {{heterogeneous}} {{embedded systems}} combine components from different domains, such as software, analogue hardware and digital hardware. The {{design and implementation}} of these systems is still a complex and error-prone task due to the different Models of Computations (MoCs), design languages and tools associated {{with each of the}} domains. Though making such systems adaptive is technologically feasible, most of the current design methodologies do not explicitely support <b>adaptive</b> <b>architectures.</b> This paper present the ANDRES project. The main objective of ANDRES is the development of a seamless design flow for adaptive heterogeneous embedded systems (AHES) based on the modelling language SystemC. Using domain-specific modelling extensions and libraries, ANDRES will provide means to efficiently use and exploit adaptivity in embedded system design.

In this paper, the authors presented the design and implementation of an adaptive Web server architecture to provide relative and absolute connection delay guarantees for different service classes. Their first contribution is an <b>adaptive</b> <b>architecture</b> based on feedback control loops that enforce desired connection delays via dynamic connection scheduling and process reallocation. The second contribution is the use of control theoretic techniques (PI controllers based on the Root Locus method) to model and design the feedback loops with desired dynamic performance.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} an {{increased interest in}} physical systems controlled over wireless networks (networked control systems). These systems allow the computation of control signals via processors that are not attached to the physical systems, and the feedback loops are closed over wireless networks. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to design and analyze event-triggered decentralized and distributed <b>adaptive</b> control <b>architectures</b> for uncertain networked large-scale modular systems; that is, systems consist of physically-interconnected modules controlled over wireless networks. Specifically, the proposed <b>adaptive</b> <b>architectures</b> guarantee overall system stability while reducing wireless network utilization and achieving a given system performance in the presence of system uncertainties that can result from modeling and degraded modes of operation of the modules and their interconnections between each other. In addition to the theoretical findings including rigorous system stability and the boundedness analysis of the closed-loop dynamical system, as well as the characterization of the effect of user-defined event-triggering thresholds and the design parameters of the proposed <b>adaptive</b> <b>architectures</b> on the overall system performance, an illustrative numerical example is further provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed decentralized and distributed control approaches...|$|R

The architecture uses a hardware-software cooperation solution to achieve dynamic processor resource allocation with minimal hardware overhead while providing some flexibility to the applications and the operating systems.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we address {{performance}} oriented design applied to <b>adaptive</b> <b>architecture</b> {{in order to satisfy}} the performance requirements for changing contextual conditions. The domain of <b>adaptive</b> <b>architecture</b> is defined and specific focus is given to form-active architecture, in which geometric changes occur as a means of adaptivity during the use of the building. A parametric design approach and related computational tools which are able to support the very early conceptual phase of the design process are introduced. Three examples are shown concerning different aspects of the design process. These are the identification of meaningful geometric properties as a means of adaptivity, of different configurations within predefined geometric properties and of reconfigurable systems. For each of these, benefits and limitations of parametric design and computational search techniques are discussed. ...|$|E

Future mobile computing deployments are likely to require such DTN deployments to operate alongside more traditional mobile ad hoc networking approaches. Applications operating in these dynamic mixed environments would like their connections to be supported by the network technology best suited to the combination of the communication session’s requirements and instantaneous network context.
