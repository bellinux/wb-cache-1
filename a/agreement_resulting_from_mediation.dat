It is proposed an analysis from a historical {{point of view of the}} elements that have led the fullfilment of the agreement built by the parties, at this point, Roman law offers a basic example as it belongs to the magistrate’s court officium to provide a guide for the formation of consensus between the conflicting parties in order to reach agreement before the effective process.

40|$|Capital Market {{is usually}} {{depicted}} as a place for experts, for people with high trading skills. This is a half truth. There are entities established and functioning under strict scrutiny of Romanian National Securities Commission (RNSC), in compliance with Capital Market Law and regulations. There are also the investors, in many cases individuals involved in shares/financial instruments trade. In both cases disputes can rise. Disputes are inevitable a part of human interaction, hence the need for dispute resolution. First option is the judicial court system. Alternative dispute resolution comprises arbitration and mediation. Arbitration is an alternative choice to provide simpler, speedier and more accessible justice than ordinary courts as well as expertise in matters that are technical in nature and require special knowledge to adjudicate upon. Capital Market environment provides an institutional arbitration court for all participants, including investors. In many cases the agreement executed between participants under RNSC scrutiny The other option for settling disputes outside the court is mediation. Mediation can provide a much cheaper and quick extrajudicial resolution of disputes in commercial matters without time consuming procedures and rigid rules. <b>Agreements</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>mediation</b> {{are more likely to}} be complied with voluntarily and are more likely to foster the commercial relationship between the parties.
