However, plant diversity in such wild plant sowings based on seed mixtures is often low due to the high competitiveness of few, common species. Here we analysed whether intraspecific aggregation could enhance the performance of less competitive <b>species,</b> and how <b>plant</b> performance {{is influenced by the}} number of species in a mixture. We focused on inter- and intraspecific competition between six <b>agricultural</b> wild <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> (Centaurea cyanus, Calendula arvensis, Melilotus officinalis, Poa annua, Bromus mollis, Medicago lupulina), and tested (i) two different seeding patterns (intraspecifically aggregated vs. randomly dispersed) and (ii) three different species mixtures (monocultures, three-species, and six-species mixtures). Plant performance was measured in terms of number of individuals, biomass per individual, and biomass per m(2). Intraspecific aggregation resulted in higher numbers of individuals of all species, while mixtures generated lower numbers of individuals. The performance of <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> differed depending on their position in the competitive hierarchy. Competitively weak species suffered much less from intraspecific than interspecific competition in terms of biomass, and the competitively weakest species became even excluded in the most species rich and randomly dispersed sowings with high interspecific competition. In conclusion, the performance of wild <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was influenced by both seeding pattern and number of species in a mixture. Intraspecific aggregation enabled the coexistence of competitively weak species by reducing interspecific competitive exclusion processes.

In order to determine the effects of plants on diversity and abundance of arthropods, a study was carried out in three regions of Razavi and northern Khorasan provinces, Shirvan, Mashhad and Gonabad. In each region, high and low input fields of winter wheat and a natural system for comparison were selected. In ripening stage of wheat growth (90 stage of Zadoks), sampling was done by use of quadrate in each system with five replications. Plants in each quadrate were counted and <b>species</b> richness of <b>plants</b> was determined.

The goals of this study were to investigate the potential corridor role of ditches and to identify the landscape components that significantly impact patterns of gene flow among remnant populations. Using microsatellite loci, we explored the spatial genetic structure of two hydrochorous wetland plants exhibiting contrasting local abundance and different habitat requirements: the rare and regionally protected Oenanthe aquatica and the more commonly distributed Lycopus europaeus, in an 83 km 2 agricultural lowland located in northern France. Both species exhibited a significant spatial genetic structure, along with substantial levels of genetic differentiation, especially for L. europaeus, whichalso expressed high levels of inbreeding.

The plant-soil (CS) -C- 137 transfer factors varied maximally 12 -fold among soils and 35 -fold among species when grown on the same soil. Single correlations between transfer factors and soil properties were found, but they varied widely with plant type and can hardly {{be used as a}} predictive tool because of the few soils used. The variation of (CS) -C- 137 concentrations in plants among soils was related to differences in soil solution Cs- 137 and K concentrations, consistent with previous observations in hydroponics and pot trials. Absolute values of transfer factors could not be predicted based on a model validated for pot trials. The Cs- 137 activity concentration in soil solution decreased significantly (11 - to 250 -fold) for most soils in the 1997 - 1999 period and is partly explained by decreasing K in soil solution. Transfer factors of lettuce showed both increasing and decreasing trends between 2 consecutive years depending on soil type. The trends could be explained by the variation in Cs- 137 and K concentrations in soil solution. It is concluded that differences in (CS) -C- 137 transfer factors among soils and trends in transfer factors as a function of time can be explained from soil solution composition, as shown previously for pot trials, although absolute values of transfer factors could not be predicted.

Little {{is known about the}} ability of the microlepidoptera to encounter and develop on alternative wild and <b>agricultural</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> These plants could provide refuges and have to be identified for more efficient integrated management strategies. Objectives: In the present study, we assessed under laboratory conditions the ability of T. absoluta to develop on such plant species referred as potential hosts in the literature, including Solanaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Convolvulaceae, Fabaceae, and Malvaceae. Materials and methods: For each plant species, fitness tests were performed in Petri dishes by isolating single individuals with excised leaf. Two choice behavioral assays were performed in flying tunnels. Volatile organic compounds released by solanaceous plants were trapped using a dynamic collection system, and analyzed by GC-MS. Results: We found that Solanum species allowed higher larval survivability and shorter development time (from egg to adult emergency) compared to the other plants. Non-solanaceous plants were not able to sustain T. absoluta larvae. Two choice behavioral assays revealed that adult distribution and female oviposition did not differ between Solanum species, which were preferred to other tested solanaceous plants. The hypothesis that female host plant choice is influenced by plant volatile organic compounds was tested. Solanum volatile profiles showed similarities, and were presenting quantitative and qualitative differences with the other tested solanaceous plants, providing some explanations in the observed behavioral discrimination. Further electrophysiological and behavioral assays are required to confirm the effect of specific chemicals on the choice of the oviposition site in T. absoluta. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Solanum species are the more suitable hosts for T. absoluta development. Other solanaceous plant species could be opportunistically colonized with little incidence but care should be taken in these results as genetic variability in insects and plants, as well as plant physiological state, might {{have an impact on the}} pest survivability...|$|E

Because larval survivability depends on the female‚Äôs oviposition choice, the hypothesis that host plant choice is influenced by plant volatile organic compounds has to be tested. Volatile organic compounds released by solanaceous plants were trapped using a dynamic collection system, and analyzed by GC-MS. Solanum volatile profiles showed similarities, and were presenting quantitative and qualitative differences with the other tested solanaceous plants, providing some explanations in the observed behavioral discrimination. Further electrophysiological and behavioral assays are required to confirm the effect of specific chemicals on the choice of the oviposition site in T. absoluta. It can be concluded that Solanum species are the more suitable hosts for T. absoluta development. Other solanaceous plant species could be opportunistically colonized with little incidence but care should be taken in these results as genetic variability in insects and plants, as well as plant physiological state, might {{have an impact on the}} pest survivability...|$|E
30|$|Mexican Washingtonian trees, Washingtonia robusta, are {{a member}} of the family Arecaceae, which is native to Northwestern Mexico. It is one of the most {{regularly}} planted palm trees around the world as an ornamental plant (Broschat 2018). Although considered a desert palm, it is native to regions having permanent surface or subsurface water (Broschat 2018). A disorder resulting in the death of 4 ‚Äì 5 -year-old W. roubsta palms in a farm north of Al Shehia district, Al Qassim region, Saudi Arabia, was brought to our attention in March 2015. Many fungal species have been reported to cause bud roots in palm trees, including Botryodiplodia, Chalara (Thielaviopsis), Colletotrichum, and Fuasrium. Phytophthora species, oomycetes, also caused various diseases on various palms including seedling blights and damping off, trunk and leaf spots, crown and root rots, blights and petiole rots; nut drop; and apical, bud, or heart rot, followed by plant death (Garofalo and McMillan 1999). About 59 identified species of Phytophthora are known as pathogens causing disease in roots, crowns, stems, leaves, and fruits of a wide range of <b>agricultural</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> (Erwin and Ribeiro 1996). Phytophthora is a soil-borne fungus-like organism from the water mold group (Ho 2018). Phytophthora bud rot is one of the most common diseases detected in palms in wet tropical climates (Garofalo and McMillan 1999). Phytophthora nicotianae (synonym = P. parasitica) has been reported to infect ornamental palms, more than 301 different ornamental plants and vegetable hosts such as onion, Allium cepa; carnation, Dianthus caryophillus; tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum; and poinsettia, uphorbia pulcherrima. It was recently reported to infect dwarf fan palm, Chamaero pshumilis, in Iran and Italy (Faedda et al. 2011 and Nazerian and Mirabolfathi 2013). Several Lysobacter spp. including L. enzymogenes, L. antibioticus, and L. capsici (Hayward et al. 2010) reported to have the potential as one of the biological control agents for plant diseases. 3.1 T 8 and OH 11 strains of L. enzymogenes were very effective in inhibiting the mycelial growth of Phytophthora capsici, Pythium ultimum, Py. aphanidermatum, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium graminearum, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Christensen & Cook, 1978,¬†Folman et al. 2003, Jiang et al. 2005, and Qian et al. 2009).|$|E

Evenness drives {{consistent}} diversity {{effects in}} intensive grassland systems across 28 European sites. Journal of Ecology, 95 (3) pp. 530 - 539 Ecological and agronomic {{research suggests that}} increased crop diversity in species-poor intensive systems may improve their provision of ecosystem services. Such general predictions can have critical importance for worldwide food production and agricultural practice but are largely untested at higher levels of diversity. We propose new methodology for the design and analysis of experiments to quantify diversity-function relationships. Our methodology can quantify the relative strength of inter-specific interactions that contribute to a functional response, and can disentangle the separate contributions of species richness and relative abundance. Applying our methodology to data from a common experiment at 28 European sites, we show that the above-ground biomass of four-species mixtures (two legumes and two grasses) in intensive grassland systems was consistently greater than that expected from monoculture performance, even at high productivity levels. The magnitude of this effect generally resulted in transgressive overyielding. A combined analysis of first-year results across sites showed that the additional performance of mixtures was driven by the number and strength of pairwise inter-specific interactions and the evenness of the community. In general, all pairwise interactions contributed equally to the additional performance of mixtures; the grass-grass and legume-legume interactions were as strong as those between grasses and legumes. The combined analysis across geographical and temporal scales in our study provides a generality of interpretation of our results {{that would not have}} been possible from individual site analyses or experimentation at a single site. Our four-species agricultural grassland communities have proved a simple yet relevant model system for experimentation and development of methodology in diversity-function research.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{considers}} the issues concerning the environmental modeling {{and analysis of}} <b>agricultural</b> and forest <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> grown under different controlled and uncontrolled conditions, with short data samples available. The key approach {{to the analysis of}} such kind of complex systems consists in the decomposition of a modeled system into subsystems with consistently small number of samples. The paper shows the examples of how to analyze individual subsystems and generalize modeling results for different subsystems to the whole system, by utilizing the GMDH advantages and qualitative analysis techniques. Here, the GMDH has been applied to estimate and analyze features of the tree growth dynamics, heavy metals impact on species cultivated near the motor road, etc. The GMDH generates the sets of models with different structures and accuracies thus enabling the identification of the most relevant structures, the analysis of their similarity and the assumptions about input of different factors. In particular, it is shown how a pair of linear models of identical structure describing different subsystems can be compiled into a model that describes a higher-level subsystem. Qualitative analysis techniques give the possibility to analyze behavior of individual subsystems as well as the system in whole...|$|R
