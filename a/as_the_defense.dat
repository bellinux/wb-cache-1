5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he ordered them to continue forward.|$|E

25|$|Between 1942 and 1945 the Luftwaffe had to {{continually}} expend its resources {{to counter the}} Allied strategic bombing campaign against targets deep inside Germany itself. RAF Bomber Command under Sir Arthur Harris had begun bombing German targets in early 1942, but after heavy losses switched to night bombing. The U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF)'s Eighth Air Force eventually joined {{in the autumn of}} 1942 flying daylight missions.

25|$|General Pereda did {{not call}} for elections, despite his promise to do so, and he was overthrown in a bloodless coup in November 1978 by General David Padilla Arancibia (1978–79), who was {{supported}} by the younger institutionalist faction of the military. He saw the main role of the military <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of the country rather than political intervention and announced elections for 1979 without naming an official government candidate. Electoral reforms simplified voter registration, and 90% of the electorate chose among eight presidential candidates in honest elections.|$|E

25|$|The {{system of}} {{government}} in Spain was constituted by a polisynodial system of Councils which advised the monarch and made decisions on his behalf about specific matters of government. In 1524 the Council of the Indies was established. Based in Castile, with the assignment of the governance of the Indies, it was thus responsible for drafting legislation, proposing the appointments to the King and pronouncing judicial sentences; as maximum authority in the ultramarine territories, the Council of The Indies took over both the institutions in the Indies <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> {{of the interests of}} the Crown and of the aborigens.|$|E

25|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm {{beliefs about the}} importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.|$|E
25|$|McMahon {{claimed to}} be {{socially}} moderate. She was pro-choice, and donated to Republican Majority for Choice. She did not support partial birth abortions and favored parental notification laws. McMahon opposed amnesty for illegal immigrants and supported border security.

She personally felt that marriage should be {{between a man and}} a woman, but favored state authority on the issue of same-sex marriage.

25|$|As {{early as}} the end of March, some Americans were leaving the city. For instance, ten {{families}} departed on March 31. Flights out of Saigon, lightly booked under ordinary circumstances, were full. Throughout April the speed of the evacuation increased, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> Attaché’s Office (DAO) began to fly out nonessential personnel. Many Americans attached to the DAO refused to leave without their Vietnamese friends and dependents, who included common-law wives and children. It was illegal for the DAO to move these people to American soil, and this initially slowed down the rate of departure, but eventually the DAO began illegally flying undocumented Vietnamese to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The {{scenario}} changed radically for the Rangers {{with the}} state election of 1873. When newly elected Governor Richard Coke took office in January 1874, it {{marked the end of}} Reconstruction for the Lone Star State, and he vigorously restored order to Texas in pursuit of improvements to both the economy and security. Once again Indians and Mexican bandits were threatening the frontiers, and once again the Rangers were tasked with solving the problem. That same year, the state legislature authorized the recommissioning of the Rangers, and a special force was created within its aegis: the Frontier Battalion, consisting of six companies of 75 men each under the command of Major John B. Jones. This group {{played a major role in}} the control of ordinary lawbreakers as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> against hostile Indian tribes, which was particularly necessary in the period of lawlessness and social collapse of the Reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|The 2002 Buccaneers {{defense is}} widely {{regarded}} as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 1976 Steelers, and few others.

They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43).

25|$|Germany started {{planning}} {{the invasion of}} Switzerland on 25 June 1940, the day France surrendered. At this point the German Army in France consisted of three army groups with two million soldiers in 102 divisions. Switzerland and Liechtenstein were surrounded by Occupied France and the Axis Powers, and so Guisan issued Operationsbefehl Nr. 10, a complete overhaul of existing Swiss defensive plans. The St. Maurice and St. Gotthard Passes {{in the south and}} the Fortress Sargans in the northeast would serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> line. The Alps would be their fortress. The Swiss 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Army Corps were to fight delaying actions at the border, while all who could retreated to the Alpine refuge known as the Réduit national. The population centers were, however, all located in the flat plains of the north. They would have to be left to the Germans in order for the rest to survive.|$|E
25|$|Peter, after abdicating the {{imperial}} crown of Brazil, placed {{himself at the}} head of the Liberal Army (1831) and from the Azores launched an invasion of northern Portugal, Landing at Mindelo, near Oporto which he quickly occupied. But Miguel's army was formidable, composed of the best troops, with dedicated volunteers and enthusiastic militiamen (although not, perhaps, the best senior officers). They easily encircled the city and lay siege to it. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of Oporto persisted, Miguel resolved to visit his troops in April 1833. But in the meantime Lisbon fell into the hands of the Duke of Terceira, who had left Oporto earlier in the Liberal fleet commanded by Charles John Napier, disembarked in the Algarve and marched across the Alentejo to defeat the Miguelist General Teles Jordão (seizing the city on July 24). Napier, after defeating a Miguelist fleet off Cape St. Vincent, joined the Duke of Terceira in the north, taking control of the Tagus.|$|E
