5|$|The June 2011 Christchurch {{earthquake}} was {{a shallow}} magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake that occurred on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST (02:20 UTC). It was centred at <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 6km (3.8mi), about 10km (6mi) from Christchurch, which {{had previously been}} devastated by another magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake in February 2011. The June quake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor that struck the region at a slightly deeper 8.9km (5.5mi). The United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw at <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> about 9km (5.6mi).|$|E
5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded at <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
50|$|Lake Leelanau runs 21 mi {{through the}} middle of the Leelanau Peninsula; it is about 1.5 mi at its widest.

5|$|In 2006 it {{was unclear}} if Beth Israel, which had already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, to <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E
5|$|Silvertip {{sharks are}} found over {{continental}} and insular shelves at <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> , occupying {{all levels of}} the water column. They are most common around isolated islands, coral banks, and reef drop-offs. Juveniles frequent coastal shallows or lagoons, while adults occur in deeper water, with little overlap between the two age groups.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of these}} lava flows blocked rivers and streams, {{impounding}} small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000years ago, basalt from the largest cinder cone in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area. The lava traveled into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes {{to the south}} and accumulated to <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> over 400ft (122m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day ghost town of Grafton, Utah. Water impounded behind the two blockages, forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.|$|E
5|$|The SS192 was {{discontinued}} in late 2004. It used a 1.8g (28grain) {{hollow point}} bullet with a copper jacket and an aluminum core. The projectile had {{a length of}} 21.6mm (.85in). It had an unmarked hollow nose with <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 7.6mm (0.3in) and a 0.8-mm (0.03in) opening. The SS192 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level IIIA vest when fired from the Five-seven.|$|E
5|$|The {{next stage}} of Bath Deep Lock is {{numbered}} 8/9 as two locks were combined when the canal was restored in 1976. The new chamber has <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> , making it Britain's deepest canal lock.

5|$|The use of pure oxygen for {{accelerated}} decompression {{is limited}} by oxygen toxicity. In open circuit scuba the upper limit for oxygen partial pressure is generally accepted as 1.6 bar, equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 6msw (metres of sea water), but in-water and surface decompression at higher partial pressures is routinely used in surface supplied diving operation, both by the military and civilian contractors, as the consequences of CNS oxygen toxicity are considerably reduced when the diver has a secure breathing gas supply.|$|E
5|$|Uniquely, Ciomadul is a {{still alive}} volcano in Eastern Europe and its craters have a {{youthful}} appearance. There {{is always the}} possibility of renewed volcanic activity if the magma chamber has not solidified. Deep earthquake activity at Ciomadul occurs down to <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> , indicating that the volcanic system between the magma chamber and lithospheric melts is still active. It {{is considered to be}} a potentially active volcano.|$|E
5|$|When powdery, snow drifts {{with the}} wind from the {{location}} where it originally fell, forming deposits with <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> several meters in isolated locations. After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} from <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> , the blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only a few meters deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed. Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the bull shark (C.leucas). At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves when the water rises. There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory.|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
