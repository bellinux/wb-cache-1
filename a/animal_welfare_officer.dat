40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion proposes toolboxes of welfare indicators for developing monitoring procedures at slaughterhouses for bovines stunned with penetrative captive bolt or slaughtered without stunning. In particular, the opinion proposes welfare indicators {{together with their}} corresponding outcomes of consciousness, unconsciousness or death. In the case of slaughter with captive bolt stunning, the opinion proposes a toolbox of indicators and the outcomes {{to be used to}} assess consciousness in bovine animals at three key stages of monitoring: (a) after stunning and during shackling and hoisting; (b) during neck cutting or sticking; and (c) during bleeding. For slaughter of bovines without stunning, a set of indicators and outcomes are proposed in another toolbox to be used for (a) assessing unconsciousness, before releasing bovines from restraint; and (b) confirming death before carcass dressing begins. Various activities—including a systematic literature review, an online survey and stakeholders’ and hearing experts’ meetings—were conducted to gather information about the specificity, sensitivity and feasibility of the indicators that can be included in the toolboxes. The frequency of checking differs according to the role of each person responsible for ensuring animal welfare. Personnel performing stunning, shackling, hoisting and/or bleeding will have to check all the animals and confirm that they are not conscious following stunning or before release from the restraint. For the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>officer,</b> who has the overall responsibility for animal welfare, a mathematical model for the sampling protocols is proposed, giving some allowance to set the sample size of animals that he/she needs to check at a given throughput rate (total number of animals slaughtered in the slaughterhouse) and tolerance level (number of potential failures). Finally, different risk factors and scenarios are proposed to define a ‘normal’ or a ‘reinforced’ monitoring protocol, according {{to the needs of the}} slaughterhouse...|$|E
40|$|Implementation of the 3 Rs (Replacement, Refinement and Reduction) {{in animal}} studies {{is a legal}} {{requirement}} in many countries. In The Netherlands, animal welfare officers (AWOs) are appointed to monitor the welfare of laboratory animals. As part of this task, AWOs give advice to researchers and can therefore have an influential role in implementing 3 R methods in research. A national survey was conducted to gain more insight into how Dutch AWOs obtain and apply 3 R information in their daily work. Nearly half of the AWO population filled out the questionnaire (15 / 32; {{a response rate of}} 46. 9 %). Two-thirds of the respondents pointed out that finding 3 R information is not an easy task {{and more than half of}} the respondents believed that information on possibi-lities to implement the 3 Rs is regularly being missed. The respondents indicated that most 3 R information is obtained directly from colleagues and other AWOs. Special online 3 R databases are rarely used. All the responding AWOs feel that they contribute to Refinement (15 / 15), nearly one-third of the respondents feel they contribute to Reduction (4 / 15), and one AWO feels he/she contributes to Replacement (1 / 15). According to the respondents, better exchange of knowledge can contribute to more successful implementation of the 3 Rs. How this knowledge exchange can best be established and facilitated needs further exploration. To this end, the authors make suggestions for a 3 R-integrated evidence-based approach.

40|$|Objectives Although {{theoretical}} conceptualisations {{of animal}} hoarding have been published, few empirical {{studies have been}} conducted. The current study investigated animal hoarding {{from the perspectives of}} professionals who come into contact with people who hoard animals through their employment in various capacities, primarily in animal welfare. Design A qualitative research design was employed using inductive thematic analysis. Methods Twelve professionals who had experience working in animal hoarding were interviewed. Participants’ professions included: mental health nurse, vet, animal behaviour consultant, animal inspector, animal warden and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>officer.</b> Participants reported working in a diverse range of locations across the UK. Semi-structured interviews were conducted either in person or over the telephone. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim before analysis. Results Animal hoarding was conceptualised primarily by the presence of multiple animal neglect or suffering. The term ‘animal hoarding’ was used by participants to reflect those who are neglecting animals unintentionally, living in squalor, self-neglecting, experiencing distress or mental health problems, and using animals as a replacement for people. Animal hoarding appears to be maintained or repeated despite interventions from animal professionals, possibly because the human aspects of this issue are currently overlooked. Conclusions Better understanding and education, particularly on the human aspects of animal hoarding, are needed for both professionals and the public. Joint working and greater communication is needed in both directions between animal professionals and those working in mental health and social services. Practitioner Points • The findings suggest that animal hoarding should be given much greater attention, both clinically and in research, within the field of psychology. • There are social and mental health aspects of animal hoarding which are inadequately addressed by professionals in the UK currently. Animal professionals should be aware of psychological and social issues such as the mental capacity of individuals to make decisions about their animals. Social and psychological interventions should be offered to engage people who are hoarding animals, safeguard people living in animal hoarding situations, address social isolation or support network issues, relieve psychological distress from comorbid mental health problems, increase insight, and instigate behaviour change. • The current study is limited by the representation of only professional perspectives on animal hoarding. The perspectives of animal hoarders and their families are not represented. • There was a majority of animal professionals compared with mental health professionals interviewed in the current study which may have caused a paucity of information on the social and mental health aspects of animal hoarding and professional responses to this...|$|E
40|$|Within {{many areas}} of {{medicine}} and science animal experiments are seen as indispensable, however ethically not unproblematic {{by the majority of}} the general public. In Germany these experiments are subject to notification or licensing. In Great Britain regulated procedures must also be licensed. In both countries, the compliance with legal rules and regulations as well as with licensing terms and conditions must be guaranteed through appropriate forms of supervision and control. The present study examines German regulations and their practical implementations in view of a forthcoming amendment of German animal welfare legislation, resulting from changes in the German constitution of 2002. Comparisons with Great Britain might show further potential for improvement for German procedures. To include all relevant aspects, the legal situation of both countries, literature searches, as well as results from a study via questionnaire are being evaluated. Regarding the countries’ legal situation {{it must be noted that}} Germany and Great Britain both share the same legal foundations due to both of them being members of the European Union. However, legal implementation differs between the two countries. In Germany, supervision of animal experiments and of laboratory animals husbandry is being dealt with according to regional law: in four federal states a regional licensing authority and in further twelve states the Veterinäramt (veterinary department) are responsible. In comparison, in Great Britain official supervision is centrally organised and subdivided between two departments within the Home Office: Animal Scientific Procedures Division and Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. Internal control is required explicitly in the German Tierschutzgesetz (Animal Welfare Act). Every establishment carrying out experiments on vertebrates must appoint a Tierschutzbeauftragter (<b>Animal</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Officer)</b> who among other duties must take care of the compliance with rules and regulations as well as with terms and conditions in the interest of animal welfare. An obligation for internal control as comprehensive as this does not exist in the British Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. As an element of internal control the local Ethical Review Process of the establishment should, among other things, allow for retrospective project reviews. Furthermore, some of its members like the Named Animal Care & Welfare Officer, the Named Veterinary Surgeon and the project licence holder have additional duties and powers in the interest of internal supervision of regulated procedures. To fulfil their supervision roles there are various possibilities available to the authorities. Visits represent the most important official supervision method and are to be used as often as possible in both Germany and Great Britain. In Germany however, these and other official supervision methods are highly limited by an unsatisfactory staff situation (on average one visit per establishment and year compared with an average of eleven visits per designated establishment and year in Great Britain). In Great Britain a similar number of announced and unannounced visits take place, whereas in Germany unannounced visits are rare. Unannounced visits have the advantage of allowing an insight into everyday routine, but bare the risk that important contact people are unavailable or no experiment currently takes place. Whilst qualification of the supervising staff in Great Britain is no cause for discussion, in Germany it is criticised particularly when delegated to the Veterinärämter. Furthermore, the partly divided responsibility for licensing and supervision or for differing supervision methods and non-uniform nation-wide enforcement in Germany are subject to serious criticism. The necessity for effective supervision is shown clearly by the variety of infringements described. In Germany as in Great Britain, mild consequences such as further instructions or letters of admonition dominate. Although tougher sanctions such as fines or imprisonment are legally possible in both countries, they are rarely imposed. Regarding internal supervision too, on-site controls are viewed as particularly helpful but in Germany as well as in Great Britain are conducted only in a small portion of all animal experiments taking place. Additionally, retrospective project reviews can make a positive contribution to laboratory animal welfare. They are a required method of control in Great Britain and therefore are used regularly, whilst in Germany so far they are applied considerably less often. For the Tierschutzbeauftragter as well as for the Ethical Review Process and its members it is necessary to be supported by the establishment. Although the personnel reviewed in both countries mainly expressed satisfaction with their access to project licence holders, personal licence holders and certificate holders and did not need to reckon with negative consequences for themselves when voicing criticism, German discrimination prohibition for the Tierschutzbeauftragter obviously is not always met and criticism and suggestions in Great Britain are not always taken into account. However, as it has turned out the supervisors’ personal commitment plays an important role, too. Involving the authorities in cases of serious or on-going infringements seems to be seen as a breach of the use of official channels by the Tierschutzbeauftragte reviewed. In comparison, in Great Britain there seem to be no misgivings regarding this. Thus, it can be noted that in Germany internal supervision and control is handled very differently depending on each establishment and its Tierschutzbeauftragter, whereas in Great Britain it is insufficiently regulated and therefore can be regarded as moderately efficient. On the basis of the data, information and findings collected in this study, the nation-wide responsibility of the licensing authorities also for the supervision of projects licensed by them can be recommended for Germany particularly regarding professional competence. Establishments conducting regulated procedures should be visited by the authority considerably more often, at least twice yearly, with as many unannounced as announced visits. For this it is necessary to provide more staff to the authorities responsible. During those visits the authority representatives of both countries should watch the conduction of animal experiments more often to assess the practical abilities of those performing them. In cases of repeated or serious infringements, considerably tougher action with use of those legal instruments available is necessary. To provide effective internal supervision or control by the Tierschutzbeauftragter, his authority to issue directives as legally granted to him, his support by the establishment as well as his personal commitment regarding his regular presence in the laboratories and at experiments taking place must be assured. In Great Britain, however, a comprehensive legal obligation for further control would need to be considered to provide effective internal supervision. Overall it can be noted that regarding supervision and control of regulated procedures there seems to be potential for improvement in both Germany and Great Britain. Germany’s federally structured official supervision seems to be less efficient than the centrally organised supervision by the British Home Office. However, some arguments seem to suggest that compulsory German Tierschutzbeauftragte, despite potential for improvement, can achieve a higher level of efficiency than Great Britain’s Ethical Review Processes...|$|E

40|$|The Swedish <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> law {{was written}} in 1988. The law’s purpose {{is to ensure that}} animals are managed in a {{suitable}} way and protect them from unnecessary suffering. Every year there are several cases of offenses concerning mistreatment of animals. The aim {{of this study was to}} do a compilation of <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> judgements from the year 2013 to 2016. The aim was also to investigate which paragraphs were violated, which consequences were most common and which animal species was most common in <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> judgements. 614 cases were reviewed and 447 of these were used in the results. The results shows that the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> law is the most common one to violate in cases of animal offense. The paragraph most commonly violated is the one concerning animal abuse. The most common consequence when violating the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation is heavy fines. Dogs are most frequently abused compared to other species according to the results. The reason people violate the legislation could be ignorance or that the legislation could be misinterpreted. Another reason could be people’s different view on animals. Heavy fines are the most common consequence of a violation because in order to receive a higher punishment it requires a graver violation. The study and research shows that in order to get sentenced to prison you need a background of committing other crimes not related to <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation. Some explanations for the result, according to scientific studies, could be that the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation needs to be clarified, a lack of knowledge about animals, how people see and value animals, a criminal past or which animals people encounter more frequently.

Thus {{it is not}} practicable to provide explicit specific advice as to what pet would best suit an individual elderly owner.

40|$|On {{the first}} January 2009 the {{official}} <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> control were {{transferred from the}} municipalities to the County Administrative board. With this transition, some changes occurred for those who work as <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors. The aim {{for this study was}} to examine farmers' view on the transition between the municipalities and County Administrative board, in order to compare the two authorities. I have also studied the farmers view about <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors' knowledge, both theoretical and practical. The questionnaire also included questions about farmers' view on <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation. I choose to interview farmers from various places in Dalecarlia County, so that I would get all the municipalities represented. The questionnaire was sent to 40 farmers, which 26 chose to participate in my survey. The results of my questionnaire showed a lack of introduction to the farmer, 38 percent of the farmers received no initial information. 62 percent of the farmers did not want <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls to be pre-notified. The overall opinion of the farmers was that they always should take care of their animals well, therefore they do not need <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls to be pre-notified. The County Administrative welfare inspector was considered to have a better knowledge than the municipality's <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector had, although the difference was barely noticeable with 22 to 21 pleased farmers. Farmers were also pleased with <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector’s practical experience, 50 percent were pleased with the municipality´s <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector and 58 percent were pleased with the County Administrative <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector. Overall, the farmers were very satisfied with the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector’s ways to deal with <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls. Twice as many indicated that they were dissatisfied with the municipality´s <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector than the County Administrative welfare inspector; as they do not take into account the farmers' thoughts and opinions. 81 percent of the farmers were satisfied with the County Administrative <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors work because they considered the farmer's thoughts and opinions. One of my questions was how the farmers perceived the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation. Half of the farmers responded that they had knowledge of the legislation surrounding their species. In my study, 18 out of the 26 farmers perceive that the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation is at an acceptable level. About half of the farmers had suggestions on how contact between farmers and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector could be done better. Opinions emerged suggesting that the farmers want to have a closer contact with <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors to promote prevention before major flaws were noticed...|$|R
