[...] Riders must pass through a metal {{detector}} in order to board, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> allowed to board the ride with any items in pockets. In each of the queue lines, there are several large screen displays that explain how to pick a song to play during the ride and important safety instructions. In the video, characters called [...] "Video DJ's" [...] are used as demonstrators to provide a visual explanation.|$|E
500|$|In May 1943, Phleps became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} his Italian allies to cooperate with German operations, which was demonstrated in his reputation for forthright speech. During a meeting with his Italian counterpart in Podgorica, Montenegro, Phleps called the Italian corps commander General Ercole Roncaglia a [...] "lazy macaroni". Phleps scolded his Wehrmacht interpreter, Leutnant Kurt Waldheim for toning down Phleps' language, saying, [...] "Listen Waldheim, I know some Italian <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> translating what I am telling this so-and-so". On another occasion, Phleps threatened to shoot Italian sentries who were delaying his passage through a checkpoint. On 15 May 1943, Phleps handed over command of the division to SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS Karl von Oberkamp.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 August, Basayev {{challenged}} Vladimir Putin to {{a personal}} duel, saying [...] "The choice of weapon we leave to you. I am not the best sportsman <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> invalid. So do agree. It will be more useful and more economical to both our peoples, {{and for the rest}} of mankind." [...] There was no official response from Putin.|$|E

And Mr. Armsworth has the money--every farthing--and the gold:--he has had it these two years!--I would give you the belt myself; and now I have done it, and the snake is unclasped from my heart at last, at last, at last!" ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{significant}} amount of the correspondence between Fronto and Marcus has survived. The pair were very close. [...] "Farewell my Fronto, wherever you are, my most sweet love and delight. How is it between you and me? I love you <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> here." [...] Marcus spent time with Fronto's wife and daughter, both named Cratia, and they enjoyed light conversation. He wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature, he would learn [...] "from the lips of Fronto". His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, {{he seems to be}} an almost constant invalid, always suffering—about one quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses. Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, [...] "of my own accord with every kind of discomfort".|$|E
2500|$|In 1282 Louis's eldest brother, Thomas, died, and in {{the summer}} of 1283 his mother followed. This {{provoked}} a succession crisis, since the ruling count of Savoy, Philip, had no sons, and the sons of Thomas, thitherto his heir, were too young to hold the reins of government. In accordance with tradition, Amadeus was recognised as Philip's heir. Louis was promised an apanage, which he did not find sufficient, and the later Savoyard chroniclers Jehan Servion and Jean d'Oronville portray him as fighting his brother for the succession or for a larger share of the inheritance while their uncle was dying. Servion puts into Philip's mouth the following denunciation of Louis's motives, before he gathered together his barons and made them recognise Amadeus as his successor: [...] "I have bestowed upon you more of my possessions than you deserve, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> in the least grateful. I know you well, for it is always you who complain of things. Your whole being is full of clamor, which makes you unwilling to hold to my will and commandment." [...] It is more probable that [...] "Louis felt inadequately rewarded for his efforts in the wars against the emperor and the dauphin in 1282–84", than that he was a person [...] "full of clamor".|$|E
2500|$|Iorga's {{tolerance}} {{for the national}} bias in historiography and his own political profile were complemented {{in the field of}} literature and the arts by his strong belief in didacticism. Art's mission was, in his view, to educate and empower the Romanian peasant. The rejection of art for art's sake, whose indifference in front of nationality issues enraged the historian, was notably illustrated by his 1902 letter to the like-minded Luceafărul editors, which stated: [...] "You gentlemen should not allow aesthetic preoccupations to play the decisive part, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> granted such circumstances as to dedicate yourselves to pure art.... Do not imitate..., do not allow yourselves to be tempted by things you have read elsewhere. Write about things from your country and about the Romanian soul therein." [...] His ambition was to contribute an alternative to Junimist literary history, and, according to comparatist John Neubauer, for the first time integrate [...] "the various Romanian texts and writers into a grand narrative of an organic and spontaneous growth of native creativity, based on local tradition and folklore." [...] Iorga described painter Nicolae Grigorescu as the purveyor of national pride, and was enthusiastic about Stoica D., the war artist. He recommended artists to study handicrafts, even though, an adversary of the pastiche, he strongly objected to Brâncovenesc revival style taken up by his generation. His own monographs on Romanian art and folklore, admired in their time by art historian Gheorghe Oprescu, were later rated by ethologist Romulus Vulcănescu a sample of microhistory, rather than a groundbreaking new research.|$|E
