5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was {{to find out how}} people with <b>a</b> {{moderate}} <b>mental</b> disorder experience sexuality.

The research showed that people with <b>a</b> moderate <b>mental</b> disorder find sexuality important; however, sexuality is rarely discussed, neither with people with <b>a</b> moderate <b>mental</b> disorder nor with their parents, professionals who work with them or in society in general. People with <b>a</b> moderate <b>mental</b> disorder need constant education about sexuality. They wish to be touched and kissed and they feel attracted to the opposite sex.
