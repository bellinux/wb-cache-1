40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is {{research}} and development concerning a fatigue tester of shock <b>absorber</b> <b>seal</b> systems. Design/methodology/approach: Analytical approach {{has been applied to}} get an understanding of a heat exchange process. The mathematical model has been formulated and validated based on the available measurements. Numerical simulation has been carried out to illustrate a heat exchange process performance. Findings: It is possible to control a seal temperature and mechanical friction related to the rod movement into the seal at the specified velocity. The model accuracy is sufficient to perform sensitivity analysis and optimize the design. Research limitations/implications: The components of a fatigue tester have to withstand the significant temperature differences in the range  30; + 140 ˚C, e. g. hydraulic hoses, fittings, and pumps. Practical implications: We combine the analytical and experimental approach to provide customized and reliable engineering solution in the area of damper component seal development. A typical seal has a lip-like design protecting the moving parts against the leakage. It can be tested in a shock absorber or externally with use of a customized test rigs. Seal tests inside a shock absorber have numerous disadvantages. A shock absorber temperature rises during longer tests and cooling phase is required. This dramatically increases tests duration performed with the use of an expensive general-purpose hydraulic testing machinery. A compressed air or water jacket is used to accelerate the cooling process. Nevertheless, there are limitations related to the physics behind the cooling process. A seal component fatigue tester allows to perform the seal component tests out of the shock absorber. Originality/value: A new testing method provides possibility to quantify the main contributors of seal usage...|$|E
50|$|Dubonnet {{suspension}} was {{a system}} of trailing arm independent front suspension and steering popular mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. Not very durable unless exactingly maintained, it was soon replaced by other versions. It consisted of a rigidly mounted axle beam in which the sprung steering and suspension arms pivoted around kingpins mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle. The wheels themselves were mounted onto stub axles, suspended from the kingpins. The system featured an encased coil spring and shock <b>absorber,</b> which <b>sealed</b> in the oil needed to lubricate and protect the suspension parts. This was also the weakness of the layout, as any leaks would have negative effects on ride and durability.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a preliminary optical assessment of the external compound parabolic concentrator (XCPC) component in three concentrating solar thermal units. Each solar thermal unit consists an optical element (the non-imaging concentrating reflector) and a thermal element (the evacuated glass tube solar absorber). The three concentrating solar thermal units discussed in this work are DEWAR 58, a direct flow all-glass dewar, DEWAR 47 an indirect flow all-glass dewar filled with thermal fluid and JIANG TUBE, a metal <b>absorber</b> with glass-to-metal <b>seal.</b> From the performance results, {{we will be able}} to determine the optical efficiency of the XCPC reflectors as well as the concentration ratio for radiation being transferred from the sun onto each of the three solar thermal collectors...|$|R
50|$|The SRF rules {{dictate that}} no {{performance}} enhancing modifications other than suspension adjustments within described parameters {{can be made}} to the car. This effectively eliminates the never-ending need for design enhancements and associated large cash outlays necessary in other classes of racecars to remain competitive and puts the focus on driver skill, rather than financial and technical investment. Every Spec Racer Ford weighs the same using ballast that can accommodate drivers who weigh up to roughly 260 pounds, uses the same engine, the same transmission, the same fiberglass body, the same chassis, even the same tires. The idea is that all of the cars are meant to have identical performance, so {{the only way to go}} faster is to be a better driver. The SRF's engine, transmission, and shock <b>absorbers</b> are <b>sealed</b> with tamper-proof devices that make it impossible to modify these components undetected. In addition, many parts of the car, including suspension arms, fiberglass, and sheet metal are marked for compliance checking with special holographic tamper-evident stickers bearing the Spec Racer Ford logo. SCCA Enterprises periodically deploys compliance officials to conduct surprise inspections of Spec Racer Fords at SCCA Major, SCCA Regional and SCCA Pro Racing events across the US.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a novel resonance absorber is described. The vibrating elements of the "membrane absorber" are the perforation membrane, the air plug in the hole, the impermeable covering membrane with the air cushion enclosed in the chamber behind functioning as a spring. This complex resonator does not require any additional absorbing material to achieve a broad-band effect {{in the range of}} medium and low frequencies. Since the membrane <b>absorber</b> is hermetically <b>sealed</b> all around against its environment and has completely smooth outer surfaces, it is especially suitable for application in fields where high demands on hygiene conditions and fire protection, low frictional losses and small volume and weight are important. Silencer splitters completely made of stainless steel are described as an example for the application of the membrane absorber under harsh conditions in coal mines and air cleaning devices for industrial plants...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of an ongoing applied {{research}} project at the Solar Energy Laboratory at UC Merced, with the objective of developing a solar thermal system able to increase the temperature of a heat transfer fluid to output temperatures around 200 °C(∼ 400 °F). The goal of this project is to design and implement a modular, low profile, scalable and solar-powered system to offer an on-site heat source. Operating temperatures on the target range of this project create the possibility of providing a renewable source of heat to a number of thermally activated technologies such as refrigeration, air-conditioning, power generation, desalination, water treatment and others. This thesis presents three heat transfer models that were built to conduct a preliminary performance assessment of three concentrating solar thermal units. Each solar thermal unit is comprised of an optical concentrator and a thermal element. The optical element is a non-imaging, reflective concentrator in the family of the compound parabolic concentrators (CPC). The thermal element includes a solar radiation absorber that transfers heat to a fluid, and an evacuated glass tube that encloses the absorber. The three concentrating solar thermal units discussed in this work are: • Type I: All Glass Dewar: Direct Flow. • Type II: All Glass Dewar: Indirect Flow. • Type III: Metal <b>Absorber</b> with Glass-to-Metal <b>Seal.</b> The solar thermal system would be integrated by thermal units connected in series to gradually increase the temperature of the fluid. The optical analysis was carried out by other authors but some relevant results to the thermal analysis are presented in this work...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} absorb a large {{reflected}} power from RF cavities, {{we have developed}} CW high power water-loads {{for the use of}} KEKB. The loads can absorb a CW power of up to ~ 1. 2 MW and an operational frequency range is 508. 9 ± 5 MHz. They are filled with water as an RF <b>absorber,</b> which is <b>sealed</b> with an RF window made of alumina ceramics. We have developed two types of water-loads: one is a rectangular waveguide made of a stainless steel, and the other a cylindrical tank made of aluminum. We made the high power test of all the loads at KEK when they were delivered. A load absorbed a maximum power of ~ 1. 1 MW. We also measured RF properties of tap water using a network analyzer with a dielectric probe. Cooling water as an RF power absorber is circulated with a pump and exchanges heat with facility cooling water using a heat exchanger at each power-supply room of KEKB. The heat exchange systems for LER have been built for KEKB, while those for HER are the reuse of TRISTAN components. The flow rate of the LER heat exchanger is 1, 200 l/min and the allowable temperature rise of water is ~ 23 ˚C. Power handling capability of the heat exchanger is about 1. 8 MW, which is well over a maximum reflected power from four cavities. The flow rate and the temperature rise of the HER heat exchanger are about 1, 500 l/min and 25 ˚C respectively. At an early stage of the KEKB operation, we used the tap water as an absorber material for its high absorption rate and easy handing. We found out later that an inside surface of the aluminum tank suffered corrosion by interaction with impurities in the water. We changed the cooling water for the cylindrical tank type from the tap water to the deionized water, while the waveguide-type load made of stainless steel still uses tap water. ...|$|R
40|$|Rubber-like {{polymers}} {{find many}} uses in industrial applications. Examples are shock <b>absorbers,</b> rubber bearings, <b>seals</b> or tires to name only a few. The {{objective of this}} work is to present an extensive overview about the theoretical and numerical modelling of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of such materials. The proposed continuum mechanical formulation is motivated on the micro level by the transient network theory. This concept relies on the observation that the molecular chains of the polymer network are steadily breaking and reforming. The reformation {{takes place in the}} stress-free state. From {{the point of view of}} continuum mechanics, the idea of the transient network theory can be described with the notion of elastic isomorphism. In this way, one arrives at a new model of finite viscoelasticity, which does not need further assumptions besides the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient being a direct result of the concept of isomorphism. A main aspect of the modelling of the thermo-mechanical coupling is the temperature dependence of the mechanical material parameters. In the case of a non-linear function, the derivation of the Helmholtz free energy must be based on a deformation-dependent heat capacity, if one strives for thermodynamical consistency. Further important is the fact that the dissipation process in rubber-like polymers is mainly controlled by the loading velocity. This is in contrast to the behaviour of metals where the influence of the inelastic deformation dominates this process. The computation of the inelastic deformation is achieved via the local integration of a differential equation of first order in time. The analogy to finite elasto-plasticity can be exploited to develop a numerically efficient implicit integration scheme based on the exponential mapping. Since this integration scheme does not allow the construction of a time-adaptive method, simple backward Euler integration is applied when automatic time stepping becomes necessary. In order to avoid the undesirable effect of locking, a new finite element technology is derived for the spatial discretization of the balance equations. The new formulation shows an outstanding computational efficiency which manifests itself especially in the case of thermo-mechanically strongly coupled problems, where the computational effort at the element level plays a rather importnat role. Another advantage of these elements is their robustness with respect to large mesh distortions. In the final part of the work, the material parameters are fitted to experimental results available in the literature. It follows a detailed investigation of various thermo-mechanical coupling phenomena at the example of cyclic shear. The theoretical and computational modelling proposed in this work is finally validated by means of practically relevant applications. (orig.)
