5|$|The wildebeests, {{also called}} gnus, are a genus of antelopes, {{scientific}} name Connochaetes. They {{belong to the}} family Bovidae, which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep and other even-toed horned ungulates. Connochaetes includes two species, both native to Africa: the black wildebeest, or white-tailed gnu (C. gnou); and the blue wildebeest, or brindled gnu (C. taurinus). Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black wildebeest changed more in order to adapt to its open grassland habitat in the south. The most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> their horns are oriented.|$|E

25|$|The strict {{constructive}} ordering {{that had}} become so pronounced in Metzinger's pre-1920 Cubist works continued throughout the subsequent decades, in the careful positioning of form, color, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which Metzinger delicately assimilates the union of figure and background, of light and shadow. This {{can be seen in}} many figures: From the division (in two) of the model's features emerges a subtle profile view—resulting from a free and mobile perspective used by Metzinger to some extent as early as 1908 to constitute the image of a whole—one that includes the fourth dimension.|$|E
25|$|Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw {{objects as}} {{perceived}} within an environment {{according to all}} of their elements taken together as a global construct.

25|$|Lead guitarist Jerry Garcia {{was often}} viewed {{both by the}} public and the media as the leader or primary {{spokesperson}} for the Grateful Dead, but was reluctant to be perceived that way, especially since he and the other group members saw themselves as equal participants and contributors to their collective musical and creative output. Garcia, a native of San Francisco, grew up in the Excelsior District.

25|$|In September 2007, Steven {{returns and}} begins {{stalking}} Ian, {{pretending to be}} Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death.

25|$|Kracht's 2012 novel Imperium follows on from Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten both in {{its very}} {{favourable}} reception by critics <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that it presents a reimagining of history that incorporates actual persons and historical reality while playing {{fast and loose with}} dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to Die Vermessung der Welt (Measuring the World) by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of Imperium. The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocoivores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt's history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht's novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the omniscient narrator informs us of the protagonist's thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt's life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history.|$|E

25|$|A major {{influence}} on modern spirituality was the Theosophical Society, which searched for 'secret teachings' in Asian religions. It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably Neo-Vedanta, {{the revival of}} Theravada Buddhism, and Buddhist modernism, which have taken over modern western notions of personal experience and universalism <b>and</b> integrated them <b>in</b> their religious concepts. A second, related influence was Anthroposophy, whose founder, Rudolf Steiner, was particularly interested in developing a genuine Western spirituality, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that such a spirituality could transform practical institutions such as education, agriculture, and medicine.|$|R
500|$|... "Melt Away" [...] was a song Carey {{produced}} on her own, and co-wrote with Babyface. The song's writing and production were [...] "superb". with each verse gliding into its chorus. According to Chris Nickson, [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] was as [...] "strong as any slow jam {{released in the}} nineties, and one that would {{find a lot of}} flavor late at night with dancers." [...] Another song that brought back reminders of older decades was [...] "Forever". The throwback was featured through the chord changes <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the guitar arpeggios [...] "stayed {{at the forefront of the}} music." [...] The song displayed subtle vocals from Carey, as well as an undeniable richness. [...] "Daydream Interlude (Sweet Fantasy Dub Mix)" [...] was one of the liveliest tracks on the album. The song was a club remix of [...] "Fantasy", which was tuned and remixed by famed house music producer David Morales. The song was directed to be a dance-club song, further broadening Carey's [...] "musical horizon". The song incorporated Carey's vocals, and added them to a thumping house beat, something he would do for many of her future singles. [...] "Looking In" [...] was the final song on the album.

2500|$|A second {{generation}} of bluegrass musicians began performing, composing and recording in the mid-to late-1960s, although many had played in first–generation bands from a young age. Some bluegrass musicians in this group are Jimmy Martin, Doc Watson, J. D. Crowe, Doyle Lawson, Sam Bush, Béla Fleck, John Hartford, Jerry Douglas, Norman Blake, Frank Wakefield, Bill Keith, Del McCoury and Tony Rice. As they refined their craft, the New Grass Revival, Seldom Scene, The Kentucky Colonels, and The Dillards developed progressive bluegrass. In one collaboration, first-generation bluegrass fiddler Vassar Clements, progressive mandolin player David Grisman, Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia (on banjo), and Peter Rowan on lead vocals played in the band called Old <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way.</b> Garcia, Chris Hillman, Dickey Betts of The Allman Brothers Band {{and others in the}} 1960s and 1970s helped introduce rock music listeners to progressive and traditional bluegrass.

2500|$|In 1756, the House of Commons {{resolved}} {{that all}} children offered should be received, that local receiving places should be appointed all over the country, and that the funds should be publicly guaranteed. A basket was accordingly hung outside the hospital; the maximum age for admission was raised from two months to twelve, and a flood of children poured in from country workhouses. In less than four years 14,934 children were presented, and a vile trade grew up among vagrants, who sometimes became known as [...] "Coram Men", of promising to carry children from {{the country to the}} hospital, an undertaking which they often did not perform or performed with great cruelty. Of these 15,000, only 4,400 survived to be apprenticed out. The total expense was about £500,000, which alarmed the House of Commons. After throwing out a bill which proposed to raise the necessary funds by fees from a general system of parochial registration, they {{came to the conclusion that}} the indiscriminate admission should be discontinued. The hospital, being thus thrown on its own resources, adopted a system of receiving children only with considerable sums (e.g., £100), which sometimes led to the children being reclaimed by the parent. This practice was finally stopped in 1801; and it henceforth became a fundamental rule that no money was to be received. The committee of inquiry had to be satisfied of the previous good character and present necessity of the mother, and that the father of the child had deserted both mother and child, and that the reception of the child would probably replace the mother in the course of virtue <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of an honest livelihood. At that time, illegitimacy carried deep stigma, especially for the mother but also for the child. All the children at the Foundling Hospital were those of unmarried women, and they were all first children of their mothers. The principle was in fact that laid down by Henry Fielding in The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling: [...] "Too true I am afraid it is that many women have become abandoned and have sunk to the last degree of vice [...] by being unable to retrieve the first slip." ...|$|E
