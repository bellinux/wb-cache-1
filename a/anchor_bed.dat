40|$|The {{subject of}} the present thesis is the {{development}} of a finite element technique for the design-accompanying simulation of the centric pull-out behaviour of load-controlled expansion anchors in uncracked unreinforced concrete, with the aim of obtaining specific suggestions for the optimization of the anchor design. The simulation is restricted to the determination of anchor loading and the interaction between the steel anchor and the concrete. It is thereby possible to regard the concrete as a nonlinear support of the anchor. Those failure modes depending exclusively upon the fracture mechanical material behaviour of the concrete, namely concrete pull-out and concrete splitting, are not taken into consideration. A crucial point in this thesis is the definition of the geometric and material two-zones bedding model, capable of reproducing both, the near-field and the far-field influence of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bedding.</b> The bedding model is based on experimentally determined material behaviour of concrete, as well as analytical estimates with elementary mechanical elasto-plastic models. A phenomenological isotropic elastic-plastic constitutive law for finite deformations according to Drucker and Prager is derived in order to describe the material behaviour in the two bedding zones of the finite element model. The function of expansion anchors is influenced significantly by the elasto-mechanical contact with friction between the cone and the shell as well as between the shell and the concrete. Various solution methods for the nonlinear contact formulation (penalty-method, lagrangian-method) are investigated with respect to their suitability. The evaluation of experimental results and the presented layered friction model for the complex friction behaviour of steel/concrete show that the friction in the two contact surfaces can be described by a Coulomb friction law. In addition, the layered friction model also supplies an important aid for the selection of the friction coefficient. Finally, the presented simulation technique and the analytical calculation models are verified using selected phenomena and experimental results. (orig.)

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the fixation with cement or by increasing the screw diameter in injured osseous environment a new screw concept was tested. Firstly the topology of the shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators was optimized using a parameter study. The resulting concept represents a compromise between maximal resistance against translational and rotational movement and the complexity of the actuator. It consists of two along the screw axis running SMA sheets made of NiTi alloy which expand fully by body temperature. The actuators were integrated into a screw demonstrator (Figure 1). First tests according to standard ASTM F 543 with bone substitutes and alcohol fixated cervical and thoracic vertebrae by tensile were promising. The pullout strength increased from 432 N to 542 N with bone substitutes and from 240 N up to 293 N by using a human vertebra. The feasibility study shows that SMA actuators are suitable to increase the pullout strength of a pedicle screw. The actuator concept was also used for an adaptive hip stem implant. In non-cemented hip implants, stem loosening can be caused by changes in the applied force and insufficient load transmission between implant and osseous <b>anchor</b> <b>bedding.</b> The target is to achieve a homogeneous force distribution at the implant-bone interface by using SMA. The active components were integrated in hip stems with a new designed surface and inner structures (Figure 2). The results proved that the frictional connection between a stem prosthesis anchored without cement and the femur can be achieved using SMA elements. So there is a potential to stabilize the prosthesis and increase ist lifetime...|$|R
40|$|Introduction At {{the current}} state of the art, endoprostheses are {{predominantly}} manufactured by cutting, forming or casting technologies. An innovative approach for manufacturing of endoprostheses can be found in the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology of Beam Melting. With that, the implant gets manufactured by layer-wise, local melting of metal powder with a laser or electron beam, based on 3 D CAD data. Methods Two different approaches of a new implant design and implant functionality were realised. The first approach is the integration of internal functional channels and cavities. The second approach is the combination of Beam Melting technology with new materials. The target is to achieve a homogeneous force distribution at the implant-bone interface by using shape-memory-alloys. Results The inner channels and cavities (inner design features) can fulfil various functions within the implant, e. g. local supply of bio-resorbable filler, prevention and treatment of implant loosening even years after implantation, post-operative medical treatment through a medication depot and supply channels, post-operative drainage of blood and wound oozing through the implant, endoscopic examination of implant-bone interface and surrounding tissue and easier and quicker explantation with less damage to the bone structure through local application of soluble. In non-cemented hip implants, stem loosening is mainly caused by a change in force application and insufficient load transmission between implant and osseous <b>anchor</b> <b>bedding.</b> The active components were integrated in hip stems with a new designed surface and inner structures. The results proved that the frictional connection between a stem prosthesis anchored without cement and the femur can be achieved using shape memory alloy elements. So there is a potential to stabilize the prosthesis and increase its useful life. Conclusion Additive Manufacturing of implants by means of Beam Melting technologies allows undreamt-of possibilities in the geometric design of implants. In addition to patient specific design and surface or volume structuring of implants, the integration of value-added features in implants e. g. inner and outer structuring and the integration of active elements is a new field of application for Additive Manufacturing technologies in arthroplasty...|$|R

40|$|At {{the current}} state of the art, endoprostheses are {{predominantly}} manufactured by cutting, forming or casting technologies. Another, rather new way of implant manufacturing is the Additive Manufacturing process called Beam Melting, using a Laser or Electron beam. In particular the customized production with no need for any type of tooling, combined with the unique freedom of design spark interest in this technology for implant manufacturing. The use of Beam Melting enables the fabrication of endoprostheses with almost any design of inner and outer geometries. Previous developments and research activities were focussing either on customized, patient specific implant designs with a production batch size of only one piece, or on structured surfaces of specific design for better bone ingrowth and improved stability of the implant-bone bonding. Both approaches have not yet reached a significant breakthrough for Additive Manufacturing as an adopted technology to produce (metal) implants, besides some niche applications, e. g. for individual cranial or jaw plates or some Electron Beam Melting series production of hip cups. This paper focuses on the integration of completely new features and functions into endoprostheses which give various added value opportunities to implants that where unthinkable before. Strategies from tooling applications of Additive Manufacturing were adopted which have proved very successful in giving added value to tools and dies by implementing complex inner cooling channels. The paper describes two innovative strategies to integrate new features and functions into standard implants, e. g. hip stems, by the creation of: - inner design features like functional channels and cavities and - surface and inner structures to integrate additional active components (e. g. shape memory alloys) The inner channels and cavities (inner design features) can fulfil various functions within the implant, e. g. local supply of bio-resorbable filler, prevention and treatment of implant loosening even years after implantation, post-operative medical treatment through a medication depot and supply channels, post-operative drainage of blood and wound oozing through the implant, endoscopic examination of implant-bone interface and surrounding tissue and easier and quicker explantation with less damage to the bone structure through local application of soluble.

The prototype gauge is specially made for ocean wave height measurement, but the underlined principle {{can be extended}} to level measurements in other situations. The gauge consists of a field unit anchored at the location where the ocean wave height is to be measured, and a base unit stationed in land [...] The base unit can be connected to a computer to download wave height data for analysis. The field unit (see Fig.) consists of (1) an air-filled torus-shaped fully submerged platform <b>anchored</b> to sea <b>bed,</b> (2) a level sensing column hinged to the platform, and (3) a control box with electronic circuits, a radio transmitter, and rechargeable batteries. The anchoring is done {{in such a way}} that the mean sea level is roughly at the centre of the level sensing column. The sensing columns should be longer than twice the amplitude of sea waves. The control circuits perform many tasks: it converts the variation of capacitance between the two vertical tubes in the sensing column to variable frequency radio signal; it determines the sampling periods and sampling rates; it also communicates with the base unit by radio signals. The field unit is designed to consume very little power and the rechargeable batteries alone can power the unit for 10 days. The base unit consists of a radio receiver, control circuits, and an interface. This unit can receive radio signals from the field unit which must be within 2 km.
