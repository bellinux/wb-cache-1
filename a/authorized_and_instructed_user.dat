40|$|In {{this study}} we {{estimate}} the motion intention using the motion dynamics information included in bio-signals. However, there are several problems when using bio-signals: high nonlinearity, individual variation and non-stationary. In order to solve these problems, we have proposed control methods for a multi-D. O. F prosthetic hand using adaptive learning. These methods can recognize many hand motion patterns using electromyographic signals (EMG). Also we investigate adaptive human action and clarify the mutual adaptation among human and machines. Adaptable Control for Individual Characteristics: It is an effective method to acquire the mapping between EMG and hand motion pattern using machine learning. This method is called “Adaptable control for individual characteristics”. We propose two kinds of methods for pattern identification. First, we analyze the human adaptation process using the self organization clustering, and propose the adaptive learning method that can maintain high performance pattern identification despite EMG’s temporal changes (Fig. 1). On the other hand, to identify motion using EMG, generally we measure EMG <b>and</b> <b>instruct</b> <b>user’s</b> desired motion to the system directly, and training data is generated.

They must acquire new skills to use this technology, including system analysis, system planning, and the principles of computer operation. An area that is frequently neglected, however, is that of developing and maintaining in-house project documentation for systems once equipment is in place and implementation has begun. This oversight leads to poor training strategies, inconsistencies in input and output, and information loss when personnel changes occur. Project documentation is the group of records that describe the system the archivist creates. It is a communications tool, developed by the project manager as a reference document for administrative and operations purposes, and to train users. The documentation guidelines assembled in this text were developed by the author while implementing automated systems over a six-year period. They are arranged in five groups.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} library instruction methods, effect {{and the challenges}} in academic libraries using the Federal University of Petroleum Resources Effurun (FUPRE) students as the target population. Library instruction is a core activity of academic libraries that entails educating, enlightening, guiding and helping the library users to identify, understand and utilize library information resources effectively. A survey research design was adopted for the study. The population is consisted of seven hundred and seventy-three 100 level students who registered for Use of Library (GSE 112) course in the first semester of 2015 / 2016 academic session. Questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. Using a consensus sampling technique, all the 773 students {{participated in the study}} during a seminar organized for the 100 level students {{at the end of the}} second semester by August 2016. All the questionnaires were retrieved while 643 were found usable representing 83 percent. The finding showed that classroom teaching, library orientation and library guide (X = 3. 00, SD = 000) were the methods mostly used while guided library tour (X = 2. 53, SD = 667), and one-on-one mentoring (X = 2. 48, SD = 716) were also used to <b>instruct</b> the library <b>users.</b> The study reveals that Ask a librarian, FAQ, library Blog, library Website, Text messaging were not used to <b>instruct</b> the <b>users.</b> It shows that library instruction is effective for identification of books on the shelves (X = 3. 78, SD = 416), accessing and retrieving of information materials in the library (X = 3. 67, SD = 471), enabling students to cite and reference books with ease (X = 3. 11, SD = 874) and turning users into regular library users (X = 3. 45, SD = 497). The study, however, showed that library instruction has no effect on students’ academic excellence (X = 3. 44, SD = 687). The challenges facing library instruction including non-expository of the program (X = 2. 78, SD = 785), inadequate time for library orientation (X = 3. 00, SD = 815), non-utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) for library instruction (X = 2. 78, SD = 787) and students’ lack of interest in library instruction programmes (X = 3. 56, SD = 684) were identified. The study concluded that library instruction is an effective means of educating users and creating awareness of available information resources in the library.
