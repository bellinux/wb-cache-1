5|$|During {{his first}} year in office Williams <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> {{suffered}} low approval ratings. However, approval for Williams <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> dramatically improved in 2005. A poll showed support for the Williams government was at 86 percent after Williams secured a deal with Federal Prime Minister Martin over equalization payments. The CRA poll in March 2006 showed 82 percent satisfaction with his government and 71 percent in William's premiership. Polling conducted throughout 2007, showed that support for Williams <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> remained high. In August 2007, the CRA found that 86 percent were satisfied with the government's performance; 77 percent supported Williams as premier, and 76 percent endorsed the PC party.|$|E
5|$|Harry Strom, a {{long time}} cabinet minister, {{replaced}} Manning and lead the party to defeat in the 1971 election {{at the hands of}} the Progressive Conservatives under Peter Lougheed.

5|$|After Shinzaemon dies, Shinrokurō wanders {{through the}} carnage. He meets the hunter Koyata, {{who has made}} a miraculous {{recovery}} after being stabbed in the neck by Naritsugu. The two then make their separate ways out of the town. An epilogue states that the Shogun <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> covered up what really occurred, announcing that Naritsugu died of illness on the journey back to his lands. Twenty-three years later, the Tokugawa Shogunate would be overthrown with the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} situation deteriorated, Whitlam <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929, {{which resulted in a}} hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> resigned and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald (1866–1937) took office. In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis, as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929. Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to easily triumph, and {{thought he would be}} moved either to the Exchequer or be asked to serve at the Colonial Office, where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark. Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented {{for the rest of his}} life, but the general election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>Government</b> resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office.|$|E
5|$|Designing the in-game propaganda, {{they studied}} {{its use in}} history, finding {{the same pattern of}} {{elements}} reappearing throughout the centuries. In place of the militarily inspired propaganda of the first game, Dishonored 2 would employ a subtler approach; lavish posters for invariably canceled enterprises meant to aid the people of Serkonos were made to exhibit the nature of tyranny as practised by the Duke of Serkonos <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government.</b> To further detail the world, the narration team would come up with fictitious products and brand names and make advertisements of them.|$|E
5|$|From mid-April Mussolini based {{himself in}} Milan, and he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> took up {{residence}} in the city's Prefecture. At {{the end of the}} month, the partisan leadership, the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia (CLNAI), declared a general uprising in the main northern cities as the German forces retreated. With the CLNAI's assumption of control in Milan and the German army in northern Italy about to surrender, Mussolini fled the city on 25 April and attempted to escape north to Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} conscription after {{the failure of the}} voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> survived unscathed. The conscription crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned by what he saw as the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1975, Whitlam {{intended}} {{to call a}} half-Senate election {{in an attempt to}} break the deadlock. When he went to seek Kerr's approval of the election, Kerr instead dismissed him as Prime Minister and shortly thereafter installed Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies were able to secure passage of the appropriation bills, and Kerr dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> were returned with a massive majority in the election held the following month.|$|E
5|$|On December 3, 2012 the {{government}} became a caretaker government after Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich accepted {{the resignation of}} prime minister Mykola Azarov <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> following the 28 October 2012 parliamentary election. A number of government members, including Prime Minister Azarov, were elected to parliament in that election. In order to get these parliamentary mandates they were obliged to submit documents on the dismissal from their previous job to the Central Election Commission within 20 days after the election (by December 3).|$|E

5|$|With the {{collapse}} of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him. Charles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of the Duke of Portland. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> {{was replaced by the}} Fox–North Coalition. The Duke of Portland became Prime Minister, with Fox and Lord North, as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively.|$|E
5|$|In April 1920, Hananu {{coordinated the}} {{shipment}} of Turkish arms to Saleh al-Ali's forces in their {{revolt against the}} French in the coastal mountains south of Latakia. Faisal's government aided Hananu's movement financially and logistically via local Arab nationalist intermediaries. French General Henri Gouraud demanded that Faisal rein in the rebels of northern Syria and end their resistance to the French military advance. Faisal continued to oppose French rule <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> launched a campaign to conscript soldiers from throughout the country in May {{as part of a}} last-ditch effort to defend Damascus against a French invasion, but the recruitment campaign was unsuccessful. On 14 July, Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal to demobilize his makeshift Arab Army and recognize France's mandate over Syria. Later in mid-July, French forces broke Hananu's resistance lines in Jisr al-Shughur, capturing the town on their way to Aleppo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of Richard's reign, the {{pressures}} mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> duties {{made him the}} target of criticism from both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard's demand that the magnates of England provide 300knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied {{with the results of}} the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may have resigned willingly, as he had talked of resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he was forced out of office by the king.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> faced {{immediate}} problems upon {{formation of}} the new country. Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening {{to withdraw from the}} union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind them closer to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American relations were in a poor state, and Canadian foreign relations were matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the Reciprocity Treaty had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. Much of present-day Canada remained outside confederation—in addition to the separate colonies of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and British Columbia, which remained governed by the British, vast areas in the north and west belonged to the British and to the Hudson's Bay Company. American and British opinion was that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 1793, another vote {{to abolish}} the slave trade was {{narrowly}} defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis {{and the threat of}} invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France, a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1941, about 75 {{prominent}} Serbs {{convened a}} meeting in Belgrade where they resolved that Nedić should form a Government of National Salvation to replace the Commissioner Government. The same day, Nedić wrote to Danckelmann agreeing to become the Prime Minister {{of the new government}} on the basis of five conditions and some additional concessions. Two days later, the German authorities appointed Nedić <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>government.</b> Real power continued to reside with the occupiers. Aćimović initially retained his position as Minister of the Interior. In March 1945, he joined a Chetnik group in the NDH, and was killed battling the Partisans.|$|E
