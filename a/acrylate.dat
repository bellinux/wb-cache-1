40|$|AbstractDue to good {{reactivity}} of fluorinated (meth) <b>acrylates</b> with other monomers or polymer segments, fluorinated poly(meth) <b>acrylates</b> possess more economical and convenient synthesis routes than other fluoropolymers. This feature article initially summarizes {{different types of}} fluorinated (meth) <b>acrylates,</b> which {{can be divided into}} fluorinated alkyl (meth) <b>acrylates</b> and fluorinated aryl (meth) <b>acrylates.</b> Subsequently, various approaches for synthesizing fluorinated poly(meth) <b>acrylates</b> including random, block, graft or star copolymers are described. Conventional free radical polymerization can be used in synthesizing random copolymers, while controlled/“living” radical polymerization can provide well-defined copolymers with accurate control over molecular weight and special structures as expected. In particular, introduction of fluorinated components into as-prepared copolymers offers an alternative route to synthesize fluorinated poly(meth) <b>acrylates</b> which are difficult to be obtained directly via polymerization. The incorporation of fluorine can confer unique and highly desirable properties to poly(meth) <b>acrylates</b> such as low surface energy, thermal stability, chemical and weather resistance, low refractive index, and self-organization characteristics. Such properties are described in great details based on many recent articles...|$|R

We investigated quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) between the base-catalyzed hydrolysis rate constants (k 1) or the rate constant with glutathione (GSH) (log kGSH) for <b>acrylates</b> and methacrylates and the 13 C NMR chemical shifts of their α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups (δCα and δCβ) or heat of formation (Hf) calculated by the semi-empirical MO method. Reported data for the independent variables were employed. A significant linear relationship between k 1 and δCβ, but not δCα, was obtained for methacrylates (r 2 = 0. 93), but not for <b>acrylates.</b> Also, a significant relationship between k 1 and Hf was obtained for both <b>acrylates</b> and methacrylates (r 2 = 0. 89).

Oligolactide <b>acrylates</b> were then synthesized by functionalizing the oligolactide diols with acrylic acid. In this study, three diol ring openers having short and long alkyl chain length were used to investigate {{the effects of the}} amount and type of diols on the properties of the oligolactide <b>acrylates.</b> The obtained oligomers were characterized, and the viscosities of oligolactide <b>acrylates</b> were measured.

An increase in the alkyl chain length of the ring openers resulted in oligomers with lower viscosity and a decrease in Tg. Following that, the obtained oligolactide <b>acrylates</b> were employed for the formulation of UV-curable screen printing inks and their properties were investigated.
