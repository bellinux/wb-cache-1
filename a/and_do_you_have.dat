5000|$|By 1969 Combe was {{a primary}} school teacher {{and in the early}} 1970s he was a {{specialist}} music teacher. He taught Junior school music at Prince Alfred College in the late 70's [...] He started writing songs for his students and in 1973 he wrote his first 'operettas' for them. One of the early ones, Bows Against the Barons, is based on Geoffrey Trease's novel of the same name, relating the legend of Robin Hood. The song, [...] "Robin Hood's Dream", appeared on his 1988 album, Newspaper Mama. In 1975 Combe moved to Sydney and aspired to be the next Paul Simon. There he appeared in the rock musical, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club. He taught at inner Sydney primary schools, performed in pubs and clubs as a singer-songwriter. He wrote a children's musical, Frederick WhatsHisName & his TwoLegged Six String Guitar, which provided the track, [...] "Spangle Road". Another of his musicals is based on Norman Lindsey's book, The Magic Pudding. In 1977 Combe migrated to England where became a presenter on, Music Time, a BBC TV educational program. He explained that [...] "Someone in Adelaide had given me the name of a BBC producer. I rang and said I had just arrived England <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any shows I can audition for. They wanted someone for Music Time, I auditioned, made the short list, and got the job." [...] Combe and co-presenter, Kathryn Harries, introduced musical concepts in an entertaining format. The show was used by teachers as part of their music programs and was a resource for other music educators. Besides being played in Britain for six years, it was re-broadcast on ABC TV. In late 1979 the Combe family moved back to Australia, where he presented, Let's Have Music, an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio program, which was used for primary school music education. In 1980 he recorded his first album, Vagabond, which was aimed at adults. The title track had been recorded by ex-pat Australians, the Seekers, in 1977. After two more years teaching, Combe issued his second album, Songs for Little Kids, in 1982 (later retitled Happy Singing and then Wash Your Face in Orange Juice). It was recorded and produced by Combe at Axent Recording Studio in Sydney and appeared on ABC Records on cassette.|$|E

As a part of this initiative, we conducted online surveys, e-mail questionnaires, a series of workshops and interviews to elicit students and educators’ perceptions of podcasts: how podcasts could support their learning and teaching. In this paper, we report the analysis of one of our requirements elicitation tools, the e-mail questionnaire which we sent around within the University in early 2008. The collated data pertains to students’ and educators’ perceptions on the following aspects: how course-related podcasts could improve the learning experience?; topics in the course(s) they are associated with and which would benefit from being presented as podcasts and say why you think these topics would be good choices; and (c) any potential drawbacks with introducing podcasts <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any thoughts on how these might be avoided?.

40|$|Using the Sun?s rays Cue: Sun drying is {{the oldest}} method of drying {{agricultural}} produce. It?s free, and it?s effective. There are some disadvantages: the weather is not always hot, and roaming animals can sometimes get a juicy meal from your hard work. But, as Ismaila Senghore found out {{when he spoke to}} Peter Monnie, sun drying has its rewards. With some added salt, all kinds of fish can be preserved through sun drying - from skate to the unusual-looking ?guitar? fish. By putting them on a platform of stalks from the ?rhun? tree, which is like a palm tree, the fish are protected from scavenging animals. Once dried they can be sold. Ismaila went to one fishing community on the windy beaches of Banjul in The Gambia, to find out more. IN:	?The people here are mainly? OUT:	?Yes a glut. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Ismaila Senghore talking to Peter Monnie in the Gambia. Adding salt, together with the heat from the sun, can preserve all kinds of fish - and fruits and vegetables too. The market may not always be good. But sun dried foods have the advantage that they can be stored, and eaten when resources are scarce. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Monnie	The people here are mainly fishermen so our women too, they also have involved themselves in it. Senghore	Now let me know now the kind of fish that you dry here? Monnie	Skate, skate fish or guitar fish as their form looks like a guitar. So we have named it guitar fish. Senghore	The sea snails - you dry them here too? Monnie	Yes we have them also here. We also dry them here. We also get them from the fishermen and we get them, we crack then we dry them. So it is also part of the activities. Senghore	Now Peter, what are the procedures that you undertake in drying your fish? When you want to dry fish, where do you start from? Monnie	Yes, when we want to dry the fish at least we bring the fish from the seashore and you bring them to our site. Then we off scale them, we scale them off. We remove some of the items in the fish. Senghore	The intestines and so forth? Monnie	Yes. Senghore	And the gills? Monnie	Yes the gills and the intestines. As you can see them you see we remove them and then after you wash them. Then you put them on the platforms. Senghore	So in other words the only treatment that you apply is salting? Monnie	Yes it is only salt because salt is the natural treatment. Senghore	Now I have seen that you have various fish here spread on these platforms. Why do you have to put them on platforms, almost one metre high? Monnie	Yes, you have to do so because we have some animals around us, donkeys, cattle and it is not safe to dry them on the ground. Senghore	I can see that your platform seems to be very practical because it made of the stalks of rhun leaves and you have some tree cuttings that you have planted in the garden, you mounted your platform on these tree cuttings. Now you can see that there is space between the rhun sticks that allows some kind of air to blow from under through the fish. Now does that possibly help your drying, is it advantageous for the drying? Monnie	Yes it is very, very advantageous so that air can blow under it so that while the one that is facing the sun is drying, then the wind also is blowing under it so that they get dry at the same time. Senghore	Now {{how do you know that}} your fish is dry? Do you come to look at it from time to time? Monnie	Yes we are always at the site. When we dry them the next day we come and we turn them all around then it becomes fully dry. Senghore	Yes because the temperature may not be very hot from the sun. Sometimes you know it might not be very sunny. It means you have to come day by day to turn it over and over is it? Monnie	Yes that is why you turn them all around. Senghore	Ok, now that you come and inspect it every day to see whether it is dry now. When it is fully dry how would you know it is fully dry? Monnie	Yes because when it is dry the fish become very hard. When you break it you cannot, it cannot then everything becomes hard. Senghore	All right now if you would want to, for example, tell anybody to start this kind of venture anywhere in the Third World what kind of advice would you give them? Monnie	Yes the advice that I would give them is that it seems like tedious work but it is also helping our community. Senghore	Now Mr Monnie, when you come to selling your fish now where do you sell your fish and do you think it is lucrative business? Monnie	Yes after drying them we pack them, we wake up early in the morning around five o?clock and we send them to the roadside and then we take where we have the market there, then we sell. So we sell them locally. Senghore	<b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a good revenue from it, is it lucrative like is it profitable? Monnie	Yes, sometimes it is profitable. If a lot of people in the market in a day, the market will not be all that impressive because a lot of the fish will be there. So sometimes you will sell? Senghore	There will be a glut? Monnie	Yes a glut. End of trackThe oldest method of drying has advantages and disadvantage...|$|E

40|$|Heartwater Cue: Heartwater {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} affecting ruminants in sub-Saharan Africa. Transmitted in the bite of a tick, it can cause death within a few days of the first signs of disease appearing. For this reason, farmers whose animals are at risk must be very alert, in order to notice the first sign of the disease - a high temperature. Treatment at this stage with a tetracycline medicine usually saves the animal?s life, but once later signs of the disease begin, such as nervous movements of the eyes and lips, treatment is much less successful. Animals born in areas where heartwater is present generally develop immunity to the disease at an early age. However, any non-immune animal that is brought into a heartwater area is at risk and should be vaccinated. For this reason, pastoralists who move their flocks and herds in search of grazing are at particular risk of losing animals to heartwater, and exotic breeds are also very vulnerable. To find out more about the disease and how farmers can respond to it, Busani Bafana spoke to Ignatious Ndzinge, a veterinary doctor working in Gabarone, Botswana. He began by asking how the disease is transmitted. IN:		It is transmitted by what ? OUT:		?the animal will survive. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 15 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Ignatious Ndzinge emphasising the importance of quick treatment to save livestock that show symptoms of heartwater. Transcript Ndzinge	It is transmitted by what we call the South African bont tick and this tick is one that actually harbours the parasites that cause heartwater. Bafana		What are the signs and symptoms of heartwater? Ndzinge	The animal will start looking sick in the sense of malaise and the temperature goes up and the temperature would be about 40 ø. As time goes on the animal would have staggering gait and eventually they will fall down and later on they will die. Bafana	You also mentioned that there was a rise in temperature. How would I know that, would that be by touching the animal, is there anything physical that can tell me that the animal is suffering from heartwater? Ndzinge	The animal would start not eating. I think that {{is one of the}} things and then the staggering gait and also you will see the animal actually panting, you would know that it has a very high temperature. Touching alone will not help but if you?ve got a simple thermometer you can put it in the animal?s bum and you will see how high it is. Bafana	There is also the issue, doctor, of that animal may not be eating. Would I then see that the animal is losing some weight? Ndzinge	No because it is a very very acute disease in the sense that it comes very fast and all of a sudden the animal just goes down, is bumping into fences, trees and things like that. So it is not a disease that you will see gradually the animal losing weight, no. Bafana	How can farmers prevent heartwater from spreading once it has been discovered? Ndzinge	Dipping is one of the things that you have to do. There?s also a vaccine that they can use especially if you are buying cattle from a non-heartwater area they must be vaccinated against heartwater before they are introduced into the heartwater area. So this is one of the things that the farmers have to do to try and prevent it. But failing that it is dipping. Also the dipping should be strategic in a sense that we don?t want it to kill all the ticks but we also want the animals to be used to the tick bite. Bafana	You did talk about vaccines, how accessible are these vaccines to a farmer in a remote area? Ndzinge	Unfortunately this vaccine is what we call the blood vaccine which has to be kept under very low temperatures, - 18 ø and is not always very practical for the farmers to have it spare in remote areas. But it is available, the government of Botswana does make it available and get it transported to most remote areas in the country. But I have to caution that when you are vaccinating you can?t vaccinate pregnant animals because you are actually infecting the animals with the disease and some will abort if they are pregnant. Bafana	Can heartwater be passed on to humans, since Botswana is one of the top meat producing nations in southern Africa? Ndzinge	No it doesn?t affect humans at all. It is just a disease that affects cattle, sheep and goats and as I say like any other ungulates like those wild animals which look like cattle. Bafana	So if I see that my animal is diseased and there is no way of me treating it, I can go ahead and slaughter it? Ndzinge	I would never advise people just to slaughter animals and eat it, because you never know sometimes you may be thinking that it is heartwater but it maybe something else. It could be anthrax, it could be another disease that has got the same clinical signs. So I always say when an animal is sick and you slaughter it just burn the carcass. Bafana	And lastly doctor you operate in central Gaborone <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any outreach programmes where you try and reach the farmers in remote areas? Ndzinge	Yes we do that, yes we do go out and talk to farmers and try to educate them about diseases. For example for heartwater we would say that they must always keep Terramycin on their shelves so that when an animal is sick like that they can give you some treatment yes. Bafana	Terramycin is a medical chemical I believe but is there any cultural medicine they can use where Terramycin is not available? Ndzinge	No I don?t know of any but this drug which is an antibiotic and I think in Botswana everybody knows it as machonazotle it?s a very effective drug to use. If you use it in time the animal will survive. End of track. Ignatious Ndzinge, a veterinary doctor working in Gaberone, Botswana...|$|E
