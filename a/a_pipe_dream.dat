The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing for fear of reprisal from their constituents. Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-period pricing remains <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>dream</b> in the minds of many." ...|$|E

According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks, noting that she [...] "basically went from full time acting mode to full time album mode". As she wanted to accomplish more [...] "John Mayer-ish type of songs", she contacted Mayer's management in order to collaborate him, citing {{him as one of}} her biggest musical influences. Mayer accepted the offer, of which Lovato said, [...] "I was completely shocked [...] It was more of <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>dream.</b> I didn't ever {{think it would be a}} reality, but it came true. He was taking a chance on working with a younger artist in the pop realm." [...] The two wrote three songs together, [...] "World of Chances", [...] "Love is the Answer" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Love Me". Lovato said that it was intimidating to work with him as she was worried that he would not like her lyrics, and she would get [...] "super excited" [...] whenever he complimented her. [...] "World of Chances", the first song she wrote with Mayer, was the only of these songs to make the album's final cut. The song was inspired by Lovato's first experience of love and heartbreak.|$|E
