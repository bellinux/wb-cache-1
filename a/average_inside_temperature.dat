40|$|The current licentiate {{thesis is}} dealing with {{transport}} of cattle from farms to abattoirs. During transport the animals are confined in the vehicle and are exposed to an unfamiliar environment, including heat, cold, humidity and vibration that might be stressful to them. To determine how inside condition in the vehicle during transportation varies depending of season, loading density, transport time and dynamic performances field experiments were made in commercial cattle transport vehicles. The vehicles used had natural ventilation system with air suspension in the front axis and leaf suspension system in the rear axis. Air quality in the compartment in terms of temperature, relative humidity and gases (ammonia, methane and carbon dioxide) were mapped out in Sweden. In Sweden and in Norway was vibration in three axes on the vehicle investigated, and in Norway also velocity and slope {{as well as the}} animal’s behaviour. An animal transport surveillance system that considers environmental parameter in the vehicle as well as the physiological response parameters has been developed to store and transfer data to a control station. <b>Average</b> <b>inside</b> <b>temperature</b> was 3 °C to 6 °C warmer than outside temperature and high animal density made the average temperature higher irrespective of outside temperature. Stops that were made to load new animals lowered temperature during winter but made it higher during summer. Experiments found no detectable methane levels and the maximum ammonia level increased with transport time. There was {{a significant difference between the}} performances of the vehicle when loaded and unloaded. Animals preferred to stand perpendicular to the direction of vehicle’s motion during transport and they lost their balance more often on a curvy road than on a straight road. The surveillance system was found to perform well and will promote animal welfare.

40|$|In {{almost all}} {{domestic}} refrigerators-freezers all components are {{assembled in the}} same relative position since several years ago. It is also known that the condenser releases heat at high temperatures (first law of thermodynamics) {{as well as the}} compressor. This heat is rejected to the environment in almost all practical situations partially by natural air convection. However, part of it is due to thermal radiation that causes an overheating of the refrigerator-freezer surfaces adjacent to those equipments. As a consequence there are more heat gains to the refrigerator-freezer through these surfaces and hence higher air <b>temperatures</b> <b>inside.</b> This paper describes how a simple technique can be very useful in order to minimize that part of heat transfer by radiation. The improvement is achieved by placing a radiation shield - a sheet of aluminium foil - over the surfaces close to the condenser and the compressor. For validating this technique a refrigerator-freezer was monitored with thermocouples for the measurements of the <b>inside</b> air <b>temperatures</b> in two situations: with and without the radiation shield. Results show that with this practice the <b>average</b> <b>inside</b> air <b>temperatures</b> in the refrigerator-freezer could decrease to about 2 K.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a fan-pad evaporative cooling system for a photo voltaic powered greenhouse was investigated under extreme summer conditions of Saudi Arabia. Greenhouse air temperature, relative humidity and electricity consumed for cooling were studied in a Quonset greenhouse covered with corrugated fiberglass¬reinforced plastic sheets and producing cucumbers. Clogging pads due to salt buildup reduced the cooling performance and caused the cooling system to operate at forfor longer duration, which causing moreincreased power to be drawn consumption from the photo voltaic system. As a result, the system tripped three times during the summer period of for one to three days. During daytime, the <b>average</b> <b>inside</b> air <b>temperatures</b> with clogged pads was between 30 °C and 51 "C, and the relative humidity was between 8 % and 30 %. This adversely affected plant growth, leading to wilting of plants, especially when accompanied by high solar radiation levels (from 10 : 00 h to 16 : 00 h). Shade reduced the stress on plants, but air temperatures and relative humidity were far from the suitable ranges for good production practice. The average stemperatures with shade ranged from 40 "C to 47. 5 "C, and relative humidity ranged from 8 % to 12 %. Replacing pads clearly improved the greenhouse environment. Air temperature and relative humidity inside the greenhouse during daytime ranged from 28 "C to 32 "C, and from 39. 3 % to 44 % respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the thermal {{performance}} of a greenhouse exposed to semi-arid conditions by investigating experimentally the heat transfers occurring through the walls and ground. A closed unheated Venlo greenhouse without crop {{in the area of}} Batna (southern Mediterranean basin) was considered. The study focuses on the effects of (i) the thermal inertia of the soil, (ii) the radiative losses through the cover, and (iii) the convection mode and flow regime on the heat transfer coefficients. Experiments were conducted from January to March 2008 under clear or cloudy skies, and low or high wind velocities. From the results, it is concluded that the heat stored in the ground of the greenhouse represents a significant heat source which can compensate the energy losses through the walls, especially during a night preceded by a high diurnal insulation. This process can maintain an <b>average</b> <b>inside</b> - outside <b>temperature</b> difference during the night within the range [1. 59 – 2. 81] K. Results also show that the radiation losses are the main component of the energy losses of the greenhouse, mainly through the outside wall surface of the cover. Conversely, the radiative heat exchange along the inner wall represents the main heat supply to this wall. The convection mode inside the greenhouse induced by the air movement seems to play a significant role on the convective exchange coefficient inside the greenhouse.

Identifying these areas by means of improved monitoring may help tackle fuel poverty and decrease warmth demand.

In addition, energy sources used for fulfilling this demand tend to be more costly and CO 2 emitting in rural dwellings than in urban areas.

The temperature was also monitored during drying when the trays were loaded with fish of different fillet thicknesses. The rate of loss of moisture was also monitored by weighing the fillets at regular interval until the moisture dropped to 20 %, dry basis or lower. The <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>inside</b> the plenum chamber of the box type solar dryer was found to have a high daily value of 71. 1 OC although an absolute maximum value of 74. 4 OC was recorded. This maximum value could be reached on cloudless days between the hours of 13 : 00 and 1400. Th...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{numerical}} {{studies of}} oscillating flux tubes have established {{the significance of}} resonant absorption in the damping of propagating transverse oscillations in coronal loops. The nonlinear nature of the mechanism has been examined alongside the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, {{which is expected to}} manifest in the resonant layers {{at the edges of the}} flux tubes. While these two processes have been hypothesized to heat coronal loops through the dissipation of wave energy into smaller scales, the occurring mixing with the hotter surroundings can potentially hide this effect. We aim to study the effects of wave heating from driven and standing kink waves in a coronal loop. Using the MPI-AMRVAC code, we perform ideal, three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of both (a) footpoint driven and (b) free standing oscillations in a straight coronal flux tube, in the presence of numerical resistivity. We have observed the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz eddies at the loop boundary layer of all three models considered here, as well as an increase of the volume <b>averaged</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>inside</b> the loop. The main heating mechanism in our setups was Ohmic dissipation, as indicated by the higher values for the temperatures and current densities located near the footpoints. The introduction of a temperature gradient between the inner tube and the surrounding plasma, suggests that the mixing of the two regions, in the case of hotter environment, greatly increases the temperature of the tube at the site of the strongest turbulence, beyond the contribution of the aforementioned wave heating mechanism.

40|$|AbstractTraditional {{machining}} of {{a permanent}} magnet is difficult because of magnetic forces and brittleness of materials. However, electrical discharge machining (EDM), which is a non-contact thermal machining method, has carried out for shape machining of magnetic materials. Magnetic materials have a Curie point. As their magnetic flux density reduces when they are heated to a high temperature. Because EDM is a thermal process, {{it has the potential}} to control the magnetic flux density of a machined surface. In this study, to clarify the relationship between magnetic flux density and temperature distributions in depth direction of permanent magnet by EDM, internal temperatures of magnets were investigated using a K type thermocouple during EDM. Neodymium magnets were used as work-pieces. The magnetic flux density of a machined neodymium magnet was measured. In addition, the effects of duty factor (D. F.) and in Diamagnetic Field were also examined. The results showed that the <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>inside</b> of the magnet is determined by the input energy, depending on the discharge conditions. A decrease of surface magnetic flux density after EDM is affected by the magnitude of the area and the amount of decrease is due to the increase of the internal temperature of the magnet. In a diamagnetic field EDM, the reduction in magnetic flux density is large compared with a regular magnetic field. However, there is no difference in internal temperature each machining. Therefore, it isn’t determined simply by the magnitude of the input energy. It can be said that combination of heat history and machined magnet shape determine the magnetic flux density...|$|R
