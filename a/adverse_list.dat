5000|$|A {{variety of}} {{allergic}} or allergic-like NSAID hypersensitivity reactions follow the ingestion of NSAIDs. These hypersensitivity reactions {{differ from the}} other <b>adverse</b> reactions <b>listed</b> here which are toxicity reactions, i.e. unwanted reactions that result from the pharmacological action of a drug, are dose-related, and can occur in any treated individual; hypersensitivity reactions are idiosyncratic reactions to a drug. [...] Some NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are truly allergic in origin: 1) repetitive IgE-mediated urticarial skin eruptions, angioedema, and anaphylaxis following immediately to hours after ingesting one structural type of NSAID but not after ingesting structurally unrelated NSAIDs; and 2) Comparatively mild to moderately severe T cell-mediated delayed onset (usually more than 24 hour), skin reactions such as maculopapular rash, fixed drug eruptions, photosensitivity reactions, delayed urticaria, and contact dermatitis; or 3) far more severe and potentially life-threatening t-cell-mediated delayed systemic reactions such as the DRESS syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, the Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are allergy-like symptoms but do not involve true allergic mechanisms; rather, they appear due {{to the ability of}} NSAIDs to alter the metabolism of arachidonic acid in favor of forming metabolites that promote allergic symptoms. Afflicted individuals may be abnormally sensitive to these provocative metabolites or overproduce them and typically are susceptible {{to a wide range of}} structurally dissimilar NSAIDs, particularly those that inhibit COX1. Symptoms, which develop immediately to hours after ingesting any of various NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1, are: 1) exacerbations of asthmatic and rhinitis (see aspirin-induced asthma) symptoms in individuals with a history of asthma or rhinitis and 2) exacerbation or first-time development of wheals or angioedema in individuals with or without a history of chronic urticarial lesions or angioedema.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) {{submitted}} to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the bleeding complications induced by the administration of antiplatelets and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. Methods: After a deletion of duplicated submissions and the revision of arbitrary drug names, AERs involving warfarin, aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel, ethyl icosapentate, limaprost alfadex, sarpogrelate, and ticlopidine were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools {{were used for the}} quantitative detection of signals, i. e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Results: Based on 22, 017, 956 co-occurrences, i. e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, 736 <b>adverse</b> events were <b>listed</b> as warfarin-associated <b>adverse</b> events, and 147 of the 736 were bleeding complications, including haemorrhage and haematoma. Both aspirin and clopidogrel were associated with haemorrhage, but the association was more noteworthy for clopidogrel. As for bleeding complications related to the gastrointestinal system, e. g., melaena and haematochezia, the statistical metrics suggested a stronger association for aspirin than clopidogrel. The total number of co-occurrences was not large enough to compare the association with bleeding complications for the other 5 antiplatelets.

40|$|Background and Aims: When a drug {{is used in}} a {{way that}} is {{different}} from that described in regulatory body approved drug label, it is said to be ′off label use′. Perioperative phase is sensitive from the point of view of patient safety and off-label drug use in this setup can prove to be hazardous to patient. Hence, it was planned to assess the pattern of drug utilisation and off-label use of perioperative medication during anaesthesia. Methods: Preoperatively, demographic details and <b>adverse</b> events check <b>list</b> were filled from a total of 400 patients from general surgery, paediatric surgery and orthopaedics departments scheduled to undergo surgery. The perioperative assessment form was assessed to record all prescriptions followed by refilling of adverse events checklist in case record form. World Health Organization (WHO) prescribing indicators were used for analysis of drug utilisation data. National Formulary of India 2011 was used as reference material to decide off-label drug use in majority instances along with package insert. Results: A total of 3705 drugs were prescribed to the 400 participants and average number of drugs per patient was 9. 26 ± 3. 33. Prescriptions by generic name were 68. 07 % whereas 85. 3 % drugs were prescribed from hospital schedule. Off-label drugs overall formed 20. 19 % of the drugs prescribed. At least one off-label drug was prescribed to 82. 5 % of patients. Inappropriate dose was the most common form of off-label use. There was 1. 6 times greater risk of occurrence of adverse events associated with the use of off-label drugs. Conclusion: Prescription indicators were WHO compliant.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{publications}} {{indicate that}} acupuncture is efficient {{for the treatment}} of pelvic girdle pain, PGP, in pregnant women. However, the use of acupuncture for PGP is rare due to insufficient documentation of adverse effects of this treatment in this specific condition. The aim of the present work was to assess adverse effects of acupuncture on the pregnancy, mother, delivery and the fetus/neonate in comparison with women that received stabilising exercises as adjunct to standard treatment or standard treatment alone. Methods In all, 386 women with PGP entered this controlled, single-blind trial. They were randomly assigned to standard treatment plus acupuncture (n = 125), standard treatment plus specific stabilising exercises (n = 131) or to standard treatment alone (n = 130) for 6 weeks. Acupuncture that may be considered strong was used and treatment was started as early as in the second trimester of pregnancy. Adverse effects were recorded during treatment and throughout the pregnancy. Influence on the fetus was measured with cardiotocography (CTG) before-during and after 43 acupuncture sessions in 43 women. A standardised computerized method to analyze the CTG reading numerically (Oxford 8000, Oxford, England) was used. After treatment, the women rated their overall experience of the treatment and <b>listed</b> <b>adverse</b> events if any in a questionnaire. Data of analgesia and oxytocin augmentation during labour, duration of labour, frequency of preterm birth, operative delivery, Apgar score, cord-blood gas/acid base balance and birth weight were also recorded. Results There were no serious adverse events after any of the treatments. Minor adverse events were common in the acupuncture group but women rated acupuncture favourably even despite this. The computerized or visually assessed CTG analyses of antenatal recordings in connection with acupuncture were all normal. Conclusion This study shows that acupuncture administered with a stimulation that may be considered strong led to minor adverse complaints from the mothers but had no observable severe adverse influences on the pregnancy, mother, delivery or the fetus/neonate. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective.  To {{investigate}} {{the roles of}} inherited polymorphisms in the MBL 2 gene and exposure to viral infection {{in the development of}} a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including birthweight < 10 th percentile (small-for-gestational age, SGA), antepartum hemorrhage (APH), pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders (PIHD), and preterm birth (PTB). Methods.  This was a case–control study using DNA from newborn screening cards of 717 cases (babies with at least one of the <b>adverse</b> pregnancy outcomes <b>listed</b> above) and 609 controls, to screen for six polymorphisms within the MBL 2 gene. These combine to create haplotypes with high (HYPA), intermediate (LYQA, LYPA), low (LXPA), and defective (HYPD, LYQC, LYPB) circulating MBL 2 levels. Results.  Significant associations were found between variant MBL 2 haplotypes and SGA (LYPA < 32 weeks OR 5. 37, 95 % CI 1. 50 – 17. 27), antepartum hemorrhage (LYPA < 37 weeks OR 2. 29, 95 % CI 1. 25 – 4. 18), and PIHD (LYQC < 32 weeks (OR 17. 89, 95 % CI 2. 20 – 139. 57). Evidence of exposure to infection increased the effect of these associations, (SGA OR 17. 00, 95 % CI 1. 03 – 252. 48; APH OR 5. 67, 95 % CI 1. 73 – 18. 84; PIHD OR 23. 80, 95 % CI 1. 08 – 1414. 76), while no evidence of exposure to infection demonstrated no associations. PTB was significantly associated with the defective HYPD haplotype with evidence of exposure to infection (OR 6. 14, 95 % CI 1. 21 – 29. 89). Conclusions.  This research suggests that the combination of fetal MBL 2 haplotypes and exposure to in utero viral infection increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including PTB, antepartum hemorrhage, small-for-gestational age and PIHD.

40|$|Background Detection {{of unknown}} risks with marketed {{medicines}} {{is key to}} securing the optimal care of individual patients and to reducing the societal burden from adverse drug reactions. Large collections of individual case reports remain {{the primary source of}} information and require effective analytics to guide clinical assessors towards likely drug safety signals. Disproportionality analysis is based solely on aggregate numbers of reports and naively disregards report quality and content. However, these latter features are the very fundament of the ensuing clinical assessment. Objective Our objective was to develop and evaluate a data-driven screening algorithm for emerging drug safety signals that accounts for report quality and content. Methods vigiRank is a predictive model for emerging safety signals, here implemented with shrinkage logistic regression to identify predictive variables and estimate their respective contributions. The variables considered for inclusion capture different aspects of strength of evidence, including quality and clinical content of individual reports, as well as trends in time and geographic spread. A reference set of 264 positive controls (historical safety signals from 2003 to 2007) and 5, 280 negative controls (pairs of drugs and <b>adverse</b> events not <b>listed</b> in the Summary of Product Characteristics of that drug in 2012) was used for model fitting and evaluation; the latter used fivefold cross-validation to protect against over-fitting. All analyses were performed on a reconstructed version of VigiBase® as of 31 December 2004, at around which time most safety signals in our reference set were emerging. Results The following aspects of strength of evidence were selected for inclusion into vigiRank: the numbers of informative and recent reports, respectively; disproportional reporting; the number of reports with free-text descriptions of the case; and the geographic spread of reporting. vigiRank offered a statistically significant improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) over screening based on the Information Component (IC) and raw numbers of reports, respectively (0. 775 vs. 0. 736 and 0. 707, cross-validated). Conclusions Accounting for multiple aspects of strength of evidence has clear conceptual and empirical advantages over disproportionality analysis. vigiRank is a first-of-its-kind predictive model to factor in report quality and content in first-pass screening to better meet tomorrow’s post-marketing drug safety surveillance needs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mirtazapine has {{a unique}} {{mechanism}} of antidepressant action, and thus {{is thought to have}} a different profile of adverse events from that of other antidepressants. OBJECTIVE: To present a methodologically rigorous systematic review of the adverse event profile of mirtazapine and point to possible problems with safety reporting in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the acute-phase treatment of major depression in adults with mirtazapine in comparison with other types of antidepressant. METHODS: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register was electronically searched using the following search terms: 'depress*', 'dysthymi*', 'adjustment disorder*', 'mood disorder*', 'affective disorder', 'affective symptoms' and 'mirtazapine'. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted, and the reference lists of the relevant RCTs were checked, for additional data. No language restriction was imposed. Two authors independently assessed the quality of trials for inclusion in the review. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Two authors independently extracted data on adverse events. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The adequacy of safety reporting was assessed by one author. Regarding the adequacy of safety reporting, the qualitative and quantitative parameters of safety reporting were determined. Regression analyses were conducted to assess characteristics of trials influencing safety reporting. The primary and secondary outcomes in the systematic review of the adverse events associated with mirtazapine were defined as the proportion of patients having each of 43 <b>adverse</b> events <b>listed</b> in the modified version of the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology, and the proportion of patients experiencing at least one adverse event, respectively. Meta-analyses were conducted for these outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-five RCTs involving 4842 patients were identified as meeting our inclusion criteria. With regard to safety reporting, only two trials and no trials were rated as 'adequate' in terms of the reporting of clinical adverse events and laboratory-determined toxicity, respectively. The proportion of text in the results sections of the study reports devoted to safety reporting was a mean of 22 %. No associations were observed between the adequacy of safety reporting and any characteristics of the trials; however, sample size over 100 participants in total and over 50 subjects in a study arm, double blindness and sponsorship by the company marketing mirtazapine were significantly associated with a greater number of reported adverse events in mirtazapine recipients. In terms of individual adverse events, mirtazapine was significantly less likely to cause hypertension or tachycardia (risk ratio [RR] 0. 51) and tremor (RR 0. 43) than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). In comparison with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mirtazapine was significantly more likely to cause weight gain or increased appetite (RR 3. 68), increased salivation (RR 3. 66), somnolence (RR 1. 62) and fatigue (RR 1. 45), but less likely to cause flatulence (RR 0. 26), sweating (RR 0. 28), sexual dysfunction (RR 0. 34), tremor (RR 0. 37), nausea or vomiting (RR 0. 40), sleep disturbance (RR 0. 55) and diarrhoea (RR 0. 61). In comparison with the serotonin-noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine, mirtazapine was significantly more likely to cause fatigue (RR 2. 02), but less likely to cause sleep disturbance (RR 0. 03), sweating (RR 0. 03) and constipation (RR 0. 25). Relative to trazodone, mirtazapine was significantly more likely to cause weight gain or increased appetite (RR 4. 00). Approximately 70 % of patients treated with mirtazapine experienced at least one adverse event, with no significant difference in comparison with other antidepressants. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the paucity of adequate safety reporting in trials comparing mirtazapine with other types of antidepressant in the acute-phase treatment of depression in adults. Based on the available evidence, mirtazapine appears to have a unique adverse-event profile. Using these findings, clinicians can inform their patients, not only of the simple frequency of adverse events with mirtazapine, but also of the relative difference in the frequency of adverse events in comparison with that of other antidepressants, to aid pragmatic clinical decisions...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} introduction {{into the}} topic {{was obtained by}} developing a German-language online course named “Dose adjustment in Patients with Liver Disease” for the “Swiss Virtual Campus” in collaboration with PNN AG, a spin-off company of the ETH Zurich. This {{was followed by the}} German-language publication “Dosage Adaptation in Patients with Liver Disease” in “Grundlagen der Arzneimitteltherapie”, Documed, 2005, and an additional German-language online course for pharmacists named “Dose Adaptation of Drugs in Patients with Liver Insufficiency” published by PNN AG. The documents of these online courses and german publications {{can be found in the}} electronic appendix on CD-ROM. This extensive introduction into the topic was followed by the actual investigational thesis. The aim of the thesis was to define strategies for dose adaptation of drugs in patients with liver disease. The main focus was to compare the prediction of the kinetic behaviour as estimated using hepatic extraction with kinetic studies performed in patients with liver cirrhosis. For this purpose, the antineoplastic drugs and the central nervous agents on the market in Switzerland were studied. In chapter 2 and 3, a general introduction and recommendation of dosing in liver disease is given. Chapter 4 contains a more detailed description of the online course about dose adaptation in liver disease for the Swiss Virtual Campus. Chapter 6 contains the results of the literature research for kinetic studies in liver disease subdivided into the class of antineoplastic drugs (chapter 6. 1) and psychotropic drugs (chapter 6. 2). For each drug, the pharmacokinetic information was collected and drugs were classified according to their bioavailability / hepatic extraction in order to predict their kinetic behaviour in patients with decreased liver function as illustrated in chapter 3. These predictions were compared with kinetic studies in patients with liver disease. Furthermore, both the dose dependent and liver specific <b>adverse</b> reactions were <b>listed,</b> the identified kinetic studies in liver disease summarized for each drug and specific dosing recommendations given. In conclusion, there are currently not enough data for the safe use of cyctostatics and psychotropic drugs in patients with liver disease. There are obvious gaps about the kinetic behaviour of drugs in patients with liver disease, in particular concerning data about hepatic extraction and kinetic studies of drugs with biliary elimination in patients with cholestasis. Pharmaceutical companies should be urged to provide kinetic data (especially hepatic extraction) needed for the classification of such drugs. Kinetic studies should be conducted in patients with impaired liver function for drugs with primarily hepatic metabolism, allowing to give quantitative advise for dose adaptation...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent issue}} of {{increasing}} public focus {{is the need for}} robust, sustainable and climate friendly power transmission and distribution systems that are intelligent, reliable and green. Current power systems create environmental impacts as well as global warming due to utilisation of fossil fuels, especially coal, as carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. In contrast to fossil fuels, renewable energy offers alternative sources of energy which are in general pollution free, technologically effective and environmentally sustainable. It is therefore a fundamental concern today to be able to bring higher percentages of renewable electricity into the energy mix due to the variable nature of many of these resources. The intermittent nature of power output from renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar, introduces potential technical challenges that affect quality of power observed including voltage fluctuation, power system transients and harmonics, reactive power, switching actions, synchronisation, long transmission lines, low power factor, storage system, load management, and forecasting and scheduling. Therefore, the major aim of this research study on the “Experimental investigation and assessment of renewable energy integration into the grid” is to investigate the strategic impacts of integrating renewable energy sources with the grid, including analysis of the potential barriers and possible deployment integration issues of renewable energy into the grid so as to develop a clean-energy system for a sustainable future. The study was divided into five major sections. Firstly, a feasibility study was undertaken to analyse the potentialities of renewable energy sources in Australia, in particular wind and solar energy. The second part of the study predicted the availability and characteristics of variable wind speed and solar radiation as well as typical variations of energy production from renewable sources for adequate management of the power systems with large-scale renewable energy integration. This part also explored the usefulness of integrating renewable energy sources with the power systems, analysing the benefits and outcomes for a typical Australian power network within the subtropical climate of Central Queennsland. From the feasibility study, it can be evident that Australia has significant potential for renewable energy generation that reduces the cost of energy generation and global warming significantly. Forecasting model predicts the solar radiation and wind speed as well as possible energy generation from solar and wind sources in advance in the Capricornia region that can be used by the grid operators for grid management purposes. The major objective of the study is to investigate the strategic impacts of integrating renewable energy sources into the grid. Initially, rigorous experimental analysis was conducted using the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Renewable Energy Integration Facility. Once experimental analysis was performed, a power system model that mimicked the experimental setup was developed using the power system design and analysis simulation tool PSS SINCAL to investigate the strategic impacts of renewable energy integration into the grid. However, to investigate the impacts of large-scale integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, a section of Ergon Energy’s Distribution Network was developoed, in particular the Rockhampton power network. It can be evident from the experimental analysis that integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy introduces harmonics and voltage fluctuations into the network and the level of these impacts increases with the increase of solar PV energy utilisation. Similar findings were also perceived from the simulation analyses. Model analysis clearly indicated that large-scale integration of renewable sources, in particular solar PV and wind, into the grid causes uncertainties in the power network due to the intermittent nature of these sources and the level of impacts that exceeded the regulatory standard defined by the local distribution network service provider (DNSP) for some of the studied case scenarios. The major adverse impacts are voltage regulation, overloading of transformers, poor power factor regulation and current and voltage harmonic distortion into the network which require to be reduced to provide a smooth power supply to the customers. Finally, the study explores possible mitigation measures to reduce the potential <b>adverse</b> impacts <b>listed</b> above and it was observed that integration of optimised STATCOM and energy storage improves the overall power quality of the power network as it enhances voltage regulation and improves power distribution and transformer utilisation and reduces total harmonic distortion of the power network. This vital study will be offered a path toward significant environmental improvement which will assist to reduce global warming and CO 2 emissions substantially. This study will also be helpful for the power utilities and communities to develop a climate-friendly sustainable power system for the future...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the treatment results and adverse drug effects for 14 dogs receiving a new paclitaxel preparat named Paccal vet. The evaluated dogs are chosen to enter a pharmacogenomical study. Therefore, this paper intends to give an introduction to pharmacogenomics. Finally this study also aims at finding the homologue genesequenses in dogs to seven genes that are important for metabolism of paclitaxel in humans. Materials and metods The dogs went through 2 - 4 cycles of paclitaxel treatment, they received a new water-soluble formula named Paccal vet, at dosages of 100 - 150 mg/m 2. Treatment results and <b>adverse</b> effects are <b>listed</b> for each dog in table 1. Gastrointestinal side effects are listed once per dog, bone marrow suppression is listed for each cycle. The dogs’ DNA is prepared from frozen EDTA-bloodsamples. As a result of the creation of different breeds, dogs have very long haplotypes, in which no recombination occurs. Therefore there can’t be an easily accessed map of haplotypes. Instead, one have to assume that by using at least five SNPs per gene of interest all different haplotypes can be covered. After deciding which SNPs to use, the primers for amplifying can be designed by help of different computer programmes. Results All dogs tolerated the substance well; no sensitivity reactions were observed. The most frequent side-effects were bone marrow depression and gastrointestinal upset. At an initial search for the homologue sequences of the chosen genes, only a few were found. The same sequence also showed up for different genes, thus revealing that it may be quite complicated to find the desired homologues, much due to the fact that some of the genes are very similar to each other. Conclusions The fact that dogs seem to tolerate Paccal vet, and the side-effects being manageable, gives a promising future to further studies following up on this small pilot study. It is the first cytostatica made particularly for dogs and also the first paclitaxel preparat tolerated by dogs. However it is a study of very few dogs whom varied greatly in gender, breed, age and size. They also suffered from different diseases in different stages which makes the results unreliable. The further farmacogenomic study of these dogs can although it is small be of great importance. It can show whether the canine genome shows polymorphism in those genes or not. If so, analysis of the results may strengthen the hypothesis that this polymorphism is strongly responsible for the individual variations in dogs as well. The concept of individualizing cancer therapy is one of great appeal, and world wide scientists are digging in to farmacogenomics. Only the future can answer how it will be applied in veterinary medicine. First we need to establish that polymorphism of interesting genes span over breed boundaries, thus it is unrealistic to keep one gene map per breed. However, if this is the case, farmacogenomic testing can prove to be of great value. For dogs with cancer, euthanasia often is a considered alternative, which puts the pet owner and sometimes also the veterinarian in a tough position. It would be of immeasurable value if a simple test could be taken, that answers the question whether this patient has a low or high probability to benefit from treatment. ...|$|R
