Many of the surviving Galka settled in Bastok, and are currently used by the city <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> underclass labour. The Galka {{do not have a}} female counterpart, but reproduce through reincarnation. They possess the highest HP and vitality in the game, but also the lowest MP. The Galka are cursed with rage.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>cheap</b> {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|The Ripper murders mark an {{important}} watershed {{in the treatment}} of crime by journalists. Jack the Ripper was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E

5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts {{and encourage them to}} ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E
5|$|The Mostyns' {{principal}} residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so {{the family}} rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 18th century the gatehouse {{was used as a}} courthouse and the main house <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> housing. In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of partition walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were no offers.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics, but {{contained within the}} reviews were often criticism on {{the execution of the}} story and plot. A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the acting to be satisfactory. Walton of the The Moving Picture News criticized the type of film as invoking sudden and unnatural changes in character {{for the sake of a}} moral lesson. The child's influence and ability to bring sense to her father was seen <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> theatrics, but ended with the assertion that the film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her father was not believable because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|It was {{followed}} by the studio album Mirrors (1979). For Mirrors, instead of working with previous producers Sandy Pearlman (who instead went on to manage Black Sabbath) and Murray Krugman, Blue Öyster Cult chose Tom Werman, who had worked with acts such <b>as</b> <b>Cheap</b> Trick and Ted Nugent. However, the resulting album sales were disappointing.|$|E
25|$|None of {{the rapid}} tests are {{currently}} as sensitive as a thick blood film, nor <b>as</b> <b>cheap.</b> A major drawback {{in the use of}} all current dipstick methods is that the result is essentially qualitative.

25|$|While {{railways}} traditionally sold fully flexible tickets {{that were}} valid on all trains {{on a given}} day or even trains on several days, deregulation and (partial) privatization introduced yield management in the United Kingdom as well as for high speed services in Germany or France. Tickets for the same route can be <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> as 19€ but also go into the triple digits depending on departure time, demand, and the time the ticket is booked.|$|E
25|$|Genale {{was created}} in 1924 {{by a group of}} {{settlers}} from the Italian city of Torino, with the supervision of the Italian governor of the colony. Near the Genale of the colonists and separated by the Shebelle river, soon grew a bigger city populated by Somalis (working <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> labor force in the plantations): the actual Janaale. After WW2 remained only Janaale, while Genale disappeared when the defeated Italians moved away from Somalia.|$|E
25|$|Immigrant monks {{soon began}} {{teaching}} to western audiences, as well. The first Buddhists {{to arrive in}} the United States were Chinese. Hired <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> labor for the railroads and other expanding industries, they established temples in their settlements along the rail lines. At about the same time, immigrants from Japan began to arrive as laborers on Hawaiian plantations and central-California farms. In 1899, they established the Buddhist Missions of North America, later renamed the Buddhist Churches of America.|$|E

25|$|The ROM dates {{the print}} to {{sometime}} between the mid-1820s and 1844; however, {{there are indications}} that the date can be narrowed to between 1830 and 1843. Synthetic blue pigment was not introduced to Japan until 1829, and it is unlikely that expensive natural indigo would be used on a medium <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> as uchiwa-e. Kunisada’s signature is flanked by two circular toshidama-in seals rather than appearing within an oblong, stylized toshidama cartouche. This suggests the print belongs to his early career.|$|E
25|$|The first {{members of}} the Issei did not emigrate {{directly}} to the mainland United States, but to Hawaii (when it was American-controlled but not yet one of the United States). These emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the steamship City of Tokio in February 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in Japan to work in Hawai'i. Their immigration was subsidized by the Hawaiian government, <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> labor was needed for important commodity crops, especially its sugar plantations. Numerous Japanese eventually settled in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|The Pacer {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the formerly unloved cars from the 1970s that are enjoying a resurgence in both collectibility and auto restoration—especially among fans of cars from that era. The Pacer is one of several 1970s cars that were always thought of <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> vehicles; therefore they were poorly maintained, which reduced their life expectancy. Also the heavy engines used in the car put more load on the front suspension than intended, which caused the rack & pinion steering to fail frequently on Pacers built in 1975.|$|E
50|$|Presently, India imports resin {{which is}} far {{superior}} in quality <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>cheaper</b> than the indigenous one. Quality of resin depends on the pinene content. Imported resin contains 75-95% pinenes, whereas chir pine resin contains only about 25% pinenes.|$|R

25|$|The Runaways {{were signed}} to Mercury Records in 1976 and their debut album, The Runaways, was {{released}} shortly after. The band toured the U.S. and played numerous sold-out shows. They opened shows with headlining acts such <b>as</b> <b>Cheap</b> Trick and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The documentary , directed by former Runaway bassist Vicki Blue revealed each girl patterned herself after an idol: Currie on David Bowie, Jett on Suzi Quatro, Ford {{a cross between}} Jeff Beck and Ritchie Blackmore, West on Roger Taylor, and Fox on Gene Simmons.|$|E
25|$|The sugar was {{originally}} added shortly before serving, and therefore did not add carbonation or alcohol to the beverage, as the sugar {{did not have}} the time to ferment. Modern faro beer is still characterized by the use of brown sugar and lambic, but is not always a light beer. The use of meertsbier has disappeared, and modern faro is not viewed <b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> or light. Today, faro is bottled, sweetened, and pasteurized to prevent refermentation in the bottle. Examples are produced by Cantillon, Boon, Lindemans or Mort Subite.|$|E
25|$|Since 1879 {{the colony}} of Fiji had {{imported}} indentured workers (<b>as</b> <b>cheap</b> labour) from India {{to work in}} the European-owned plantations, which produced (according to demand) sea island cotton from the late 1860s to the early 1870s, then copra, then sugarcane from around 1880. This Indian immigration (which ended in 1916) came about because the Pacific Islands (particularly the New Hebrides and the Solomon Islands) couldn't provide enough labour. These islands provided labour from 1864 to 1911, when the European planters in the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides brought about legislation to prevent emigration from those islands.|$|E
