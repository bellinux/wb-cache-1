25|$|Southland Life vacated {{the complex}} when Cityplace Center was opened in 1988. The hotel tower left Sheraton in 1990 and was renamed the Harvey Hotel in 1994. In 1990, a central tower {{addition}} of 25 floors and bay windows was proposed {{to make the}} complex competitive to newer projects going up in the city. However, the office towers sat vacant until 1996, when HBE Corp. purchased the entire 1.5 million-square-foot complex from New York Life, {{as well as the}} entire block across the street, for a total of $40 million. At a further cost of $170 million, HBE redeveloped all three towers into one large hotel and built a convention center on the <b>adjacent</b> <b>block,</b> linked by skybridges. The Harvey Hotel tower remained open throughout the work. HBE placed the finished hotel within their Adam's Mark chain, naming it the Adam's Mark Dallas. The 1844-room hotel opened in October 1998. DART's adjacent light rail line and Pearl Station were major factors in converting the complex into a first-rate convention facility. A parking garage and 3-story convention building were constructed on an adjoining block to the southwest, and the building's facade of glass mosaics was painted gray during the building's conversion.|$|E

We use finite state vector quantization to provide the memory. To further improve performance by exploiting nonstationarities in the image, we use variable block sizes in the encoding. This is done by using a quadtree data structure to represent an encoding based on using variable block sizes. To reduce encoding complexity, hierarchical table lookup schemes are used to replace all the full search encoders...|$|R
