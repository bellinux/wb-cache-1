500|$|The film's {{experimental}} plot and dense dialogue were controversially received. Esquires Mike D'Angelo claimed that [...] "anybody who claims {{he fully understands}} what's going on in Primer after seeing it just once is either a [...] or a liar". Scott Tobias writes for The A.V. Club: [...] "The banter is heavy on technical jargon and almost perversely short on exposition; {{were it not for}} the presence of voiceover narration, the film would be close to incomprehensible." [...] For the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano writes: [...] "sticklers for linear storytelling <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> frustrated by narrative threads that start promisingly, then just sort of fall off the spool". Some reviewers were entirely put off by the film's obfuscated narrative. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter complained that Primer [...] "nearly gets lost in a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture".|$|E
500|$|The Daily Times also {{supported}} the government's position and added, [...] "Let us be clear. No government can violate the universal principle of 'no negotiation with terrorists' and {{live to be}} praised." [...] The News was more critical, stating, [...] "Once 'Operation Silence' is over, the firing stops, the dust settles down and the bodies are counted, there <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> many questions raised. Why didn't the government take action earlier against the clerics because had that been the case so many lives {{would not have been}} lost? Why were the Lal Masjid elements allowed so much leeway that the complex became almost like a state within a state, complete with a moral policing force which acted with impunity enforcing a rigid interpretation of Islam on the city's residents? How did so many hardened militants, reportedly some foreigners among them, make their way inside the compound situated in the heart of Islamabad?".|$|E
500|$|Much {{critical}} {{attention has}} been given {{to the development of the}} characters from the original book, 25 years on. One review opined that [...] " [...] characters are incapable of growth. They cannot credibly find Jesus or even see a skilled psychologist or take the right medication to fend off despair. They <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> American psychos." [...] Their development, some critics have observed, illuminates the ways they have not developed as people; Clay is, for example, [...] "in mind and spirit if not quite in body, destined to remain unchanged, undeveloped, unlikable and unloved." [...] In Less Than Zero, though the characters of the novel compose for some [...] "the most hollow and vapid representation of the MTV generation one could possibly imagine", they remained to other reviewers [...] "particularly sympathetic". Like the novel, its characters were equally cultural milestones, described by a reviewer as [...] "seminal characters" [...] (of American fiction). On the subject of the 1987 film, Clay describes that [...] "the parents who ran the studio would ever expose their children in the same black light the book did". To Bill Eichenberger, this shows how [...] "the children have become the parents, writing scripts and producing movies, still imprisoned by Hollywood's youth and drug cultures – but now looking at things from the outside in." [...] Eisinger comments for the New York Press, that while [...] "they're in careers now and new relationships and different states of mind... their preoccupations are just the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|A 2006 article {{reported}} {{incidents of}} violence, disputes and discrimination against Dalits in Maharashtra. The article noted that non-Dalit families claimed {{they do not}} treat Dalits differently. A carpenter caste person said, [...] "We tell them anything and they tell us you are pointing fingers at us because of our caste; we all live together, and there <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fights, but they think we target them." ...|$|E

2500|$|On a web search engine, input [...] "novels" [...] and [...] "length" [...] and {{you will}} find tables of word counts, {{separating}} out novels from novellas, even from the esoteric and still shorter [...] "novelette"—as though prose works were dog show contestants, needing to be entered into proper categories. But when it comes to writing, any distinctions that begin with an objective and external quality like size <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> misleading. The delicate, gem-like jigsaw of Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Ray [...] could not be more unlike the feverishly cunning philosophical monologue of Albert Camus' The Fall, but both novels are about the same length.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the basic}} {{variegated}} anatomical {{structure of the}} brain is laid down during early development, it {{is more or less}} fixed. But given the numerous and diverse collection of available circuitry, there <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> functionally equivalent albeit anatomically non-isomorphic neuronal groups capable of responding to certain sensory input. This creates a competitive environment where circuit groups proficient in their responses to certain inputs are [...] "chosen" [...] through the enhancement of the synaptic efficacies of the selected network. This leads to an increased probability that the same network will respond to similar or identical signals at a future time. This occurs through the strengthening of neuron-to-neuron synapses. And these adjustments allow for neural plasticity along a fairly quick timetable.|$|E
2500|$|The main idol in {{the temple}} is of Tirthankara Rishabha, carved in black stone in padmasana posture, about [...] tall. [...] Two oxen are carved {{in the center of}} the simhasana (platform) of the main idol, which also has 16 dreams of the mother of Tirthankar. Surrounding the main deity, there are 23 idols, 2 {{standing}} and 21 seated, in an ashtadhatu (composed of eight metals) parikar. Here, pilgrims <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lost in unstinted devotion; both Jain and non-Jain visitors and pilgrims experience a sort of sacredness, thanks due to the simply indescribable aura of the image of Shri Prabhu. The round face of Shri Prabhu is extremely attractive and pleasing to the mind. The whole temple, with the main inner apartment, the deep pandal, nine chowkis, the assembly pandal, the Bhamati, the small shrines of gods, the Shrungara chowki, the peak and the encircling fort is simply majestic. Even from a distance, the gorgeous 52 Jinalayas can enrapture the viewer. In the north and south sides of the Khela Mandapa of the temple, idols of Tirthankaras Vasupujya, Mallinath, Neminath, Parshvanath and Mahavir Swami (collectively referred to as Panch-Balayati) are installed.|$|E
