40|$|The {{frequency}} of kinetochore (centromere) -positive micronuclei (MN) was determined in 32 fibroblast cell lines. We tested 16 probands with spontaneously high MN levels (greater {{than or equal}} to 20 MN/ 500 cells (4 %] and 8 probands (controls) with low MN levels (less {{than or equal to}} 13 MN/ 500 cells (2. 6 %]. To study whether the elevation of MN levels is due to increased chromosomal breakage we used the <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibody</b> fluorescent staining method. Probands with spontaneously high MN had kinetochore-positive MN increased by a factor 2. 1 compared to the controls whereas the kinetochore-negative MN were increased by a factor 6. 14. This shows that spontaneous elevation of MN is mainly caused by increased chromosomal breakage and only in a minor proportion by chromosome segregation errors as a consequence of spindle defects...|$|E
40|$|If mouse {{bone marrow}} {{preparations}} {{are treated with}} a classical C-banding procedure, {{it may be possible}} to distinguish between micronuclei with or without centromeres. This allows discrimination between micronuclei originating from chromosome breakage and those originating from chromosome loss. Thus, using C-banding, the micronucleus test can be used not only for the detection of clastogens but also aneugens. In this way, more exhaustive methods such as immunological staining using <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies</b> may not be necessary.

40|$|Two pesticides, {{organophosphate}} phosphamidon (PHO) and organochlorine dieldrin (DED) were assayed by {{the mouse}} bone marrow micronucleus test, {{to ascertain whether}} they showed genotoxic activity in vivo. Two doses, sub-lethal (PHO = 3 mg/kg b. wt.; DED = 60 mg/kg b. wt.) and lethal (PHO = 5 mg/kg b. wt.; DED = 90 mg/kg b. wt.), of each substance were administered intraperitoneally to 9 - 10 -week old CBA male mice, in acute and repeated exposure. The sub-lethal dose was also administered at two different times and twice at 24 -h intervals. Both PHO and DED proved able to induce a dose-dependent increase of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE). The two pesticides also showed a different detoxification time. Furthermore, the CREST staining with <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies</b> allowed us {{to conclude that the}} two chemicals are clastogens...|$|R
40|$|Some {{chromosomes}} in transformed rat {{cells and}} somatic cell hybrids fail {{to display the}} presence of kinetochore proteins as detected by <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Suchchromosomes (K- Chromosomes) may constitute a novel mechanism for the genesis of aneuploidy. Wehave analyzed primary~ immortalized and malignant marnmalian cells {{for the presence of}} kinetochore proteins and micronuclei. Our resuJts suggest a correlation of the K- chromosome and micronucleus frequency with the variability in chromosome number. Upon in situ hybridization with the minor satellite and alpha satellite sequences some Kchromosomes showed a signal. This indicates that the observed lack of kinetocbores is not necessarily {{due to a lack of}} centromeric DNA. We conclude that dislocated K- chromosomes may become incorporated into micronuclei which are prone to loss. Such events would be associated with the generation of aneuploidy...|$|R
40|$|The kinetochore-containing {{micronuclei}} induced in CHO cells by clastogenic and aneuploidogenic substances, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or colchicine, were {{distinguished by}} means of a technique based on the use of human CREST <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Both substances induced their expected effects. However, 48 hours after the end of treatment, colchicine and MMC induced a significant increase of CREST- and CREST+ micronuclei, respectively, suggesting an induction of clastogenicity by colchicine and of aneuploidy by MMC. These results were confirmed by the characterisation of the micronuclei induced by the same substances in gill cells of the marine mussel, Mytilus, treated in vivo. A cytofluorimetric analysis on the isolated gill of this animal showed that the cell cycle remained unaltered until almost 24 hours after excision. This suggests the possibility of using the isolated gill of Mytilus as a new biological system for laboratory experiments...|$|R
40|$|The last 25 {{years have}} seen an ever-growing use of the {{erythrocyte}} micronucleus test for measuring damage to mammalian chromosomes in vivo. In addition, staining micronuclei with <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies</b> from CREST serum discriminates aneugenic from clastogenic damage. The use of the micronucleus test in rats, however, has been problematic because the spleen of adult rats efficiently removes micronucleated erythrocytes from the blood. In the present study, we have treated 5 -day-old rats with either X-rays (a clastogen) or vinblastine (an aneugen) and measured micronuclei in erythrocytes from the blood and liver. Each treatment increased the frequency of micronuclei in both tissues, with the percentages of CREST-staining micronuclei reflecting the mechanism of micronucleus induction by the two agents. The results indicate that performing the micronucleus assay in the liver and peripheral blood of 5 -day-old rats may be a useful approach for detecting the in vivo genotoxicity of chemical and physical agents...|$|R
40|$|We used {{antisera}} {{from patients}} with the CREST syndrome of scleroderma (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) to show that an antigenic component of the kinetochore present in metaphase chromosomes is also present in nonhistone chromosome scaffolds isolated following extensive digestion of the DNA and extraction of the bulk of chromosomal protein. All sera from 12 scleroderma CREST patients previously shown by immunofluorescence microscopy to have circulating <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies</b> recognise a protein of Mr 77, 000 (CREST- 77) in an immunoblotting assay. 9 of the 12 sera also recognise an antigen of Mr 110, 000 (CREST- 110). These proteins are present in isolated chromosomes and nonhistone scaffolds derived from them by two different procedures. Sera of five scleroderma CREST patients who are antikinetochore negative (by immunofluorescence) bind to neither protein in immunoblots.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for {{the characterization of}} kinetochore-containing (CREST+) micronuclei (MN), based {{on the use of}} <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies</b> (derived from CREST patients) and indirect immunofluorescence, was applied to mouse bone marrow erythrocytes. The proposed protocol allows us to obtain fluorescent signals of good quality and highly reproducible data. The clastogenic agent mitomycin C (MMC; 1 mg/kg body wt) and the two aneugenic compounds chloral hydrate (CH; 200 mg/kg body wt) and colchicine (COL; 1 mg/kg body wt) were used to verify the sensitivity of this approach to chemicals with different mechanisms of action. These compounds were tested at a 20 h time interval from treatment and all of them were able to significantly increase (P < 0. 001) the frequency of MN in polychromatic erythrocytes. Of the MN observed in preparations from control animals, 45 % were CREST+ and this percentage increased significantly (P < 0. 001) after treatment with CH or COL. On the contrary, only 22 % CREST+ MN were found after treatment with MMC (statistical comparison with the control value: P < 0. 001). The CREST characterization of MN induced in vivo in mouse bone marrow allows us to infer the origin of MN formation, thus contributing to the identification of aneugenic agents...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} the kinetics of the induction of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei (MN) by mitomycin C (MMC, 0. 1 &mgr;g/ml) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells treated with cytochalasin B (Cyt-B, 3 &mgr;g/ml). In cells treated with Cyt-B {{as well as}} with Cyt-B plus MMC the highest yield of binucleated cells was obtained 24 h after treatment. After 40 h of treatment with Cyt-B the frequency of MN in binucleated cells was significantly higher than that observed at previous times in the same cultures as well as in controls. In cultures treated with MMC the frequency of MN increased with time, reaching the highest value at 24 h. The frequency of chromosomal aberrations was also significantly higher in cells treated both with Cyt-B and Cyt-B plus MMC than in controls and exceeded that of MN in parallel cultures. These data confirm the capacity of MMC to induce chromosomal alterations in mammalian cells; in particular they indicate that Cyt-B is able to induce cytogenetic effects in CHO cells. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, after reaction with CREST <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies,</b> we found that in cells treated with Cyt-B or Cyt-B plus MMC the frequency of MN without kinetochore was, respectively, about 70 and 85 %, indicating that under our experimental conditions MN originate mainly from acentric chromatid fragments. Present data suggest that the method based on the blockage of cytokinesis by Cyt-B normally used in the MN assay should be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of kinetochore and DNA synthesis in micronuclei (MN) induced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by clastogenic and aneuploidogenic substances such as mitomycin C (MMC) and colchicine {{was determined by}} immunofluorescence technique using CREST <b>antikinetochore</b> <b>antibodies</b> and anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) antibodies. A cytofluorimetric analysis was also performed. Colchicine significantly increased micronucleated cells at least up to 96 h {{from the end of}} treatment. As expected, among colchicine-induced micronucleated cells the majority contained at least one CREST + MN. MMC induced a significant increase in micronucleated cells up to 120 h from the end of treatment and the great majority of MN lacked kinetochore fluorescence, indicating that MMC-induced MN were derived from acentric fragments. However, colchicine and MMC at 48 and 72 h from the end of treatment induced a significant increase of CREST- and CREST + MN, respectively, suggesting an induction of clastogenicity by colchicine and aneuploidy by MMC. The clastogenic effect of colchicine after 48 h was also confirmed by the {{presence of}} chromatid fragments in metaphase cells. A cytofluorimetric analysis indicated that, as aspected, colchicine and MMC interfere with the G 2 /M and S phases, respectively; however, a slight interference of colchicine with the S phase was also observed. DNA synthesis was present in MN and it was in most cases synchronous with synthesis in the main nucleus. The frequency of cells with MN in S phase observed in untreated or MMC-treated cells is in agreement with the proportion of cells without MN showing DNA synthesis. On the contrary, the frequency of cells with MN in S phase observed in colchicine-treated cells was significantly lower than that observed in control and MMC-treated cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequencies}} of micronuclei (MNi) in the gill {{cells of the}} mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis were determined {{over a long period}} (up to 28 days) following a 48 -h treatment with colchicine. The frequency of MNi at the end of treatment was significantly higher than in controls and 24 h later it had increased even more. After this period, the frequency of MNi rapidly declined until a plateau level was reached on day 2 - 3, which was significantly higher than the control baseline level, and persisted {{until the end of the}} experiment (28 th day). In the same cell system we previously reported a persistence of an increased frequency of MNi after treatment with mitomycin C (MMC) (Majone et al., 1987). In order to establish the origin of MNi, the difference between their size distribution in MMC- and colchicine-treated animals was determined at the end of treatment as well as during the plateau phase. The difference was statistically significant (P less than 0. 001) at the end of treatment, the MNi induced by MMC being smaller than those induced by colchicine. However, the difference during the plateau phase was not statistically significant. Human CREST <b>antikinetochore</b> fluorescent <b>antibodies</b> reacted with chromosome centromeres of Mytilus and were applied to gill cells at the end of a 48 -h treatment with MMC or colchicine. About 60 % of the MNi induced by colchicine but only 30 % of those produced by MMC reacted positively with the fluorescent antibodies. This result indicates that the majority of MNi observed at the end of a 48 -h treatment with MMC or colchicine originate, respectively, from acentric chromosome fragments and from whole lagging chromosomes...|$|R
