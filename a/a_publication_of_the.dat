Moore judges that the article was neither well written nor particularly persuasive, but notes that other writers at the time made the connection between sport, cricket, the ideology of the British Empire and Fascism.|$|E

500|$|It {{was in this}} milieu that Dada was born, at {{some point}} before May 1916, when <b>a</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same name first saw print. The story of its {{establishment}} {{was the subject of}} a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a monocle, entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his [...] "scandalized spectators", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on stilts, and returning in clown attire. The same type of performances took place at the Zunfthaus zur Waag beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down. According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for as long as it lasted, [...] "the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired." [...] Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of Alfred Jarry, André Gide, Christian Morgenstern, Jean-Pierre Brisset, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jacques Vaché, Marcel Duchamp or Francis Picabia.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, {{both men}} {{appeared}} before police magistrate A. H.

Unwin opted for a jury trial, while Powell elected to be tried by a judge alone. Unwin's trial proceeded first, on November 12. He testified that he had ordered the pamphlets, which were {{paid for by the}} government, and then circulated them as <b>a</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "United Democrats", a fictitious organization that listed its address as that of Unwin's home. According to Unwin, the leaflet's text, minus the named individuals, had been provided to him by Powell, he had sent it to the printer's in exactly that form, and he was surprised to see the list of names in the final version. [...] Though his testimony was vague and apparently evasive, he admitted to destroying 4,000 copies of the leaflet {{on the day of the}} police raid. [...] He was convicted and Ives, dismissing his role in the affair as that of an [...] "errand boy", sentenced him to three months hard labour.|$|E
