5|$|Unlike phylogenetic studies {{based on}} {{morphological}} traits, molecular {{analyses of the}} internal phylogeny of the ants have given strong evidence that the <b>armadillo</b> ants are neither closely related to nor nested within the Myrmicinae. Brady et al. (2006), Moreau et al. (2006) and Rabeling et al. (2008) reconstructed phylogenetic trees with the agroecomyrmecines inside the 'poneroid' group of subfamilies, close to the Paraponerinae, and gave support for {{the exclusion of the}} genus from the Myrmicinae, a subfamily located inside the 'formicoid' clade. Given the early appearance of the Agroecomyrmecinae in the geologic record, the similarities of <b>armadillo</b> ants to Myrmicinae were hypothesized to represent convergence and/or retention of plesiomorphic forms.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{elongate}} organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, <b>Armadillo</b> girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.|$|E

40|$|Nine-banded <b>armadillos</b> (Dasypus novemcinctus) are {{naturally}} infected with Mycobacterium leprae {{and have been}} implicated in zoonotic transmission of leprosy. Early studies found this disease mainly in Texas and Louisiana, but <b>armadillos</b> in the southeastern United States appeared {{to be free of}} infection. We screened 645 <b>armadillos</b> from 8 locations in the southeastern United States not known to harbor enzootic leprosy for M. leprae DNA and antibodies. We found M. leprae-infected <b>armadillos</b> at each location, and 106 (16. 4 %) animals had serologic/PCR evidence of infection. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism variable number tandem repeat genotyping/genome sequencing, we detected M. leprae genotype 3 I- 2 -v 1 among 35 <b>armadillos.</b> Seven <b>armadillos</b> harbored a newly identified genotype (3 I- 2 -v 15). In comparison, 52 human patients from the same region were infected with 31 M. leprae types. However, 42. 3 % (22 / 52) of patients were infected with 1 of the 2 M. leprae genotype strains associated with <b>armadillos.</b> The geographic range and complexity of zoonotic leprosy is expanding. 26583204 PMC 467243...|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that Desmatosuchus could have been omnivorous or even an insectivore. This is because of several similarities between Desmatosuchus and <b>armadillos.</b> For instance, both groups are armored. They possess long snouts that lack teeth on the end. Also, {{there is evidence of}} bees, wasps, and termites in the Late Triassic, meaning that Desmatosuchus had access to insects that <b>armadillos</b> prey on. Their teeth are somewhat similar in shape, although <b>armadillos</b> have more peg like teeth. Both Desmatosuchus and <b>armadillos</b> typically carry around 6 teeth on their dentaries. Both <b>armadillos</b> and Desmatosuchus have hypertrophied processes present on their limbs, which indicates large limb muscles. This connection is more tenuous, however, since Desmatosuchus have a crest over their hind limbs but lack one on their forelimbs, meaning that they likely didnt have the musculature for digging with their arms the way <b>armadillos</b> do. In spite of these parallels, the general consensus is still that Desmatosuchus was most likely herbivorous.|$|R

The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species.

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} Sonic games, Knuckles' Chaotix was not {{developed}} by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. Development {{on the game}} {{can be traced back}} to a 1994 internal prototype for the Sega Genesis. Titled Sonic Crackers, it featured Sonic and Tails, and the developers experimented with the ring force bond physics. This core concept was carried over to the more powerful 32X add-on, where development continued under the working title Knuckles' Ringstar. Sonic and Tails were removed from the game and replaced by Knuckles and four other characters. Among these was Mighty the <b>Armadillo,</b> who featured previously in SegaSonic the Hedgehog (1993).|$|E
5|$|At an {{appearance}} at the <b>Armadillo</b> World Headquarters, a music venue in Austin, Texas, Nelson met publisher and screenwriter William D. Wittliff. Because {{of the success of}} the album, Wittliff decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red Headed Stranger. In 1979 Wittliff finished a draft of the project, which was turned over to Universal Studios. The studio budgeted the film at $14 million and sent the script to Robert Redford, who turned it down. The movie project was tabled, and Wittliff and Nelson had to buy the script back from Universal. The script then went to HBO, who assigned the project a budget of $5 million, but this project was not completed either. Finally, Nelson and Wittliff decided to finance the film themselves. Nelson portrayed the role of the stranger, and the movie was released in 1986.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Armadillos</b> {{have a life}} {{expectancy}} of 7 to 20 years. Juveniles lack fully developed and strengthened armor and are much more susceptible to predation, thereby having a much higher mortality rate than adults.

Since juvenile mortality rates are much higher, this most likely indicates an increased ability of adults to escape from predators. Strangely, various physical damages caused to <b>armadillos</b> do not appear to have any significant consequences in breeding or other physical functions.

5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that {{the range of the}} marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct giant <b>armadillo</b> Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a rubber band, and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the <b>Armadillo</b> can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E

25|$|The core of beta-catenin {{consists}} of several very characteristic repeats, each approximately 40 amino acids long. Termed <b>armadillo</b> repeats, all these elements fold {{together into a}} single, rigid protein domain with an elongated shape – called <b>armadillo</b> (ARM) domain. An average <b>armadillo</b> repeat is composed of three alpha helixes. The first repeat of β-catenin (near the N-terminus) is slightly different from the others – as it has an elongated helix with a kink, formed by the fusion of helices 1 and 2. Due to the complex shape of individual repeats, the whole ARM domain is not a straight rod: it possesses a slight curvature, so that an outer (convex) and an inner (concave) surface is formed. This inner surface serves as a ligand-binding site for the various interaction partners of the ARM domains.|$|E
