The authors assessed the presence of evidence-based information <b>about</b> <b>child</b> maltreatment fatalities and risk factors for death in 24 social science textbooks <b>about</b> <b>child</b> abuse and neglect or child welfare. The results indicate that basic information, such as definitions and incidence rates of child maltreatment fatalities are routinely included in social science textbooks, but information <b>about</b> <b>child,</b> parent, and household risk factors are not, and that inaccurate information is often included. Implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R

So that Rule No. 23 / 2002 <b>about</b> <b>Child</b> Protection could be seen as transformation of Fiqh Hadhanah which had wider scope, not only in family, but also larger role in child protection. Rule No. 23 / 2002 <b>about</b> <b>Child</b> Protection material, Islamic Law Compilation and Rule No. 1 / 1974 about marriage were implementation of Fiqh Hadhanah.

25|$|Dr. Paul Lemoine of Nantes, France {{had already}} {{published}} {{a study in}} a French medical journal in 1968 <b>about</b> <b>children</b> with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics, and in the U.S., Christy Ulleland and colleagues at the University of Washington Medical School had conducted an 18-month study in 1968–1969 documenting the risk of maternal alcohol consumption among the offspring of 11 alcoholic mothers. The Washington and Nantes findings were confirmed by a research group in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1979. Researchers in France, Sweden, and the United States were struck by how similar these children looked, though they were not related, and how they behaved in the same unfocused and hyperactive manner.|$|E
25|$|The CASI {{began as}} two {{separate}} measures that {{were developed to}} assist clinicians in obtaining information about youths from their caregivers. Although a variety of checklists were already available, most were not clearly connected to the diagnostic system used by psychiatry and many other professions. The authors saw this need and began to create a symptom checklist in 1984 {{that was based on}} the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Their goal was to obtain information <b>about</b> <b>children</b> who were receiving special education services so that they could assign them into groups based on their learning and behavioral problems that were more relevant to conventional psychiatric diagnoses (need citation). In this way, the measures helped gather information that helped the clinician form a diagnostic impression. The items also rated the severity of the symptoms. Adding them created a severity score that help guide selection of treatment targets. The original motivation for developing the checklist was to aid with research and gathering of fairly large amounts of data in schools; however, the creators soon saw the possible application of these symptom inventories in clinical settings. To that end, they began work in 1986 on an instrument that would be used by teachers and parents to give a comprehensive look at a youth's emotional and behavioral symptoms. This led to the earliest measure related to the CASI- the Stony Brook Child Symptom Inventory-3 (CSI-3). In 1987 this was followed by the CSI-3R based on the revised third edition of the DSM (DSM-III-R). The CSI-3R included both teacher and parent checklists. The teacher checklist focused on youth behaviors more likely take place in a school setting. In 1990, Dr. Gabrielle Carlson adapted the parent checklist from the CSI-3R for use with adolescents, which became the first version of the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI-3R). After the fourth edition of the DSM was published in 1994, the CSI-4 was developed in response to those changes. The CSI-4 was available in both Spanish and English. In 1995, the ASI was also updated to the ASI-4 to account for modifications in the DSM.|$|E
