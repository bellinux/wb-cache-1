5|$|In San Antonio de Béxar, Ugartechea <b>asked</b> <b>Dr.</b> Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales {{resident}} in town on personal business, to help Castañeda convince the settlers to follow orders. When Smither arrived on October 1, {{he met with}} militia captain Mathew Caldwell to explain that the soldiers meant no harm if the settlers would peacefully relinquish the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Castañeda to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Castañeda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} several story ideas, Heuton and Falacci wanted to feature {{a case in}} which math was used to solve a traditional type of crime. They decided to base the episode on a real-life serial rapist case in which police <b>asked</b> <b>Dr.</b> Kim Rossmo to assist them in the investigation. In 1998, Rossmo, then with the Vancouver Police Department, was called in to help Lafayette, Louisiana, police investigator McCullan Gallien find the South Side Rapist. Rossmo and Gallien visited the crime scenes, and Rossmo used criminal geographic targeting, a mathematical model used to find the area in which the suspect would most likely reside. Together, Rossmo and Gallien developed a map indicating the most likely location of the rapist's residence. After DNA cleared everyone living in the area, Gallien learned that a sheriff's deputy in a neighboring department, Randy Comeaux, was a potential suspect. He had lived in the area during the time frame of the rapes but moved to a residence in the neighboring jurisdiction some time later. DNA on a cigarette butt left by Comeaux confirmed that he was the rapist, and Comeaux was arrested.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2007, CMLL's annual Gran Alternativa tournament {{took place}} at Arena Mexico. Guerrero teamed up with Euforia, but the team was {{defeated}} by Místico and his partner La Sombra. After the loss Guerrero publicly <b>asked</b> <b>Dr.</b> Wagner, Jr. to join him for a challenge to Místico and Negro Casas for the CMLL Tag Team Championship. The match was held on July 13, 2007 at Arena Mexico and saw Guerrero and Wagner win the championship. A week later Guerrero and Wagner lost the titles back to Místico and Casas, making the team the shortest reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champions ever. The loss caused the two fighting in mutual accusations of betrayal, which in turn led to a feud between the two wrestlers. On July 27, at Arena Mexico, Dr. Wagner, Jr. and Místico held a mano a mano match which was decided by a treacherous intervention by Guerrero, who climbed into the ring, attacked Wagner from behind and caused him to lose the match, then the aftermath, Guerrero ripped off Wagner's mask. On August 3, 2007, Guerrero teamed up with Atlantis and Sangre Azteca against Dr. Wagner Jr., Alex Koslov and Volador Jr. at Arena México after the match Guerrero took the microphone and challenged Wagner for a mask versus mask match but no match ever came of it as Dr. Wagner, Jr. left CMLL shortly after. In 2008 Último Guerrero teamed with newcomer Dragón Rojo Jr. to win the 2008 Gran Alternativa tournament.|$|E

25|$|Bat Masterson {{became more}} widely {{known as a}} gunfighter {{as a result of}} a {{practical}} joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the reporter <b>asked</b> <b>Dr.</b> W.S. Cockrell about mankillers. Dr. Cockrell pointed to a young man nearby and said it was Bat and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with several lurid tales about Bat's exploits, and the reporter wrote them up for the New York Sun. The story was then widely reprinted in papers all over the country. Cockrell subsequently apologized to Bat, who insisted he was not even in Gunnison at the time.|$|E

25|$|An {{examination}} of the contents obtained from the stomachs of frogs revealed that ninety percent of their food consisted of crabs, insects, and the larvae of insects, all of which harmed the rice crop. Based on the study, a paper 'On the Export of Frogs' Legs from India' {{was published in the}} Journal of the BNHS. In 1979, a Parliamentary Committee examined a report based on the study and <b>asked</b> <b>Dr</b> Sálim Ali, then a Member of the Rajya Sabha, if a ban on the export of frogs' legs was feasible. Dr Sálim Ali supported the ban, which was ultimately recommended by the committee. All frogs of the genus Rana are now protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{said on the}} episode's DVD audio {{commentary}} {{that while}} the episode was [...] "full of funny moments", it caused [...] "nothing but trouble" [...] to {{the staff of the}} show. One of the troubles was that after the episode had been written by Swartzwelder, an unsolicited writer sent the staff a script which contained a virtually identical story. To avoid a lawsuit, the staff paid him US$3000 and went forward with the episode. Material cut from the episode's script included many couples who were supposed to be at the retreat instead of the Flanders family, such as Mr. Burns and his mail-order bride, and Mrs. Krabappel trying to reunite with her estranged husband Ken Krabappel. Reiss said the scene played out [...] "horribly badly", and it appeared as if Mr. Burns's mail-order bride was a prostitute. The Ken Krabappel character was supposed to be based on singer Dean Martin, but somehow he ended up with a southern accent that made him sound like a hick. The whole scene was rewritten with help from producer James L. Brooks and it was completed after several hours. A scene in which Moe <b>asked</b> <b>Dr.</b> Hibbert to cure his discolored feces was also removed during the first reading of the script after a complaint by Brooks. Series creator Matt Groening later expressed an objection to the ending, which sees General Sherman jumping {{out of the water and}} winking at the camera, believing it to be overly cartoony.|$|E

2500|$|Locke was cremated, and his remains {{turned over}} to Dr. Arthur Fauset, an {{anthropologist}} who was a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Fauset was Locke's close friend, and executor of his estate. Fauset died in 1983, and the remains were given to his friend, Reverend Sadie Mitchell. Mitchell ministered at African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Philadelphia. Mitchell retained the ashes until the mid-1990s, when she <b>asked</b> <b>Dr.</b> J. Weldon Norris, a professor of music at Howard University, to take the ashes to Washington, D.C. [...] The ashes then resided at Howard University's Moorland–Spingarn Research Center until 2007. Concerned that the human remains were not properly cared for, the ashes were given to Howard University's W. Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, which had extensive experience handling human remains. Locke's ashes, which were stored in a plain paper bag in a simple round metal container, were transferred to a more appropriate small funerary urn. They were locked in a safe to keep them secure.|$|E
