5|$|Shadrick's {{family was}} {{informed}} {{of his death}} by <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> had heard his name on a radio broadcast, and the news from the military came via telegraph several days later. The family was immediately inundated by reporters and local well-wishers. Shadrick's body was returned to the United States, and on June 17, 1951, a funeral attended by hundreds of local residents was held in Beckley, West Virginia. The service was set {{to coincide with the}} anniversary of the start of the war. His flag-draped casket was escorted down the streets of the town on a horse-drawn carriage, and he was buried at the American Legion cemetery in the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} season premiere, the {{fugitive}} couple, {{now under the}} aliases of Angie and Nick Bolen, buys a house on Wisteria Lane in Fairview, Eagle State, with their nineteen-year-old son, Danny (Beau Mirchoff). While Angie hesitantly befriends the other women on the street, Danny takes a liking to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> eventually rejects his attempts to form a romantic relationship. When Julie falls into a coma after being strangled, Danny is the prime suspect, thus creating tension between Angie and Julie's mother, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher). However, Danny is cleared of all charges when his alibi is validated. Meanwhile, neighbor Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) befriends Angie while experiencing a nervous breakdown {{as a result of}} Mike Delfino (James Denton) marrying Susan rather than her. When Katherine begins to question Angie's past, Angie tells Susan that Katherine may have strangled Julie as an act of revenge.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{respond to}} a corpse found in the woods, next to a van full of low-quality marijuana. Munch proves {{to be an expert}} on hemp, and {{discusses}} how the plant was grown by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer, and Bolander finds <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> saw Jones holding a gun to the victim's head the night before the murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to answer. That night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E

25|$|In his {{rebuttal}} closing argument, {{defense attorney}} Art Hanes Jr. attacked the evidence {{presented by the}} prosecution as being purely circumstantial, adding that similar circumstantial evidence had earlier seen Chambliss acquitted of the church bombing in 1963. Hanes also harked towards the testimony {{of several of the}} 12 witnesses the defense had called to testify as to Chambliss's whereabouts {{on the day of the}} bombing, including a policeman and <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> had each testified as to Chambliss being at the home of a man named Clarence Dill on the day of the bombing.|$|E
25|$|Intentional torts include, among others, certain torts {{arising from}} the {{occupation}} or use of land. The tort of nuisance, for example, involves strict liability for <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> interferes with another's enjoyment of his real property. Trespass allows owners to sue for entrances by a person (or his structure, such as an overhanging building) on their land. Several intentional torts do not involve land. Examples include false imprisonment, the tort of unlawfully arresting or detaining someone, and defamation (in some jurisdictions split into libel and slander), where false information is broadcast and damages the plaintiff's reputation.|$|E
25|$|The popular {{image is}} of Johnny Appleseed {{spreading}} apple seeds randomly everywhere he went. In fact, he planted nurseries rather than orchards, built fences around them {{to protect them}} from livestock, left the nurseries in the care of <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> sold trees on shares, and returned every year or two to tend the nursery. His first nursery was planted on the bank of Brokenstraw Creek, south of Warren, Pennsylvania. Next, he seems to have moved to Venango County along the shore of French Creek, but many of these nurseries were in the Mohican area of north-central Ohio. This area included the towns of Mansfield, Lisbon, Lucas, Perrysville, and Loudonville.|$|E

She is first seen in season 2, where she attends Kayla's and Ben's playgroups. In season 3, she {{is seen as an}} overbearing board president, shutting down the rooftop beach but later gets voted out of the position by Ben, Tucker and Danny. In season 4, she suspects her husband is cheating on her, and has an affair with Tucker.|$|R

25|$|Diana Rebollar, 9, {{was killed}} on August 8, 1994. She had been beaten, sexually {{assaulted}} and strangled. She lived in the Heights area of Houston, {{at the front of}} a small duplex. One day, she went to the neighborhood store to buy a bag of sugar. Employees of the store saw her leave the store safely, but she never returned home. She was found the next day on a loading dock behind a building. One lead for police was given by <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> described a van that frequented the area. She was connected to the Carmen Del Estrada case by the killer's MO: a rope with a bamboo stick attached was found around her neck.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. <b>A</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E

His last name comes from Flanders St. in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. When he was created, he was intended to just be <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> was very nice, but whom Homer loathed.|$|E

500|$|The next morning, Tim is {{visited by}} <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> warns him that digging for buried {{items in the}} {{backyard}} {{is a bad idea}} and says that the site was once the [...] "Chicano Hall of Fame". Soon afterwards, Max returns to pick up her purse and finds Tim digging again. She joins him and discovers a plastic bag filled with bones. Meanwhile, Lee goes to visit her sister Squiggy (Melanie Lynskey) and brother-in-law Bob (Ron Livingston) for an afternoon after complaining to her mother that she no longer feels she has an identity outside of being a mother and wife.|$|E
500|$|In Scotland and Ireland, {{the first}} farmer {{to finish the}} grain harvest made a corn dolly, {{representing}} the Cailleach (also called [...] "the Carlin or Carline"), from the last sheaf of the crop. The figure would then be tossed into the field of <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> had not yet finished bringing in their grain. The last farmer to finish had the responsibility to take in {{and care for the}} corn dolly for the next year, with the implication they'd have to feed and house the hag all winter. Competition was fierce to avoid having to take in the Old Woman.|$|E
500|$|Seeing the boy's intelligence, some neighbors {{offered to}} pay Horace's way at Phillips Exeter Academy, but the Greeleys were too proud to accept charity. [...] In 1820, Zaccheus's {{financial}} reverses caused him to flee New Hampshire with his family lest he be imprisoned for debt, and settle in Vermont. Even as his father struggled {{to make a living}} as a hired hand, Horace Greeley read everything he could—the Greeleys had <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> let Horace use his library. [...] In 1822, Horace ran away from home to become a printer's apprentice, but was told he was too young.|$|E

500|$|María Amelia Batvinik {{was born}} on 13 November 1914 in Buenos Aires, the {{youngest}} of seven children to Belarusian Jewish immigrants, Jaime Batvinik from Minsk, and Ana Zaguer from Pinsk. From an early age, she was drawn to acting and began performing alongside other neighborhood children in the courtyards of their homes. That was how she met Paulina Singerman, <b>a</b> <b>neighbor,</b> <b>who</b> suggested to Bence's mother that the child be enrolled in the Lavardén Children's Theater, operating in the Teatro Colón. At the age of five, she officially debuted, encouraged by the sisters Paulina and Berta Singerman, in poet Alfonsina Storni's work, [...] "Juanita".|$|E
500|$|Sadie Mansfield and Sadie Marcus {{had very}} similar names and {{initials}} and were both known by their friends as Sadie. Both made a stagecoach journey from San Francisco to Prescott, Arizona Territory; both traveled {{with a black}} woman named Julia; both were sexual partners with Behan; both were 19 years old, born in New York City, and had parents from Prussia. The only difference noted in the 1880 census is their occupation: Sadie in San Francisco is listed as [...] "At home", while Sadie in Tip Top is recorded as a [...] "Courtesan". Josephine said that her parents hid her activities, {{and they may have}} been covering for her when the census taker, <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> knew the family, appeared on their doorstep.|$|E
500|$|On October 24, {{during the}} early morning, Farrar {{received}} a phone call at his apartment from <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> shouted that his house—meaning the Farrar–Green family home in Prairie Village—was on fire. Farrar immediately drove there. A 9-1-1 call placed from the house at 12:20a.m. alerted police dispatchers to possible trouble, though the caller did not speak before hanging up. A police cruiser found the house on fire. Fire trucks were dispatched at 12:27 to what was classed as a [...] "two-alarm" [...] fire. The first firefighters on the scene reported that Green and her ten-year-old daughter Kate were safely outside the house by the time they had arrived. Both were in their nightclothes. Kate begged firefighters to help her brother and sister, six-year-old Kelly and thirteen-year-old Timothy, who were still inside. Green stood next to her daughter, and was reported to have been [...] "very calm, very cool". At least two firefighters attempted to search inside the home for the missing children, but the building was so consumed by flames that they could only access {{a small portion of the}} ground level before the structure became unsafe.|$|E
50|$|After a rumble between New York City street gangs, the Hornets and Dukes, a {{youth is}} taken captive and {{threatened}} with a zip gun by Lenny Daniels, {{one of the}} Hornets. The act is witnessed by <b>a</b> <b>neighbor,</b> McAllister, <b>who</b> tells the cops.|$|R

She plays <b>a</b> female <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> is {{questioned by the}} detective. The male actor who plays Goof has not been identified. Blackton was the sister of Maniac's assistant director and daughter of J. Stuart Blackton, founder of Vitagraph Studios {{and the father of}} American animation.|$|R

2500|$|Boudin and Wilkerson {{disappeared}} {{before they}} could be questioned. They had been free on bail on assault charges stemming from the Days of Rage riots in Chicago. <b>A</b> <b>neighbor</b> <b>who</b> rendered aid after the blast described them as [...] "dazed and trembling" [...] as they were led [...] "staggering" [...] from the wreckage, one clad only in blue jeans and the other naked. The neighbor brought them to her house, where they showered, borrowed clothing, and told a housekeeper {{they were going to}} a local drugstore, then hailed a taxi and disappeared.|$|E
