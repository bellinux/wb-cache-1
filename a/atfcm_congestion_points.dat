50|$|Variable {{speed limits}} {{displayed}} on overhead lane control signs (LCS) above each lane {{are used to}} reduce traffic speed prior to a <b>congestion</b> <b>point.</b> Variable message signs (VMS) accompany the reduced speed limit to warn drivers of slow traffic. Speeds are determined automatically and are lowered using one or two upstream gantries {{depending on the size}} of the reduction. Intervals of 8.0 km/h (5.0 mph) and 16.1 km/h (10.0 mph) are common. Upon the end of a <b>congestion</b> <b>point,</b> speed limits are returned to the default speed. The primary purpose of queue protection is to reduce rear-end collisions.|$|R

40|$|While network {{simulations}} for {{congestion control}} studies have often varied traffic loads and protocol parameters, they have typically investigated {{only a few}} topologies.

In particular, we report that a measurable fraction of packets pass through multiple <b>congestion</b> <b>points.</b> Second, we argue that the distinction between the "barbell" topology and more complex topologies is relevant by presenting a scenario with multiple <b>congestion</b> <b>points</b> that exhibits behavior that seems unexpected based on intuition derived from the barbell topology (in particular, a TCP-only system that exhibits behavior technically considered "congestion collapse"). We make the larger argument that the typical methodology currently accepted for evaluating network protocols is flawed. Finally, we briefly comment on some issues that arise in designing a simulation methodology that will be better suited to comparison of network protocol performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a new method to describe, compare, and classify the traffic <b>congestion</b> <b>points</b> in Beijing, China, {{by using the}} online map data and further revealed the relationship between traffic congestion and land use. The data of the point of interest (POI) and the real-time traffic was extracted from an electronic map of {{the area in the}} fourth ring road of Beijing. The POIs were quantified based on the architectural area of the land use; the <b>congestion</b> <b>points</b> were identified based on real-time traffic. Then, the cluster analysis using the attributes of congestion time was conducted to identify the main traffic congestion areas. The result of a linear regression analysis between the congestion time and the land use showed that the influence of the high proportion of commercial land use on the traffic congestion was significant. Also, we considered five types of land use through performing a linear regression analysis between the congestion time and the ratio of four types of land use. The results showed that the reasonable ratio of land use types could efficiently reduce congestion time. This study makes contributions to the policy-making of urban land use...|$|R

5000|$|Beyond {{critical}} mass, {{the increasing}} number of subscribers generally cannot continue indefinitely. After a certain point, most networks become either congested or saturated, stopping future uptake. Congestion occurs due to overuse. The applicable analogy is that of a telephone network. While the number of users is below the <b>congestion</b> <b>point,</b> each additional user adds additional value to every other customer. However, at some point the addition of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system. After this point, each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user. In practical terms, each additional user increases the total system load, leading to busy signals, the inability to get a dial tone, and poor customer support. The next critical point is where the value obtained again equals the price paid. The network will cease to grow at this point, and the system must be enlarged. The <b>congestion</b> <b>point</b> may be larger than the market size. New peer-to-peer technological models may always defy congestion.

50|$|Predictive {{time delay}} {{is based on}} the concept that the system or the user knows when the <b>congestion</b> <b>point</b> is reached or when the delay of the freeway would be equal to the delay on city streets, and the {{decision}} for route assignment is taken in time. On the other hand, reactive time delay is when the system or user waits to experience the point where the delay is observed and the diversion of routes is in reaction to that experience. Predictive delay gives significantly better results than the reactive delay method.|$|R

5000|$|Congestion {{avoidance}} can {{be achieved}} efficiently by reducing traffic. When an application requests a large file, graphic or web page, it usually advertises a [...] "window" [...] of between 32K and 64K. This results in the server sending a full window of data (assuming the file {{is larger than the}} window). When many applications simultaneously request downloads, this data creates a <b>congestion</b> <b>point</b> at an upstream provider by flooding the queue. By using a device to reduce the window advertisement, the remote servers send less data, thus reducing the congestion. This technique can reduce network congestion by a factor of 40.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedIn this thesis, the {{fundamental}} experimental observation is that, on the Internet and other networks, traffic seems to concentrate quite heavily on some very small subsets. The main result in {{here is that}} this phenomenon is not, in general, related to the popular "heavytailed" phenomenon, but is a consequence of the negative curvature of the network. The mathematical analysis and simulation results confirm this striking traffic pattern specific to negatively curved networks from both the theoretical and practical points of view. Furthermore, this thesis addresses another fundamental question: if congestion does not necessarily occur at vertices with high degree, nor at the so-called highly connected "core," then what are the <b>congestion</b> <b>points?</b> It is shown that the <b>congestion</b> <b>points</b> are the points relative to which the network has low moment of inertia. That single point relative to which the network has a well-defined minimum {{is referred to as the}} centroid, the point through which most of the traffic transits. Probably the most important result as far as protocol design is concerned is that load balancing can be achieved by a routing table designed on the basis of a virtual network in which the link weights have been adjusted to correct the curvature from negative to positive. The latter mathematical technique is reminiscent of the Yamabe flow and the Poincaré conjecture. The practical implementation of this concept on the ns- 2 network simulator indicates a significant reduction of the congestion...|$|R

The {{results indicate that}} welfare impacts from congestion vary by <b>congestion</b> <b>point,</b> site, and activity within a given site. Estimating willingness to pay (WTP) for multiple sites and activities allows for parametric testing of whether WTP varies among sites and activities. The most general implication {{of this study is}} that if one has the ability to discriminate by activity, doing so is preferable purely in terms of overall model performance.

40|$|Quality-of-Service routing {{satisfies}} {{performance requirements}} of applications and maximizes utilization of network resources by selecting paths {{based on the}} resource needs of application sessions and link load. QoS routing can significantly {{increase the number of}} reserved bandwidth sessions that a network can carry, while meeting application QoS requirements. Most research on QoS routing to date, has focussed on routing within a single domain. We argue that since the peering links joining different network domains are often <b>congestion</b> <b>points</b> for network traffic, it is even more important to apply QoS routing concepts to inter-domain routing. BGP, the de facto standard for inter-domain routing provides no support for QoS routing, and indeed it facilitates the use of localized routing polices that can lead to poor end-to-end performance. This paper proposes a new approach to inter-domain routing for sessions requiring reserved resources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{evolution}} of the Internet gave rise to new applications. The need to disseminate high volumes of data to numerous users along with the {{evolution of}} Peer-to-Peer systems, introduced a new alternative to the traditional client-server paradigm. File sharing networks became the platform for thousands of users to share content. Users often turn to these networks to find highly anticipated, newly released software or video files which sometimes are of considerable size. However, increased mean response time or even network failures {{can be observed in}} such P 2 P systems, often caused because of uneven flow of data and intersperse <b>congestion</b> <b>points.</b> In this paper, the structure of Peercast, an agent based dissemination network, is presented. Several simulation experiments were conducted and their results are examined in order to determine how the network’s bandwidth can be best utilized during the dissemination process...|$|R

Multimedia {{services such as}} HD/SD IPTV service and VOD service require an available bandwidth without loss, delay and jitter as well as efficient data transport technologies. In order to support end-to-end QoS, plenty of technology has been introduced mainly to the access and core network. But this trend is moving toward the home network, which includes desktops, laptops, IPTV STB, digital AV appliances, Wi-Fi phones, PDA, home gateway and server and so on. There exists many <b>congestion</b> <b>points</b> in home network, therefore home network needs to support end-to-end dynamic QoS control.

40|$|Distributed control {{protocols}} routinely have {{to operate}} oblivious of dynamic network information for scalability or complexity reasons. However, more informed protocols are likely to make more intelligent decisions. We argue that protocols can leverage dynamic congestion information without suffering the mentioned penalties. In this paper we show that routers can readily exchange congestion information in a purely passive fashion using congestion markings from existing traffic. As a result, each router can locally infer a congestion map of the network. Moreover, the maps are continuously updated with near real-time information. Our solution for building the congestion maps leverages standardized and widely used congestion management protocols and does not require changes to end hosts. We find that 90 % of the time, the inference accuracy is usually within 10 % even for environments with multiple <b>congestion</b> <b>points</b> and sudden changes in the traffic pattern. 1...|$|R
