5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other tribes}} have legends {{involving}} battles and disagreements between the great peaks. The Cowlitz and Chehalis have a legend where Rainier and St. Helens were female mountains and quarreled over Adams, the male mountain. In a different legend from the Cowlitz, St. Helens {{was the man}} and Pahto (Adams) and Takhoma (Rainier) were his wives and the two wives quarreled with each other. A thunderbird legend from the Yakamas has <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> battle between the thunderbird, Enumklah, and his five wives, Tahoma (Rainier), Pahto (Adams), Ah-kee-kun (Hood), Low-we-lat-Klah (St. Helens), and Simcoe. Pahto and Tahoma were badly beaten, Ah-kee-kun and Low-we-lat-Klah escaped without injury, and Simcoe suffered the greatest injury for starting the battle.|$|E
5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi.|$|E
50|$|The adult sides {{consolidated}} in 2014 before <b>an</b> <b>terrific</b> 2015 unfolded. Four colts' sides won trophies {{before the}} 1st XI finally clinched promotion to the County League {{at the third}} attempt {{at the end of}} August. The championship was clinched in the last game when the home match with second placed Littlehampton was abandoned. They achieved this with largely the same side which played in 2014 and no overseas player.|$|R

5|$|Brigadier-General Lewis Pugh Evans, of Lovesgrove, a World War I Victoria Cross {{recipient}} {{and former}} churchwarden, {{is buried in}} the churchyard. His grave {{is marked by a}} simple slate headstone giving names and dates of birth and death. He was a kinsman of Major-General Lewis Pugh, who is commemorated in the south transept. Evans was awarded the VC when, as an acting Lieutenant Colonel in The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders), on 4 October 1917, near Zonnebeke, Belgium, he was Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment: For most conspicuous bravery and leadership. Lt.-Col. Evans took his battalion in perfect order through <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> enemy barrage, personally formed up all units, and led them to the assault. While a strong machine gun emplacement was causing casualties, and the troops were working round the flank, Lt.-Col. Evans rushed at it himself and by firing his revolver through the loophole forced the garrison to capitulate. After capturing the first objective he was severely wounded in the shoulder, but refused to be bandaged, and re-formed the troops, pointed out all future objectives, and again led his battalion forward. Again badly wounded, he nevertheless continued to command until the second objective was won, and, after consolidation, collapsed from loss of blood. As there were numerous casualties, he refused assistance, and by his own efforts ultimately reached the Dressing Station.|$|E

25|$|The ceasefire {{was to go}} {{into effect}} at 1200 hours 22 February 1973. At 1145 hours, the Communists opened <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> {{bombardment}} on Paksong. By 1205 hours, the Thai troops were fleeing. By nightfall, PAVN troops had settled into the blasted village.|$|E

5000|$|In Kingdom Come, Alex Ross portrayed <b>a</b> Mister <b>Terrific</b> with {{oversized}} guns, shoulder pads, {{and other}} military accoutrements. He sported the [...] "Fair Play" [...] logo, but displays little idea of its true and original meanings.|$|R
25|$|While {{there have}} been {{animated}} cartoons based on these giant robots, {{no one has ever}} attempted a live-action feature about them. It struck me that it was a natural fantasy for the big screen–and <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> opportunity {{to take advantage of the}} special effects that are available today.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance {{moved out}} at 17:00 on Sunday 9 June in <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> storm and {{three hours later}} arrived at Talaat ed Dumm halfway to Jerusalem where they {{spent a couple of}} days; it was exactly six weeks since the brigade had first gone to the Jordan Valley.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{accounts}} {{about what}} happened next. Having reorganized his horsemen, Wolfskeel returned to the attack around 10:00 AM. The Austrian cavalry trotted toward Dessaix's men in three lines. This time Sahuc's light horse and Pully's dragoons were waiting for them. The two French divisions countercharged, and the cavalry of both armies became embroiled in <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> melee.|$|E
6000|$|The cook obeyed; and {{instantly}} broke out with <b>a</b> second <b>terrific</b> scream; announcing nothing less, this time, than {{the appearance of}} Mr. Bowmore himself, alive and hearty, returning with Percy from the meeting at the Club! ...|$|R

25|$|On paper, {{the match}} looked {{daunting}} for the World team {{as they were}} up against five world champions {{and a number of}} other players who had achieved good results in Candidates Tournaments. However, <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> display of defiance from the World's top four boards almost tipped the balance and in the end, it was only the Soviets' strength in depth that won the day, by the narrowest of margins.|$|E
25|$|Though Bankhead's career slowed in the mid-1950s, {{she never}} faded {{from the public}} eye. Her highly public and often scandalous {{personal}} life began to undermine her reputation as <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> actress, leading to criticism {{she had become a}} caricature of herself. Although a heavy smoker (reportedly 150 cigarettes/day), heavy drinker, and consumer of sleeping pills (she was a lifelong insomniac), Bankhead continued to perform in the 1950s and 1960s on Broadway, radio, television, and in the occasional film.|$|E
25|$|The night before, <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> storm lashed {{the entire}} area badly. Prior to the battle, General Hill, seeing the rough terrain of the area as a hazard, had his men place a white cloth around their hats as a {{precaution}} {{to serve as a}} battle-badge. As it turned out, this was a great idea that may have aided immensely in the outcome... All were in dense marshy woods, or on the terribly muddy road wading through water two to three feet deep and through thick underbrush.|$|E
60|$|Dropping the ox, with <b>a</b> most <b>terrific</b> roar it {{came over}} the wall at me--I {{remember}} that {{there seemed to be}} yards of it--I mean of the lion--in front of which appeared a cavernous mouth full of gleaming teeth.|$|R

6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{said the}} soldier, bending <b>a</b> most <b>terrific</b> frown from <b>a</b> pair of broad black eyebrows, {{handling}} the hilt of his weapon with one hand, and twirling {{with the other}} his huge mustaches; [...] "will you quarrel for your city?" ...|$|R
25|$|On {{the left}} flank, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen's III Armeekorps crashed into General of Division Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire's {{division}} and <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> fight blazed up. Both sides fed in reinforcements as the infantry battled over {{a pair of}} parallel ridges in the Battle of Teugen-Hausen. Ultimately, Davout brought superior forces to bear {{in the late afternoon}} and pushed back the Austrians a short ways. That night, Charles ordered Hohenzollern to withdraw a little to the east, closer to his main body.|$|E
25|$|The Mali Empire {{has enjoyed}} {{virtually}} no military reverses {{in its first}} century of existence and had grown at <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> rate in both size and wealth by the time Ibn Battuta arrived there. However this wealth and power {{may have been the}} reason behind more aggressive attacks by its neighbors as well as the complacency of some of the mansas in dealing with them. Subject peoples on the fringes of the empire slowly began to shake off the yoke of Mandinka hegemony. This happened slowly at first, but after 1450 the empire would begin to crumble very rapidly.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the No. 9 team {{partnered with}} Braun Racing and their No. 10 Toyota Camry for several races with Kasey Kahne and Elliott Sadler. Fritos with the sponsor at Atlanta with Kahne as driver. Bumper to Bumper {{sponsored}} Sadler at New Hampshire. McDonald's was the sponsor at Daytona is July and at Bristol in August. In 2011, the team returned in a 1-race deal with Marcos Ambrose {{behind the wheel}} for the 2011 NAPA Auto Parts 200 in Montreal-a race Ambrose has dominated over the years but failed to win at. Ambrose made <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> comeback from an early spin, and won the race.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic writes, [...] "The biggest {{surprise}} {{here is that}} a fair number of the unreleased songs tend to have a prominent backbeat -- usually some sort of play on disco, but 'Tell Jack' is <b>a</b> pretty <b>terrific</b> slice of Elton John-styled glam rock." ...|$|R
5000|$|Winkler {{says when}} he saw a rough cut of the final film he thought it was [...] "atrocious... for Peter to blame the movie's failure on the casting and not being in {{black-and-white}} is a really terrible excuse for a guy who simply screwed up <b>a</b> really <b>terrific</b> script." ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{the south}} west of Malwa plateau, the {{dissected}} hill tracts culminate in the Mathwar hills, located in Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh.

25|$|Shamrock Rovers {{began their}} {{pre-season}} on 1 February against non-league side, Killarney Celtic at Celtic Park. Surprisingly, Killarney Celtic started off positively {{with a goal}} in the opening ten minutes of the game. Killarney kept this lead until the 53rd minute when Ciarán Kilduff scored a goal to equalize. From then on Rovers began {{to get into the}} game. In the 77th minute, Anthony Murphy put Rovers into the lead with <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> goal. Followed by this, Stephen O'Donnell and Karl Sheppard both scored with Billy Dennehy scoring twice on the 79th and 86th minute, resulting in the game ending 6-1 to Shamrock Rovers.|$|E
25|$|About 4:30p.m. Price's left {{emerged from}} Williams Hollow and attacked, {{outflanking}} Carr's line. On the right, Dodge's brigade collapsed after putting up <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> fight at Clemon's farm. On the left, in equally hard fighting, Vandever's men were steadily pushed {{back to the}} tavern and beyond. In the center, Little led his men forward into the teeth of Federal artillery. After being forced back from position after position, Vandever's men finally halted the Confederate drive at Ruddick's field, over a quarter mile south of the tavern. There {{they were joined by}} Dodge's men, part of Alexander S. Asboth's 2nd Division and Curtis. At 6:30p.m., Curtis launched a brief counter-attack, but soon recalled his men in the dark.|$|E
25|$|On 25 June, while escorting 29 {{merchant}} {{ships to}} Gibraltar, Senecas men heard <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> explosion, and observing the steamer Queen sinking, they drove Seneca {{at full speed}} to the rescue. So badly was the Queen hit that within five minutes of the explosion she was completely out of sight under the water, taking 25 of her men with her, including the commodore of the convoy. Twenty-seven survivors were clinging to the small boats and pieces of floating wreckage. Senecas No. 1 lifeboat with Third Lieutenant F. W. Brown in charge, was lowered to pick them up. All 27 were safely on board Seneca within 40 minutes. For {{the remainder of the}} convoy's run, Captain Wheeler assumed command.|$|E

5000|$|JoBlo gave a mixed {{review for}} the film, {{saying that it}} [...] "teeters {{on the edge of}} being <b>a</b> pretty <b>terrific</b> killer in the woods film" [...] but that [...] "with a few moments of {{characters}} doing moronic things, and a thrill-less and much too long exposition, the flame is a little dull".|$|R
