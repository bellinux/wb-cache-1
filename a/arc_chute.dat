25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the <b>arc</b> <b>chute</b> (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the <b>arc</b> <b>chute</b> {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.|$|E
50|$|Open knife {{switches}} were {{supplanted by}} safety switches with current carrying contacts inside a metal enclosure {{which can only}} be opened by switching off the power. In modern applications, automatic switches (such as contactors or relays), and manual switches such as circuit breakers are used. These devices use a snap action mechanism which opens the switch contacts rapidly, and feature an <b>arc</b> <b>chute</b> where the arc caused by opening the switch is quenched. These devices also prevent injury due to accidental contact, as all of the current carrying metal parts of the switch are hidden within or surrounded by insulating guards.|$|E

40|$|Investigations of the arc {{splitting}} {{process in}} low-voltage <b>arc</b> <b>chutes</b> {{have shown that}} an ignition voltage has to be exceeded before new arc roots form on the splitter plates. When an arc spot has been formed, the electrode fall voltages are nearly constant and rather independent of the current. In simulations this behaviour can be modelled by {{a thin layer of}} elements with a nonlinear current density-voltage characteristic surrounding the splitter plate. An appropriate characteristic has al-ready been presented in earlier publications. It includes an ignition voltage at low current densities and a constant final voltage at higher current densities. In this paper, the influence of the magnitude of the ignition voltage is evaluated. A lower voltage peak yields a shorter arc loop around the lower edge of the splitter plate and an earlier subdivision of the arc. A too high voltage hump makes arc splitting impossible. To show that special treatment of the arc roots is absolutely necessary, a com-paring simulation without an arc root model was performed. The results are compared and verified on the basis of experimental results. Hence, the arc splitting process is analyzed concerning arc voltage and current through the plate as well as the location of arc roots. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} arc rupturing parts of {{low-voltage}} air circuit breakers {{depends upon the}} strength and distribution of the magnetic blowout field by which the arc is forced. The magnetic blowout causes the arc {{to move into a}} set of slotted iron grids, where the arc is extinguished rapidly. The current in the conductors and the arc make up a magnetic field through the grids around the arc. Thus, {{the first step in the}} calculation of the motion of the arc is the prediction of the magnetic blowout force. In many cases, however, it was not easy to calculate the forces owing to the complicated three dimensional structure of <b>arc</b> <b>chutes</b> and contact systems. In this paper, a developed method which can calculate the distribution of magnetic blowout forces along arc which lie at arc rupturing Parts 　of a circuit breakers is described. The forces are calculated in the same way that a conductor is moved in the magnetic field. The flux density in the arc is obtained by 2 -D or 3 -D finite element method taking into account magnetic saturation of iron plates. And then, the differences between 2 -D and 3 -D finite element method are discussed by calculated results of the model...|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} the experimental results on {{the breakdown of the}} high-speed flow of transformer oil. In real conditions, the flow moves in the contact gap of a high-voltage explosive switch with speeds from 67 to 152 m /s. The geometry of the contact gap is sharply inhomogeneous and forms turbulence in the flow zone. In the <b>arc</b> <b>chute</b> medium the air inclusions pass from the dissolved state to the gaseous and the emerging bubbles enter to the electric field. Breakdown occurs, mainly through gas inclusions. In the moment, the gradient of the breakdown voltage is reduced by 91. 6 % compared to the static state of the oil. The experiments were carried out on the model of a high-voltage explosive switch, connected to the power circuit of the surge generator. The probing of the gap was made by a standard pulse of 1. 5 / 50 [mu]s. As a result, the dependences of the gradient of the breakdown voltage on the flow rate of the transformer oil for the usual geometry of the high-voltage explosive switch contact system are constructed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{about the}} implementation of Solid State Circuit Breaker in power system using MOSFET. The high power semiconductor switches {{can be used to}} separate the faulty portions {{from the rest of the}} power system in case of abnormal conditions. The Solid State Circuit Breaker is a topology made in the form of module, can protect power system and its components from faults. Existing mechanical circuit breakers are based on the principle of magnetically latching a pair of mechanical contacts shrouded by an <b>arc</b> <b>chute</b> for arc extinction. Very often unnecessary tripping results from a phenomenon known as, “rapid rise” which subsequently results in the demand for frequent maintenance. Due to the long turn-off delay of the present mechanical circuit breaker, significant voltage sag is experienced in the grid which affects the sensible loads. The distortions caused by the three phase short circuit can be reduced to 100 µs in the system with SSCB, in contrast to 100 ms achieved by the present technology and hence it improves the power quality. The SSCB uses high power anti parallel switches to carry bidirectional current. The load voltage is sensed and it is used to turn on and turn off the SSCB. The Eight bus system with SSCB is modeled and simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The hardware model is developed for implementation of SSCB using MOSFETand it is tested in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The flow {{characteristics}} of an aerator inserted on the chute with a concave surface {{is more complex}} than that of on the straight chute. The area of the air intake of the aerator is a very important factor which influences the cavity size of jet flow after the aerator, the air pressure in the cavity and air concentrations in high-speed flows along the chute. The present project focused on the air intake of an aerator inserted on a model chute with a concave surface. How the area of the air intake of the aerator and the radius of <b>chute</b> <b>arc</b> affect {{flow characteristics}} are investigated. The air pressure in the cavity was indirectly derived from the jet trajectory equation. It is demonstrated that the cavity length increases with, and the air pressure in it decreases with the increasing of the air intake area at first, and then it remains unchangeable for a discharge even though the air intake area continues to increase...|$|R
