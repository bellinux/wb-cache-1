40|$|Introduction & Objective: Brucellosis is an {{important}} zoonosis considered a serious hazard to public health. Human brucellosis is caused {{by one of the}} four species of the brucella genus: B. melitensis is principally found in goats and sheep, B. abortus in cattle, B. suis in swine and B. canis in dogs. <b>Vaccination</b> of young <b>animals,</b> is a strategy to decrease the incidence rate of brucellosis in humans. The objective {{of this study is to}} give an estimate of <b>vaccination</b> coverage in <b>animals</b> (sheep or goats and cattles) and its effect on human brucellosis incidence rate. Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the data on reported human cases of brucellosis originated from Hamadan health deputy and the data on <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> was collected from provincial veterinary of Hamadan. The relationship between the <b>animals</b> <b>vaccination</b> coverage with the incidence of human brucellosis was assessed with the SPSS software. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> and human brucellosis. Results: According to provincial veterinary of Hamadan reports, <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> coverage (percentage) from 2002 to 2008 was between 17. 5 % in 2002 and increased to 60 % in 2008 in young sheep and goats, and vaccination coverage against brucellosis in young cattles was 5. 6 % in 2002 and increased to 38 % in 2008. According to Hamadan health deputy human brucellosis incidence rate was 86 per 100000 persons in 2002 and reduced to 44. 7 per 100000 persons in 2008. Statistical analysis showed that Pearson correlation coefficient of cattle vaccination and human brucellosis(r = - 0. 78), sheep's vaccination and human incidence rate (r = - 0. 38) are negative but incomplete. Conclusion: <b>Vaccination</b> of young <b>animals</b> was effective in reducing the incidence rate of human brucellosis. Our findings emphasize the importance of the combination of health education and <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> programs for controlling such zoonosis diseases and highlight the need for cooperation between public health officials and veterinary officers...|$|R

40|$|Brucellosis, {{the most}} common {{zoonotic}} disease worldwide, represents a great threat to animal husbandry {{with the potential to}} cause enormous economic losses. Brucellosis has become a major public health problem in China, and the number of human brucellosis cases has increased dramatically in recent years. In order to evaluate different intervention strategies to curb brucellosis transmission in China, a novel mathematical model with a general indirect transmission incidence rate was presented. By comparing the results of three models using national human disease data and 11 provinces with high case numbers, the best fitted model with standard incidence was used to investigate the potential for future outbreaks. Estimated basic reproduction numbers were highly heterogeneous, varying widely among provinces. The local basic reproduction numbers of provinces with an obvious increase in incidence were much larger than the average for the country as a whole, suggesting that environment-to-individual transmission was more common than individual-to-individual transmission. We concluded that brucellosis can be controlled through increasing <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> rates, environment disinfection frequency, or elimination rates of infected animals. Our finding suggests that a combination of <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination,</b> environment disinfection, and elimination of infected animals will be necessary to ensure cost-effective control for brucellosis...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Toxoplasma gondii is a {{worldwide}} prevalent zoonotic parasite which causes toxoplasmosis. An appropriate vaccine for animals could interrupt the circle between animals and humans. Our previous {{study showed that}} excreted/secreted antigens (E/SA), derived from the peritoneum of mice infected with T. gondii tachyzoites could {{be considered as a}} good candidate for <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) inhibits proliferation of B and T lymphocytes and induces homeostasis in immune system responses. However, since IL- 10 has also been shown to suppress the killing of T. gondii by human macrophages, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate IL- 10 serum levels after vaccination with T. gondii E/SA prepared in vivo. Methods: T. gondii tachyzoites were inoculated in the peritoneum of mice and harvested E/SA were used as a vaccine, with and without adjuvant, in T. gondii infected and un-infected mice. IL- 10 serum levels were evaluated using the ELISA technique. Results: The data showed that although serum levels of IL- 10 were not changed at the early phases, they were elevated at the end phases of vaccination with T. gondii E/SA. Conclusion: Based on these and our previous results, it can be concluded that in vivo prepared T. gondii E/SA could be considered as a good candidate for <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination...</b>|$|R

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) {{gives rise}} to a highly {{contagious}} and economically important disease of cloven-hooved <b>animals.</b> <b>Vaccination</b> reduces the economic impact by inducing serotype-specific protection. Recently, a replication-defective adenovirus-vectored foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) subunit vaccine was developed and licensed. Serum virus neutralization (SVN) titer ≥ 1. 5 to FMDV is the best predictor of vaccine-induced protection. However, protection does not always correlate with the presence of neutralizing antibodies. For example, some animals with high SVN titer develop signs of disease, and conversely, some animals with negligible SVN titer are protected. Categorizing cattle on the parameters of seroconversion and protection status yields four groups of cattle.

30|$|The overall {{unit cost}} of PPR {{vaccination}} in Somalia, 2012, was estimated as USD 0.28 per animal. This {{is much less}} than the overall individual <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> cost for Rinderpest from a study by (Tambi et al. 1999) which estimated the individual <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> cost as ECU 0.42 equivalent of USD 0.51 based on average ECU value between 1989 and 1996. In the same study, unit cost of Rinderpest vaccination in Ethiopia was estimated as ECU 0.27 (USD 0.33) and this relatively low unit cost was attributed to economies of scale. The estimated cost of a dose of PPR vaccine in Somalia was USD 0.12 which compares favourably with the USD 0.10 reported by Jones et al. (2016) in other parts of Africa. However, the unit cost of service delivery of the PPR vaccine per animal was different. In Somalia, it was USD 0.14 per animal which was much lower than USD 0.3 estimated by Jones et al. (2016). This could have been due to the economy of scale, considering that nearly 20 million sheep and goats were vaccinated against PPR disease. The differences could have also arisen due to different ways of costing the service delivery. In the Somalia study, the cost of service delivery was calculated based on the cost of personnel time and the transport costs during data and serum collection. The procurement of vaccine increased the total cost of vaccination. In this study, it constituted 50 % of the total vaccination cost. One way of reducing this cost is vaccinating against more than one disease that is prevalent in the area. The control of sheep and goat pox and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia diseases could be done alongside PPR disease (Kumar et al. 2014; FAO/OIE 2015).|$|R
40|$|Infectious disease {{remains a}} {{constant}} {{threat to the}} health of man and his <b>animals.</b> <b>Vaccination</b> has been declared one of the medical triumphs of the twentieth century. For man or <b>animal,</b> <b>vaccination</b> remains the best and most cost effective means for the prevention of disease. Many novel vaccine antigens are rationally designed peptides and recombinant proteins which require the use of adjuvants or other immune enhancers to increase efficacy. Currently, there is a need not only for single dose vaccines (to improve patient compliance and improve animal welfare by reducing livestock handling) but also adjuvants that preserve the immunogenicity of the protein during encapsulation, storage and release and enhance the host 2 ̆ 7 s immune response to the antigen. Biodegradable polyanhydrides have shown many characteristics that fulfill these ideals but further study is needed. The studies presented in this dissertation were undertaken with the intent to define the interaction(s) between novel biodegradable polyanhydride microspheres and the host immune system. In order to address the role of polyanhydride chemistry on murine dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro, DC activation by polyanhydride microspheres was evaluated by surface marker expression and cytokine secretion. Several murine models, including a transgenic T cell transfer model, were used to evaluate the induction of antigen-specific immune response by immunizing mice with microsphere adjuvanted ovalbumin. The in vivo studies using ovalbumin encapsulated microspheres were carried out in three mouse strains to evaluate the memory or recall response induced by a single microsphere vaccination and to evaluate strain differences in response to the polyanhydride microspheres. Finally, microspheres loaded with the protease digested vaccine antigen derived from Brachyspira hyodysenteriae was used to vaccinate mice and pigs prior to disease challenge studies designed to evaluate the induction of protective immunity. Taken together, this body of work further adds to our knowledge of polyanhydride microspheres and their potential use as vaccine carriers...|$|R

Accurate population statistics and cost-effective registration systems are the basis for evidence-based policies and effective new strategies to provide adapted, integrated, and sustainable social services for mobile pastoralist people in remote zones. Mobile livestock production systems need to be fostered to strengthen their role as conservators of semi-arid ecosystems and main producers of pastoral products that are contributing significantly to the gross domestic product and food provision of their countries. Currently, the range of demographic and health surveillance methods, tools and approaches is limited to settled households and hardly applicable in mobile populations. New evaluation and monitoring methods, approaches, and tools to survey mobile households are needed. Preventive measures (the joint human and <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> program, in the Lake Chad area, provided by the Swiss Tropical Institute and the Centre de Support en Santé Internationale in Chad from 2000 to 2007) have been implemented on small scale and need to be evaluated and scaled up towards an equity effective health intervention. Therefore, estimates on population sizes and other demographic core indices like mortality and fertility in these highly mobile pastoralists’ settings have to be assessed, making demographic and health information surveillance indispensable. The study presented here, was carried out at the southern shores of Lake Chad in Chari-Baguirmi, Chad. In five random household survey rounds demographic and health related data was collected among the target population of the joint human and <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> program, that comprised the main ethnic groups of Arab, Fulani, and Gorane mobile livestock keepers. An electronic biometric fingerprint application was used to register and identify pastoralist women. We present in this study a proof-of-concept of monitoring highly mobile livestock keepers with the help of biometric technology that is further linked to a geographical information system. The unique biometric identification number serves as mark to establish population estimates, dilution rates (in and out migration) and survival probabilities applying “Jolly-Seber multiple mark-recapture” (re-encountering) and “Bailey triple catch” methodology.

40|$|Maternally-derived {{antibodies}} (MDAs) {{can protect}} offspring against influenza virus infection {{but may also}} inhibit active immune responses. To overcome MDA- mediated inhibition, active immunization of offspring with an inactivated H 5 N 1 whole-virion vaccine {{under the influence of}} MDAs was explored in mice. Female mice were vaccinated twice via the intraperitoneal (IP) or intranasal (IN) route with the vaccine prior to mating. One week after birth, the offspring were immunized twice via the IP or IN route with the same vaccine and then challenged with a lethal dose of a highly homologous virus strain. The results showed that, no matter which immunization route (IP or IN) was used for mothers, the presence of MDAs severely interfered with the active immune response of the offspring when the offspring were immunized via the IP route. Only via the IN immunization route did the offspring overcome the MDA interference. These results suggest that intranasal immunization could be a suitable inoculation route for offspring to overcome MDA interference in the defense against highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 virus infection. This study may provide references for human and <b>animal</b> <b>vaccination</b> to overcome MDA-induced inhibition...|$|R
