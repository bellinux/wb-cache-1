In general, however, when using digital signals to modify the carrier wave, the method is called keying, rather than modulation. Thus, telecommunications modems use frequency-shift keying (FSK), phase-shift keying (PSK), or <b>amplitude-phase</b> keying (APK), or various combinations. Furthermore, another digital modulation is line coding, which uses a baseband carrier, rather than a passband wave.|$|E

An appropriate tool to analyse the spectral componets of sea level records must let to the identification of the passage of such waves. Fourier analysis has traditionally been used to extract global information in the frequency domain from signals with not time varying <b>amplitude-phases.</b> Wavelet transforms seems to be most appropriate as it can be used to analyse time series that contain nonstationary power at many diferent frequencies. In this study, wavelet transform (WT) and cross wavelet transform (XWT) was applied in analysing time series along South American west coast (Sawc) from 020 S to 230 S comprising Equator, Peru and Chile. SAwc is characterized by a predominant latitudinal orientation, 300 counter clock-wise rotated with respect to the south-north axis. WT shows significant power for oscillations in the 4 - 20 days band for events El Niño 91 - 92 e 97 - 98. These oscillations can be forced by Rossby-gravity mixed waves trapped at the equator. Fluctuations of 30 - 60 days were also observed for Paita, Callao, San Juan and Cadera stations during the El Niño events. These waves probably are linked with Equatorial Kelvin waves (EKW), wich propagate eastward. EKW are forced by equatorial winds in the central part of Equatorial Pacific, wich are associated with reversal of the trade winds. XWT show regions with high commom power and further revels information about phase relationship consistent with a southward propagation.

By utilizing the equivalent model of conductivity cell, we derived the functional relation between resistance-capacitance (RC) parameters and the <b>amplitude-phase</b> characteristics, thus the RC parameters decoupling value can be obtained and the conductivity can be calculated. We also designed automatic temperature compensation and intelligent shift function, which further improve the system precision and practicality.

Here we investigate the role of thermal fluctuations {{as well as of}} the non-linear <b>amplitude-phase</b> coupling parameter and the amplitude relaxation rate to explain the linewidth broadening of in-plane precession modes induced in planar nanostructures. Experiments on the linewidth broadening performed on MgO based magnetic tunnel junctions are compared to the linewidth obtained from macrospin simulations and from evaluation of the phase variance. In all cases we find that the linewidth varies linearly with temperature when the amplitude relaxation rate is of the same order as the linewidth and when the <b>amplitude-phase</b> coupling parameter is relatively small. The small <b>amplitude-phase</b> coupling parameter means that the linewidth is dominated by direct phase fluctuations and not by amplitude fluctuations, explaining thus its linear dependence as a function of temperature...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a novel network to {{separate}} mixtures of inputs that have been previously learned. A significant capability of the network is that it segments the components of each input object that most contribute to its classification. The network consists of <b>amplitude-phase</b> units that can synchronize their dynamics, so that separation {{is determined by the}} amplitude of units in an output layer, and segmentation by phase similarity between input and output layer units. Learning is unsupervised and based on a Hebbian update, and the architecture is very simple. Moreover, efficient segmentation can be achieved even when there is considerable superposition of the inputs. The network dynamics are derived from an objective function that rewards sparse coding in the generalized <b>amplitude-phase</b> variables. We argue that this objective function can provide a possible formal interpretation of the binding problem and that the implementation of the network architecture and dynamics is biologically plausible.

In rate adaptation, choosing proper modulation schemes based on channel conditions {{is vital to}} the transmission performance. However, due to the natural character of discrete modulation types and continuous varied link conditions, we cannot make a one-to-one mapping from modulation schemes to channel conditions.

To fill-in the gap, we propose TiM (Time-line Modulation), a novel 3 -Dimensional modulation scheme by adding time dimension into current <b>amplitude-phase</b> domain schemes. With estimation of channel condition, TiM changes base-band data transmission time by artificially interpolating values between original data points without changing <b>amplitude-phase</b> domain modulation type.
