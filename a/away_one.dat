5|$|Sometime in {{the early}} nineteenth century, a storm washed <b>away</b> <b>one</b> of the legs leaving it much as it is today, {{although}} erosion continues. By 1992 a 40-metre (130ft) crack had appeared {{in the top of the}} south face, leaving a large overhanging section that will eventually collapse.|$|E
5|$|ISI {{reported}} after questioning {{survivors of}} the raid that there were 17 to 18 people in the compound {{at the time of}} the attack and that the Americans took <b>away</b> <b>one</b> person still alive, possibly a bin Laden son. The ISI said that survivors included a wife, a daughter and eight to nine other children, not apparently bin Laden's. An unnamed Pakistani security official was quoted as saying one of bin Laden's daughters told Pakistani investigators that bin Laden had been captured alive, then in front of family members was shot dead by American forces and dragged to a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Missions are tasks {{undertaken}} by a clan. There are {{four types of}} missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends <b>away</b> <b>one</b> member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E

5|$|Ongoing {{efforts are}} being made by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving <b>away.</b> <b>One</b> of the underlying goals {{is to reduce the}} time needed to evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30years, to two or three days.|$|E
5|$|Mortality is {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause of failure of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed <b>away.</b> <b>One</b> of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, mongooses, honey badgers, baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, and spotted hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard is thought {{to be the most important}} nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, mongooses, rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E

When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse. Megan and Graham sneak <b>away</b> <b>one</b> night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.|$|E

When the demon appears a second time, Dylan decides to track down a man who molested Dylan's friend when they were children. After shooting him, Dylan's sickness goes away. The next month, Dylan struggles to find another target he feels deserves to die. He settles on a brothel run by a Russian mob.

5|$|While {{stalling}} {{north of}} Luzon, Goni enhanced the southwest monsoon across the Philippines, resulting in rainfall and gusty winds across the western {{portion of the}} nation. The storm spawned seven tornadoes, one of which damaged or destroyed ten houses in Carranglan, Nueva Ecija. Rough seas swamped a motor boat near Banton Island, forcing the crew of seven to swim ashore. Across Luzon, flooding caused landslides in 13locations, including a mountain slope in Mankayan, Benguet, that buried three mining camps, killing 13miners. More than 100policemen and miners searched through the mud for survivors. Water levels quickly rose in rivers across Luzon, washing away 14flood control systems, including one dyke. Swollen rivers also inundated several bridges and washed <b>away</b> <b>one</b> in Santa, Ilocos Sur, that left 5,100people isolated. At three dams, water gates were opened after flood levels reached critical heights. Across Luzon, trees were knocked down and the power supply was disrupted; all electrical service was restored by September1, or 11days after the storm's closest approach. In total, Typhoon Goni damaged 5,742houses, of which 188 were completely destroyed. Total damages amounted to ₱4.5billion ($96.6million USD), split roughly evenly between agricultural and infrastructural impacts. In Ilocos Norte province in northwestern Luzon, damage was estimated at ₱1.8billion ($38.7million USD). Overall, Typhoon Goni killed 33people and left 9missing in the Philippines, mostly due to landslides or drownings, and injured 24others.|$|E
