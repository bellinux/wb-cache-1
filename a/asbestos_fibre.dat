The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{concentrations}} of inorganic fibres in the lungs in cases of mesothelioma and controls: to determine whether concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> differ with the different exposures identified from interview; and to investigate {{the existence of a}} cut off point in concentrations of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> that indicates occupational exposure. METHODS: Case-control study; 147 confirmed cases of mesothelioma and 122 controls identified from deaths occurring in four districts of Yorkshire between 1979 and 1991. Surviving relatives were interviewed to determine lifetime exposure history to <b>asbestos.</b> Mineral <b>fibre</b> analysis was carried out on lung tissue from postmortem examinations. RESULTS: Odds on high concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> were greater in cases than controls. After excluding subjects with occupational and paraoccupational exposure, the odds on high concentrations were still greater in cases than controls, but only significantly so for amphiboles. There was only a weak relation between probability of occupational exposure to asbestos and concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres,</b> and no significant difference in fibre concentrations was found between subjects who had been exposed to asbestos through different routes: these comparisons were only based on small groups. There was considerable overlap in concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> between cases and controls with and without histories of occupational exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The study has confirmed previous results of higher concentrations of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> in cases than controls, and has shown that this is still found in subjects with little evidence of occupational and para-occupational exposure.

Since the 1970 s, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> have been considered carcinogenic in humans i. e as a known cancer-causing agent. In the environment, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are inactive and naturally resist biodegradation. In time, fibres can only be ground into smaller particles by mechanical force. These small particles in the air present a health hazard. Because of their small size, shape and durability, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> can easily be inhaled and stick to the lung tissue, causing serious respiratory problems. Among these are diseases with long latency periods of 10 to 40 years such as: asbestosis, mesothelioma and lung cancer. Asbestos is the generic, industrial name for a group of six minerals determined by common size and inherent physical properties. Crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite and actinolite are all asbestos minerals from the amphibole mineral group. The sixth mineral, chrysotile, is a mineral from the serpentine mineral group. <b>Asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are particles longer than, or equal to, five µm with a length to width ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 3 : 1; however, the ratio can be higher than 20 or even 1000.
