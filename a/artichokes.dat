25|$|Flatulence-producing {{foods are}} {{typically}} high in certain polysaccharides, especially oligosaccharides such as inulin. Those foods include beans, lentils, dairy products, onions, garlic, spring onions, leeks, turnips, swedes, radishes, sweet potatoes, potatoes, cashews, Jerusalem <b>artichokes,</b> oats, wheat, and yeast in breads. Cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables {{that belong to}} the genus Brassica are commonly reputed to not only increase flatulence, but to increase the pungency of the flatus.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian plateau harvests {{trees for}} making doors, ploughs, and baskets. Fruit is grown also. Pears, apples, apricots, quince, plums, nectarines, cherries, mulberries, and peaches were {{commonly}} {{seen in the}} 20th century. Almonds and pistachios are common in warmer areas. Dates, oranges, grapes, melon, and limes are also grown. Other edibles include potatoes and cauliflower, which were hard to grow until European settlement brought irrigation improvements. Other vegetables include cabbage, tomatoes, <b>artichokes,</b> cucumbers, spinach, radishes, lettuce, and eggplants.|$|E
25|$|Chemically {{defined as}} {{oligosaccharides}} occurring naturally in most plants, inulins have nutritional value as carbohydrates, or more specifically as fructans, a polymer {{of the natural}} plant sugar, fructose. Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant sources such as chicory roots or Jerusalem <b>artichokes</b> for use in prepared foods.

40|$|<b>Artichoke</b> (Cynara scolymus L.) {{is one of}} the world’s oldest {{medicinal}} plants with multiple health benefits. We have previously shown that <b>artichoke</b> leaf extracts and <b>artichoke</b> flavonoids upregulate the gene expression of endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human endothelial cells. Whereas NO produced by the eNOS is a vasoprotective molecule, NO derived from the inducible iNOS plays a pro-inflammatory role in the vasculature. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of <b>artichoke</b> on iNOS expression in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC). Incubation of HCASMC with a cytokine mixture led to an induction of iNOS mRNA expression. This iNOS induction was concentration- and time-dependently inhibited by an <b>artichoke</b> leaf extract (1 – 100 µg/mL, 6 h or 24 h). Consistently, the <b>artichoke</b> leaf extract also reduced cytokine-induced iNOS promoter activation and iNOS protein expression. In addition, treatment of HCASMC with four well-known <b>artichoke</b> compounds (cynarin > cyanidin > luteolin ≈ cynaroside) led to a downregulation iNOS mRNA and protein expression, with cynarin being the most potent one. In conclusion, <b>artichoke</b> contains both eNOS-upregulating and iNOS-downregulating compounds. Such compounds may contribute to the beneficial effects of <b>artichoke</b> and may per se have therapeutic potentials...|$|R
