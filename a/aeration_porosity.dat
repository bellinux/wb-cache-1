The bulk density, total porosity, and <b>aeration</b> <b>porosity,</b> however, were highest with 100 % coal rubble and decreased with decreasing coal rubble proportion while water holding porosity increased with decreasing coal proportion. Germination decreased with increasing coal rubble at 14 to 28 and at 35 days after sowing (DAS). A mix of between 0 to 50 % coal rubble with pine bark seemed ideal for germination. <b>Aeration</b> <b>porosity,</b> total porosity, and bulk density were negatively correlated to germination (14 to 28 DAS) while water holding porosity was positively correlated.

Bibliography: leaves 158 - 161. xi, 171 l illus., tablesRepresentative soils of four Great Soil Groups from Hawaii were {{compressed}} artificially {{to develop}} {{a study on the}} effects of compaction in subtropical soils. Although this study was primarily concerned with the Low Humic Latosols which are of great importance agriculturally in Hawaii, representatives of the Hydrol Humic Latosol, Gray Hydromorphic Clay and Alluvial Soils were also included. The dominant criterion investigated was the effect of increasing soil bulk density on sugarcane roots. A method was devised to produce the conditions under which roots could be grown in soils which were compressed to various bulk densities. The relationship of the effects of variations in bulk density and <b>aeration</b> <b>porosity</b> on root morphology and proliferation was examined and is discussed. With increasing soil bulk density, roots of sugarcane develop quite normally until a density is reached at which proliferation is reduced and then roots and rootlets gradually become more distorted. Roots are incapable of penetrating a soil compressed above a critical bulk density. Seven stages of degradation to root proliferation and development are described for this continuous trend between these extremes. Each of the se stages has been correlated with bulk density. and <b>aeration</b> <b>porosity</b> values for each soil studied. Even though the particle density values. determined by standard means, for soil material are similar (2. 86 to 2. 87 gm/cc), a Grey Hydromorphic Clay allowed cane roots to enter soil at 1. 89 gm/cc while a Hydrol Humic Latosol did not allow roots to enter soil compressed to 0. 96 gm/cc. Bulk density, per se, plays an even less significant role when variations in particle density are considered: a soil horizon of a Humic Ferruginous Latosol with a particle density of 4. 01 gm/cc allowed good root distribution and proliferation at bulk densities as high as 2. 71 gm/cc. Despite this great variation in the soil bulk density associated with a particular stage of degradation to root proliferation and development for widely different soils, when one particular horizon of a particular soil series is compared, the seven stages of degradation described occur at remarkably similar bulk densities. <b>Aeration</b> <b>porosity</b> values correlate much more closely with each of the seven stages of root degradation than do bulk density values. However, variations in <b>aeration</b> <b>porosity</b> are quite wide for a particular soil material which has been compressed at different moisture contents. Some preliminary investigations, not developed further in this study, indicate that there is a still closer correlation of each stage of root degradation with air permeability. Detailed investigations of other factors establish the actual weight and volume of roots within representative soils which had been compressed to various bulk densities. Distortion to the cells of roots was not established, but morphological distortions are related to increases in soil bulk density. Rates of root elongation decrease with increasing soil bulk density. Despite reduced proliferation and distortions, radio rubidium investigations indicate that roots may function when they are able to penetrate compressed soil.

Combination of vermicompost and foliar spray of vermiwash presented better growth till flowering and fruiting stage due to frequent supplementation and foliar absorption of the vermiwash (Khan et al. 2014).Vermiwash has also been proven to replenish the deficiency of potassium and phosphorus in Tomato seedlings (Arthur et al. 2012).

30|$|Vermicomposts (VC) are finely divided, peat-like {{materials}} with high <b>porosity,</b> <b>aeration,</b> drainage, water-holding capacity, and microbial activity (Edwards 2004; Pandya et al. 2014). These composts {{result from a}} non-thermophilic biodegradation and stabilization of organic materials through interactions of earthworms and microorganisms (Edwards 2004; Arancon et al. 2003; Agnieszka et al. 2013). A wide range of organic residues, including sewage sludge, animal wastes, crop residues, and industrial refuse are increasingly being converted by earthworms to form VC (Edwards 2004; Roberts et al. 2007; Pascal et al. 2010). The earthworms breakdown the organic residues, which stimulate greater microbial activity, increase nutrient mineralization rates, and rapidly convert the wastes into a humus-like substance that has a finer structure than ordinary composts while possessing greater and more diverse microbial populations (Atiyeh et al. 2000; Yadav and Garg 2011).|$|R
30|$|Soil {{fertility}} {{depends on}} physical, {{chemical and biological}} soil attributes. Vermicompost is a nutrient rich, microbiologically active organic amendment which results from the interactions between earthworms and microorganisms in the breakdown of organic matter (Lazcano and Dominguez 2010). In fact, vermicomposts are finely divided peat-like materials with high <b>porosity,</b> <b>aeration,</b> drainage, water holding capacity and large surface area, providing strong capacity to hold and retain plant available nutrients such as nitrates, exchangeable phosphorus, soluble potassium, calcium, magnesium etc. (Edwards and Burrows 1988; Orozco et al. 1996; Chaudhuri et al. 2000). Compared to their parent materials, vermicomposts have less soluble salts, greater cation exchange capacity, increased total humic acid, available nutrients and biologically active substances such as plant growth regulators (Kale 2014). Based on physical, chemical and biological characteristics, vermicomposts have considerable potential for growing vegetables, fruit bedding plants, green house crops, etc. (Edwards et al. 2011). Interestingly, presence of certain plant hormones such as indole acetic acid adsorbed into the low-weight humic substances extracted from earthworm feces have recently been reported by Canellas et al.

Similar reductions were observed for the untreated GW feedstock. Soil was amended with biochar or feedstock giving application rates of 1 and 5 %. Following an initial incubation, nitrogen (N) was added at 165  kg/ha as urea. Microcosms were again incubated before being brought to 100 % water-filled porosity and held at this water content for a further 47 days. The flooding phase accounted for the majority (< 80 %) of total N 2 O emissions. The control soil released 3165  mg N 2 O-N/m 2, or 15. 1 % of the available N as N 2 O. Amendment with 1 and 5 % GW feedstock significantly reduced emissions to 1470 and 636  mg N 2 O-N/m 2, respectively. This was equivalent to 8. 6 and 3. 8 % of applied N. The GW biochar produced at 350 °C was least effective in reducing emissions, resulting in 1625 and 1705  mg N 2 O-N/m 2 for 1 and 5 % amendments. Amendment with BS biochar at 5 % had the greatest impact, reducing emissions to 518  mg N 2 O-N/m 2, or 2. 2 % of the applied N over the incubation period. Metabolic activity as measured by CO 2 production could not explain the differences in N 2 O emissions between controls and amendments, nor could NH 4 + or NO 3 – concentrations in biochar-amended soils. A decrease in NH 4 + and NO 3 – following GW feedstock application {{is likely to have}} been responsible for reducing N 2 O emissions from this amendment. Reduction in N 2 O emissions from the biochar-amended soils was attributed to increased adsorption of NO 3 –.

Soil samples were collected from the B horizons of five oxidic Latosols representing the textural variability of the Latosols of the Cerrado biome. LLWR and other soil physical properties were determined at various soil compaction degrees induced by uniaxial compression. Soil compaction caused effects varying from enhanced plant growth due to higher water retention, to severe restriction of edaphic functions. Also, inverse relationships were observed between clay content and bulk density values (Bd) under different structural conditions.

These systems rely on a high soil fertility to maintain nutrient availability and plant health. Soil aggregation contributes to this fertility, because {{it is crucial to}} soil <b>porosity,</b> <b>aeration</b> and infiltration of water. This paper reports a study of two pairs of differently managed, neighboring fields. The aim was to elucidate long-term effects of the different farming systems on physical and biological variables with influence on bonding and binding mechanisms of soil aggregation. Each pair consists of an organically grown dairy farm soil, based on a forage crop rotation system, including grass (Org-FCS(G)) and a conventionally managed soil. One of the conventional farms has a forage crop rotation with annual cash crops and no grass (Conv-FCS(NG)) and one has been grown continuously with small grain cereals and rape (Conv-CCS). Our results indicate that the Org-FCS(G) soils stimulate biotic soil aggregating agents as measured by extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and hyphal length measurements, respectively. Generally, the Conv-CCS soil, which relies exclusively on synthetic fertilisers and cereal production, offered poor conditions for the biotic binding and bonding agents. Nevertheless this soil contained a large amount of stable macro-aggregates.

Despite improvements in soil physical properties and changes in rooting patterns, aboveground tree growth was not affected by tillage. The results of this study point to the need for better diagnostics for identifying sites were tillage is appropriate in situations where fertilization and vegetation control are planned. Potential factors to consider are presence and abundance of old root channels, soil shrink/swell capacity, soil structure, presence and depth to root restricting layers, and historical precipitation records...|$|E

Organic carbon accumulation in the representative natural fallow profile was 22. 7 g/kg, followed by 16. 5 g/kg for the Leucaena woodlot and lastly 11. 8 g/kg for the cultivated site. The mean bulk density of the natural fallow, Leucaena woodlot and cultivated sites were from 1. 36 Mg/m 3 , 0. 92 Mg/m 3 and 1. 33 Mg/m 3 with corresponding range in mean weight diameter of 0. 5 mm - 1. 2 mm, 0. 6 mm - 1. 2 mm and 1. 0 mm - 1. 2 mm, respectively. The lower bulk density observed for the woodlot corresponds to increased total <b>porosity,</b> <b>aeration,</b> and root proliferation due to the stronger and extensive rooting system. Significant differences (P > 36 %). For the surface soils, exchangeable Na was very variable in the natural fallow. Exchangeable Na, Ca and K and total nitrogen were very variable in the Leucaena woodlot and the cultivated sites. Variability in clay content was very high in the cultivated soils only. The order cultivated land > Leucaena woodlot > natural fallow was noted for properties with high variability (CV > 36 %). Plant biomass accumulation was 1834 kg/ha (natural fallow) and 830 kg/ha (Leucaena woodlot) indicating that natural fallows do not only maintain soil quality but they also decrease variability in soil properties which is desirable for soil productivity and quality...|$|R
30|$|There is {{a growing}} concern to {{decrease}} the application of chemical fertilizer to soils using soil nutrients more efficiently and by more application of organic matter. Excessive applications of agro-chemicals in crops have adversely affected the soil flora, fauna and enzymes which help to maintain the natural fertility of soil. Higher usage of fertilizers and pesticides has also desired more irrigation causing additional stress on water sources (Yadav and Garg 2011). Ground water pollution due to leaching of agrochemical is other ill-effects on environment. Organic fraction of solid wastes contains significant quantities of plant nutrients. But these wastes cannot be directly applied to the agricultural fields since these can destroy the natural fertility of the soil and may lead to phytotoxicity. The availability of nutrients to plants from organic manure is closely related to its maturity. Matured organic manure is well balanced in nutrients (NPK) with low C:N and C:P ratio, which indicates slow rate of nutrients release. While in case of unstabilized and fresh organic waste materials, higher nutrient release rates may limit the microbial growth which may retard or even stop decomposition and mineralization of wastes (Senesi 1989). So prior to land application of the solid wastes their biostabilization is essential. Among various methods of organic matter, vermicomposting is known to produce highly stabilized and non-thermophilic product, which has a great potential as soil amendment (Arancon et al. 2003 a, b). Vermicompost is finely divided peat-like material with high <b>porosity,</b> <b>aeration,</b> drainage and water-holding capacity (Edwards and Burrows 1988). It contains nutrients in such forms that are readily available to the plants, such as nitrates, exchangeable phosphorus, soluble potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc. (Edwards and Burrows 1988; Orozco et al. 1996). Tomati et al. (1990) reported that vermicomposts contain biologically active substances such as plant growth regulators, and have great potential in maintaining the soil fertility. If vermicomposts are integrated in nutrient management in agricultural fields, the costs of crop production may be reduced significantly (Sangwan et al. 2010).|$|R
30|$|Vermicompost is {{a product}} of non-thermophilic {{biodegradation}} of organic material by combined action of earthworms and associated microbes (Pathma and Sakthivel 2013). It is a highly fertile, finely divided peat-like material with high <b>porosity,</b> <b>aeration,</b> water-holding capacity and low C:N ratios (Dominguez and Edwards 2004). Vermicompost is made up primarily of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) and possesses remarkable plant growth-promoting properties due to the presence of nutrients in plant-available forms such as nitrates, calcium, phosphorus and potassium (Edwards and Burrows 1988). The enhancement of plant growth by vermicompost may not only be nutritional, but also due to its content of biologically active plant growth-influencing substances (Warman and AngLopez 2010). The presence of plant growth regulators such as auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins of microbial origin (Tomati et al. 1988) and humic acids (Atiyeh et al. 2002) has been reported in vermicompost. Stimulation of root growth (initiation and proliferation of root hair), increased root biomass, enhanced plant growth and development have been reported with the application of vermicompost, {{because of the presence of}} humic acids (Tomati et al. 1988; Mylonas and Mccants 1980; Chen and Aviad 1990). Moreover, the positive influences of humic acids on plant growth and productivity, which seem to be concentration specific, could be mainly due to hormone-like activities of humic acids through their involvement in cell respiration, photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, protein synthesis and various enzymatic reactions (Chen and Aviad 1990). Further, humic acids are molecules that regulate other processes of plant development, such as macro and micronutrient adsorption (Gutierrez-Miceli et al. 2008 a) and metabolism, which influence protein synthesis. Significant increase in soil enzyme activities such as urease, phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase and arylsulfatase has been associated with the application of vermicompost (Albiach et al. 2000). Vermicomposts also possess disease-suppressing potential on a wide range of phytopathogens (Sahni et al. 2008). Vermicomposts harbour a wide variety of efficient antagonistic bacteria aiding in suppression of diseases caused by devastating soil-borne phytopathogenic fungi (Singh et al. 2008; Pathma and Sakthivel 2012). Several studies also report that vermicompost application suppresses infection by insect pests, repel crop pests and induce biological resistance in plants against pests and diseases due the presence of antibiotics and actinomycetes (Munroe 2007).|$|R

The moisture stored in different soillayers is recognized as an important driver of the productivity and sustainability of semi-arid terrestrialecosystems, and land-use change has {{a significant effect on}} the global carbon (C) cycle through changingsoil C accumulation rates. To evaluate the response of soil water storage (SWS) and soil organic carbonstorage (SOCS) to long-term natural vegetation succession (∼ 150 a) and the coupling interaction betweenthem, we examined the soil moisture and soil organic carbon content in the land for different restorationages in the Ziwuling Forest region located in {{the central part of the}} Loess Plateau, China. Our resultsshowed that the SWS decreased and the SOCS increased with long-term natural vegetation restoration. The SOCS decreased along with the increase in the soil depth, and it was highest in the topsoil (0 – 20 cm). In addition, the soil depth at which the SWS intensely varied and at which the SOCS tended to be stablemoved downward and upward, respectively, with the vegetation succession. Furthermore, the correlationbetween SWS and SOCS was significant (P < 0. 05) in the long-term restoration and gradually weakenedwith the increase in the soil depth and the vegetation restoration stages. Clay, silt, sand, total porosity(TP), inactive porosity (IP), <b>aeration</b> <b>porosity</b> (AP) and capillary porosity (CP) were important factorsthat influenced the coupling interaction of SWS and SOCS at the grass restoration stages (< 50 a), andBD influenced this interaction in the shrub and early forest restoration stages (< 130 a). The effect of soilphysical factors on the interaction of SWS and SOCS gradually weakened during the vegetation restorationsuccession. These results are expected to help improve the understanding of the response of deep soilwater and soil organic carbon to long-term natural vegetation restoration and to provide insights intothe coupling interaction between soil water and soil organic carbon influenced by vegetation...|$|E

40|$|The least {{limiting}} {{water range}} (LLWR) was introduced as an integrated soil water content indicator, measuring {{the impact of}} mechanical impedance, oxygen and water availability on water uptake and crop growth. However, a rigorous definition of the upper limit of the LLWR using plant physiological and soil physical concepts was not given. We introduce in this study an upper limit of the LLWR, based on soil physical and plant physiological properties. We further evaluate the sensitivity of this boundary to different soil and crop variables, and compare {{the sensitivity of the}} upper limit of the LLWR to previous definitions of soil water content at field capacity. The current study confirms that the upper limit of the LLWR can be predicted from knowledge of the soil moisture characteristic curve, plant root depth and oxygen consumption rate. The sensitivity analysis shows further that the upper limit of the LLWR approaches the volumetric soil water content at saturation when the oxygen consumption rate by plants becomes less than 2 A mu mol m(- 3) s(- 1). When plants are susceptible to aeration (e. g. potato and avocado), {{there is a big difference}} between the upper limit of the LLWR and the soil water content at field capacity, in particular for sandy soils. Results also show that the soil water content at <b>aeration</b> <b>porosity</b> corresponding to 10 % cannot be considered as an appropriate upper limit of LLWR because it does not appropriately reflect the crop water requirements. Similar poor results are obtained when considering the soil water content at matric potential - 0. 033 MPa or when defining the soil water content at field capacity based on drainage flux rate. It is observed that the upper limit of the LLWR is higher than either soil water content at - 0. 033 MPa matric potential or soil water content at field capacity as based on drainage flux rate, especially in sandy soils...|$|E
30|$|Vermicomposting is {{the process}} of {{producing}} compost by utilizing earthworms to turn the organic waste into high-quality compost that consists mainly of worm cast in addition to decayed organic matter (Ismail 2005; Devi and Prakash 2015). Vermicomposting helps to convert the organic wastes (agro-wastes, animal manure and domestic refuse) into highly nutrient fertilizers for plant and soil (Gajalakshmi and Abassi 2004). Vermicompost is a finely divided peat-like material with excellent structure, <b>porosity,</b> <b>aeration,</b> drainage and moisture-holding capacity (Ismail 2005; Edwards et al. 2011). Vermicompost, an organic fertilizer rich in NPK, micronutrients and beneficial soil microbes (nitrogen fixing and phosphate solubilizing bacteria and actinomycetes), is a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers, which is an excellent growth promoter and protector for crop plants (Sinha et al. 2011; Chauhan and Singh 2015). Today vermicompost is an important component of organic farming systems, because it is easy to prepare, has excellent properties and is harmless to plants. Vermicompost improves the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil as well contributes to organic enrichment (Ansari and Jaikishun 2011; Chauhan and Singh 2013). In 1996 the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries (LVV) in Suriname made an attempt to investigate vermicomposting, but did not achieve significant results (Nanden and Dipotaroeno 1996). Since then, no research has been conducted in this area in Suriname. Investigations on vermicomposting and its impact on vegetable production are necessary, especially as it {{can be used as a}} bio-fertilizer. Research on vermicomposting will provide farmers with an environment-friendly fertilizer and assist in promoting the agriculture sector towards a greener future. The use of such technology will help in cost management in agriculture which is increased in the recent years and has added to the burden of farmers in terms of chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides. Consequently, the cost of production has increased many folds. Use of organic source of fertilizers like vermicompost could be an effective solution to the problem where it could substitute the chemical inputs in crop productivity and reduce the economic cost and on the other hand may also lead to organic produce which fetches higher price in the market. The increase in living standards around the world has created a growing demand for such organic produce, or cultivation using only natural pesticides and fertilizers, which are perceived to be healthier for consumers and environment friendly (Kaplan 2016).|$|R

Não houve diferença estatística entre as amostras para as características físicas estudadas. As amostras oriundas do litoral não diferiram daquelas obtidas no interior, assim como, as amostras que sofreram hidrólise ácida não diferiram daquelas in natura. Da mesma forma, as partes da planta (folhas, estipe e cartucho) não apresentaram diferenças significativas entre si.

40|$|Soil {{biodiversity}} constitutes one of {{the main}} component of agroecosystems, being involved in the delivery of several essential ecosystem services such as, among others, nutrient cycling, soil formation, pest and pollution control. Thus, soil biodiversity indicators can be used by governments and farmers to monitor soil quality and ecosystem functioning under various land uses and management practices. At present, organic wine represents an emerging market that is showing potential for growth. There is, in fact, a growing worldwide interest and attention for environmental friendly products and sustainable agricultural practices. Organic farming employs a set of farming practices that contribute in preserving soil quality. In this scenario, the aim of our study was to assess the long-term effects of organically managed vineyards on soil quality by means of two bioindicators: ciliated protozoa and microarthropods. Ciliated protozoa are eukaryotic microorganisms which constitutes an essential component of the soil microbial loop. By feeding on bacterial biomass ciliates play an essential role in the liberation of nutrients in the plant rhizosphere. Soil microarthropods contribute to the organic matter degradation and dispersal, affect the soil <b>porosity,</b> <b>aeration,</b> water infiltration, modifying and improving soil fertility. Both ciliates and microarthropods are very sensitive to changes in their habitat and fluctuations in their communities can affect the food web and the energy transfer within the soil ecosystem. Thus, the monitoring of the structure of microarthropod and ciliate communities represent a valuable tool to assess soil quality and functioning. The study was realized in the terroir of “Verdicchio di Matelica” (Marche, Italy), on three vineyards that were organically managed since 1992, 1998 and 2009 respectively. In each vineyard, soil samples (0 - 10 cm depth) were taken every month from March to October 2011. In addition, soil chemical-physical (texture, soil moisture, pH, NPK, OM, C/N, Cu), were measured in each site. For microarthropods, the measured biological parameters were: the Soil Biological Quality (QBS-ar) index, abundances of biological (BF) and euedaphic forms (EF) and diversity indices. Soil samples were collected in both disturbed (tillage) and not-disturbed (no-tillage) inter-rows. For ciliates: abundances and diversity indices were measured and soil samples were randomly collected in the whole sampling area. The results of the multivariate data analysis (Cluster Analysis, CA; non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling, nMDS) and diversity indices (H’,J,d) indicate that the most stable habitat for ciliates and microarthropods is represented by the “older” (V 92) followed by the V 98 and the “younger” V 09 vineyards. Collectively, the data seem to indicate that the long-term organic management of the soil contributes to global soil quality in vineyards at least in this particular pedoclimatic area and for the investigated bioindicators. Furthermore, this study helps in the definition of possible biotic baseline values to evaluate soil quality and health in vineyards...|$|R
