5|$|After Ealdred's death, {{one of the}} {{restraints}} on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred {{was one of a}} few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E

Cunningham {{played in the}} match which was won easily by the New Zealanders 55–4. Devon were expected to pose a serious challenge, but were overwhelmed and only managed to score a drop-kick.

I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories.

5|$|Between 2:00am and 3:00am on Sunday morning, July 22, {{the peace}} was again broken and fire alarms began to ring {{throughout}} the city. To the west, at the Mount Clare Shops of the B, a 37-car train of coal and oil {{had been set}} on fire. Police, firefighters, and thousands of citizens flocked to the scene. A contingent of 50 marines was dispatched to the area to provide assistance. The cars which had not yet caught fire were detached from those burning, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the flames were extinguished between seven and nine cars had been burned.

5|$|Blaine {{had always}} {{believed}} his health to be fragile, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he joined Harrison’s cabinet he truly was unwell.

With these family issues and his declining health, Blaine decided to retire and {{announced that he would}} resign from the cabinet on June 4, 1892. Because of their growing animosity, and because Blaine’s resignation came three days before the 1892 Republican National Convention began, Harrison suspected that Blaine was preparing to run against him for the party’s nomination for president.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{legislation}} aided the cause. From 1968, county councils {{could set}} up country parks, under the Countryside Act 1968, and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British Waterways Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase inland waterways. By 1969, BWB had stated that {{they were prepared to}} hand over the canal to Devon County Council, together with some money for maintenance. With some representatives within the council wavering, the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969. Around 400 walkers set off, with the local member of Parliament firing a starting gun, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Tiverton was reached, the party totalled about 1200 people.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals.

5|$|Despite these setbacks, Simonds {{was adamant}} that Verrières Ridge {{should be taken}} and sent in the Black Watch and the Calgary Highlanders to {{stabilise}} the precarious Allied position.

5|$|During that series, Leyland scored runs {{several times}} under {{pressure}} <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Australia toured England in 1934, {{he was a}} leading batsman in the team.

After military service in the Second World War, Leyland returned to the Yorkshire team for one season before announcing his retirement from regular first-class cricket.

5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui Dynasty, Yang (reigned 604–618), the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane: the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, coupled with natural disasters, caused unrest in the provinces, while the successive military failures eroded the emperor's prestige and legitimacy ("Mandate of Heaven") among the provincial governors. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he realized {{the gravity of the}} situation, it was too late: as revolts spread, in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E

5|$|Fireworks: Fireworks first {{appeared}} in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), in the early age of gunpowder.

5|$|Following the Second World War, service levels dropped {{dramatically}} along the Portishead branch.
