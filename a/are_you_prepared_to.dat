Afterwards, with his dying breath, Donut gets up, grabs the Landlord by the shirt and utters in English, [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> do?", a nod to Sean Connery's character Jim Malone in Brian De Palma's 1987 film The Untouchables.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Monsieur de Laval,' said he suddenly, 'you {{have seen}} {{something}} of my methods. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> enter my service?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A word or {{two with}} regard to the {{business}} part of this matter, Miss Thurwell. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> spend a good deal of money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but that}} <b>is</b> what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> do!" [...] said he, {{and he held}} her {{away from him and}} stared at her, as if he had never seen Elspeth before. [...] "Were you not afraid?" [...] he exclaimed, in amazement.|$|R
60|$|Starbottle (coolly). Then <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> give me satisfaction, sir,--personal satisfaction.|$|R
5000|$|... "Don't try {{to solve}} that problem until <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> deal with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|FRANKLYN [to Lubin] <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> listen, Mr Lubin; or shall I {{thank you}} for your very kind and welcome visit, and say good evening? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Has Machowl come {{on board}} yet?" [...] asked Baldwin, as he stepped on the deck. [...] "Ah, I see he has.--Well, Rooney lad, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> go down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However long {{it may be}} delayed, the day of fate must {{break at}} last. Say, Franks, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> drink the dregs of that cup I promised you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{strikes you}} as sudden: {{you had no}} {{intention}} of going for hours. But the hint is too plain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ignored. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> agree that <b>you</b> really must when, looking round, you gather that the last remark was not addressed to you, but to another gentleman who is shaking hands with her: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Adolf?" [...] I inquired. [...] "I {{believe she}} thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> {{run away with}} him. You seemed to have him hypnotized." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 20, 2007 Kerry {{issued a}} letter {{responding}} to Pickens'. He accused Pickens of [...] "parsing and backtracking" [...] on his initial offer and wrote that [...] "I am <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> prove the lie and marshal all the evidence, the question <b>is</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> fulfill your obligation." [...] He concluded that [...] "the only thing remaining {{now is to}} set the date for our meeting in an appropriate forum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Clavering, [...] "I don't think I am. I {{know you}} got a wallet of dollars--though I don't know who sent them. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> deny it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! I {{thought that}} I was {{explicit}} enough, brutally explicit, even. What have you to offer me {{in place of}} your name and yourself? What sacrifice <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> make?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> {{encounter}} all {{the horrors}} that a building such as 'what one reads about' may produce? Have you a stout heart? Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS MARCH. If {{he would}} only learn {{that the value of}} a {{sentiment}} is the amount of sacrifice <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> make for it! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If your Highness will ring when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> {{give me an}} audience," [...] he said, [...] "I {{shall be}} entirely at your service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Must we take it, then, Mannering," [...] Lord Redford said, gravely, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> {{support the}} {{administering}} {{of the medicine}} you spoke of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|CYRIL. The {{theory is}} {{certainly}} a very curious one, but to make it complete you must show that Nature, no less than Life, is an imitation of Art. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> prove that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you hear, Mr. Greene?" [...] said she, {{turning to}} him. [...] "Do {{you mean to}} allow that vast amount of {{property}} to be lost without an effort? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> replace my jewels?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be 'Let us {{take the}} road,' then," [...] said Stephen,--"so {{suitable}} for a wet morning. But <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> abandon the most sacred duties of life, and come and sing with us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't fancy {{camping in}} the woods all night, and that <b>is</b> about what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] one of the Albany {{officers}} said, grumblingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] Julian muttered. [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> {{plead guilty}} to is holding {{communication}} {{with members of the}} Labour and Socialist Party in Germany." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} {{interesting}} to me {{to hear from you}} there, when the ladies had left us, how many old threads <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> pick up." ...|$|R
6000|$|Col. Starbottle. Permit me, a moment,--a single moment. (To Concho.) You have--er--er--characterized my {{introduction}} of this--er--gentleman as a [...] "cheat" [...] and an [...] "imposture." [...] <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> deny {{that this is}} Alexander Morton? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In one moment, Mr. Thew. Even {{though you}} do not choose to answer them, there are certain {{questions}} I intend to ask. The first is, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> produce the Marconigram which you received last evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Clair," [...] {{said the}} manager of an agency to which she had applied, [...] "I am glad to be able at last {{to make you a}} {{definite}} offer of employment. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> go upon the stage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn't own me," [...] said March, rising. [...] "He {{has made}} the little mistake of {{speaking}} {{to me as if}} he did; and when"--March put on his hat and took his overcoat down from its nail--"when you bring me his apologies, or come to say that, having failed to make him understand they <b>were</b> necessary, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> stand by me, I will come back to this desk. Otherwise my resignation is at your service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not marry me! And why not, Lady Desmond? Is not {{my blood}} {{as good as}} his?--unless, indeed, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> sell your child to the highest bidder!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I to {{understand}} then, Sir Percy," [...] said Chauvelin, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> apologize to Mademoiselle Candeille for this insult offered {{to her by}} Lady Blakeney?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite {{as well as}} he deserves! What a {{house to}} bring us to;--and what people! Did you ever come across such an old woman before! And she has him {{completely}} under her thumb. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> live with that harridan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, the de-votion of a lifetime,' he answered, looking {{sideways}} at me. 'Miss Cayley, when a business man advances a proposition, commercial or otherwise, he advances {{it because he}} means it. He asks a prompt reply. Your time is valuable. So is mine. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> consider it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, General Santerre," [...] said Denot, marching {{close up}} to him, [...] "are you {{prepared}} to make good your promise to me? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> give me an escort for myself and this lady, and {{to allow us to}} commence our journey from hence to Saumur?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lady Constantine, don't {{be angry}} with me! Will you do this,--watch the star for me while I <b>am</b> gone? If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> do it effectually, I will go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I {{have done}} all that and am quite {{satisfied}} with the security --an advance of thirty thousand charged on all the Honham Castle estates at four per cent. The question now <b>is</b> if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> consent to the transfer. In that case all the old charges on the property will be paid off, and Mr. Quest, who will act {{for me in the}} matter, will prepare a single deed charging the estate for the round total." ...|$|R
6000|$|Verena waived {{this point}} of the discussion; she only said: [...] "Well, I am glad <b>to</b> hear <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> see the place all choked up with old maids!" ...|$|R
