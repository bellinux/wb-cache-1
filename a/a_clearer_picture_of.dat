5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. These measures gave each platoon <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat.|$|E

The first passerines are now thought to have evolved in the Southern Hemisphere in the late Paleocene or early Eocene, around 50 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 season saw {{a return}} to {{excavation}} at the site, {{with a focus on}} the palace in Area D that had been discovered by Kempinski. The team wanted to go deeper and explore the possibility of there being a palace beneath the one Kempinski found. They managed to get <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the entire MB palatial area up to the 1600s BC destruction, and recovered further wall plaster fragments. The structure underneath the MB II palace was determined most likely to be a palace itself, and further fragments of Aegean wall frescos and imported pottery were found, allowing the excavators to push back the time for contact with the Aegean and Cyprus to the MB I period. At the close of the dig season, the site was covered up to preserve it in the off-season.|$|E

[...] The surviving brother is given a choice to take his responsibility as a goel by fulfilling the yibbum obligation, or to perform halizah, though the latter choice is described by the verse disfavorably. The brother who agreed to marry his sister-in-law would be the sole benefactor of his brother's estate instead of splitting it with the family. The offspring of the levirate union {{would be seen as}} a perpetuation of the deceased brother's name. Levirate marriage is permissible only when the dead brother had no children at all.|$|E
2500|$|The ancient Indians were {{generally}} unconcerned with chronologies, being {{more focused on}} philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the Jain scriptures, and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in Indian history for which significant accounts exist. British author Karen Armstrong writes that although {{there is very little}} information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddhārtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure. Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of [...] "birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death" [...] must be true.|$|E

The Civic Action was considered a practical tool of Diệm's government to serve [...] "the power vacuum" [...] and make a rural influence for Diệm's government in countryside due to the departure of Việt Minh cadres after the Geneva Accords (1954).

2500|$|The 13th {{and early}} 14th centuries are {{generally}} regarded as the high period of scholasticism. [...] The early 13th century witnessed {{the culmination of the}} recovery of Greek philosophy. [...] Schools of translation grew up in Italy and Sicily, and eventually in the rest of Europe. [...] Scholars such as Adelard of Bath travelled to Sicily and the Arab world, translating works on astronomy and mathematics, including the first complete translation of Euclid’s Elements. Powerful Norman kings gathered men of knowledge from Italy and other areas into their courts as a sign of their prestige. William of Moerbeke's translations and editions of Greek philosophical texts in the middle half of the thirteenth century helped in forming <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Greek philosophy, and in particular of Aristotle, than was given by the Arabic versions they had previously relied on, which had distorted or obscured the relation between Platonic and Aristotelian systems of philosophy. [...] His work formed the basis of the major commentaries that followed.|$|E

[...] The protagonists continually gain <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> {{the true nature of}} the glasses and cyberspace throughout the series. [...] It is eventually revealed that the glasses form a two-way brain-computer interface known as Imago, first used in experimental medical treatments. [...] However, there are substantial health risks in prolonged use of the interface, and the interface itself presents the possibility of a coma or brain death through the [...] "dennō coil" [...] phenomenon. [...] At the same time, an experiment gone awry gave birth to Michiko, a digital life form that assumed control of Coil Domain—referred to in rumors as [...] "the other side". [...] Due to their inability to erase Coil Domain, Megamass opted to instead create a new layer of augmented reality space on top of Coil Domain, where the influence of Michiko and Imago was lessened in order to minimize the occurrence of dennō coil. [...] Much information regarding Coil Domain, Imago, Michiko and dennō coil has been aggressively covered up by the technology conglomerate, Megamass.|$|E
