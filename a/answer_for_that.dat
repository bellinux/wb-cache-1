25|$|Viper was {{launched}} at Poole on 11 June, and having got her ready for sea, Roddam sailed {{to join the}} Channel Fleet at Spithead, arriving on 26 July. Shortly after his arrival, the commander-in-chief, George Anson {{expressed a desire to}} stop a fleet, then at Plymouth, from sailing. The commanders of the various ships in the fleet argued against sending a ship, owing to the strong south-westerly wind, but Roddam, despite having a brand-new ship, not fully fitted and trialled at sea, offered to make the attempt. Impressed, Anson wrote to the Admiralty, and requested that Roddam be placed under his command. Anson was later superseded by Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Warren, who in mid-1747 received word from a Bristol-based privateer that a fleet of some 30 ships were assembled at Cedeiro Bay, near Cape Ortegal, loaded with naval stores. The entrance to the anchorage was very narrow, and was defended by two shore batteries. With the odds against any attack, Sir Peter decided that there was little point in risking an assault. At this time Captain Henry Harrison, Roddam's old commander on Monmouth, suggested to Warren that Roddam make an attempt in Viper, adding that 'He would <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> young man effecting all that human nature could perform'.|$|E
500|$|In a 1971 {{letter to}} Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, [...] "When {{people ask me}} {{questions}} about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> <b>that!</b> It's not a putdown, it's the truth." [...] Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting specifically on [...] "Revolution 9", Lennon said with ironic authority, [...] "For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask {{any of the other}} people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Brown's theorem {{left open}} {{the case of}} acyclic social {{preferences}} where the number of alternatives {{is less than the}} number of individuals.

2500|$|... "It {{certainly}} {{is one of}} the real disappointments in my career. We had the players to do it. We just didn't get it done and I'm the one that must <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> But I do think it was a growing period in my life where I learned what it takes. And maybe not winning one kept me that much more hungry when we came over to Bolles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, Lucas often {{exaggerated the}} amount of {{material}} he wrote for the series; much of the exagerations stemmed from the post‐1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon. Michael Kaminski explained that the exaggerations were both a publicity and security measure, further rationalizing that since the series' story radically changed throughout the years, it was always Lucas' intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material from his perspective. The exagerations created rumors of Lucas having plot outlines a sequel trilogy of (Episodes VII, VIII and IX), which would continue the story after 1983's Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Lucasfilm and George Lucas had [...] denied plans for a sequel trilogy for many years, insisting that Star Wars {{was meant to be}} a six-part series, and that no further films would be released after the conclusion of the prequel trilogy in 2005. Albeit Lucas made an exception by releasing the animated Star Wars: The Clone Wars film in 2008, while promoting it, Lucas maintained his status on the sequel trilogy: [...] "I get asked all the time, 'What happens after Return of the Jedi?,' and there really is no <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father, that's where that story ends." ...|$|E

50|$|The program {{immediately}} informs {{whether the}} answer is right or wrong. Through the Preferences screen, the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked. At {{the bottom of the}} window, the program shows all the screens for the current lesson. If all <b>answers</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> screen are correct, the button <b>for</b> <b>that</b> screen turns green. If some answers are correct, the border of the button turns green, but the screen number itself turns orange. If all <b>answers</b> <b>for</b> a screen are wrong, the button turns orange. This applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons, which are treated as tests. In those lessons, the buttons for each screen all remain brown. In all lessons there is a button in the bottom-right of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct, wrong or have not been answered. Each time an answer is clicked, one point is given. At the end of the lesson, the total number of correct, wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct <b>answers</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> lesson. If too many questions were answered incorrectly, the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson.|$|R

5000|$|On the {{web page}} of the company EF, the score {{calculation}} is explained: [...] "In order to calculate a country’s EF EPI score, each test score was normalized to obtain the percentage of correct <b>answers</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> test. All the scores for a country were then averaged across the three tests, giving equal weight to each test." [...] There is thus no differentiation of the three tests for the calculation of the score.|$|R

6000|$|... "That would he--that would he!" [...] {{returned}} the Alderman. [...] "I <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> it, <b>that</b> Mr. Van Staats complies with all engagements, as punctually {{as the best}} house in Amsterdam, itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> There's Stovey's empty cart {{standing}} just where it stood yesterday; and he promised he'd have it home before three to-day. My back {{will be up}} with him if he doesn't mind himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll not <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> Maud. One {{would do}} {{a great deal to}} {{preserve}} his paternal dwelling from pillage, and his father's grey hairs from violence. But I came alone; that party and its objects being utterly strangers to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|Holmes {{laughed and}} threw his card {{across the table}} to the constable. [...] "Don't get arresting me for the murder," [...] he said.

6000|$|... "I'll <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> and it's another {{proof of}} its being wrong. In a vessel is as correct as in a coach, {{and on a}} vessel as wrong as can be; but you can say on board a vessel, though not `on the boards of a vessel;' as Mrs. Budd has it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thirdly,--For that {{he hoped}} (could he {{overtake}} them) to have company by-and-by.
