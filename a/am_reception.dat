2500|$|In the 1990s, {{many of the}} CBC's AM {{stations}} {{moved to}} FM in response to complaints of poor <b>AM</b> <b>reception.</b> This meant that the old distinction between the AM [...] "Radio" [...] network and the FM [...] "Stereo" [...] network was no longer accurate, {{even though many of}} the FM [...] "Radio" [...] stations broadcast in mono only. As a result, in 1997 CBC Radio became CBC Radio One and CBC Stereo became CBC Radio 2. Although some Radio One stations still broadcast on AM as of 2016, because of issues with urban reception of AM radio signals many of the remaining AM stations have added FM rebroadcasters in major urban centres within their broadcast area.|$|E
5000|$|Owing to the {{difficulty}} of <b>AM</b> <b>reception</b> in modern times, WINA added an FM translator on 98.9 MHz in November 2015. This translator is fed by an HD subchannel of co-owned WCNR (106.1 MHz).|$|E
50|$|In 2000, the CBC {{opened a}} local FM {{repeater}} of CBK in Regina, CBKR-FM 102.5, due to problems with urban <b>AM</b> <b>reception</b> during the day. In 2006, a second repeater was added—CBK-1-FM 94.1 in Saskatoon.|$|E

50|$|The {{lower the}} {{transmission}} frequency of AM sound broadcasting stations (also: AM radio), the greater is the geographical area covered, and lower {{is the quality}} of <b>AM</b> <b>reception.</b> Typical AM radio stations broadcast at frequencies between 525 kHz and 1605 kHz.|$|E
50|$|Since August 1987, {{the tunnels}} have {{provided}} cellular phone reception. The tunnel provided <b>AM</b> <b>reception</b> in 1958; however, due to design repairs, the reception was discontinued {{by the early}} 1960s until being reinstalled in 1986. Radio reception was improved to cover the entire tunnel in March, 1997. With the help of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students, the tunnel has provided FM reception since May, 2005; moreover, AM signals were upgraded at that time.|$|E
50|$|In April 2007, CHOK AM {{applied to}} add an FM {{transmitter}} (CHOK-1-FM) at Sarnia to broadcast at 103.3 MHz and simulcast the programing of CHOK 1070 AM, due to <b>AM</b> <b>reception</b> problems from metal and steel associated with the operations from petrochemical plants. Another company, Points Eagle Radio, had applied {{at the same time}} to use the 103.3 MHz frequency to broadcast Aboriginal programing. Points Eagle Radio was given approval by the CRTC to use the 103.3 FM frequency on August 7, 2007.|$|E

50|$|The tunnel {{provided}} <b>AM</b> <b>reception</b> in 1960 however due {{to design}} repairs it was discontinued until 1986. It was improved {{to cover the}} entire tunnel with strong reception in March 1997.Since August 1987 the tunnels have provided cellular phone reception. With the help of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students the tunnel has provided FM reception since July 2005 as well as having its AM signals upgraded at the time. In 2015, the original flat ceiling was removed due to its poor condition.|$|E
50|$|The station {{also has}} a rebroadcast {{transmitter}} (CBEF-1-FM) in Leamington, on 103.1 FM. Due to <b>AM</b> <b>reception</b> issues in downtown Windsor, CBEF was also approved by the CRTC to operate a 620-watt rebroadcaster in Windsor at 105.5 MHz, provided that does not interfere with stations at or near this frequency, such as WQQO in Toledo or WWCK-FM in Flint. The callsign for the new rebroadcaster at 105.5 FM is CBEF-2-FM. As of April 1, 2012, 105.5 CBEF-2 is on the air.|$|E
50|$|For <b>AM</b> <b>reception,</b> {{the gain}} {{of the loop}} is {{adjusted}} so it is just below the level required for oscillation (a loop gain of just less than one). The result {{of this is to}} greatly increase the gain of the amplifier at the bandpass frequency (resonant frequency), while not increasing it at other frequencies. So the incoming radio signal is amplified by a large factor, 103 - 105, increasing the receiver's sensitivity to weak signals. The high gain also has the effect of sharpening the circuit's bandwidth (increasing the Q factor) by an equal factor, increasing the selectivity of the receiver, its ability to reject interfering signals at frequencies near the desired station's frequency.|$|E

5000|$|A {{more serious}} {{drawback}} {{was that it}} could act as an inadvertent radio transmitter, producing interference (RFI) in nearby receivers. In <b>AM</b> <b>reception,</b> {{to get the most}} sensitivity the tube was operated very close to instability and could easily break into oscillation (and in CW reception did oscillate), and the resulting radio signal was radiated by its wire antenna. In nearby receivers, the regenerative's signal would beat with the signal of the station being received in the detector, creating annoying heterodynes, (beats), howls and whistles. [...] Early regeneratives which oscillated easily were called [...] "bloopers", and were made illegal in Europe. One preventative measure was to use a stage of RF amplification before the regenerative detector, to isolate it from the antenna. [...] But by the mid 1920s [...] "regens" [...] were no longer sold by the major radio manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|Selectivity {{became more}} {{important}} as spark transmitters {{were replaced by}} continuous wave transmitters which transmitted on a narrow band of frequencies, and broadcasting led to a proliferation of closely spaced radio stations crowding the radio spectrum. [...] Resonant transformers continued {{to be used as}} the bandpass filter in vacuum tube radios, and new forms such as the variometer were invented. [...] Another advantage of the double-tuned transformer for <b>AM</b> <b>reception</b> was that when properly adjusted it had a [...] "flat top" [...] frequency response curve as opposed to the [...] "peaked" [...] response of a single tuned circuit. [...] This allowed it to pass the sidebands of AM modulation {{on either side of the}} carrier with little distortion, unlike a single tuned circuit which attenuated the higher audio frequencies. Until recently the bandpass filters in the superheterodyne circuit used in all modern receivers were made with resonant transformers, called IF transformers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first record}} that Tom Browne played on [...] "Solid Gold 60" [...] at 4.00 pm on Sunday 1st October 1972 was [...] "Honky Cat" [...] by Elton John. The first two hours were {{broadcast}} only on Radio 1's medium wave channel, which {{at that time}} was 247 metres (1215 kHz) although occasionally local radio stations broadcasting on FM in mono such as BBC Radio London (94.9 MHz) would carry the transmission from 4 - 6pm. The previous Sunday chart show, the long running Pick of the Pops with Alan Freeman, aired between 5-7 pm and was broadcast not just on 247m but Radio 2's FM and LW frequencies for the entire show, but the axing of Pick of the Pops, brought a change to the allocation of FM and LW airtime, with Radio 1 losing one of the precious hours of valuable FM and LW for its chart show, as they reverted to Radio 2. This was bad news for the numerous parts of the country where reception of Radio 1 on 247m was poor, especially during the dark winter months when <b>AM</b> <b>reception</b> deteriorated. From the outset on 1st October 1972, Solid Gold 60's final hour was broadcast on FM and LW as well as on Radio 1 (247m). Twenty records were crammed into 60 minutes, plus a verbal countdown. Whilst many recordings of the many Top 20's aired between 6-7 survive today, there seem to be few recordings of the first two hours of Solid Gold 60 (4-6pm) which have survived.|$|E
