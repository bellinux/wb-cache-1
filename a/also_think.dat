But, some <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that the carving is of Seth Senior himself. Members of the Roebuck family lived on this site for over 70 years and held the tenancy when the famous Sovereign Anthem was written in 1929 to commemorate 100 years of the brewery. Sarah Jane's death in 1976 ended Roebuck family ties with the Sovereign Inn.|$|E
25|$|The Polka-dot tree frog, widely {{found in}} the Amazon was {{discovered}} {{to be the first}} fluorescent amphibian in 2017. The frog is pale green with dots in white, yellow or light red. The fluorescence of the frog was discovered unintentionally in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The fluorescence was traced to a new compound {{found in the}} lymph and skin glads. The main fluorescent compound is Hyloin-L1 and it gives a blue-green glow when exposed to violet or ultra violet light. Scientists behind the discovery say that the fluorescence can be used for communication. They <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that about 100 or 200 species of frogs are likely to be fluorescent.|$|E

500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] is one {{of those}} songs that's in the DNA of so much going on these days that it's hard to know where to start. Its tape collage alone makes it one of the first tracks to use {{sampling}} really successfully.

500|$|Blumenfeld has {{described}} how his character [...] "sort of evolved" [...] from being [...] "super needy [...] weird" [...] to [...] "a little crazier", but that [...] "the root of my character {{is still the}} same, the insecurity of it". Regarding his similarity to his character, {{he said he is}} [...] "hopefully very different but maybe at the root of it we're the same person. I'm probably a little smarter than the character though. Maybe the things that he thinks I <b>also</b> <b>think</b> but I'm able to suppress them." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph Madonna further explained her inspiration behind the song and stated that [...] " [...] a song most people who work can relate to.

500|$|Regarding the {{characters}} that could {{appear in the}} season, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "The idea of some familiar faces with some new faces is {{something to look forward}} to. I <b>also</b> <b>think</b> finding some new Marvel characters to pull into the universe would be cool. Fans seem to respond when there are characters from the Marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] He later explained that the series has the opportunity to explore the Inhumans outside of the Royal Family (who are the major focus of the comics, television series and previously planned film). The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics. The change was due to 20th Century Fox controlling the film and television rights to the majority of Marvel's X-Men and mutant characters.|$|E
500|$|Michael Ausiello spoke {{further on}} Katherine Heigl's {{perspective}} on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not {{originally intended to}} be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. [...] "Even though there's {{a part of me}} that would like to go back and do the quick Izzie farewell, [...] " [...] she says, [...] "I <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that my last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Don't go, we're your family,' and Izzie's response was, 'No you're not, you're just a bunch of people I worked with, and I can find that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy {{felt the}} video was unique and commented that [...] "There aren't many popstars {{who could make}} a video {{featuring}} doves, balloons, a galloping horse, a giant inflatable elephant and a mass grope-fest {{in the middle of}} LA... {{and get away with it}} [...]" [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly complimented its sexuality and said that the video could [...] "best described as either a makeout flash mob, a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade gone wild, or some serious [...] "the touch, the feel of cotton" [...] guerrilla marketing." [...] MuuMuse-editor Bradley Stern praised the concept of the video as [...] "incredible" [...] and complimented the inclusion of the horse. Popjustice called the music video a [...] "lovely pervoramic pop moment." [...] Due to its sexual content and nature, the music video was censored and banned in numerous Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In an interview with Spanish television channel Cuatro, Minogue responded to the censorship and said: [...] "I think, yes, it's sexy but I <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it's very touching and sensual and the message is love." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Peter Robinson of The Observer gave the song the maximum five stars referring {{to it as}} a [...] "comeback single" [...] and as having a [...] "genius hook". He added that the song [...] " [...] been called lazy, largely by misinformed people who <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that Kylie's 'la la la's would have been better with proper words". Popjustice compared it to [...] "Some Girls" [...] by Rachel Stevens and added [...] " [...] track lays a really strong foundation for the realised comeback that didn't quite happen last time and it's hard not {{to think of it as}} a late contender for single of the year. [...] It's literally quite good". Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald said [...] "it's got hit written all over it". On the week of November 24, 2008, the Derby Telegraph chose it as single of the week. In the album review, Nekesa Mumbi Moody of The Providence Journal said that along with [...] "Shattered Glass", they were [...] " [...] fun disco tracks".|$|E
500|$|... "The List" [...] premiered on the Fox {{network in}} the United States on October 20, 1995. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.8, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 10.8 percent of all television-equipped {{households}}, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was watched {{by a total of}} 16.72 million viewers, and was later nominated for several International Monitor Awards, including nominations for best director, best editing, and best color correction. [...] "The List" [...] later won the award for best director. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode, [...] "I think this is a vastly underrated episode. I <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it was a very brave and different show to do and that it will weather the test of time very well. I think it was brave because {{there is not a single}} likable character - nobody you can root for. Mulder and Scully do not solve the case, and that is something I had been interested in doing for some time." [...] Chris Carter was nominated for an award by the Directors Guild of America for his work on this episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I <b>also</b> <b>think</b> there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but I <b>also</b> <b>think</b> she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. I know how to do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, Perry said that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E
500|$|... "Bouncing Back" [...] {{opens with}} [...] "a mysterious flash-forward {{to three months}} in the future, showing an {{unidentified}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agent seemingly dead in space." [...] Tancharoen called it [...] "the promise of something fairly ominous to come", and stated, [...] "We will be uncovering things from the midseason opener {{all the way to}} the finale. We will slowly be discovering what that image is." [...] She added that any [...] "clues" [...] would likely play out during present day sequences rather than further flash-forwards, such as when Johnson receives a vision of the flash-forward in [...] "Spacetime", an episode where she learns that [...] "she cannot change the outcome of these visions and the future is the future." [...] Whedon discussed this idea, and that of the [...] "theory behind the Inhumans that each one of them serves a purpose", saying, Inhumans [...] "are made, they're not random. There's a lack of something that needs filling and an Inhuman will be created that fills that niche. It's an interesting concept we like playing with, and that plays into the idea of fate, which with our future visions, we're hitting pretty hard." [...] On choosing Lincoln to be the one to die, which the executive producers knew going into the season when forming the arcs for Lincoln, Daisy, and Ward, Bell said he [...] "earned it" [...] adding that Lincoln comes to a point where he realizes what his purpose is, with Whedon noting that he understands that Daisy has a different purpose. Whedon continued that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not [...] "want to be a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes. What we had not done is the heroic death and the full-sacrifice death. This was a conscious decision. We <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that there’s a poetry in the fact that the person doing it doesn’t consider himself a hero. That’s the beauty of the moment—it’s not just for , but it is, and it’s not just for him, but it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.
