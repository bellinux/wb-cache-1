40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{sought to}} investigate the relationship between capacity and safety on freeway roadways in New Jersey. Using the State's roadway database, capacity was estimated for State roadways using the procedures in the Highway Capacity Manual. Crash prediction models were developed relating <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rates to the geometric variables used to estimate capacity {{as well as to}} capacity and v/c ratio. The research showed that as capacity increases the number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rate also increases. As v/c ratio increased the number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rate decreased indicating that congestion may result in reduced speeds and as a result a lower number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rates. The research points to the need to include operational parameters in performing road safety evaluations...|$|R
5|$|On 17 January 1931, Breguet 280T F-AIVU of Air Union crashed whilst {{attempting}} {{to land at}} Lympne. The aircraft caught the boundary fence <b>and</b> <b>crashed</b> onto the airfield, damaging the forward fuselage and undercarriage. Of the eight people on board, one of the crew was injured.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 1961, a B-52G {{broke up}} in midair <b>and</b> <b>crashed</b> after {{suffering}} a severe fuel loss, near Goldsboro, North Carolina, dropping two nuclear bombs in the process without detonation. 3 of the 8 crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 1963, a B-52C on a {{training}} mission out of Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, lost its vertical stabilizer due to buffeting during low-level flight, <b>and</b> <b>crashed</b> {{on the west}} side of Elephant Mountain near Greenville, Maine. Of the nine crewmen aboard, two survived the crash.|$|E
30|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was designed to}} examine taxi drivers’ personal views on work-related stress, daily risky driving behaviors, <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> risk. The survey consisted of 16 questions ranging from sociodemographic characteristics, level of workload, frequency of risky driving behaviors <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> experience over the past 3 years.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that speed plays {{a large part}} in the chance {{of being involved in}} a road crash. Speed also plays a part in crash severity. This, however, is much more simple to determine than the relation between speed <b>and</b> the <b>crash</b> chance. During the course of time, many studies of the relation between speed <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> chance have been carried out, but they have had very varying results. This literature study aims at providing an up-to-date picture of the most important, and especially the most recent studies made of speed and its relation to crash chance. In this study, a distinction is made between studies that have reported results on a) the relation between absolute speed <b>and</b> <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> b) the relation between speed distribution <b>and</b> <b>crashes.</b> In addition, the report contains an inventory of the research methods used until now to study the relation between speed <b>and</b> <b>crashes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Road works (speed limit {{changed from}} 70mph to 50mph, speed cameras, better safety fencing, banning cyclists from the road, slip road changes) {{finished}} {{at the start}} of 2000 reduced traffic collisions <b>and</b> <b>crashes</b> by 60%. Before this it was having 26 vehicle collisions <b>and</b> <b>crashes</b> a year with 40 people injured.|$|R
5|$|On 28 April 2015, the Augsburger Allgemeine, a German {{regional}} daily newspaper, {{published an}} article stating that according to Erich Bäcker, Lützow attempted an emergency landing at Donaumünster/Erlingshofen <b>and</b> <b>crashed</b> into the Danube. Bäcker made his claim based on reports made by eye-witnesses who saw a low flying Me262 crashing into the Danube that day.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1947, a {{steam train}} {{approaching}} from West Dulwich passed a {{signal at danger}} in heavy fog <b>and</b> <b>crashed</b> into an electric train crossing the station's south junction towards Tulse Hill.

5|$|Wet {{conditions}} {{caused many}} accidents along roadways in central Virginia. A motorist on Interstate 95 in Richmond {{died when he}} hydroplaned <b>and</b> <b>crashed</b> his car. In Albemarle County, a popular forest boardwalk {{that was part of}} the Monticello property was destroyed by a falling oak tree. Also in Albemarle, two people were killed when their car drove off a road <b>and</b> <b>crashed</b> into a tree during heavy rainfall. A man in Chesterfield County died when struck by a tree. Three people died when a car in southern Fluvanna County crashed into a tree. The deaths were considered indirectly related to the storm.|$|E

Although drinking and driving was not a criminal offence, the police charged him with damaging public property and fined him £5, {{the equivalent of a}} weeks wages. It was his third car crash. His success did not abate. A Ju 88 and Do 217 were claimed off the English coast on the nights of the 26 and 31 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Korean War, Leyte was ordered to the Korean Peninsula, {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire <b>and</b> <b>crashed</b> on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds despite the efforts of wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, no. 1976 was {{retired after}} it had lost braking power <b>and</b> <b>crashed.</b> After this, only {{selected}} trams were given overhauls, the last being no. 170 in 1980. Following the delivery of the articulated SL79, the Class B and E were gradually retired, with the last tram running into 1985. Oslo Tramway Museum has kept six trams, while Oslo Sporveier kept two, converted them to maintenance vehicles and painted them yellow with zebra stripes.|$|E
