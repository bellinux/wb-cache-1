5000|$|Isaacson became {{chairman}} and CEO of CNN in July 2001, replacing Tom Johnson, {{and only two}} months later guided CNN through the events of 9/11. Shortly after his appointment at CNN, Isaacson attracted attention for seeking the views of Republican Party leaders on Capitol Hill regarding criticisms that CNN broadcast content that was unfair to Republicans or conservatives. He was quoted in Roll Call magazine as saying: [...] "I was trying {{to reach out to}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> who feel that CNN has not been as open to covering Republicans, and I wanted to hear their concerns." [...] The CEO's conduct was criticized by the left-leaning Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) organization, which said that Isaacson's [...] "pandering" [...] behavior was endowing conservative politicians with power over CNN. [...] In January 2003, he announced that he would step down as president at CNN to become president of the Aspen Institute. Jim Walton replaced Isaacson as president of CNN.|$|E

5000|$|Wehner is {{a staunch}} critic of Donald Trump; he joined many Republican figures who {{announced}} {{that they would not}} vote for Trump. In a January 2016 column in the New York Times entitled [...] "Why I Will Never Vote for Donald Trump," [...] Wehner wrote that if Trump was the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton the Democratic nominee, [...] "I would prefer to vote for a responsible third-party alternative; absent that option, I would simply not cast a ballot for president. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republicans,</b> I suspect, would do the same." [...] In another Times op-ed in July 2016, Wehner wrote that Trump [...] "embodies a Nietzschean morality rather than a Christian one," [...] writing that Trump is [...] "characterized by indifference to objective truth (there are no facts, only interpretations), the repudiation of Christian concern for the poor and the weak, and disdain for the powerless." [...] He also wrote: [...] "it {{is fair to say that}} there existed in the Republican Party repulsive elements, people who were attracted to racial and ethnic politics and moved by resentment and intolerance rather than a vision of the good. This group was larger than I ever imagined, and at important moments the Republican Party either overlooked them or played to them. Some may have been hoping to appeal to these elements while also containing and moderating them, to sand off the rough edges, to keep them within the coalition but not allow them to become dominant. But the opposite happened. The party guests took over the party." [...] A day after Trump was inaugurated as president, Wehner authored a column in the New York Times in which he expressed doubt that Trump would govern well, a prediction that he claims came true in a column he wrote a day after Trump fired of FBI Director James Comey after Comey asked for additional resources in investigating the Russian interference. In July 2017, Wehner wrote, [...] "Republican voters and politicians rallied around Mr. Trump in 2016, believing he was anti-establishment when in fact he was anti-order. He turns out to be an institutional arsonist. It is an irony of American history that the Republican Party, which has historically valued order and institutions, has become the conduit of chaos." ...|$|E

40|$|The Puławy party, {{cooperating}} with wide circles of enlightened landed gentry, made the Seym a political weapon {{of the struggle}} for {{the independence of the}} Commonwealth. By abolishing the Permanent Council (19 January 1789) and overthrowing the system of Russian protectorate they were able to gain full independence of the Commonwealth by political means. As far as the process of changes in the State's political system is concerned they emphasised the leading role of the Seym not the government in the Commonwealth thus trying to undermine the position of the king. They combined oligarchic views with radically republican reformist ideas. Republican tendencies won approval of the gentry; however, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> radically <b>republican</b> ideas were met with indifference or even disapproval of the enlightened landed gentry. The compromise concerning the reform of the Seym reached by the Puławy party and the gentry parliamentary formation {{at the beginning of the}} debates was of great importance for the future. The essence of the compromise was that the seym which was currently in session was to become the permanent governing Seym (combining legislative and executive powers and permanently in session) just as the gentry wanted and according to the future constitution it was supposed to be the ready Seym (always ready to be convened in definite circumstances and consisting of the same members elected every two years) as the Puławy party wanted. The greatest achievement of the Puławy party during the first stage of the debates of the Great seym was attracting wide circles of the gentry to the reformist proposals represented by them. At the very beginning of the Great Seym the Puławy party popularized the following concepts; the ready Seym, the Guardians (a kind of government) as an organ indispensable for the functioning of a modern State (although it was supposed to have only a supervisory role), collegiate administration governing bodies. At the same time they made it possible to introduce in the future Montesquieu's principle of the separation of powers, which was the opposite of the idea of the Permanent governing Seym. By associating the concept of changes in the State's political system with the abolition of the Permanent Council and thus with the idea of independence they made the proposed reforms very popular with the gentry. As a result they paved the way for the future constitution. They also made the local diets free from magnates' domination by depriving the landless gentry (who were the tool of the magnates) of political rights. Besides they worked out the concept of the peasants' reform and they also supported hereditory succession to the throne. At the end of 1790 they lost political initiative for the benefit of the king, who became the main author of the Constitution which showed clear monarchical tendencies. The Puławy party was not able to introduce many of their ideas into the Constitution. Nevertheless, the Puławy party together with the gentry parliamentary formation succeeded in shaping the sovereignty of the Seym and practically managed to hand over central State' s administration into the hands of the collegiate administration governing bodies, which had a great deal of autonomy. And although a number of the proposals put forward by the Puławy party were not welcomedby the king and the gentry. their ability to reach reformist compromises is an undeniable contribution to the debates of the Great Seym. The ability to hold a constructive political dialogue both with the king and the gentry parliamentary formation made it possible for the debates of the Great Seym to culminate in the 3 rd of May Constitution and further reformist acts...|$|R
