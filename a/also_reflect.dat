All of the Confederate States {{made an effort}} to supply their {{respective}} State buttons to their troops. The states that did not join the Confederacy, but had men within its ranks, such as Maryland and Missouri, also made buttons, that have turned up on surviving uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments. For example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often iridescent.|$|E
5|$|The {{eleventh}} nocturne {{was written}} in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> the composer's own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle {{camouflage}} techniques {{begin with}} paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised {{materials such as}} blankets and vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near infrared and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> infrared to help provide concealment from night vision devices.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E

5|$|Biographers {{and critics}} agree that Louis Lambert is a thinly veiled {{version of the}} author, {{evidenced}} by numerous similarities between them. As {{a student at the}} Collège de Vendôme, Balzac was friends with a boy named Louis-Lambert Tinant. Like the title character, Balzac's faith was shaken {{at the time of his}} first communion. Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like Lambert – was often punished for misbehaving in class. The precise details of the school <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were allowed to keep pigeons and tend gardens, and holidays were spent in the dormitories.|$|E
5|$|In the 3rd century, {{imperial}} mausolea {{began to}} be built as domed rotundas rather than tumulus structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. Pagan and Christian domed mausolea from this time can be differentiated in that the structures of the buildings <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> their religious functions. The pagan buildings are typically two story, dimly lit, free-standing structures with a lower crypt area for the remains and an upper area for devotional sacrifice. Christian domed mausolea contain a single well-lit space and are usually attached to a church.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by the Hermannsburg School, Jugadai's {{paintings}} reflect her Tjuukurrpa, {{the complex}} spiritual knowledge and relationships {{between her and}} her landscape. The paintings <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> fine observation of the structures of the vegetation and environment. Jugadai's works were selected for exhibition at the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards five times between 1993 and 2001, and she was a section winner in 2000. Her paintings are held in major collections including the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory.|$|E

5|$|Many Metro {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Chicago architect Harry Weese, and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture. With their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of Brutalist design. The stations <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults. Weese worked with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based lighting designer Bill Lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system. All of Metro's original Brutalist stations are found in Downtown Washington, D.C. and neighboring urban corridors of Arlington, Virginia, while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs.|$|E
5|$|The Imperfect {{portrays the}} verb as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.|$|E
5|$|The {{drama is}} based on Ovid's tale of the {{abduction}} of Proserpine by Pluto, which itself {{was based on the}} Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone. Mary Shelley's version focuses on the female characters. In a largely feminist retelling from Ceres's point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength offered by a community of women. Ceres represents life and love, and Pluto represents death and violence. The genres of the text <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women's writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{instruments}} is unclear, though {{there have been many}} suggestions. Historical accounts, of which the earliest date from 588CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the kakko, a drum that originated in South China. This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko. Certain court music styles, especially gigaku and gagaku, arrived in Japan through both Korea and China. In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko. Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku, an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the Hungarian {{language}} {{is one of the}} main sources of the research on the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms. According to a scholarly theory, the oldest layers of Hungarian vocabulary show features of the territory in which the language emerged. The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of the Hungarian language and other peoples. Loan words <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> changes in the way of life of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of Narcissus varies with species, N. poeticus being more toxic than N. pseudonarcissus, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance {{there is a}} five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of N. papyraceus than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and {{is part of the}} plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> defence against parasites. The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth. For instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.|$|E

5|$|These changes {{brought the}} {{customary}} rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. As described above, John {{had come to}} a compromise with Pope Innocent III in exchange for his political support for the King, and clause 1 of Magna Carta prominently displayed this arrangement, promising the freedoms and liberties of the church. The importance of this clause may <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband <b>also</b> <b>reflect</b> the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E
