Insider preview builds are aimed towards enthusiasts and enterprise users for the testing and evaluation of updates and new features. Users of the Windows Insider program receive occasional updates to newer preview builds of the operating system <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to evaluate preview releases after general availability (GA) in July 2015this {{is in contrast to}} previous Windows beta programs, where public preview builds were released less frequently and only during the months preceding GA. Windows Insider builds continued being released after the release to manufacturing (RTM) of Windows10.|$|E
5|$|The F/A-18 Hornets are modern {{all-weather}} strike fighter jets, {{designed to}} attack both ground and aerial targets. Australia's F/A-18s were built during the 1980s and early 1990s and {{are currently being}} upgraded to improve their capabilities and extend their service lives. ACG operates a total of 71 F/A-18A and F/A-18B Hornets. The F/A-18A is a single-seat fighter and the F/A-18B is a two-seat variant which is mainly used for pilot training. The Australian Government is planning to replace the F/A-18A and Bs with the F-35A Lightning II from 2013 onwards. The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a dedicated strike aircraft in RAAF service and are considered superior to the F-22 Raptor {{in their ability to}} acquire and track moving ground targets, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> upgraded until the F-35s are delivered.|$|E

This occurred on 15 May 2009. Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments are no longer usable.

25|$|Cryoconservation is an {{indispensable}} {{tool in the}} storage of genetic material of animal origin <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful {{for the conservation of}} livestock into the future. Cryoconservation serves as a way to preserve germplasms, which is particularly beneficial for threatened breeds. Indigenous livestock may be conserved for a variety of reasons, including the preservation of local genetics, their importance in local traditions and their value to the culture identity and heritage of the area. The loss of regional livestock diversity could increase instability, decreases future possibilities and challenge production systems. Moreover, the maintenance of indigenous breeds can aid in the preservation of traditional lifestyles and livelihoods, even providing income through cultural tourism. Indigenous breeds can contribute to local economies and production systems by utilising land that is unsuitable for crop production to produce food products, as well as providing hides, manure and draft power. Therefore, the conservation and progression of these breeds are of the utmost importance for food security and sustainability.|$|E

500|$|American {{paddlefish}} {{are native}} to the Mississippi River basin and once moved freely under the relatively natural, unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s. [...] They commonly inhabited large, free-flowing rivers, braided channels, backwaters, and oxbow lakes throughout the Mississippi River drainage basin, and adjacent Gulf drainages. [...] Their peripheral range extended into the Great Lakes, with occurrences in Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada until about 90 years ago. [...] American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. [...] Poaching {{has also been a}} contributing factor to their decline <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as long as the demand for caviar remains strong. [...] Naturally occurring American paddlefish populations have been extirpated from most of their peripheral range, as well as from New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. [...] The current range of American paddlefish has been reduced to the Mississippi and Missouri River tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin. They are currently found in twenty-two states in the U.S., and those populations are protected under state, federal and international laws.|$|E
