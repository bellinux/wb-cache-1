40|$|APA {{citation}} style {{refers to}} the rules and conventions established by the American Psychological Association for documenting sources used in a research paper. APA style requires both <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> and a reference list. For every <b>in-text</b> <b>citation</b> there should <b>be</b> a full <b>citation</b> in the reference list and vice versa. The examples of APA styles and formats listed on this page include {{many of the most}} common types of sources used in academic research. For additional examples and more detailed information about APA citation style, refer to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association and the APA Style Guide to Electronic References. Also, for automatic generation of citations in appropriate citation style, use a bibliographic citation management program such as Refworks or EndNote. You can find more information on this in our Citation Management page. Reference Citations in Text In <b>APA</b> style, <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> <b>are</b> placed within sentences and paragraphs so that it is clear what information is being quoted or paraphrased and whose information is being cited.

50|$|In the author-date method (Harvard referencing), the <b>in-text</b> <b>citation</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in}} {{parentheses}} after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports. The citation includes the author's name, year of publication, and page number(s) when a specific {{part of the}} source is referred to (Smith 2008, p. 1) or (Smith 2008:1). A full <b>citation</b> <b>is</b> given in the references section: Smith, John (2008). Name of Book. Name of Publisher.|$|R

5000|$|In the author-title or author-page method, also {{referred}} to as MLA style, the <b>in-text</b> <b>citation</b> <b>is</b> placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports, and includes the author's name (a short title only is necessary when {{there is more than one}} work by the same author) and a page number where appropriate (Smith 1) or (Smith, Playing 1). (No [...] "p." [...] or [...] "pp." [...] prefaces the page numbers and main words in titles appear in capital letters, following MLA style guidelines.)

40|$|The {{following}} information {{relates to}} the format used in IEEE Transactions, Conference Proceedings and Journals. Please refer to the IEEE website for guidance on other publication types, such as Standards and IEEE magazines. <b>In-text</b> <b>citations</b> IEEE <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> <b>are</b> either one number or series of numbers, written inside square brackets like this example [12, 13] and can appear {{in the middle of}} a sentence or at the end [14]. The number {{relates to the}} associated reference list. References The reference list is a separate section at the end of the document but before any appendices. The section heading is the word References (or Reference if only one reference used). Even if you are using section numbers for the main part of your document, you do not normally put a section number for the References section. There are several things to consider for your reference list: Cite appropriately (don’t forget anyone) Be accurate with the author’s names, dates, and title...|$|R
40|$|RefWorks is {{ideally suited}} for {{undergraduate}} students with team-based research projects {{as part of}} their course assessment. The Dorothy Hill Physical Sciences and Engineering Library at the University of Queensland taught students from three engineering courses how to use RefWorks to manage project references and to create team-based bibliographies. One team member created the account, all collected references, and one created the bibliography. <b>In-text</b> <b>citations</b> <b>were</b> done manually. Students could immediately see the relevance of RefWorks in the library class when they began finding information and creating the bibliography for their projects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to provide academic staff with insights into their own information behavior and to motivate them to refer to relevant, accurate and reliable resources in their own course materials. To achieve this we used a participative research approach. Six participants assessed course materials created by themselves or by colleagues from their own department. It was found that in the course materials for the undergraduate ICT program of a university of applied sciences, <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> <b>are</b> often missing. If references are made, they are mainly references to general information sources like handbooks and popular or semi-scholarly websites. We discussed these findings in a focus group.

40|$|<b>Citation</b> <b>is</b> a very {{important}} aspect of writing. When an author uses another author's ideas or information, credit must be given, whether the original author's words are used as a direct quote or not. The older, more traditional styles of citation relied on the author listing the full citation of each source on the page where the information was actually used, usually in a footnote. Later, the footnotes were collected {{at the end of}} the paper or chapter and called endnotes. However, both of these formats were awkward and clumsy for the writer. Therefore, both the MLA (Modern Language Association) and the APA (American Psychiatric Association) decided to create new systems that were easier to use for the writer, and yet still gave the reader as much information as they needed to know. MLA and APA styles of <b>citation</b> <b>are</b> designed around two different, yet related functions: <b>in-text</b> parenthetical <b>citation</b> and the list of sources. Both are absolutely necessary in order for either one to work. The <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> make reference to the list of sources, and the list of sources tells you the necessary information about the sources cited in the text of the essay. In this guide, we will deal with both functions, but separately. <b>IN-TEXT</b> CITATIONS <b>In-text</b> <b>citations</b> <b>are</b> used whenever a writer has used information from another source, whether that information is a direct quote or a paraphrase. The rule of thumb is that if the writer didn't know the information before beginning the research, it needs to be cited. The one exception to this rule is general knowledge. Any information found in a general encyclopedia or found in a majority of sources is not considered unique enough to need to be cited. The author CAN cite it, but they are not required to do so...|$|R

40|$|We report {{characteristics}} of <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in over five million full text articles from two large databases - the PubMed Central Open Access subset and Elsevier journals - as functions of time, textual progression, and scientific field. The {{purpose of this}} study is to understand the {{characteristics of}} <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in a detailed way prior to pursuing other studies focused on answering more substantive research questions. As such, we have analyzed <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in several ways and report many findings here. Perhaps most significantly, we find that there are large field-level differences that are reflected in position within the text, citation interval (or reference age), and citation counts of references. In general, the fields of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Life and Earth Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering have similar reference distributions, although they vary in their specifics. The two remaining fields, Mathematics and Computer Science and Social Science and Humanities, have different reference distributions from the other three fields and between themselves. We also show that in all fields the numbers of sentences, references, and in-text mentions per article have increased over time, and that there are field-level and temporal differences in the numbers of in-text mentions per reference. A final finding is that references mentioned only once tend to be much more highly cited than those mentioned multiple times. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

For an overview of related key topics on working with documentation styles, visit the videos and quizzes in this tutorial. Explore It By documenting your sources carefully—in your text and in your bibliography—you give readers of your research project a map to the sources you use. While reading your paper, readers should be able to identify specific types of information about the sources you use. When your in-text references are accurate and formatted correctly, they will point readers to the complete citation on your bibliography page. All documentation styles call on you to include citations of sources in your text that are connected to entries in the bibliography that accompanies your research project. Though the requirements and styles differ, MLA, APA, and Chicago styles all require basic citations in your text that identify the author and indicate which of your sources is being cited. And when you cite a particular passage in your draft all these documentation styles require you to note, often by giving a page number, where the material appears in the source. The citations in the text of your research paper point readers to a particular entry in your bibliography.
