5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle.

The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded <b>and</b> <b>partially</b> single-stranded.|$|E

5|$|Dunkerque and Strasbourg {{formed the}} French Navy's 1ère Division de Ligne (1st Division of the Line) {{prior to the}} Second World War.

The ship was badly damaged during the British attack at Mers-el-Kébir after the Armistice that ended the first phase of France's participation in World War II, but she was refloated <b>and</b> <b>partially</b> repaired to return to Toulon for comprehensive repairs. Dunkerque was scuttled in November 1942 to prevent her capture by the Germans, and subsequently seized <b>and</b> <b>partially</b> scrapped by the Italians and later the Germans.

The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E
