This technique along with a novel experimental design enables continuous observation of clustering behavior of inclusions {{before and after the}} calcium treatment. Results show that the increase in average inclusion size in non-calcium-treated condition was much faster compared to calcium-treated condition. Results also show that the magnitude of attractive capillary force between inclusion particles in non-treated condition was about 10 − 15 N for larger particles (10 µm) and 10 − 16 N for smaller particles (5 µm) and acting length of force was about 30 µm. In the case of calcium-treated condition, the magnitude and acting length of force was reduced to 10 − 16 N and 10 µm, respectively, for particles of all sizes. This change in attractive capillary attractive force is due to change in inclusion morphology from solid alumina disks to liquid lens particles during calcium treatment...|$|E

The results show that MgTi 2 O 4, MgTiO 3 are effective for partition of Mn atoms into oxides, while MgO, Al 2 O 3, MgAl 2 O 4 are ineffective for the formation of local Mn-depleted zones. Furthermore, the calculations show that Mn atoms exist as a simple solute by replacing Mg atoms in MgO, MgTi 2 O 4 and MgTiO 3. Except by forming complex Ti-Mn oxides, such as MnTi 2 O 4 and MnTiO 3, Mn atoms can also exist as a simple solute in Ti 2 O 3 by occupying vacancy positions in their crystals.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{annealing}} cycle on the microstructure, mechanical properties and drawability of aluminium <b>killed</b> <b>steel</b> sheets at three different heating rates and different holding times were studied using tensile test, hardness test, optical microscope and {{transmission electron microscope}} techniques. The results of sample for different times in laboratory experiments were compared with production samples. The results for these experiments showed that at lower heating rates (12 °C/h) recrystallization occurred at a lower annealing temperature. This effect is attributable to the longer time available to initiate nucleation at the lowest heating rate. However, for all three heating rates (12 °C/h, 24 °C/h and 36 °C/h), the aluminium and nitrogen combine to form atmospheres or pre-precipitation clusters at polygonized subgrains and as rolled boundaries, modiflying {{the development of the}} recrystallized structure. Different amounts of AIN were precipitated prior to recrystallization for each heating rate resulting in different final recrystallized grain sizes, mechanical properties and drawabilities. The heating rate strongly influences recrystallization with a lower heating rate reducing both the temperature of the start of recrystallization and the recrystallized grain size. It is inferred that the lower rate promotes nucleation of recrystallization over growth of recrystallized. The effect of holding time on mechanical properties was to : (i) decrease tensile strength, yield strength and hardness and (ii) increase elongation and grain size. Tensile strength and hardness results from laboratory experiments were lower than those for production samples, but the trends were similar. The curve of yield strength from the production samples was however sharper than for the laboratory samples. Holding times that produced the coarsest grain size also resulted in the lowest yield strength,tensile strength and hardness...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} dual phase steels {{comprising}} of 5 - 20 % martensite in a ferrite matrix {{have come into}} the limelight of high strength cold formable steels because of their potential for vehicle weight saving. They show the following features: no yield point; relatively low initial flow stress; high initial workhardening rate; well sustained work hardening. As a consequence of these characteristics, dual phase steels exhibit a better combination of strength and elongation than other HSLA steels. In this thesis, a broad view of the factors which influence their properties is presented. Mechanical properties and forming ability of a commercially available dual phase steel and an AL-Si <b>killed</b> <b>steel</b> processed to dual phase form are investigated to ascertain the effect of their microstructure on their properties. It is found that the yield phenomena are masked by the transformation induced stresses present during processing and so yield point could be recovered under suitable ageing treatment; that apart from giving the above properties dual phasing gives rise to very low strain-rate sensitivity and a low R value ~ 1; that the mechanical response under rolling conditions is not different from those under tension; {{that there is a}} danger of damage to tooling during forming operations of these steels if fracture should precede instability as a result of grain size dependent strength found for these steels. It is also found that very little deformation of the martensite islands took place during deformation except at high strains. The work-hardening and the strength levels can be controlled by either decreasing the grain size or increasing the martensite volume fraction, but it is found that increasing martensite has a detrimental effect on ductility and the ductility and fracture strength can be controlled better by refining the grain size. A remarkable effect found in the dual phase steel tested is that the compressive strength is higher than the tensile strength. The reason for this observation is not yet clear but it is suggested that it might be due to the introduction of emissary type dislocations into the ferrite lattice as a result of twins formed in the martensite during transformation from austenite. The twins are envisaged to be { 111 } in character...|$|R
