Most credible energy scenarios for the UK based on the earlier CO 2 emissions reduction targets of 60 % compared to 1990 levels strategically allocated all emissions savings to other sectors of the UK economy, allowing the majority of road transport to be powered by fossil fuels.

40|$|The {{importance}} of having accurate load models in power system stability studies has been well established in the literature as being essential for precise power system transient event investigations. The power industry presently uses composite load models in typical stability programs (e. g. LOADSYN and PSS/E).

40|$|Increased {{load demand}} can {{severely}} deteriorate {{the performance of}} a power system. Reactive compensation allocation is a common method to allow a power system to return to an acceptable performance level for an expected load increase. The reactive power planning problem (RPP) is used to determine the optimal placement of reactive devices for a set of objectives. The RPP is a large scale, multi-objective, highly constrained and partially discrete optimization problem that is very difficult to solve. [...] Heuristic optimization techniques have been used as a means to solve difficult optimization problems including many power system optimization problems. Heuristic techniques based on evolutionary strategies have been used to solve RPPs as they overcome many of the difficulties with classical optimization techniques. However, new multi-objective evolutionary computational techniques have shown the ability to consider an optimization problem's objectives independently for the determination of Pareto-optimal solutions. [...] A popular multi-objective evolutionary strategy called the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) is applied to a series of multi-objective RPP case studies in this research.

Two configurations of absorbers were analyzed based on flue gas flow rate at full-load condition and at time-average of an <b>assumed</b> <b>load</b> variation of a power plant operating flexibly.

The SFR assumed is the 400 MWe (1000 MWt) ABR- 1000 preconceptual design incorporating metallic fuel. Three alternative idealized schemes for controlling the reactor side of the plant {{in combination with the}} existing automatic control strategy for the S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton cycle are explored using the ANL Plant Dynamics Code together with the SAS 4 A/SASSYS- 1 Liquid Metal Reactor (LMR) Analysis Code System coupled together using the iterative coupling formulation previously developed and implemented into the Plant Dynamics Code. The first option assumes that the reactor side can be ideally controlled through movement of control rods and changing the speeds of both the primary and intermediate coolant system sodium pumps such that the intermediate sodium flow rate and inlet temperature to the sodium-to-CO{sub 2 } heat exchanger (RHX) remain unvarying while the intermediate sodium outlet temperature changes as the load demand from the electric grid changes and the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle conditions adjust according to the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle control strategy. For this option, the reactor plant follows an assumed change in load demand from 100 to 0 % nominal at 5 % reduction per minute in a suitable fashion. The second option allows the reactor core power and primary and intermediate coolant system sodium pump flow rates to change autonomously in response to the strong reactivity feedbacks of the metallic fueled core and assumed constant pump torques representing unchanging output from the pump electric motors. The plant behavior to the <b>assumed</b> <b>load</b> demand reduction is surprising close to that calculated for the first option. The only negative result observed is a slight increase in the intermediate inlet sodium temperatures by about 10 C. This temperature rise could presumably be precluded or significantly reduced through fine adjustment of the control rods and pump motors. The third option assumes that the reactor core power and primary and intermediate system flow rates are ideally reduced linearly in a programmed fashion that instantaneously matches the prescribed load demand. The calculated behavior of this idealized case reveals a number of difficulties because the control strategy for the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle overcools the reactor potentially resulting in the calculation of sodium bulk freezing and the onset of sodium boiling. The results show that autonomous SFR operation may be viable for the particular <b>assumed</b> <b>load</b> change transient and deserves further investigation for other transients and postulated accidents...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{issues related}} to the process of designing a 30 -feet container {{to be used as a}} mobile laboratory for collecting the environmental samples and identification of biological threats. Tactical and technical assumptions for the container, taking into account the requirements of the transport and movement of the army at long distances and in the difficult areas by means of transport characterized by increased traction properties, made the starting point. A possible way of relocation on the land roads using commonly available and military means of transport, possibilities of loading and unloading using the autonomic system and automatic levelling system are described. It describes the process of creating the MES model of the supporting structure and assumptions taken for that purpose.

40|$|The use of ground-coupled {{systems in}} {{commercial}} buildings offers economic {{as well as}} environmental advantages. When both heating and cooling is required, a ground-coupled system can function both as a heat source and a heat sink. At the same time, it can {{also serve as a}} short term as well as a seasonal storage. The main goal of this thesis is to show the effect of different building load patterns and different ground system designs and configurations on the overall efficiency. The results of this work can be used for technical as well as economical optimization. The methodology used was to study by simulation the influence of the heating and cooling load characteristics of the building (load pattern), the size of the ground system (depth and number of the boreholes) and the geometry of the ground system (configuration, i. e. positioning of the boreholes). To facilitate the simulations, simple models of the heat pump and cooling system heat exchanger were derived. These models, together with data for different building load profiles and ground system configurations, were used to provide inputs to the ground system design software EED. The models developed in this work together with the design software, were applied in a case study (Astronomihuset, Lund). Simulated and measured data agree reasonably well. As a result of this work, three key numbers were introduced to characterize the system of building-heat pump-ground system. Firstly, the load factor describes the relation between heating and cooling loads in the building. Secondly the specific borehole load is an indicator of the effect of the building loads on the borehole. Thirdly, the geometry factor {{is a measure of the}} potential of the ground system for heat exchange with the ambient ground and/or as a storage. Examination of simulation results with different configurations using the same specific borehole load showed that the brine temperature differences are not very large. On the other hand, changes in specific load have a large influence. Furthermore, the simulations show that a system with balanced heating and cooling and storage is more sensitive to the accuracy of the <b>assumed</b> <b>load</b> pattern than is a system for heating or cooling only.

40|$|As {{electricity}} generation based on volatile renewable resources {{is subject to}} fluctuations, data with high temporal and spatial resolution on their availability is indispensable for integrating large shares of renewable capacities into energy infrastructures. The scope of the present doctoral thesis is to enhance the existing energy modelling environment REMix in terms of (i.) extending the geographic coverage of the potential assessment tool REMix-EnDaT from a European to a global scale, (ii.) adding a new plant siting optimization module REMix-PlaSMo, capable of assessing siting effects of renewable power plants on the portfolio output and (iii.) adding a new alternating current power transmission model between 30 European countries and CSP electricity imports from power plants located in North Africa and the Middle East via high voltage direct current links into the module REMix-OptiMo. With respect to the global potential assessment tool, a thorough investigation is carried out creating an hourly global inventory of the theoretical potentials of the major renewable resources solar irradiance, wind speed and river discharge at a spatial resolution of 0. 45 °x 0. 45 °. A detailed global land use analysis determines eligible sites for the installation of renewable power plants. Detailed power plant models for PV, CSP, wind and hydro power allow {{for the assessment of}} power output, cost per kWh and respective full load hours taking into account the theoretical potentials, technological as well as economic data. The so-obtined tool REMix-EnDaT can be used as follows: First, as an assessment tool for arbitrary geographic locations, countries or world regions, deriving either site-specific or aggregated installable capacities, cost as well as full load hour potentials. Second, as a tool providing input data such as installable capacities and hourly renewable {{electricity generation}} for further assessments using the modules REMix-PlasMo and OptiMo. The plant siting tool REMix-PlaSMo yields results as to where the volatile power technologies photovoltaics and wind are to be located within a country in order to gain distinct effects on their aggregated power output. Three different modes are implemented: (a.) Optimized plant siting in order to obtain the cheapest generation cost, (b.) a minimization of the photovoltaic and wind portfolio output variance and (c.) a minimization of the residual load variance. The third fundamental addition to the REMix model is the amendment of the module REMix-OptiMo with a new power transmission model based on the DC load flow approximation. Moreover, electricity imports originating from concentrating solar power plants located in North Africa and the Middle East are now feasible. All of the new capabilities and extensions of REMix are employed in three case studies: In case study 1, using the module REMix-EnDaT, a global potential assessment is carried out for 10 OECD world regions, deriving installable capacities, cost and full load hours for PV, CSP, wind and hydro power. According to the latter, photovoltaics will represent the cheapest technology in 2050, an average of 1634 full load hours could lead to an electricity generation potential of some 5500 PWh. Although CSP also taps solar irradiance, restrictions in terms of suitable sites for erecting power plants are more severe. For that reason, the maximum potential amounts to some 1500 PWh. However, thermal energy storage can be used, which, according to this assessment, could lead to 5400 hours of full load operation. Onshore wind power could tap a potential of 717 PWh by 2050 with an average of 2200 full load hours while offshore, wind power plants could achieve a total power generation of 224 PWh with an average of 3000 full load hours. The electricity generation potential of hydro power exceeds 3 PWh, 4600 full load hours of operation are reached on average. In case study 2, using the module REMix-PlaSMo, an assessment for Morocco is carried out as to determine limits of volatile power generation in portfolios approaching full supply based on renewable power. The volatile generation technologies are strategically sited at specific locations to take advantage of available resources conditions. It could be shown that the cost optimal share of volatile power generation without considering storage or transmission grid extensions is one third. Moreover, the average power generation cost using a portfolio consisting of PV, CSP, wind and hydro power can be stabilized at about 10 €ct/kWh by the year 2050. In case study 3, using the module REMix-OptiMo, a validation of a TRANS-CSP scenario based upon high shares of renewable power generation is carried out. The optimization is conducted on an hourly basis using a least cost approach, thereby investigating if and how demand is met during each hour of the investigated year. It could be shown, that the <b>assumed</b> <b>load</b> can safely be met in all countries for each hour using the scenario's power plant portfolio. Furthermore, it was proven that dispatchable renewable power generation, in particular CSP imports to Europe, have a system stabilizing effect.

The buckling predictions demonstrate the effect of introducing symmetrical combinations of elastic restraints against rotation on the edges of isolated skew plates. Further, they are presented in a manner that allows the benefits of continuity over skew bays to be evaluated. The curves also illustrate the complex character of the buckling mode changes that take place with a change in aspect ratio in skew plate structures. In addition, these mode changes lead to well defined local optima, which the designer can exploit if he has control over the aspect ratio of a skew plate...|$|R
40|$|A {{probabilistic}} model for tensile fracture of straight-fiber carbon-carbon composites is proposed. The anajysis {{derives from the}} extensive theoretical work available for graphite/epoxy composites 4 eg, Batdorf, Mandere et al, Rosen, and Phoenix) '; but attempts {{to account for the}} weak microcracked interfaces in carbon-carbons by <b>assuming</b> <b>load</b> transfer between fiber and matrix isO primarily frictional. The model extends the work of Chatterjee, et al, by including a predictive analysis for the frictional shear stress, incorporating a Poisson's effectQFom Oent) hand a thermal-expansion effect. Inputs to the model include fiber, matrix, and interface properties (including friction coefficient), fiber strength distribution or the length dependence of dry-yarn strength, and transverse stresses acting on the yarn bundle. Illustrative results show that composite strength may be expected to increase with temperature even if the fiber strength does not. Also, the results show that room-temperature strength of a carbon-carbon yarn tends to be significantly lower than the strength of a similar graphite-epoxy yarn, even if no degradation of fiber properties has occurred during the fabrication of the carbon-carbon composite...|$|R
