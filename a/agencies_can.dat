5|$|The City of Omak's mayor–council {{government}} comprises a mayorwho {{also represents}} north-central Washington's separate economic development districtand a seven-member council. These positions, stipulated by the Omak City Code, {{are subject to}} at-large elections every two years, rather than by geographic subdivisions. Like most portions of the United States, government and laws are run {{by a series of}} ballot initiatives whereby citizens can pass or reject laws, referenda whereby citizens can approve or reject legislation already passed, and propositions where specific government <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people. Federally, Omak is part of Washington's 4th congressional district, represented by Republican Dan Newhouse, who was sworn in on January 3, 2015. The current mayor, Cindy Gagne, was first elected in 2000 as a councilwomen, and was appointed in May 2009.|$|E

We {{assume that the}} enforcement agency's objectives do not perfectly correspond with {{the objectives of the}} legislative body who determines the standards for compliance and the fines for non-compliance, and that the enforcement <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> determine its inspection policy independently. However, contrary to Franckx (2002), we assume that the <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> commit to inspection probabilities.

Exemption 3, 5 U.S.C. Section 552(b)(3)(B) or (b)(3) pertains to information that is prohibited from disclosure by another federal law.|$|E
25|$|Effectiveness of {{authority}} {{refers to the}} ease in which {{the intentions of the}} political executive can be transformed into legislative or regulatory action. This is important because the governments and <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> use implied threats of price controls, additional regulation or taxation to induce certain behaviours from companies. Such threats will only have credibility if companies think that these threats will be carried out if they do not comply.|$|E
25|$|These <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> be transit police, school {{district}} police, campus police, airport police, railroad police, park police or police departments responsible for protecting government property, {{such as the}} former Los Angeles General Services Police. Some agencies, such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department, have multi-state powers. There are also some private (non-governmental) agencies, such as the Co-op City Department of Public Safety.|$|E

25|$|Although the pataca is {{the legal}} tender of Macau, the Hong Kong dollar is almost universally {{acceptable}} in the Region, and in some cases, is preferred to the Pataca. Circulation of the pataca is mandated by a decree (Decreto-Lei n.º 16/95/M) prohibiting refusal by merchants, but some casinos flout this rule and refuse bets in patacas. The Hong Kong dollar and Chinese yuan are generally accepted throughout Macau from casinos to restaurants. Payments to government <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> also be made in both Hong Kong dollars and patacas.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has {{a number}} of habitat {{conservation}} programs in effect which includes lands traditionally inhabited by the Mission blue butterfly. A recovery plan, drawn up by the USFWS in 1984, outlined the need to protect Mission blue habitat and to repair habitat damaged by urbanization, off-highway vehicle traffic, and invasion by exotic, non-native plants. An example of the type of work being done by governmental and citizen <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> be found in the Marin Headlands at Golden Gate National Recreation Area. In addition, regular wildfires have opened new habitat conservation opportunities, as well as damaging existing ones.|$|E

50|$|A student-run {{advertising}} agency {{acts like a}} real {{advertising agency}}, but is operated by students. The <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> {{be included in the}} academic curriculum, allowing students to work in the agency for academic credit. Or, the <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> simply be housed within the academic unit, allowing students to work in the agency for volunteer experience. In other cases, the <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> operate as a student club within the broader organizational structure of the university. The student-run agency provides advertising and similar communications services to various organizations such as college departments, small businesses, and community-based non-profit organizations. Some agencies compete with professionals and charge for services. Other agencies do all their work without charge. Other agencies have a philanthropic focus whereby communications work is conducted for free for nonprofits, while for-profit entities are asked to make a charitable donation to the agency to support its learner-centered focus.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} to {{what extent}} reputational concerns give rating agencies incen-tives to reveal information and how this is affected by competition in the ratings industry. In a simple model in which a rating <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> make mistakes and has public and private information about a project, ratings might not reflect private information and can even contradict public information {{in an attempt to}} minimize reputational costs. A monopo-listic rating <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> act conservatively by issuing more bad ratings than justified by both types of information, whereas in a competitive setting, a rating <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> become bold by issuing more good ratings than justified by both types of information. Ratings can be more accurate in a monopoly than with competition depending on the strength of public information, but the industry structure ceases to affect accuracy when the quality of private information is high or when reputational concerns are weak...|$|R
25|$|Water {{availability}} in Yemen has decreased. Water scarcity with {{an intrinsic}} geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen. In a vicious circulation of dehydration between climate change, the water recharge into aquifers is decreasing and {{salt water intrusion}} is increasing. After the civil war began in 2015, the water buckets were destroyed significantly and price of water highly increased. Storing water has demolished by war and supply chains have been occupied by military personnel, which makes the delivery of water far more difficult. In 2015, over 15 million people need healthcare and over 20 million need clean water and sanitation—an increase of 52 percent since the intervention but, the government <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> not afford to deliver clean water to displaced Yemeni citizens.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, FPS was {{transferred}} to the Department of Homeland Security and retained its responsibilities for protecting the buildings, grounds, and property owned, occupied, or secured by the federal government under GSA's jurisdiction. In addition to GSA facilities, the Act also provides FPS with the authority to protect properties held by DHS components that were not under GSA jurisdiction. FPS was moved from GSA, Public Building Services, to DHS, effective March 1, 2003. Within DHS, FPS became a part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). On October 28, 2009, President Barack Obama signed legislation which transferred FPS from ICE to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Today, FPS is responsible for policing, securing, and ensuring a safe environment in which federal <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> conduct business by reducing threats posed against approximately 9,000 Federal government facilities throughout the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Local <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> also finance {{stormwater}} {{programs and}} services through voter approved tax increases or bond measures, including using proceeds from unrestricted general tax increases (e.g., general sales taxes increases) that have been approved by voters in many cities and counties {{over the past few}} years. [...] Thus, many additional and alternative revenue sources are available to finance clean water governmental mandates besides property-related fees and charges under Proposition 218.|$|E
2500|$|If a local {{government}} tax is legally dedicated {{for one or}} more specific purposes it is a special tax. [...] Proposition 218 also requires certain taxes relating to real property be levied as special taxes.

2500|$|The Employment Agencies Act 1973 {{regulates the}} conduct of the 17,000 odd {{agencies}} operating in the UK. It prohibits most agencies charging upfront fees, makes it an offence to put out misleading advertising for jobs which do not exist, sets standards for assessing an employee's experience, and more. It was introduced after similar (though stronger) legislation was passed in France and Germany regulating agencies (for Germany, see [...] ). The 1973 Act was amended by the Conservative government through the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, ostensibly to increase efficiency. It abolished the system of agency licensing, so that <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> operate freely, unless inspectors find violations and close them down.|$|E

2500|$|Legislation will be {{required}} to set in place access to the VII data and communications between applicable agencies. [...] In the USA, for example, an Interstate is a Federal roadway that is often maintained by the State, but the local county or municipal authorities may be involved too. [...] The legislation would need to set the levels of authority of each agency. [...] In Pennsylvania, for example, municipalities tend to have greater authority than counties and sometimes even the State whereas neighboring Maryland has more authority at the county level than at municipal level; and State roads are almost exclusively controlled by the State. [...] It would also have to be determined which other <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> use the data (i.e. law enforcement, Census, etc.) and to what degree it is permissible to use the information. Law enforcement would be needed to minimise data misuse. [...] The various levels of authority could also increase incompatibility.|$|E

60|$|With {{but little}} break we come here upon a {{significant}} analogy, parallel to an analogy already described. As was pointed out, an inorganic {{body that is}} modifiable by its medium, acquires, after a time, an outer coat which has already undergone such change as surrounding <b>agencies</b> <b>can</b> effect; has a contained mass which is as yet unchanged, because unreached; and has a surface between the two where change is going on--a region of activity. And we saw that alike in the vegetal cell and the animal cell there exist analogous distributions: of course with the difference that the innermost part is not inert. Now we have to note that in those aggregates of cells constituting the Metaphyta and Metazoa, analogous distributions also exist. In plants they are of course not to be looked for in leaves and other deciduous portions, but only in portions of long duration--stems and branches. Naturally, too, we need not expect them in plants having modes of growth which early produce an outer practically dead part, that effectually shields the inner actively living part of the stem from {{the influence of the}} medium--long-lived acrogens such as tree-ferns and long-lived endogens such as palms. But in the highest plants, exogens, which have the actively living part of their stems within reach of environing agencies, we find this part,--the cambium layer,--is one from which there is a growth inwards forming wood, and a growth outwards forming bark: there is an increasingly thick covering (where it does not scale off) of tissue changed by the medium, and inside this a film of highest vitality. In so far as concerns the present argument, it is the same with the Metazoa, or at least all of them which have developed organizations. The outer skin grows up from a limiting plane, or layer, a little distance below the surface--a place of predominant vital activity. Here perpetually arise new cells, which, as they develop, are thrust outwards and form the epidermis: flattening and drying up as they approach the surface, whence, having for a time served to shield the parts below, they finally scale off and leave younger ones to take their places. This still undifferentiated tissue forming the base of the epidermis, and existing also as a source of renewal in internal organs, is the essentially living substance; and facts above given imply that it was the action of the medium on this essentially living substance, which, during early stages in the organization of the Metazoa, initiated that protective envelope which presently became an inherited structure--a structure which, though now mainly inherited, still continues to be modifiable by its initiator.|$|E
