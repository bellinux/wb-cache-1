40|$|Background. On 21 May 2005, the Norwegian health {{authorities}} were alerted by officials {{from a local}} hospital that several recent patients had received the diagnosis of legionnaires disease; all patients resided in 2 neighboring municipalities. We investigated the outbreak to identify the source and to implement control measures. Methods. We interviewed all surviving case patients and investigated and harvested samples from 23 businesses with cooling towers and other potential infection sources. The locations of the businesses and the patients ’ residences and movements were mapped. We calculated attack rates and risk ratios among people living within various radii of each potential source. Isolates of Legionella pneumophila were compared using molecular methods. Results. Among 56 case patients, 10 died. The case patients became ill 12 – 25 May, resided up to 20 km apart, and had not visited places in common. Those living up to 1 km from a particular <b>air</b> <b>scrubber</b> had the highest risk ratio, and only for this source did the risk ratio decrease as the radius widened. Genetically identical L. pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates were recovered from patients and the <b>air</b> <b>scrubber.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>scrubber</b> is an industrial pollution-control device that cleans air for dust particles by spraying with water.

40|$|Intensification of {{livestock}} production {{in combination with}} a decline in arable land {{has resulted in a}} discrepancy between excess load of nutrients from livestock production and the possibility to apply these nutrients in an environmental way on agricultural land. Consequently, the mineral input and output in livestock intensive regions is not balanced. The crop production systems rely on synthetic fertilizers for fertilization, whereas livestock production systems face problems in manure disposal. This dissertation aimed towards efficient use of resources by re-connecting crop and livestock production through animal manure processing. The processing results in animal manure derivatives such as liquid fraction (LF) of digestate, mineral concentrate and <b>air</b> <b>scrubber</b> water, that might have potential to be used as alternatives for synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers. The dissertation investigated N fertilizer performance of these materials with regard to crop yield and soil properties on laboratory, greenhouse and field scale. Results showed that LF of digestate, <b>air</b> <b>scrubber</b> water and mineral concentrate can be used as synthetic N fertilizer substitutes without adverse effects on crop yield. With regard to environmental aspects, it seems that these materials should not additionally increase the risk of nitrate leaching as compared to conventional fertilization practices.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>scrubbers</b> are {{commonly}} used for removal of ammonia and odor from exhaust air of animal houses in the Netherlands. In addition, <b>air</b> <b>scrubbers</b> remove {{a part of the}} particulate matter. In this article, the results of an on-farm monitoring are presented in which PM 10 removal was monitored at 24 scrubbers. It was found that <b>scrubbers</b> with long <b>air</b> contact times (empty bed residence time (EBRT) > 3 s) achieved relatively high PM 10 removal efficiencies (on average 79 %). However, at short air contact times (EBRT < 3 s), efficiencies were lower (on average 49 %). As dust particles travel through the humid scrubber environment, they grow in size and mass, which increases their chance of being intercepted and removed from the air. The results suggest that the maximum particle size is reached within this period of 3 s, but a controlled experimental setup is required to prove this assumption. Possible formation of salt aerosols inside the scrubbers may have affected measured removal efficiencies, especially for acid scrubbers, that are operated at EBRT < 3 s. As multistage scrubbers have a higher average air residence time, they show a higher PM 10 removal efficiency than acid scrubbers and bioscrubbers. In addition, it is suggested that the gravimetric PM 10 determination method might need to be improved to eliminate the effect of differences in moisture levels between scrubber inlet and outlet air on particle cutoff...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe use of air {{scrubbers}} {{to reduce}} ammonia (NH 3) emissions from buildings on pig farms {{is one of}} the most promising techniques in the Göteborg protocol and other European regulations including the Industrial Emission Directive. In France, some air scrubbers are currently used on pig farms, mainly to reduce odours from livestock buildings. However, recent research revealed the production of N 2 O resulting from the treatment of air from pig buildings. In this context, a two-month study was conducted on a pig farm with 750 places for fattening pigs to check the abatement of NH 3 emissions and to assess the possible production of N 2 O during treatment of exhausted air from buildings housing fattening pigs by a <b>air</b> <b>scrubber.</b> Concentrations of NH 3 and N 2 O in the inlet and outlet air of the scrubber were continuously monitored using an Innova 1412 infrared analyzer.
