5|$|As in the {{previous}} two drives, Virginia Tech relied upon its rushing offense: The first five plays of the drive were runs by David Wilson, who gained 26 yards. The Hokies then switched gears, surprising Tennessee, whose defense <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> 30-yard pass completion from Taylor to Boykin. Tech reverted to running plays, but Tennessee again <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> long gain, as Roberts advanced 21 yards on a run, then Wilson ran three yards into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 34-14 lead with 5:14 remaining in the game.|$|E
