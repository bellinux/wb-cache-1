50|$|The life {{histories}} of most conger eels are poorly known. Based on collections of their small leptocephalus larvae, the <b>American</b> <b>conger</b> eel {{has been found}} to spawn in the southwestern Sargasso Sea, close to the spawning areas of the Atlantic freshwater eels.|$|E
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>conger</b> (Conger oceanicus) is {{a species}} of eel in the Congridae family. Widespread in the Western Atlantic from the Cape Cod in Massachusetts to northeastern Florida in United States and {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico. Also reported from near the mid-Atlantic island of St. Helena and the coasts of Canada. It is a dark gray-green, with tiny rusty-red speckles. It is about 6.5 ft long and weighs about 89 lb. The eel can be gray, brown, black, steel-blue, reddish-brown, or olive-green.|$|E
5000|$|Conger ( [...] ) is a genus {{of marine}} congrid eels. [...] It {{includes}} {{some of the}} largest types of eels, ranging up to 3 m (10 ft) in length, {{in the case of the}} European conger. Large congers have often been observed by divers during the day in parts of the Mediterranean Sea, and both European and <b>American</b> <b>congers</b> are sometimes caught by fishermen along the European and North American coasts.|$|R
50|$|The next day, however, a conciliatory {{message was}} {{received}} from the Chinese, which raised hopesâ€”dashed again on July 16 when the most capable British officer was killed and journalist George Ernest Morrison was wounded. However, <b>American</b> Minister <b>Conger</b> carried on a communication with the Chinese government and on July 17 firing died down {{on both sides and}} an armistice began. It was just in time; nearly half of the legation guards were dead or wounded. The motivation on the Chinese side for the armistice was probably the knowledge that an allied force of 20,000 men had landed in China and retribution for the Boxers and the siege was at hand.|$|R
50|$|Academia Cotopaxi (Academia Cotopaxi American International School) is a co-educational {{school in}} Quito, Ecuador, created in 1959 {{by a group}} of <b>American</b> parents. Alice <b>Conger</b> was the first {{director}} of the school. This school maintains a majority of international students, who are the children of the diplomatic missions to Ecuador and children of employees of major international corporations, as well as local students. The school offers K-12 education and includes the International Baccalaureate program which allows students to graduate with an IB diploma or certificate.|$|R
5000|$|The Germans and the Americans {{occupied}} {{perhaps the}} most crucial of all defensive positions: the Tartar Wall. Holding {{the top of the}} 45 ft tall and 40 ft wide Wall was vital. If it fell to the Chinese, they would have an unobstructed field of fire into the Legation Quarter. The German barricades faced east on top of the wall and 400 yd west were the west-facing American positions. The Chinese advanced toward both positions by building barricades ever-closer. It was a claustrophobic existence for the soldiers on the wall. [...] "The men all feel they are in a trap," [...] said the American commander, Capt. John T. Myers, [...] "and simply await the hour of execution." [...] Added to the daily advances of the Chinese were the nightly serenades of rifle and artillery fire and firecrackers designed to keep the foreigners awake and alert. [...] "From June 20 to July 17 we had nightly attacks," [...] said a missionary woman. <b>American</b> Minister <b>Conger</b> said [...] "that some of them, for furious firing, exceeded anything he experienced in the American Civil War." [...] The hard-pressed Legation guards saw their numbers diminish daily with casualties.|$|R
