5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the Landlord {{is brought to}} the triad boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> about the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of}} the money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E
25|$|The Romans usually treated their {{traditional}} narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates {{to his or}} her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism is an important theme. When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with ritual, augury, and institutions than with theology or cosmogony.|$|E

25|$|Support for reunification {{among the}} younger generations in South Korea {{has been seen}} by some as faltering, with the percent of people in {{government}} polls who regarded reunification as essential dropping from more than eighty percent in the 1990s to fifty-six percent. Among Koreans in their twenties, forty-one percent {{agreed with the statement}} (and only about twenty percent of teenagers). Many suspect that younger generations, not sharing previous generations' perception of Korea's unnatural division, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with South Korea's economic development and hesitant to singlehandedly take on North Korean integration and the associated costs (which some estimates put as high as $1 trillion).|$|E
25|$|Barry causes Colin {{problems}} by interfering with his work, deliberately making him jealous, {{and engaging in}} criminal antics with villainous Nick Cotton (John Altman) leaving Colin {{to pay for the}} damages. Further problems arise when Colin is called for jury service in 1987. The plaintiff {{is a member of the}} gangster organisation known as The Firm, and when Colin refuses to give a verdict of not guilty at the trial, Colin's flat is vandalised by Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt). Colin calls the police, but they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> about Colin's relationship with Barry than catching the vandals. They discover that Barry was under the age of legal sexual consent for gay men when he and Colin began living together, and the police decide to inform Barry's parents (in 1987 the legal age of sexual consent for gay men was 21). Barry is petrified of his homophobic father and decides to end his relationship with Colin.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that {{men are more likely}} to engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are {{more likely to engage in}} extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E

25|$|However, some {{obstacles}} remain. ASEAN currently trades {{more with}} other countries (80%) than among its member countries (20%). Therefore, ASEAN economies <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, ASEAN member countries have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration however implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency. On the other hand, there are also constraints on the adoption of one currency, such as the following: diversity {{in the level of}} economic development across countries, weaknesses in the financial sectors of many countries, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required for forming and managing a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the more}} {{conservative}} assemblies discourage political involvement, sometimes {{to the extent of}} judging anyone in fellowship who opts to exercise their voting rights in democratic, free elections. This teaching is {{based on the premise that}} the Bible teaches that Christians are citizens of heaven, only sojourners here on earth, and therefore ought not to become involved in activities which could be deemed as being too worldly. Some have claimed that the movement, with its upper-class roots, lacks compassion for the plight of the underprivileged, alleging, example, that it was left to non-Brethren like William Wilberforce, Lord Shaftesbury, and other politically active Christians to work toward the abolition of slavery and toward improving the welfare of factory children in the 19th century. Many Brethren, however, see this as unfair criticism and point to George Müller's ministry caring for homeless orphans and also to the sacrifices of its missionaries such as Anthony Norris Groves. It is more reasonable, they claim, to state that the Brethren <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with people's spiritual needs than with their physical condition. However, where physical help is given, it tends to be given directly and not through secular organisations.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{privacy is}} {{becoming}} an issue of increasing managerial importance as consumers become concerned about marketers’ intrusions on their privacy and insist on {{the protection of the}} confidentiality of their personal information. This study identified the different sociodemographic variables via a national telephonic survey of a sample of 800 South African consumers and determined their level of concern towards privacy protection, misuse of information, solicitation and government protection in privacy information matters. In the privacy protection dimension, it was found that older consumers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> than younger consumers; English- and Afrikaans-speaking consumers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> than consumers from other language groups; middle and high income groups <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> than lower income consumers; and females <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> than males. In the information misuse dimension, it was found that older consumers, English-speaking consumers and high income groups <b>were</b> <b>more</b> concerned; middle and high level education groups <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned,</b> as <b>were</b> employed consumers. In the solicitation dimension, it was found that older consumers, English-speaking consumers and high income groups displayed higher levels of concern. Low and middle level education groups were less concerned. In the government protection dimension, the only group that showed higher levels of concern was females in comparison with males. Organisations should not be reactive in their management of privacy issues and wait for an external threat before they implement cohesive policies. Organisations that put off complying with regulations are likely to have more regulatory mechanisms imposed on them, and such delays may not be conducive to a trusting relationship with consumers...|$|R
