Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E

Bond attacks the hotel where Greene and Medrano are finalising their plans and leaves Greene stranded in the desert with only <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> of engine oil to drink. Bond then finds Vesper Lynd's former lover and member of Quantum, Yusef Kabira.|$|E

5|$|Crease {{was born}} at Ince Castle, in Cornwall, {{the son of a}} Royal Navy captain. He earned his BA from Clare College, Cambridge and then studied law at the Middle Temple.

After only a short turn as a barrister on his return to England, he took a job in Cornwall managing <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> mine owned by Great Wheal Vor United Mines, which ended with his employer suing him.|$|E
5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes {{to solve the}} problem of how to take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> container of ice embedded in the top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, taking advantage of the growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E

In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

5|$|In January 1855, Brontë {{discovered}} she was pregnant. It {{was accompanied by}} severe illness and she died on 31 March 1855, officially from tuberculosis. Mr. Nicholls remained with Brontë's father for a further six years before returning to Banagher in 1861, taking with him his wife's portrait, her wedding dress (of which a copy has been made), some of Charlotte's letters and other mementoes. Forty years later, when the critic Clement Shorter prepared to write Charlotte Brontë and Her Circle, he found at Banagher among other relics, two diaries of Emily and Anne, in <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> box, and some of Charlotte's minute childhood writings wrapped in newspaper {{at the bottom of}} a drawer.|$|E
5|$|The Erie Railroad was {{constructed}} through Sloatsburg from 1836 to 1841, {{helping with the}} prosperity of the village, along with its population. The station was also near the Sterlington one, but it never served of great importance. The Sloatsburg station building was built in 1868 as a two-story brick facade with <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> roof. The style of the building, according to the railroad's 1920 engineering report, is a Type 6A style, with dimensions of 17' x 29.5' x 19'. The station was equipped to host {{as a base for}} XG Radio from the Suffern Tower (SF) in Suffern. The Sloatsburg station served well for the nearby Greenwood Lake, with a stagecoach leaving the station three times day. The stagecoach was mainly inhabited by fishermen on their way to Greenwood Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, {{is also a}} kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, all {{to the accompaniment of}} a slit drum or <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The Wiz is a 1978 American musical {{adventure}} film {{produced by}} Universal Pictures and Motown Productions, and released by Universal Pictures on October 24, 1978. An urban reimagining of L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz featuring an entirely African-American cast, The Wiz was loosely {{adapted from the}} 1974 Broadway musical of the same name. The film follows the adventures of Dorothy, a shy twenty-four-year-old Harlem, New York City, schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy Land of Oz, which resembles an alternative fantasy version of New York City. Befriended by a Scarecrow, <b>a</b> <b>Tin</b> Man, and a Cowardly Lion, she travels through the city to seek an audience with the mysterious Wiz, who they say {{is the only one}} powerful enough to send her home.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} and complex arrangements required {{to support the}} infantry attack from {{the west and the}} mounted attack from the east were completed by 30 October, when these attacking forces moved to positions within a day's march of their deployment. Three divisions of XX Corps were concentrated in position: the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Goz el Geleib, the 60th (London) Division at Esani and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division at Khasif. In preparation for their final approach march, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen's Westminster Rifles (179th Brigade, 60th Division) were supplied with tea and rum for the following day. In their haversack rations were five onions, <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> of bully beef, a slice of cooked bacon, biscuits and dates.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (<b>a</b> <b>tin</b> alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.|$|E

5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian {{father and}} an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, {{where he worked}} on survey teams in the {{interior}} before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in New South Wales. In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by Henryk Bull in the whaler Antarctic, which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the Ross Sea. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and {{claimed to be the}} first men to set foot on the Antarctic continent—although the American sealer John Davis believed he had landed on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1821. They also visited Possession Island in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in <b>a</b> <b>tin</b> box as proof of their journey. Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge penguin rookery providing a ready supply of fresh food and blubber, could serve as a base at which a future expedition could overwinter and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior.|$|E
