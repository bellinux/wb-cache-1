5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to know one another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|He {{was shot}} down most {{probably}} by Italian Spanish Civil War ace Tenente Lieutenant) Franco Lucchini of 90a Squadriglia, 10° Gruppo ("group"), 4° Stormo ("wing"). He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an embarrassment and regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> not {{to get lost in}} the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E

5|$|In 1903 Elmer Riggs {{published}} {{a study that}} described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the Grand River Valley near Fruita, Colorado, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age {{to those of the}} Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described Brontosaurus. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus ajax, Riggs realized that the holotype of A.ajax was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since Apatosaurus was the earlier name, Brontosaurus should be considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus. Because of this, Riggs recombined Brontosaurus excelsus as Apatosaurus excelsus. Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to Apatosaurus, Riggs <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to A.excelsus.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{was brought}} to Göttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her {{expertise}} in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether's first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} amino acids were {{discovered}} in the early 19th century. In 1806, French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine, the first amino acid to be discovered. Cystine was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884. Glycine and leucine {{were discovered in}} 1820. The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. They said that it came from behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese {{field study}} found that S.spraguei was the {{dominant}} fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean Pine, {{both in terms of}} ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S.spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S.spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.|$|E

5|$|After {{discussing}} Supreme Court precedent, Heins {{recounts the}} jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the bias of individual jurors rather than {{an interpretation of the}} law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they felt that it was the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E
5|$|Hoagland and Davis (1987) {{subsequently}} {{completed a}} thorough analysis, based on electrophoresis, shell morphology, and internal anatomy, of the succineids at Chittenango Falls. They divided Succinea into two genera, keeping the Old World Succinea in the genus and elevating the New World Succinea, of the Section Novisuccinea including ovalis and chittenangoensis, to the genus level. They <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> that the Old World Succinea putris {{is probably a}} species complex and that the gray morph, although closely related to Succinea putris sensu lato, is a distinct species, which they designated Succinea sp. B. Based on these factors, the species designation Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is considered valid. Both species have been observed with red and gray morphs, bringing into question whether the earlier separation truly represented taxonomic distinctiveness. Currently, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, Succinea sp. B, and 3–4 Oxyloma spp. {{are considered to be}} the only succineid species present at Chittenango Falls. In 2003, the U.S. Geological Survey (T. King, unpublished data) amplified and sequenced the cytochrome oxidase I region of mitochondrial DNA and the ITS-1 region of nuclear DNA in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and Succinea sp. B. The results (sequence divergence of 10–15 percent) suggest large differences between the two species. No hybridization was observed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963, several {{proposals}} from local governments have requested the construction of a parallel span or additional pontoons to increase capacity and add infrastructure for rapid transit and bicyclists. Daily traffic crossing the bridge rose from 17,400 cars in 1964 to nearly 100,000 in 1987, making the bridge the worst traffic bottleneck in the state of Washington. By the late 1990s, the bridge was carrying twice as much traffic as it was designed to handle, and calls from Eastside cities and companies for a replacement bridge intensified. WSDOT engineers <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> that sections of the bridge would fail during a large earthquake or a major windstorm, and that the bridge was nearing the end of its life expectancy, necessitating a total replacement. The bridge underwent a major rehabilitation in 1999, including a seismic retrofit and increased resistance to stronger sustained winds, to extend the life expectancy to 20 to 25 years.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Stadium in Athens was {{selected}} as the venue for the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final at the April 2005 meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Tallinn, Estonia. The meeting <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> the venues for the 2006 final and the 2006 and 2007 UEFA Cup finals. Shortly before the final, the UEFA Champions League trophy was returned to UEFA by Ludovic Giuly, representing the 2006 winners, Barcelona. UEFA president Michel Platini then presented the trophy to the Mayor of Athens, Nikitas Kaklamanis, so that it might be put on display in and around the city. The stadium had hosted the showpiece event before. The most recent was the 1994 final. Coincidentally Milan were the winners, beating Barcelona 4–0. The other final held at the ground was in 1983, when Hamburg beat Juventus 1–0. The ground had also played host to the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final in 1987, when Ajax beat Lokomotiv Leipzig 1–0.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals paired United with Porto, against {{whom they had}} played in the first {{knockout}} round of the 2003–04 competition. The draw <b>also</b> <b>determined</b> the semi-final pairings, with United or Porto drawn to play against Arsenal or Villarreal. The first leg of the quarter-final was played at Old Trafford, giving Porto the chance to put the pressure on Manchester United with an away goal. That away goal came in the fourth minute of the game, but Wayne Rooney equalised tenminutes later and Carlos Tevez gave United {{the lead in the}} 85thminute. However, with only oneminute left in the game, United suffered a defensive lapse, allowing Mariano González to score Porto's second away goal. Those away goals meant that United travelled to the Estádio do Dragão in Porto needing a win or a score-draw of 2–2 or higher to remain in the competition. A 40-yard goal from Ronaldo in the sixthminute put United into the lead, and although both sides pressed for another goal, it proved to be {{the only one of the}} game, making Manchester United the first English side to win in Porto.|$|E
