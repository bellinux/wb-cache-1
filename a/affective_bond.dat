40|$|The client-therapist {{relationship}} {{is recognized as}} an important factor contributing to outcomes of child and youth care. Particularly in secure residential youth care, in which adolescents with mainly externalizing behaviour problems are often placed coercively, the client-staff relationship seems to be important for the achievement of positive outcomes. The present study aims to assess the client-staff relationship {{for a group of}} 135 adolescents in secure residential care and factors associated with a positive relationship. The results show that adolescents, group care workers and teachers experience a limited <b>affective</b> <b>bond</b> in their relationship 2 months after the adolescents were admitted to the secure care centre. Adolescents do tend to use care workers and teachers as a secure attachment figure, which suggests that an <b>affective</b> <b>bond</b> is no precondition for the adolescents to experience staff as a secure base. Main predictors of a good relationship are the positive treatment skills of both group care workers and teachers. These findings point to the need for training of care workers and teachers so that they are better prepared for working with these adolescents. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper will be reading affect. By working through {{examples}} of ethnographic research with domestic and care workers and their employers in Germany from a discursive-deconstructive perspective, I will show how a deconstructive reading of affect can {{add to our understanding}} of (a) 'the speaking subject' embedded within a discursive framework, and, (b) "intensity" in the encounters between domestic and care workers and their employers. These encounters occur in a "heterotopian space", a heterogeneous space ruled by the effects of <b>affective</b> <b>bonds.</b> In this space affect denotes a more or less organised experience, an experience which probably has empowering and disempowering consequences, registered at the level of encounter, and not necessarily to be understood in linguistic terms, but which is analysable as effect (MASSUMI, 1996, p. 237). It is by thinking through the words of those who inhabit this gendered and ethnicised heterotopia that the paper looks at the following questions: How can this encounter be read on the basis of <b>affective</b> <b>bonds?</b> How can we grasp affect as a moment of intensity in these relationships? What can reading FOUCAULT, DERRIDA and SPIVAK and thinking through them add to the theorisation of affect? URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 070211...|$|R

The results indicated some common beliefs: "Crying infants should be immediately calmed by adults and should include receptive behaviors such as taking the child in their arms and saying sympathetic words.

I look at how an <b>affective</b> <b>bond</b> with Wonder Woman informs and guides an affective attachment to one's local and national communities, actualizing the utopian promise of self, commodity icon, and America. These utopian iterations are primarily defined by a celebration of pluralism, and thus Wonder Woman is used to validate the inherent pluralism of the self in relation to society, an empowering strategy for all consumer-citizens...|$|E

Based on semi-structured interview data, this article explores Confucianism’s impact on Chinese kin caregivers’ understandings of children’s needs and their childrearing practices to address these needs. Through the lens of attachment theory, this study identified a close <b>affective</b> <b>bond</b> between children left behind and their kin caregivers. This relationship is underpinned by kin caregivers’ high commitment and love for children, and the Confucian concept of ‘benevolence’.

40|$|Victorian society {{depended}} on the maintenance of positive <b>affective</b> <b>bonds</b> between individuals and between individuals and government. Anxieties about the relationships between classes, and between {{members of the same}} class made such bonds difficult. Additionally, consumer society distanced consumers from each other, creating cynical consumers of spectacle, novels and consumer objects. Commodity culture used new visual enticements to encourage the <b>affective</b> <b>bonds</b> between people and commodities; they continued to create a cycle of emotional investment and frustration in the consumers who purchased in ever-increasing numbers. After the Great Exhibition, both Dickens and Eliot describe the urge to consume in terms of collecting, and both show that such consumption can only cause destructive social stagnation. In contrast, both present models that allow both economic and affective circulation. Novels by Dickens, Eliot, Wood, Ouida, and Collins distance their readers, placing them in what James Buzard describes as a 2 ̆ 2 participant/observer 2 ̆ 2 position that allows them to observe and to consume the characters 2 ̆ 7 emotions. While this distances the reader, it also forces the reader to moderate his or her affective connection to the consumable object. As observer, the reader also responds to the social anxiety attendant on class relationships by judging each character in order {{to decide whether or not}} to extend affective identification. Readers enjoy the ability to deny identification to characters representing other class positions and enjoy Schadenfreude when those characters do not succeed in crossing class boundaries. ...|$|R

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with supporters of Barack Obama and the UK Liberal Democrats, the article illustrates how the bond between fans and their political fan object is built in the highly polysemic environment of convergence media in which audiences actively construct textual boundaries. Based on projective and self-reflective readings, enthusiasts of given political causes, actors or parties thus build an affective attachment to their fan object which allows for the creation of trust in its perceived proximity.

The paper argues that ESC serves as space of both illusionary belonging, yet equally challenges the homogenous constructions of home and belonging prevalent in national identity through the disillusionment of a shared and negotiated cultural space, allowing for the formation of, borrowing Winnicott's term, a “good enough” Heimat that offers a dual space of belonging yet simultaneously challenges the horizon of expectation upon which such belonging rests...|$|E

The study had the objective of verifying the father’s opinion concerning breast-feeding. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews following a thematic analysis technique proposed by Bardin. The fathers attributed importance to breast-feeding relating it to the baby and the mother. Concerning the child, we verified the benefits of maternal milk as a nutritious meal that promotes the infantile growth and development. It also determines the current health and promotes a strong bond of love between the mother and her baby. Concerning the mother, the interviewees stated that breast-feeding, besides contributing to establish an <b>affective</b> <b>bond</b> between the baby and its mother, also accomplishes maternity.

Relational, sociocultural and revised attachment approaches to emotional wellbeing supplied the theoretical framework of the study. Data were collected by ethnographic methods and analysed qualitatively. Two day-care groups in Finland participated. For most of the day at least one child was in a teacher’s lap. The teacher’s lap signified, e. g., consolation and confidence, but also delight. Further, for the children, it was a contested site for gaining teacher attention and displaying power.

40|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} that social scientists' {{accounts}} of ‘activism’ have too often tended to foreground and romanticise the grandiose, the iconic, and the unquestionably meaning-ful, {{to the exclusion of}} different kinds of ‘activism’. Thus, while there is a rich social-scientific literature chronicling a social history of insurrectionary protests and key figures/thinkers, {{we suggest that}} there is more to ‘activism’ (and there are more kinds of ‘activism’) than this. In short, we argue that much can be learnt from what we term implicit activisms which – being small-scale, personal, quotidian and proceeding with little fanfare – have typically gone uncharted in social-scientific understanding of ‘activism’. This paper will reflect upon one example of this kind of ‘implicit’ activism, by re-presenting findings from interviews undertaken with 150 parents/carers, during an evaluation of a ‘Sure Start’ Centre in the East Midlands, UK. From these interviews emerged a sense of how the Centre (and the parents/carers, staff and material facilities therein) had come to matter profoundly to these parents/carers. We suggest that these interviews extend and unsettle many social-scientific accounts of ‘activism’ in three key senses. First: in evoking the specific kinds of everyday, personal, <b>affective</b> <b>bonds</b> which lead people to care. Second: in evoking the kinds of small acts, words and gestures which can instigate and reciprocate/reproduce such care. And third: in suggesting how such everyday, <b>affective</b> <b>bonds</b> and acts can ultimately constitute political activism and commitment, albeit of a kind which seeks to proceed with ‘not too much fuss’...|$|R
