5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>when</b> you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
25|$|Steven Gold (Hanks) is a {{struggling}} medical student who moonlights as a stand-up comedian. It quickly becomes evident {{that he is}} lousy at the former and excels at the latter. <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>when</b> he is given a chance at the big time, he cracks under the pressure. Lilah (Field) is a dedicated housewife who yearns to be a comic. She has the raw talent but {{does not have the}} command of craft that Steven possesses.|$|E
500|$|The British press {{unanimously}} praised Arsenal's feat {{once the}} season {{drew to a}} close; the News of the World branded the team as [...] "Immortals", while The Sunday Times led with the headline [...] "Arsenal the New Invincibles". In an otherwise positive reflection of Arsenal's season, Glenn Moore wrote for The Independent: [...] "There may thus have been some truth in Arsène Wenger's declaration that Arsenal's achievement was a greater triumph than winning the Champions' League. Arsenal's prolonged celebrations reflected the scale of this landmark <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>when</b> they reflect in the summer break, how many players will agree with Wenger?".|$|E

500|$|The {{response}} for [...] "Dial D for Diddly" [...] {{was that it}} started well, but then gradually declined. In Marnell's opinion, [...] "he best segment of the entire episode comes when Ned makes his normal routine look sinister <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>when</b> he finally closes his hands to pray, he's actually holding a pair of severed hands", but {{as for the rest}} of the segment, he is disappointed: [...] "hen it seems like the short is heading for some darkly hilarious territory, the voice of God turns out to be Homer urging Ned to murder his enemies." [...] Other reviewers agreed with his assessment. Surette concluded that the episode [...] "tarted off good, but got boring very quick." [...] Likewise, Childs commented that the [...] "segment had a lot of promise for the funny, but it started to sag fast and then sank altogether." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The New York Times Book Review for 11 September 1938, Kay Irvin said, [...] "Even {{a lesser}} Agatha Christie story holds its readers' {{attention}} with its skillful management of suspense. Appointment with Death is decidedly of the lesser ranks: indeed, it {{comes close to}} being the least solid and satisfactory of all the Poirot mystery tales. Its presentation of a family harried and tortured by a sadistic matriarch is shot full of psychological conversation and almost entirely deficient in plot. <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>when</b> the evil-hearted old tyrant has been murdered at last and Poirot considers the suspects, one follows with genuine interest the unraveling of even unexciting clues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like Euripides, both Aeschylus and Sophocles created comic effects {{contrasting}} {{the heroic}} with the mundane, but they employed minor supporting characters for that purpose, whereas the younger poet was more insistent, using major characters as well. His comic touches {{can be thought}} to intensify the overall tragic effect, and his realism, which often threatens to make his heroes look ridiculous, marks a world of debased heroism: [...] "The loss of intellectual and moral substance becomes a central tragic statement". Psychological reversals are common and sometimes happen so suddenly that inconsistency in characterization is an issue for many critics, such as Aristotle, who cited Iphigenia in Aulis as an example (Poetics 1454a32). For others, psychological inconsistency is not a stumbling block to good drama: [...] "Euripides is {{in pursuit of a}} larger insight: he aims to set forth the two modes, emotional and rational, with which human beings confront their own mortality." [...] Some however consider unpredictable behaviour to be realistic in tragedy: [...] "everywhere in Euripides a preoccupation with individual psychology and its irrational aspects is evident....In his hands tragedy for the first time probed the inner recesses of the human soul and let passions spin the plot." [...] The tension between reason and passion is symbolized by his character's relationship with the gods, as in Hecuba's prayer, answered not by Zeus, nor by the Law of Reason, but by brutal Menelaus as if speaking on behalf of the old gods, and most famously in Bacchae, where the god Dionysus savages his own converts. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>when</b> the gods appear deus ex machina, as they do in eight of the extant plays, they appear [...] "lifeless and mechanical". Sometimes condemned by critics as an unimaginative way to end a story, the spectacle of a [...] "god" [...] making a judgement or announcement from a theatrical crane might actually have been intended to provoke scepticism about the religious and heroic dimension of his plays. Similarly his plays often begin in a banal manner that undermines theatrical illusion. Unlike Sophocles, who established the setting and background of his plays in the introductory dialogue, Euripides used a monologue in which a divinity or human character directly and simply tells the audience all it needs to know {{in order to understand the}} subsequent action.|$|E
