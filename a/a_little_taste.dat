2500|$|The {{successful}} 1987 reunion sparked {{discussions about}} reconstituting the band {{on a permanent}} basis. They eventually decided to replicate the Toulouse Street/Captain and Me incarnation, settling on a lineup featuring Johnston, Simmons, Hartman, Porter and Hossack, plus more recent addition LaKind, and released Cycles on Capitol Records in 1989. The album featured a Top 10 single, [...] "The Doctor", which showcased Johnston's unmistakable voice and soaring lead guitar and reminded listeners of the band's pre-McDonald heyday and triumph, which was natural given the line-up of the band at this time. The song {{is very similar to}} [...] "China Grove," [...] and the connection was further enhanced by guest Bill Payne's tinkling piano. There was more strong material on the album, including Johnston's [...] "South of the Border", Dale Ockerman's and Pat Simmons' [...] "Take Me To The Highway", and [...] "I Can Read Your Mind", a great version of the Isley Brothers' [...] "Need <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Taste</b> Of Love", and a version of The Four Tops classic, [...] "One Chain (Don't Make No Prison"), which had been covered by Santana years before. Cycles proved a successful, strong and very solid comeback album and was certified Gold. Bumpus participated in the 1989 and 1990 tours, adding his distinctive voice, keyboards, saxophone and flute to the proceedings. His presence bridged the gap between the current band and the McDonald era; he sang lead vocals on the song [...] "One Step Closer" [...] (as he originally had on the 1980 album) while Simmons took McDonald's part. The group was further augmented on the 1989 tour by Dale Ockerman (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), Richard Bryant (percussion, vocals) and Jimi Fox (percussion, backing vocals). After being diagnosed with terminal colon cancer, LaKind stepped down before the tour.|$|E

60|$|For a while, they {{wandered in}} that same broad valley which Kenyon had viewed with such delight from the Monte Beni tower. The {{sculptor}} soon began to enjoy the idle activity of their new life, which the lapse of {{a day or two}} sufficed to establish as a kind of system; it is so natural for mankind to be nomadic, that <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> <b>taste</b> of that primitive mode of existence subverts the settled habits of many preceding years. Kenyon's cares, and whatever gloomy ideas before possessed him, seemed to be left at Monte Beni, and were scarcely remembered by the time that its gray tower grew undistinguishable on the brown hillside. His perceptive faculties, which had found little exercise of late, amid so thoughtful a way of life, became keen, and kept his eyes busy with a hundred agreeable scenes.|$|R

I noticed that the table decorations were extremely pretty. Somebody complimented our hostess upon them. Mrs. Le Geyt nodded and smiled--"I arranged them. Dear Hugo, in his blundering way--the big darling--forgot to get me the orchids I had ordered. So I had to make shift with what few things our own wee conservatory afforded. Still, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>taste</b> and a little ingenuity--" [...] She surveyed her handiwork with just pride, and left the rest to our imaginations.|$|E

There is not {{on the banks of the}} Brenta a more dingy and desolate villa than Ducie appeared when we first came; and as for the gardens, they were a perfect wilderness. She made everything. It was one vast, desolate, and neglected lawn, used as a sheep-walk when we arrived. As for the ceilings, I was almost tempted to whitewash them, and yet you see they have cleaned wonderfully; and, after all, it only required <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>taste</b> and labour. I have not laid out much money here. I built the conservatory, to be sure. Henrietta could not live without a conservatory.' ...|$|E

I had a green silk, and it looked so cheap and horrid {{by the side of the}} nice dresses here I felt {{regularly}} unhappy about it, and asked her how much a dress like one Mrs Laurence had would cost. That looked so simple and elegant I thought it wouldn't be costly; but it was India mull and Valenciennes lace, so, of course, I couldn't have it. Then Mrs Brooke said: [...] "Get some muslin to cover the green silk, and wear hops or some white flowers, instead of pink, in your hair, and you will have a pretty suit." [...] Isn't it lovely and becoming?' And Miss Burton surveyed herself with girlish satisfaction; for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>taste</b> had softened the harsh green, and hop-bells became her red hair better than roses.|$|E

50|$|It was {{developed}} in Berkshire, England, United Kingdom by crossing the Cox's Orange Pippin with a Worcester Pearmain to get the optimum positive traits from both parents. This was actually what happened, it received the high eating qualities with which the Cox's is notable: a firm white flesh which is also juicy, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sharp in <b>taste,</b> but well balanced with sweetness and aroma. From the Worcester it took {{the best part of}} its horticultural adventures: easy to grow, reliable crop and resistant to many diseases.|$|R

60|$|The Bishop's study, which Farnie now {{proceeded}} to inspect, {{was not of}} this kind. It was a neat study, arranged with not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>taste.</b> There were photographs of teams with the College arms on their plain oak frames, and photographs of relations in frames which tried to look, {{and for the most}} part succeeded in looking, as if they had not cost fourpence three farthings at a Christmas bargain sale. There were snap-shots of various moving incidents in the careers of the Bishop and his friends: Marriott, for example, as he appeared when carried to the Pavilion after that sensational century against the Authentics: Robertson of Blaker's winning the quarter mile: John Brown, Norris's predecessor in the captaincy, and one of the four best batsmen Beckford had ever had, batting at the nets: Norris taking a skier on the boundary in last year's M.C.C. match: the Bishop himself going out to bat in the Charchester match, and many more of the same sort.|$|E
6000|$|... "The case {{is entirely}} the reverse when one fights with woman," [...] replied Erling. [...] "In war I confess that I like {{everything}} to be straightforward and downright, because when things come to the worst a man can either hew his way by main force through thick and thin, or die. Truly, I would that it were possible to act thus in matters of love also, but this being impossible--seeing that women will not have it so, and insist on dallying--the {{next best thing to}} be done is to act on their own principles. Fight them with their own weapons. If a woman is outspoken and straightforward, a man should be the same--and rejoice, moreover, that he has found a gem so precious. But if she will play fast and loose, let a man--if he does not give her up at once--do the same. Give Ada <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>taste</b> of indifference, Glumm, and thou wilt soon bring her down. Laugh at her as well as with her. Show not quite so much attention to her as has been thy wont; and be more attentive to the other girls in the dale--" ...|$|E

The tea proceeded pleasantly, notwithstanding that the cake, being <b>a</b> <b>little</b> burnt, <b>tasted</b> on the outside like the latter plums in snapdragon. Christopher never could meet the eye of Picotee, who continued in a wild state of flushing all the time, fixing her looks upon the sugar-basin, except when she glanced out of the window to see how the evening was going on, and speaking no word at all unless it was to correct a small sister of somewhat crude manners as regards filling the mouth, which Picotee did in a whisper, and a gentle inclination of her mouth to the little one's ear, and a still deeper blush than before.|$|R

Never were people so glad to see other people as these landlords and landladies were to behold Mr Varden and Mrs Varden and Miss Varden; and wouldn't they get out, said one; and they really must walk upstairs, said another; and she would take it ill and be quite certain they were proud if they wouldn't have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>taste</b> of something, said a third; and so on, that it was really quite a Progress rather than a ride, and one continued scene of hospitality from beginning to end. It was pleasant enough to be held in such esteem, not to mention the refreshments; so Mrs Varden said nothing at the time, and was all affability and delight--but such a body of evidence as she collected against the unfortunate locksmith that day, to be used thereafter as occasion might require, never was got together for matrimonial purposes.|$|E

Two recent reviews discuss the importance of removing lingering toxins and allergens while enhancing the levels of health-promoting antioxidants 1, 2. Such improvements may be accomplished efficiently through intragenic modification, a new approach to genetic engineering that transforms plants with native genetic elements only.

They recombine entire genomes of cultivated crops with those of wild relatives to capture at least some of the diversity that evolved within species boundaries. Additionally, genes are modified or inactivated through chemical mutagenesis programs that induce extensive substitutions, deletions, or rearrangements. New varieties derived from introgression or mutation breeding may, indeed, display powerful new trait combinations. However, they also express many less-desirable characteristics that were not considered during the selection process (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
