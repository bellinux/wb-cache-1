5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak {{is a clear}} anise-flavored alcoholic drink that is mixed with water to soften it {{and give it a}} creamy white color. It is consumed during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, and gatherings or with the mezze. Beer is also a consumed drink <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains one of the few breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, the brewery produces non-alcoholic beer for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Al-Kateb {{applied for}} a {{protection}} visa, {{on the grounds that}} the United Nations 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons obliged Australia to protect him. His application was rejected, a decision upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia. In June 2002, Al-Kateb stated that he wished to voluntarily leave Australia and be sent to Kuwait or to Gaza. However attempts by the Government of Australia to remove Al-Kateb to Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> territories (which would have required the approval of Israel) failed.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} {{had many}} long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased {{popular support for}} Zionism, {{and led to the}} creation of Mandatory Palestine, which later became Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> territories. As a result it is considered to have caused the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, often described as the world's most intractable conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to the Sharif of Mecca in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating {{large sums of money}} in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Jifna {{is governed}} by a village council {{consisting}} of ten members including the chairman. The council was founded in 1954, when a prominent resident, Nasri Ilias Samara, pressured the Jordanian authorities to recognize the institution, even though a village was normally required to have a population of at least 1,000 inhabitants for permission to establish a village council. The decision was approved by Jordan's then prime minister. Representatives from Jifna's largest families formed the original council's body, appointing Smara as chairman and Salim Issa Musleh as vice chairman. Jabi Na'im Kamil was elected as the chairman in 2005 and the Badil (Alternative) list—which represents a leftist alliance of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> People's Party—won most of the council seats.|$|E
