5000|$|ADC {{embarked}} on some acquisitions {{in the early}} 1990s, attempting to move [...] "up the stack" [...] in the datacom field by acquiring companies that manufactured datacom equipment. However, their ability to find synergies between these companies proved limited and eventually ADC was forced {{to move away from}} a hardware-only strategy, broadening out into software. This effort resulted in limited success as well, and happening {{about the same time as}} the dot-com bubble burst, caused ADC stock to plummet. Despite these ups and downs, ADC continued to survive and on July 13, 2010, the company released this announcement: [...] "Tyco Electronics (NYSE: TEL) and ADC (Nasdaq: ADCT) announced today a definitive agreement under which Tyco Electronics will acquire ADC for $12.75 per share in cash, or an enterprise value of approximately $1.25 billion. The transaction is expected to be accretive by approximately $0.14 per share in the first full year after closing excluding <b>acquisition-related</b> <b>costs.</b> It will position Tyco Electronics' Network Solutions segment as a leading global provider of broadband connectivity products to carrier and enterprise networks around the world." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{investment}} on facilities for manufacturing high-tech products requires {{a large amount}} of capital. Even though the demands of such products change dramatically, a company is forced to implement some make-to-stock policies apart from a regular make-to-order production, so that the capacity of expensive resources can be highly utilized. The inherent characteristics to be considered include finite budget for investing resources, lump demands of customers, long production horizon, many types of products to mix simultaneously, time value of capital and asset, technology innovation of resources, efficient usage of multiple-function machines, and limited capacity of resources. In addition to revenue gained from products and the salvage/assets of resources, a decision maker also needs to consider costs regarding inventory, backorder, and resource <b>acquisition-related</b> <b>costs</b> through procurement, renting, and transfer. This study thus focuses on the following issues: (i) how to decide on resources portfolio regarding the way and timing of acquisting resources, and (ii) how to allocate resources to various orders in each production period. The goal is to maximize the long-term profit. This study formulates the problem as a non-linear mixed integer mathematical programming model. A constraint programming-based genetic algorithm is developed. It has been demonstrated to solve the problem efficiently. Capacity planning Resource portfolio Genetic algorithm...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) has improved its Strategic Management Plan (SMP) by including additional strategic planning elements that were lacking from previous plans; however, the fiscal year 2012 - 2013 SMP still needs to incorporate some key information {{that would make it}} more useful for DOD decision makers as a guide for implementing business transformation efforts and for measuring progress. Improvements in the SMP include links between its business goals and DOD-wide goals, as well as milestone or target data that would enable DOD to better measure performance and assess progress in achieving SMP goals. However, the SMP does not fully describe the specific challenges the goals are intended to address and what the root causes of those challenges are. For example, the SMP states that the goal on strengthening DOD's acquisition processes is aimed at obtaining greater efficiency and productivity in defense spending, but the accompanying narrative does not describe what is causing <b>acquisition-related</b> <b>cost</b> growth and how the goal's initiatives may address those causes. The SMP also lacks sufficient context for why business goals and strategies were chosen or changed from prior plans, such as whether sufficient progress had been made to warrant their removal. Also, the SMP includes performance measures that do not fully reflect core activities needed to assess progress for some business goals. For example, the SMP identifies measures related to planning for contractor support, but does not address other core activities such as those related to providing contractor oversight. Refining the SMP to include this key information could help DOD better prioritize and target its reform efforts to address the underlying causes of its systemic business challenges and to achieve results. ...|$|R
