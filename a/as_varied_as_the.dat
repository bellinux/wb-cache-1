5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E

Chess and card games were played, and complicated poetry competitions took place; wine and 'araq flowed freely; participants sang, danced, and listened to records played on a phonograph.|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, {{came to be seen}} as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts {{on the nature of}} painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E

50|$|At short {{distances}} (less than 1.7 fm or so), {{the attractive}} nuclear force {{is stronger than}} the repulsive Coulomb force between protons; it thus overcomes the repulsion of protons within the nucleus.

Buenos Aires, its cultural capital, is largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of European styles in architecture. Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centers, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering live music of a variety of genres.|$|E
25|$|The {{meanings}} of the designs on totem poles are <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> cultures that make them. Some poles celebrate cultural beliefs that may recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events, while others are mostly artistic. Animals and other characters carved on the pole are typically used as symbols to represent characters or events in a story; however, some may reference the moiety of the pole’s owner, or simply fill up empty space on the pole. The carved figures interlock, one above the other, to create the overall design, which may rise to a height of sixty feet or more. Smaller carvings may be positioned in vacant spaces, {{or they may be}} tucked inside the ears or hang out of the mouths of the pole’s larger figures.|$|E

50|$|The {{variety of}} {{foodstuffs}} in <b>the</b> north is not <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> south of Mexico, {{because of the}} mostly desert climate. Much of the cuisine of this area is dependent on food preservation techniques, namely dehydration and canning. Dried foods include meat, chiles, squash, peas, corn, lentils, beans and dried fruit. A number of these are also canned. Preservation techniques change the flavor of foods; for example, many chiles are less hot after drying.|$|R
25|$|Training {{methods are}} <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> pigeons themselves. Some fanciers believe their {{system is the}} secret to their success and guard these hard learned lessons closely. Most fanciers will explain their basic {{strategy}} but some {{may be reluctant to}} share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning {{is one of the key}} elements in a lot of racing programs.|$|E
500|$|Film noir {{is often}} said to be defined by [...] "moral ambiguity", yet the Production Code obliged almost all classic noirs to see that steadfast virtue was {{ultimately}} rewarded and vice, {{in the absence of}} shame and redemption, severely punished (however dramatically incredible the final rendering of mandatory justice might be). A substantial number of latter-day noirs flout such conventions: vice emerges triumphant in films <b>as</b> <b>varied</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> grim Chinatown and the ribald Hot Spot.|$|E
