It has further pledged to invest £2.5 billion into the police service, promising to recruit 10,000 more officers. In addition, the group would reform education policy by aiming to cut school class sizes and scrapping tuition fees for UK students attending British universities; conversely, <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> students {{would be required to}} pay in full.|$|E
5|$|A French-aligned Haitian general, André Rigaud, had {{instructed}} his forces to attack <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once Experiment and her convoy of merchant ships neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing {{two of the}} American merchant ships before withdrawing. Experiment managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. On the American side, only {{the captain of the}} schooner Mary was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced out of power by the forces of Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the 1791 Haitian Revolution, did the picaroon attacks cease.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of {{political}} and military machinations conducted by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that are described in the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

5|$|After pacifying central Vietnam, Duyệt was reappointed {{to be the}} viceroy of {{southern}} Vietnam and Cambodia in 1820 by Emperor Minh Mạng, Gia Long's successor. The emperor further enhanced Duyệt's powers by allowing him the power to oversee <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> trade coming into his area, and collect taxes in Cambodia and on imports and exports at his discretion. This gave Duyệt control over the vast economic resources in the fertile agricultural and lumber-rich region and most importantly, land development. The southern area had only been populated by ethnic Vietnamese in recent centuries and immigration, clearing and development of land was rapid.|$|E
5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} NATO {{to develop}} a military structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a {{reduction in the number of}} military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E

5|$|By January 1943, Himmler {{reported}} that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans {{did not live}} in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million residents of the annexed Polish territories, {{as well as from}} Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the General Government or sent to Germany as slave labour. Himmler instructed that the German nation should view <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> workers brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood. In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as Rassenschande (race defilement).|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E

5|$|Despite his socialist and pro-Soviet beliefs, Crawford {{believed}} in collaborating with <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> archaeologists, regardless of political or ideological differences. In early 1938, he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry; the Ministry published his lecture as Luftbild und Vorgeschichte, and Crawford was frustrated that the British {{government did not}} publish his work with the same enthusiasm. From there, he visited Vienna to meet with his friend, the archaeologist Oswald Menghin; Menghin took Crawford to an event celebrating the Anschluss, at which he met the prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel. Shortly after, he holidayed in Schleswig-Holstein, where German archaeologists took {{him to see the}} Danevirke.|$|E

Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries.|$|E
5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or subtitling. In general, <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a soap opera was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language localisation of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using teletext service normally used for closed captioning.|$|E

5|$|Postwar Communist {{governments in}} Eastern Europe {{severely}} restricted religious freedoms. Although some priests and religious collaborated with Communist regimes, many were imprisoned, deported or executed and the Church {{was an important}} player {{in the fall of}} Communism in Europe. In 1949, Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War led to the expulsion of <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> missionaries. The new government also created the Patriotic Church whose unilaterally appointed bishops were initially rejected by Rome before many of them were accepted. In the 1960s, the Cultural Revolution saw the closure of all religious establishments. When Chinese churches eventually reopened, they remained {{under the control of the}} Patriotic Church. Many Catholic pastors and priests continued to be sent to prison for refusing to renounce allegiance to Rome.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran and Germany requested that the organization responsible for the show's production, the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), create and produce versions of Sesame Street in those countries. Even before the American show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> versions had to be broadcast without commercials; (2) any changes would have to meet high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's cultural values and traditions; and (4) all changes would have to be approved, initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.|$|E
5|$|His {{international}} {{career was}} then put on hold, as <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> tours were suspended during the Second World War. He {{continued to play}} first-class cricket in Australia, before enlisting in the Second Australian Imperial Force in May 1942. Barnes's time in the military was short. A man who {{was proud of his}} appearance, he had a uniform made to measure when the one issued did not fit. He met champion golfer Norman Von Nida early into his enlistment and the two were assigned to the 1st Armoured Division in Greta. A shortage of tanks and the military regimen led to boredom and Barnes used his hitherto ignored trade background to his advantage, seeking a release to join a tank-making company, which was granted. Von Nida and Barnes remained friends and business partners for many years afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In 1336, an embassy to the French Pope Benedict XII in Avignon {{was sent}} by Toghun Temür, the last Yuan emperor in Dadu. The embassy was led by two Genoese {{travelers}} {{in the service of}} the Mongol emperor, who carried letters representing that the Mongols had been eight years (since Archbishop John of Montecorvino's death) without a spiritual guide, and earnestly desired one. Pope Benedict appointed four ecclesiastics as his legates to the khan's court. In 1338, a total of 50 ecclesiastics were sent by the pope to Peking, among them John of Marignolli, who returned to Avignon in 1353 with a letter from the Yuan emperor to Pope Innocent VI. But soon, the Han Chinese rose up and drove the Mongols out of China, establishing the Ming Dynasty in 1368. By 1369, <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> influences, from Mongols to Christians, Manichaeans, and Buddhists, were expelled by the Ming Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Kabila {{was shot}} dead inside his palace. The Congolese {{government}} claimed Kabila {{had been killed by}} a rogue bodyguard, who was himself killed at the scene. According to a report published in French newspaper Le Monde, Kabila was killed by the kadogo, an army of child soldiers he was known to have assembled during the First Congo War. The kadogo had suffered badly during the battles in Kasai and Katanga, were poorly paid, and had become alienated by Kabila. Kabila's son Joseph was appointed president and immediately began asserting his authority by dismissing his father's cabinet and senior army commanders, assembling a new government, and engaging with the international community. The new government provided impetus for renewed peace negotiations, and in July 2002 a peace agreement was reached between Rwanda, Congo, and the other major participants, in which <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> troops would withdraw and RCD-Goma would enter a power-sharing transitional government with Joseph Kabila as interim president until elections could be held. By the end of 2002, all uniformed Rwandan troops had left Congolese territory.|$|E
5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled <b>all</b> <b>foreign</b> debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E
