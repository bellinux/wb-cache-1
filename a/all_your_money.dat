60|$|VALENTINE. Ah, ma'am, if {{only you}} had {{invested}} <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money</b> as you laid out part by my advice. What a monstrous pity you did not.|$|E

6000|$|... "But, come now, let's {{hear more}} about this business, Tom. I suppose you want a little sum to make a venture with. But where's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> own <b>money?</b> You don't spend it all--eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is absurd," [...] she declared. [...] "You {{have wanted}} <b>money</b> <b>all</b> <b>your</b> life, <b>money</b> and power. You have both now in your grasp. If {{you do not}} use them, I shall think--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money</b> {{was offered}} me {{to stand in}} your shoes," [...] said the captain, looking after him--"rich as you are, I wouldn't take it!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No difference," [...] said Von der Doppelbauch. [...] "It is {{accepted}} anyway. The telegram has just arrived accepting <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money.</b> My assistants are packing it up outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps your {{existing}} will {{may help}} you to instruct me, sir," [...] pursued Mrs. Lecount. [...] "May I inquire to whom you left <b>all</b> <b>your</b> surplus <b>money,</b> after leaving the eighty thousand pounds to your wife?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Then {{come the}} doctor, {{the worst of}} them all,Saying, [...] "What's been {{the matter with you}} all the fall?"He says he will cure you of <b>all</b> <b>your</b> disease.When <b>your</b> <b>money</b> he's got, you can die if you please,And it's hard, hard times.|$|R
5000|$|It's Up to You: Try to get {{others to}} comply {{by telling them}} the {{decision}} is theirs to make and it's up to them. That is, try to gain their compliance by telling them the choice to comply is up to them. Example: [...] "Its {{up to you to}} spend <b>all</b> of <b>your</b> <b>money</b> on video games, instead of saving it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But she'll spend <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money,</b> Poff! She'll {{break your}} back with debts. What's to prevent her? With him living on her! For that's what it comes to practically." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would seem}} so," [...] replied my father, with a laugh. [...] "I am an unlucky beggar, Maggie. I dropped <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money</b> {{as well as}} my own down that wretched mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Give <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money</b> to the headmen of the village,' said Juseen Daze; 'and {{they will}} hold a {{communal}} Council, and the Council will {{send a message that}} your wife must come back.' ...|$|E

40|$|What? You 2 ̆ 7 re having {{dollars and}} dimes trouble already? Don 2 ̆ 7 t write Dad for more money. Make {{the most of}} what you have. At the {{beginning}} of the school year, you are constantly called upon to spend more money. You have membership dues to pay, books and supplies are required and it is a temptation to spend hours and dimes in the Union. After the first few weeks, however, you suddenly stop and wonder where <b>all</b> of <b>your</b> <b>money</b> has disappeared to...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ten thousand!" [...] exclaimed Mary Louise, delightedly, [...] "why, you Craggs {{are going}} to be rich, Ingua. What with <b>all</b> the <b>money</b> <b>your</b> mother got back from Ned Joselyn and this legacy, you will never suffer poverty again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; your father's Mr. Bertram. Therefore, if old Mr. Bertram should die, {{and this}} young man should be his heir, {{he would have the}} charge of <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money.</b> You'd better be gracious to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not yet,' {{said the}} goose. 'Take a good {{handful of the}} herb with you, and let us go to your rooms. We will collect <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money</b> and clothes together, {{and then we will}} test the powers of the herb.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because now is {{the only}} time there ever is to do a thing in,' said Miss Ophelia. 'want to make sure of it. You may die or lose <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money.</b> Then Topsy would be taken away and sold, in spite of {{anything}} I could say.' ...|$|E

If I {{know that you have}} $12 now, then it would be expected that with even odds, you will either have $11 or $13 after the next toss. This guess is not improved by the added knowledge that you started with $10, then went up to $11, down to $10, up to $11, and then to $12.|$|R
5000|$|A highly {{simplified}} spinoff {{was published}} in 1997 by Valen Brost Game Co called Spaceopoly. This game has secret mission cards, similar to Risk, specifying an assignment that the player can complete to win the game. The rules contain quirky provisions; for example, the last sentence of the rule on laser battles reads: [...] "If an opponent fires a laser at your ship and rolls 12 (i.e., double sixes), your ship is totally disabled and you {{are out of the}} game. <b>Your</b> attacker wins <b>all</b> of <b>your</b> <b>money</b> and property. Exception: If you hold the 'Invented a new force field' mission card you survive the attack and automatically win the game!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] {{commanded}} the major, {{with his arm}} outstretched. [...] "It seems that my book didn't lie, after <b>all.</b> You think <b>your</b> <b>money</b> salve will heal all the hurts of honour. Under no circumstances would I accept a loan from a casual acquaintance; and as to you, sir, I would starve before I would consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the circumstances we have discussed. I beg to repeat my request relative to your quitting the apartment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{she said}} to her husband, [...] "it would have been much better if each one of you had given the two dollars without any raffle, and then you would have had <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money.</b> But one can't expect men to do a thing like that." ...|$|E

40|$|Betting on a {{horse race}} is, in many ways, like {{investing}} in a financial market. You invest <b>your</b> <b>money</b> on the horse that you believe {{is going to win}} the race, in the hope of a return on your investment. Like some financial investments, horse race betting is a high risk investment, in that you can lose <b>all</b> of <b>your</b> <b>money.</b> As with making the right financial decision, the return on your investment, if you bet on the winning horse, can be considerable. In this paper, we present EDDIE, a genetic programming system, which augments an expert's knowledge and guides the expert into making the best investment decision. We set out to show that by using EDDIE, and a financial expert's expertise, we can guide that expert towards the best investment decision and maximise that expert's return on investment. Introduction A horse racing bettor is concerned with one thing only, and that is to risk money in order to gain more money. To do this a bettor must have information with which to determine how to [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 6, 1992, Galli, {{wearing a}} black wig, entered the Tool Shed and pointed a gun at store clerk Sylvia Nordoff. He told her, [...] "This is a stickup, give me <b>all</b> of <b>your</b> <b>money</b> or I'll kill you." [...] When Ms. Nordoff refused {{to hand over the}} money, Galli grabbed nearly $180 in cash from the cash {{register}} and fled. Ms. Nordoff tackled him just outside the store, where her son Michael helped her hold Galli down. Christopher Galli, who was waiting outside, threatened Ms. Nordoff and her son with a weapon and told them to let Adam go. Galli and Christopher then ran to their car and drove off. When witnesses attempted to pursue the two men, Nathan drove up and told them to call the police while he chased the robbers. Nathan later returned to the scene and gave false information to the police.|$|R
6000|$|... "Greetings, Benoni," [...] he said, {{with his}} {{pleasant}} smile. [...] "Here am I, yet alive, for <b>all</b> <b>your</b> fears; {{so you see}} <b>your</b> <b>money</b> is still safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One at a time," [...] he said. [...] "Mrs. Pullen, I {{was very}} {{sorry to hear}} this afternoon, for your sake, that you had lost <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money.</b> What I {{wanted to say to}} you now, now that you are poor, was to ask you to be Mrs. Miller. What d’ye say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By jove! And <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money</b> was in it. What rotten luck!" [...] Then I {{spotted the}} silver lining. [...] "But, after all, it doesn't matter so very much.

6000|$|... "Look here, fellers," [...] Seth {{cried in}} what was very like despair as the steamer neared the dock, [...] "I don't know what to do, even after you've put up <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>money.</b> Where can Snip an' I go? We've got to earn our livin', an' I don't see how it's to be done if we're bound to hide all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, please, {{forgive me}} for hurting you. You wanted {{straight}} talk, and I am giving it to you. All these last years you have been living unnaturally. You, {{a man of the}} open, have been cooping yourself up in the cities with all that that means. You are not the same man at <b>all,</b> and <b>your</b> <b>money</b> is destroying you. You are becoming something different, something not so healthy, not so clean, not so nice. <b>Your</b> <b>money</b> and <b>your</b> way of life are doing it. You know it. You haven't the same body now that you had then. You are putting on flesh, and it is not healthy flesh. You are kind and genial with me, I know, but you are not kind and genial to all the world as you were then. You have become harsh and cruel. And I know. Remember, I have studied you six days a week, month after month, year after year; and I know more about the most insignificant parts of you than you know of all of me. The cruelty is not only in your heart and thoughts, but it is there in face. It has put its lines there. I have watched them come and grow. <b>Your</b> <b>money,</b> and the life it compels you to lead have done all this. You are being brutalized and degraded. And this process can only go on and on until you are hopelessly destroyed--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{think that}}," [...] she pleaded. [...] "And please, Mr. Draconmeyer, don't think that I don't {{appreciate}} <b>all</b> <b>your</b> kindness. Short of accepting <b>your</b> <b>money,</b> I {{would do anything}} to prove it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{immediately}} after Runyon's passing on December 10, 1946, Winchell {{went on the}} air and asked his audience for contributions to cancer research. [...] "Mr. and Mrs. United States! A very dear friend of mine a great newspaperman, a great writer, and a very great guy Damon Runyon, was killed this week by America's Number Two killer Cancer. It's time we tried to do something to fight this terrible disease. We must fight back, and together we can do it. Won't you send me a penny, a nickel, a dime, or a dollar? <b>All</b> of <b>your</b> <b>money</b> will go directly to the cancer fighters, in Damon Runyon's name. There will be no expenses of any kind deducted."The organization gained more visibility in 1949 when Milton Berle, a long-time friend of both Runyon and Winchell, hosted the first-ever telethon, raising $1.1 million for the foundation over 16 hours. [...] In its first three decades, the foundation was a popular cause among celebrities from Hollywood to Broadway and the sports world. Marlene Dietrich, Bob Hope, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and many of their contemporaries served as supporters and board members.|$|R
