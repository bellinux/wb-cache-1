We have been pretty severe upon them, but nowhere, except in the pulpit, to my knowledge. I counsel my brethren to keep away from their houses; let them alone, and treat them as courteously as you would any other person. Do you enquire whether I have any grounds for giving this advice? I answer, I have. For there are few men in this congregation who know when to stop, should they find themselves engaged in a contest with one of that class of people, therefore let them alone entirely. Those individuals are disagreeable to me, and so are their doctrines. The man they hold up is so low and degraded in his spirit, feelings, and life, I have not patience to hear anything said about him. I have known him too long, and too well, not to be satisfied of the wickedness of his heart. ... "I wish this community to understand, that what has been said here touching those men and their views has been with no other design than to cause them to use their tongues as they ought, and cease abusing me and this people. Some of them visited me yesterday, and wished to know if it was safe for them to stay here. I told them they were as safe as I was, if they did not undertake to make us swallow, whether or not, something we are not willing to take. [...] "We have been driven, and re-driven," [...] said I, [...] "and if corrupt people stay in our midst, they have got to use their tongues properly." [...] They promised they would, if they might stay."If they wish to live here in peace, I am willing they should, but I do not wish them to stir up strife. I never expected that this community would be composed entirely of Latter-day Saints, but I expected there would be goats mixed among the sheep, until they are separated. I do not look for anything else, but I wish them to behave themselves in their sphere, also the sheep; and let the goats associate with their goatish companions, and not endeavor to disturb the equanimity of the sheep in their pasture."This comparison will apply to this people, and those men. If they wish to labor, and obtain a living, they are welcome to do so; but they are not at liberty to disturb the peace of their neighbors in any way; neither let this people disturb them, but grant them every privilege claimed by, and belonging to, American citizens. Let them meet together and pray if they please; this is their own business. Let them do as some did in a camp meeting in York State-One man met another and said, [...] "How do you do? How <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>getting</b> along on the camp-ground?" [...] "Why they are serving God like the very devil," [...] was the reply.

These questions and others like them are important to us as teachers because they reflect aspects of self-functioning and the answers to them say something about how well the self is doing its job. Given that poor self-functioning has been suggested as adversely affecting one's achievement and life chances, and that it has been associated with eating disorders and delinquent behaviour, it is not surprising that improving self-functioning is a goal of education. It is highly desirable that we should want to promote people's psychological well-being and so evaluating oneself positively, having warm relationships with others, making genuine choices, managing one's environment and having a sense of moving forward are qualities that we wish to foster...|$|E

Such studies to date have produced equivocal evidence of variation in rhetorical organisation across culturo-linguistic groups. In order to contribute to this continuing debate, this study employs the Rhetorical Structure Theory analytic framework to produce pictorial representations of lengthy Chinese and Australian news journal text. Results obtained clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using the RST framework {{in this kind of}} analysis. While the small size of the newstext corpus severely limits the generality of other findings, they give tentative support to the contrastive rhetoric hypothesis. Pedagogical implications include the benefits of promoting awareness of such cross-cultural variation within the L 2 classroo...|$|E
40|$|At {{colleges and}} {{universities}} around the world, {{the use of the}} eBook as a source of research material continues to slowly gain momen-tum, “slowly ” being the key word here. In reviewing multiple editions 1, 2 of the Library Use of E-Books published by the Primary Research Group, {{it can be seen that}} eBook spending of universities over the five years from 2006 to what is projected in 2011 has increased dramatically. The median spending has increased by more than a fac-tor of five, with institutions projecting to spend $ 104, 922 on eBooks in 2011. While libraries are spending more on eBooks, they are choosing to spread those dollars amongst multiple vendors and publishers.

40|$|Turkish {{university}} and research libraries have been cooperating for 20 {{years for the}} primary purpose of sharing printed materials such as books and journal articles. This well-established effort had become insufficient in the changing environment, which is shifting more and more toward electronic resources. The need for better management of tight library budgets and for better site license negotiations appeared as two of the main motivating factors {{in the formation of the}} Anatolian University Libraries Consortium (ANKOS). ANKOS was formed in 2000 with the participation of 12 university libraries. Over the past three years, the number of member libraries has increased to 70. While ANKOS is evolving into a national organization, the member libraries have started seeing ANKOS as a critical component of their acquisitions process. ANKOS today is leveraging what each library is trying to accomplish in terms of subscribing to more electronic resources for the lowest price. This article studies how ANKOS is affecting individual libraries’ decision-making regarding their investment in electronic resources. A survey was conducted among member libraries to answer questions such as have they experienced a change in the expenditure of their funds; <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>getting</b> better value for their money; is ANKOS helping them to sign more suitable contracts; is it helping them to overcome the language barrier with vendors; are the fair use principles understood better by librarians as well as users.

40|$|Sports {{sponsorship}} is an {{umbilical cord}} that ensures supply of essential resources for sports {{to ensure its}} sustenance and development. Corporate sponsors provide the greatest resources in sponsorships. Sponsorship is a symbiotic business relationship, one {{that is supposed to}} benefit sponsors and sports entities who are in partnership. Value derivation from resources invested in a sponsorship is important to sponsors, it is the greatest benefit for them. Chances of sustaining a sponsorship is enhanced when value is derived from a sponsorship. Sports in Nigeria contend with various challenges, including inadequate funding. In order to surmount this problem, it is essential for sports entities to know why corporate bodies desire to sponsor sports and what they define as value since value is subjective to a large extent. This thesis sought to resolve four questions: a. Why are corporate sponsors interested in sponsoring sports in Nigeria? b. What do sponsors perceive as value in a sponsorship? c. <b>Are</b> <b>they</b> <b>getting</b> value from existing sponsorships? d. What is expected of recipients to sustain or enhance a sponsorship relationship? This qualitative study involved three case studies and four face-to-face interviews of representatives of corporate sponsors of sports in Nigeria. This study is based on Homan’s Social Exchange Theory. The focus was not to test theory but rather to highlight that sponsorship is exchange based relationship. It is a commercially motivated relationship in which sponsors give their resources to sports entities to enable them associate their brands with them. The benefits derived are varied, including possibility to leverage their brands. A thematic approach was used in data analysis. Results showed that recognition, attention, visibility, broad reach to variety of people, association/relationship, inherent nature of sports are some major themes deduced from reasons of interest to sponsor sports. Respondents agreed that they have derived value from sponsorship though it could have been better in some cases. Honesty, professionalism, innovativeness, discipline, transparency were stated as important to sustain a sponsorship. Themes connected to value included, youth empowerment, brand projection, enhanced visibility and image. Sponsorship was stated to be a symbiotic affair, anything far from this will undermine their interests in such sponsorship. Sports entities in Nigeria need to create an outlook that will attract sponsors as well as help deliver value in relation to expressed value definitions by their sponsors. Sports in Nigeria will experience a positive change if sports administrators and other sports entities desiring fulfilling sponsorship act on findings from this study...|$|E
