Addis (6, 7) has studied the urinary sediment in both nor-mal and nephritic patients and is able by this means to classify the nephritides more accurately.

40|$|Microscopic haematuria is a urinary {{finding more}} and more {{frequently}} observed in routine analysis in childhood. The diagnostic problems, most of which unresolved, are yet the principal question concerning in. We have studied 123 patients during five years from 1975 to 1980, and followed them for 1 - 8 years (mean 4 years). Oue experience allowed us to consider “normal” or without remarkable pathologic significance a urinary findings {{less than or equal}} to 5, 000 RBC/m’ at the <b>Addis</b> <b>count.</b> Such findings was pointed out in 55 cases (44 %); 27 patients (22 %) had 5 - 10, 000 RBC/m’, 34 patients (27. 6 %) presented 10 - 50, 000 RBC/m’, and 7 cases (5. 7 %) had more than 50, 000 RBC/m’. The familiar background, the clinical, biological, and immunological data, the roentgenographic investigations and the renal biopsy carried out in 4 group of patients, led us to the following conclusions: (1) 26 % of the 123 cases had an “unexplained” microscopic haematuria with complete lack of anamnestic data, symptomatology and with normal biological findings. (2) In 65. 8 % of the cases it was possible to discover frequent upper respiratory tract infections (and allergy in 5. 6 % of them). (3) In 26 % of the patients we discovered a previous or actual genitor-urinary (10. 5 % and 15. 5 % respectively) infection: 9. 4 % of 96 urographies demonstrated a variable degree of nephro-urological abnormalities. (4) 23 children (18. 7 %) was selected for renal biopsy, primarily by the hypocomplementemia and positive anti-DNA ab. Test, and secondly by elevated degree of microematuria. The histological and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of mesangial proliferation glomerulonephritis with IgC-IgA-C 3 deposits in 7 cases (30 % of the cases biopsied and 5. 6 % of the total), 69. 6 % of the cases had only minimal changes with negative immunofluorescence. (5) A mean follow-up of 4 years in two groups of patients (6 years of age) has demonstrated that microscopic haematuria remains unchanged in 18 - 19 % of both groups. A more marked improvement or normalization has been documented in the children more than 6 years aged (p< 0. 001) while a worsening has been observed in the children less than 6 years aged (p< 0. 005), with a difference statistically significant between the two groups considered...|$|E
40|$|P REVIOUS WORK (I) in this {{laboratory}} {{demonstrated the}} effectiveness of 6 per cent osseous gelatin as a plasma volume expander. However, following intravenous gelatin infusions eosinophilic droplets (2) {{are found in the}} proximal tubular cells. Accordingly, <b>Addis</b> <b>counts</b> (3) were performed in five children (surface area varying from 0. 62 to 0. 96 m. 2) immediately before and two days after the intravenous ad-ministration of 500 cc. of 6 per cent osseous gelatin. There was no significant change before and after gelatin in specific gravity; and albumin, cast, red and white cell excretion. From these data we concluded that gelatin was not nephrotoxic. However, in view of the claim that gelatin causes a nephrosis (2) we felt that quantitative examination of several renal functions should be done. Since the eosinophilic granules probably represent proximal tubules reabsorbing gelatin (4) and since albumin is similarly reabsorbed (s), we decided to follow a program similar to our examination of the latter substance. METHODS After we had demonstrated that gelatin did not interfere with the analysis fo...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} report {{deals with}} {{a study of the}} urinary changes in ordinary scarlet fever as revealed by the <b>Addis</b> sediment <b>count</b> technique. No cases of clinical postscarlatinal nephritis have been included. Particu-lar interest centers in the period from 8 to 30 days after the onset of infection. LITERATURE As early as 1874 Mahomed (1) found that scarlet fever convalescents, at some period during the six weeks after defervescence, exhibited a pulse of high tension (sphygmograph) and hemoglobinuria (guaiac test) without albuminuria (nitric acid test). If the tension was high and persisted, albumin was liable to appear. Occasionally there was anorexia with slight fever (1000 F.) and sometimes a little edema was evident upon careful examination, but as a rule, there were no constitutional symptoms or signs. He called this picture the "prealbuminuric stage of nephritis. " Thompson (2), in 1886, examined the urine for blood and albumin three times a day for 56 days in 180 cases of scarlet fever. Eighty-four per cent of the patients were under 15 years. In 66 cases (37 per cent) there were no urinary changes. Two cases (1 per cent) showed anasarca without urinary changes, and in 112 (62 per cent) the urine showed albumin, blood, or both, with or without edema. Thompson calls all of these 112 cases " nephritis, " but "in some cases, the evidence of kidney mischief was so slight and evanescent that but for careful and frequent testing, the presence of these substances, would no doubt, have been overlooked. " Thompson also found, at times, a positive guaiac test with no albumin, but thought the "pre-albuminuric stage " of nephritis was infrequent. Dittmar (3) examined the urine in 91 consecutive cases twice daily for 56 days. Eighty-five per cent of the patients were under 15 years. The nitric acid test for albumin and the guaiac test for blood were used. Forty-eight (52. 7 per cent) of the cases at some period showed positive 1 Two patients were studied through the courtesy of Dr. Charles Hendee Smith and 12 patients were studied on the wards of Willard Parker Hospita...|$|R
50|$|The Italian {{claim that}} Menelik {{was aware of}} Article XVII turning his nation into an Italian {{protectorate}} seems unlikely given that the Emperor Menelik sent letters to Queen Victoria and Emperor Wilhelm II in late 1889 and was informed in the replies in early 1890 that neither Britain nor Germany could have diplomatic relations with Ethiopia on the account of Article XVII of the Treaty of Wuchale, a revelation that came as a great shock to the Emperor. Victoria's letter was polite whereas Wilhelm's letter was somewhat more rude, saying that King Umberto I was a great friend of Germany and Menelik's violation of the supposed Italian protectorate was a grave insult to Umberto, adding that {{he never wanted to}} hear from Menelik again. Moreover, Menelik did not know Italian and only signed the Amharic text of the treaty, being assured that there were no differences between the Italian and Amharic texts before he signed. The differences between the Italian and Amharic texts was due to the Italian minister in <b>Addis</b> Ababa, <b>Count</b> Pietro Antonelli who had been instructed by his government to gain as much territory as possible in negotiating with the Emperor Menelik, but knowing Menelik was now enthroned as the King of Kings had a strong position was in the unenviable situation of negotiating a treaty that his own government might disallow, and who inserted the statement Ethiopia gave up its right to conduct its foreign affairs to Italy as a way of pleasing his superiors who might otherwise had fired him for only making small territorial gains. Antonelli was fluent in Amharic and given that Menelik only signed the Amharic text he could not have been unaware that the Amharic version of Article XVII only stated that the King of Italy places the services of his diplomats at the disposal of the Emperor of Ethiopia to represent him abroad if he so wished. When his subterfuge was exposed in 1890 with Menelik indigently saying he would never sign away his country's independence to anybody, Antonelli who left Addis Ababa in mid 1890 resorted to racism, telling his superiors in Rome that as Menelik was a black man, he was thus intrinsically dishonest and it was only natural the Emperor would lie about the protectorate he supposedly willingly turned his nation into.|$|R
