5|$|Chaos;Head was {{originally}} released for Microsoft Windows on April 25, 2008 by Nitroplus. Around June {{of the same}} year, {{it was decided to}} port the game to Xbox 360. This version was released on February 26, 2009 under the title Chaos;Head Noah, and includes new content. Chaos;Head Noah was ported to multiple platforms: it was released for the PlayStation Portable on June 24, 2010, for iOS on November 18, 2010, for Android on January 24, 2012, and for PlayStation 3 on November 22, 2012. While the Xbox 360 version was given a Z rating (18 years and up) by CERO, the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 versions were edited {{to be able to be}} released with a D rating (17 years <b>and</b> <b>up).</b> <b>The</b> PlayStation Vita version bundled the Z-rated version of Chaos;Head Noah with the follow-up Chaos;Head Love Chu Chu! under the title Chaos;Head Dual, and was released on August 21, 2014.|$|E
5|$|During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David {{became the}} first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the {{leadership}} of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908– February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram {{became the first}} to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.|$|E

5|$|East Anglia was a {{long-lived}} Anglo-Saxon {{kingdom in}} which a duality of a northern and a southern part existed, corresponding with the modern English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. It was formed during the 5th century, following the ending of Roman power in Britain in 410. The east of Britain became settled at an early date by Saxons and Angles from the continent. During the 5th century, groups of settlers of mixed stock migrated into the Fens <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> major rivers inland. From Bede {{it is known that}} the people who settled in what became East Anglia were Angles, originally from what is now part of Denmark. By the 6th century, new settlements had also appeared along the river systems of the east coast of East Anglia, including the Deben, the Alde and the Orwell. The settlers were unaffected by Roman urban civilisation and had their own religion and language. As more of the region fell under their control, new kingdoms were formed, replacing the function of the Roman territoria. Surrounded by sea, fenland, large defensive earthworks such as the Devil's Dyke and wide rivers, all of which acted to disconnect it from the rest of Britain, the land of the East Angles eventually became united by a single ruling dynasty, the Wuffingas.|$|E
5|$|Later in the war, Young's {{farmhouse}} and Four Corners {{were the}} site of the largest military engagement near the river. By 1780, the Continentals were operating much more freely around northern Westchester, although they had to stay on the move to avoid attack. In January, one company of about 250 troops from Massachusetts lingered long enough at Four Corners for local Loyalists to inform the British, who raised a force of about 100 cavalry and 400 to 500 infantry at Fort Washington, today on the northern tip of Manhattan. The force marched to Yonkers <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Saw Mill overnight, arriving at Four Corners the next morning. The outnumbered Continentals put up stiff resistance, aided by the cold, heavy snow cover and their opponents' fatigue, but most were ultimately killed or taken prisoner. The British and their Loyalist and Hessian allies celebrated by burning down the Young house; the Continentals retreated {{to the north of the}} Croton River for the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|Lower North East Road {{runs around}} Anstey Hill <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{escarpment}} of the Burnside-Eden Fault Zone. It connects the suburbsformerly villagesof Hope Valley and Houghton. Three roads were surveyed and built {{to connect the}} same locations. The first was a private road constructed by George Anstey in 1841although officially surveyed in 1844to reach his estate, as a mostly straight-line extension of Grand Junction Road. It followed {{the base of a}} gully, before rising steeply up Anstey Hill. From 1842 to 1846, Anstey constructed a replacement private road with a devil's elbow (double hairpin bend) that followed the land's contours more closely. As Chairman of Roads for the District of Yatala, Anstey allocated most of the district's funding to his road, leading to a public outcry that forced him from office in 1851. This ungravelled road became known as Anstey Hill Road and remained in use for 20 years. New Road, later renamed Houghton Road and subsequently Lower North East Road, was constructed in 1873 as a replacement. It was longer than the preceding roads but lacked a devil's elbow, was more evenly sloped, and was paved in 1930. It now separates {{a small part of the}} parkthat contains Klopper's quarries and the Gun Emplacementfrom the rest. Remains of the two previous roads can be seen near Klopper's quarries.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} third repulse of the Confederates on the western wing, the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee regiments arrived from the Mauckport Road and joined the battle, giving the attackers a {{numerical}} superiority. At about 12:40p.m., Capt. Byrnes arrived with the Confederate artillery and used his two ten-pound Parrott rifle cannons to pin down the defenders in the works. In the meantime, Morgan was leading his main body of troops far around {{the eastern edge of}} the defenses <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Plank Road, threatening the town directly and bypassing the defenses entirely. As they moved onto the Corydon Pike, they shot and robbed a toll gate keeper who refused to throw down his gun.|$|E
5|$|The 1827 North Carolina {{hurricane}} caused severe impacts {{along its}} track through the northeastern Caribbean Sea <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> East Coast of the United States in late August1827. First observed over the Leeward Islands on August17, the storm continued northwest, passing over Puerto Rico {{and the northern}} coastline of Hispaniola. It moved through the Turks and Caicos Islands and then the Bahamas by August21 and curved northward. Although there is some discrepancy in its track, the hurricane moved ashore somewhere along the North Carolina coastline on August25, perhaps at Category4 intensity on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The cyclone emerged back into the Atlantic Ocean around Norfolk, Virginia, and grazed the New England coastline before last being observed offshore Nova Scotia on August28. Along its track, numerous vessels were damaged, capsized, or run aground. The combination of heavy rainfall and ferocious winds caused severe crop damage, damaged or destroyed structures, and snapped and uprooted trees. Overall, the storm was responsible {{for more than six}} deaths and at least two injuries.|$|E

They advanced in small groups, supported by the heavy weapons of M/116, who were held {{at the base of the}} bluff. Progress was slowed by mines on the slopes of the bluff, but elements of all three rifle companies, as well as a stray section of G/116, had gained the top by 09:00, causing the defenders at WN-62 to mistakenly report that both WN-65 and WN-66 had been taken.|$|E

5|$|The {{first person}} to climb the {{mountain}} was Thomas Gerdine, along {{with a group of}} United States Geological Survey scientists, Sam Strom, A. H. Dubor, and Darcy Bard, in 1897. The volcano is also available to skiers. To reach the mountain itself, it takes 5 miles of walking along the White Chuck River Trail (Forest Service Trail No. 643) <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Sitkum Glacier. The trail is reached via Forest Service Road No. 23. Mainly, the slopes consist of black diamonds for both the ascent and descent.|$|E
5|$|The route {{began in}} Scandinavian trading centres such as Birka, Hedeby, and Gotland, crossed the Baltic Sea entered the Gulf of Finland, {{followed}} the Neva River into the Lake Ladoga. Then it followed the Volkhov River, upstream past {{the towns of}} Staraya Ladoga and Velikiy Novgorod, crossed Lake Ilmen, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Lovat River. From there, ships had to be portaged to the Dnieper River near Gnezdovo. A second route from the Baltic to the Dnieper was along the Western Dvina (Daugava) between the Lovat and the Dnieper in the Smolensk region, and along the Kasplya River to Gnezdovo. Along the Dnieper, the route crossed several major rapids and passed through Kiev, and after entering the Black Sea followed its west coast to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|When I-96 was {{completed}} in 1977, several highway designations were shifted in the Metro Detroit area. The Business Spur I-96 designation that had replaced US16 was removed from Grand River Avenue. That roadway was signed as M-5 southward between 8Mile Road and its present eastern terminus at I-96 while the remainder of Grand River Avenue and the stub freeway formerly part of I-96 that continued out to I-275 became part of M-102. This extension to M-102 was reversed in October 1994 when M-5 was extended northwesterly along Grand River Avenue, the freeway <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Haggerty Connector north of I-96 in Novi, replacing part of M-102 in the process.|$|E

On his release, Orsborne planned to make a single-handed transatlantic crossing in an open boat, but the trip was delayed, and finally cancelled when war began in September 1939.

5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work {{his way around the}} flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E
5|$|While {{work on the}} Synopsis of Quadrupeds {{was still}} in progress, Pennant decided on a journey to Scotland, a {{relatively}} unexplored country and not previously visited by a naturalist. He set out in June 1769 and kept a journal and made sketches as he travelled. He visited the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast on the way and was much impressed by the breeding seabird colonies. He entered Scotland via Berwick-on-Tweed and proceeded via Edinburgh <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> east coast, continuing through Perth, Aberdeen and Inverness. His return journey south took him through Fort William, Glen Awe, Inverary and Glasgow. He was unimpressed by the climate but was interested in all he saw and made enquiries about the local economy. He described in detail the scenery around Loch Ness. He enthused over the Arctic char, a fish new to him but did not mention a monster in the lake. He observed red deer, black grouse, white hares and ptarmigan. He saw the capercaillie in the forests of Glenmoriston and Strathglass and mentioned the pine grosbeak, the only occasion on which it has been recorded from Scotland. He enquired into the fisheries and commerce of the different places he passed through and visited the great houses, reporting on the antiquities he found there. He finished his journey by visiting Edinburgh again and travelling through Moffat, Gretna and Carlisle {{on his way back}} to Wales, having taken about three months on his travels. On his return home, Pennant wrote an account of his tour in Scotland which met with some acclaim and which may have been responsible for an increase in the number of English people visiting the country.|$|E
