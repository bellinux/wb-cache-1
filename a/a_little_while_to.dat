25|$|In 1807 Captain George Reynolds {{replaced}} Wise, who {{had become}} ill and who remained in the West Indies for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> recuperate before returning home. By {{the end of the}} year Mediator had returned to Britain. In 1808 she was fitted as a storeship and command passed to Captain George Blamey. Her role became one of conveying supplies to the various squadrons blockading French ports. On 15 March 1808 Mediator recaptured the Swedish ship Maria Christiana. In May 1808 Captain John Pasco managed to obtain the command of Mediator for three months.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a small}} {{theater at}} the studio where {{contract}} players put on plays. While Kanin was acting in Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead, {{she came to the}} attention of Michael Kanin, who had just been hired as a writer in the B unit. Michael was trained as an artist and had turned to commercial art and painting scenery for burlesque houses to help support his parents during the Depression. They were introduced by a mutual friend, and Michael practically asked Kanin to marry him right then and there, but it took her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> come around to the idea.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} it took me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> {{get used to the}} new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. [...] But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> and <b>to</b> each {{the silence was}} like an irritating air, exaggerating discomfort.|$|R
60|$|They had a fair wind, {{and towards}} evening Cynthia, {{who had been}} absent from his side <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> came <b>to</b> tell him that the coast of France grew nigh.|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} silence. Romola took no note {{of this for}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> pauses in dictation; and when at last she looked round inquiringly, there was no change of attitude.|$|R
500|$|Yeats finally visited Olivia at her Porchester Circle home a {{few weeks}} later to present his well-thought out {{intentions}} but, to his bewilderment, Olivia declared her love for him. Unsure of himself, he took another absence, during which he decided that if Maud was unattainable, or unavailable due to circumstances, he would have Olivia, writing [...] "but after all if I could not get the woman I loved it would be a comfort for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> devote myself to another". For Yeats, Olivia was willing to lose her daughter, financial security, social standing, and the goodwill of her family. Although her husband had grounds to sue Yeats and consequently destroy his reputation, her best hope against complete ruin was Shakespear's strong dislike of public scenes. Then Yeats lost his nerve again, suggesting instead each seek advice from a friend (a [...] "sponsor"). He probably chose Florence Farr to be his sponsor while Olivia chose Valentine Fox—Harwood speculates that the sponsors advised the two {{to go ahead with the}} affair, perhaps to Yeats' discomfort.|$|E
2500|$|The former name of [...] "Belles Roches" [...] {{hints at}} the {{spectacular}} location of Saint Romain, nestling under a cliff {{at the top of}} the Clous valley above Meursault. The appellation was only designated in 1947, and there are no Premier Crus in its 135 ha. The mostly red wines represent the more rustic side of Burgundy and take <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> come round.|$|E
2500|$|In eight Test matches since April 2012, he {{has managed}} to score just 408 runs at an average of 31.38, with highest being 117. In six ODIs in the same period, he scored 183 runs at an average of 30.5 and was dropped for the ODI series against England. His last ODI century was the double hundred against the West Indies in December 2011. Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott had hinted that it might {{be the end of the}} road for Sehwag."I don't think he'll play again. I think it's because India have gone the right way. It took <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> come around to it. They've given youth a chance," [...] Boycott told a cricket website.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father {{asked him}} to dinner, and {{when he wanted to}} {{discharge}} the fellow Torrance told him something that upset father terribly, and urged that he be kept <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer, <b>to</b> which father agreed." ...|$|R
50|$|Later, in September 2006, Jack and Jen {{accepted}} {{a job in}} London, England, and although Frankie stayed in Salem <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer <b>to</b> help with some court cases, he soon left on Thanksgiving night 2006, {{to work at a}} firm in Washington, D.C.|$|R
60|$|Only the Lady Elaine {{was troubled}} in spirit, for she wist that now Sir Bors was come Sir Launcelot would not {{stay with them}} for long, but that he would in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> desire <b>to</b> return again {{to the court of}} King Arthur.|$|R
2500|$|Ellen E Jones from The Independent though Dyer in EastEnders seemed [...] "inevitable" [...] {{and called}} him [...] "the cockney messiah [...] come to save EastEnders". She said that Dyer walks the [...] "thin line between {{national}} treasure and national laughing stock", so EastEnders—"which works best when it's an overblown cockney pantomime"—would be Dyer's [...] "natural home". Kevin O'Sullivan from the Daily Mirror {{said that it would}} take more than hiring Dyer to [...] "stop the rot", as fans were getting [...] "fed up" [...] of watching the show. Katy Brent from the Daily Mirror said: [...] "I'm kind of intrigued to see what Danny Dyer is going to bring to the table, or bar in his case, but I think it's going to take me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> be convinced by him. No offence Dan, I'm sure you'll be great, but I'm a little sceptical when 'names' are brought in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon being {{convinced}} {{that he had not}} robbed anyone of their melody, McCartney began writing lyrics to suit it. As Lennon and McCartney were known to do at the time, a substitute working lyric, titled [...] "Scrambled Eggs" [...] (the working opening verse was [...] "Scrambled eggs/Oh my baby how I love your legs/Not as much as I love scrambled eggs"), was used for the song until something more suitable was written. In his biography, , McCartney recalled: [...] "So first of all I checked this melody out, and people said to me, 'No, it's lovely, and I'm sure it's all yours.' It took me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> allow myself to claim it, but then like a prospector I finally staked my claim; stuck a little sign on it and said, 'Okay, it's mine!' It had no words. I used to call it 'Scrambled Eggs'." [...] The original song, Scrambled Eggs, was written to hold the music and phrasing in place. It was performed by Paul McCartney and Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and has been recorded and released by the Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Armadale," [...] {{said the}} lawyer, [...] "you did me the honor, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> since, <b>to</b> {{say that you}} {{considered}} me your friend. May I presume on that position {{to ask you a}} question or two, before you go straight to your own ruin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Beaupere {{cautiously}} edged along up {{with other}} questions toward the forbidden ground, and finally repeated a question which she had refused <b>to</b> answer <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> back--as <b>to</b> whether she had received the Eucharist in those days at other festivals than that of Easter. Joan merely said: ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[The {{memory of}} having heard that name <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> before coming <b>to</b> her--with a start, confusedly.] Cape Town? Where's that. Far away? ...|$|R

60|$|But {{the bishop}} {{knew better than}} that, and worked his way round to the stern, and after holding on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get his breath, he managed to clamber into the boat.|$|E
60|$|If it be {{continued}} to be look'd on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer with <b>a</b> Microscope, it will within <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> begin <b>to</b> wreath it self again, and soon after return to its former posture, bending it self again neer the middle, {{into a kind of}} knee or angle.|$|R
50|$|They {{then are}} able to be at ease for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> and decide <b>to</b> go with Makoy's earlier plan to move to Manila.|$|R
6000|$|... "In fact," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George, [...] "I {{would not}} say any thing about the distance that you wish {{to go to the}} captain. Just make a bargain with him to let you go aboard his raft for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> and <b>to</b> send you ashore whenever you wish to go." ...|$|R
60|$|The skipper, {{suffering}} severely from suppressed emotion, went below, and the crew, {{after waiting}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that}} he was not coming up again, made their way quietly to the mate.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vickers himself {{listened for}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> such {{fragments}} as came his way, and then, going indoors, sat down amid {{the remains of}} his breakfast to endeavour {{to solve the mystery}} of the new clothes.|$|E
60|$|Henery Walker at once gave 'im {{some more}} gin and beer, and arter he 'ad drunk it the old gentleman said that he'd go {{and live with}} 'im for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> see 'ow he liked it.|$|E

50|$|In 1958 class {{designation}} on {{the suburban}} network was abolished, with all painted indications of former First- and Second-class ticketing requirements painted over within two days; it took <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer <b>to</b> standardise all seating, and until that happened there were stories of passengers {{rushing to the}} former first-class trailer cars for the more comfortable seating.|$|R
60|$|He {{waited for}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> let them gain their {{distance}} {{and for the}} second time wiped his forehead with his shirt sleeve; then, without ever once letting his eyes leave them, he climbed the fence to the roadway.|$|E
60|$|He was {{perfectly}} cool, {{and his eyes}} kept that mocking smile which made all I said seem rather foolish. I paused for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> consider what I had better say next. But {{it was he who}} spoke first.|$|E
60|$|The calm fervour of her cheerful voice {{brought back}} so vividly, first the dear old house itself, {{and then my}} solitary home, that my heart was too full for speech. Traddles pretended for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> be busily looking among the papers.|$|E
6000|$|At last, as the tea {{was nearly}} over, Aubrey walked in, quite ready for self-defence.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{my father}} was a farmer. I'm a teacher. I only began <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> ago <b>to</b> speak in the {{interest}} of the farmer.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I went on, [...] "we do, indeed"; {{and again}} I smiled benignly, as I uttered that amazing lie.
