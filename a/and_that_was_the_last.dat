25|$|The 1900 {{season was}} not {{successful}} for Diver. He scored just 421 runs in 19 matches {{for an average}} of 16.19, and passed 50 just twice. A report {{at the start of the}} 1901 season indicates that Diver appeared for practice with the Warwickshire team, though it also states that the County Club was in severe financial difficulties. In the event, Diver played in only one match, the away fixture with Surrey at The Oval, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> game of his first-class career.|$|E
25|$|Three Ba.88s were {{modified}} by the Agusta plant in late 1942 {{to serve as}} ground-attack aircraft. The Ba.88M had the wingspan increased by 2 meters (6ft 6½ in) to alleviate wing-loading problems, and featured dive brakes, Fiat A.74 RC.38 engines, and a nose armament increased to four 12,7mm (0,5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns. Evaluated at Guidonia, they were delivered to the 103° Gruppo Autonomo Tuffatori at Lonate Pozzolo on 7 September 1943, the day before Italian Armistice. Later they were evaluated by Luftwaffe pilots <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> heard of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was en-route to Campbeltown Airport in Argyll, Scotland, {{to pick up}} a ten year-old boy with acute abdominal pain, suspected to be appendicitis. After a flight that included many navigational irregularities, the pilot was flying the normal approach, which took the aircraft out to sea before turning back toward the airport. The pilot informed controllers that he had completed the turn, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> transmission received from the aircraft. Investigators conclude the aircraft hit the water a few seconds after that transmission. Both occupants of the aircraft, the pilot and a paramedic seated at his station behind the pilot, were killed. The ensuing investigation concluded that the pilot allowed the aircraft to fly too low, and it descended unchecked into the sea. The pilot was also fatigued, overworked, lacked recent flying practise, and he might have suffered from an undetermined influence, such as disorientation, distraction, or subtle incapacitation, as evidenced by several navigational errors, miscommunications, and mismanagement of his instruments. Although the weather might have precluded a safe landing in Campbeltown, the weather was not a cause of the accident. The patient was eventually driven overland to a Glasgow hospital, where he was treated for a ruptured appendix.|$|E

Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", and she {{was praised}} for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw <b>the</b> lightning, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> guns; <b>and</b> then we heard <b>the</b> thunder, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> big guns; <b>and</b> then we heard <b>the</b> rain falling, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> drops of blood falling; and {{when we came to}} get <b>the</b> crops, it <b>was</b> dead men <b>that</b> we reaped." ...|$|R

500|$|Tom Araya {{said that}} [...] "when we did Divine Intervention, {{this was the}} last conference we ever had with a record label where they sat us down and sold us the idea of how they wanted to do [...] "Divine", and how {{they were going to do}} this with the cover... and all these {{different}} ideas for the album. Then one guy looked at us and said, 'But we need a hit song.' And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.' So we're like saying to them, 'Right, you write the fucking hit song and we'll record it.' That shut the guy up <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time we had any kind of meetings like that!" ...|$|E
2500|$|NS ex-Conrail unit #8447 had a {{front door}} swap with BNSF #4560. In February 2006, Norfolk Southern C40-8W was seen with an {{extremely}} dirty BNSF C44-9W door. Norfolk Southern {{knew it was}} getting old and {{it was due to}} be retired so they took the door and put it on without repainting it into Conrail paint. In late 2010, NS 8447 was seen again in Conrail paint with the then-rusted-over BNSF door <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time it was seen until early 2011.

2500|$|Eysenck’s {{attitude}} was summarised {{in his autobiography}} Rebel with a Cause: [...] "I always felt that a scientist owes the world only one thing, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> truth as he sees it. If the truth contradicts deeply held beliefs, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> too bad.

2500|$|In 1992/1993, Sublime {{was briefly}} signed to Danny Holloway's True Sound imprint. However, the band stayed on Skunk Records {{and then in}} June 1994, they were signed to the label Gasoline Alley of MCA Records by Jon Phillips who {{subsequently}} became Sublime's manager. Sublime released their second album Robbin' the Hood in 1994, an experimental effort with its diffuse mixture of rock, rap, spoken-word nonsense and folk-leaning acoustic home recordings. Robbin' the Hood was a commercial failure. The band toured extensively throughout 1994-1995, their popularity increasing gradually beyond the West Coast as [...] "Date Rape" [...] began earning radio play. In 1995, the band co-headlined the inaugural nationwide Vans Warped Tour. The band was eventually asked to leave the tour for a week due to unruly behavior of Sublime guests and Lou Dog biting four different individuals. [...] Gaugh reflected on the experience: [...] "Basically, our daily regimen was wake up, drink, drink more, play, and then drink a lot more. We'd call people names. Nobody got our sense of humor. Then we brought the dog out and he bit a few skaters, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> straw." [...] After the Warped Tour and the subsequent Three Ring Circus Tour, the band was pressured to begin producing new studio material as a follow-up to Robbin' the Hood.|$|E
2500|$|I {{even saw}} the Aurora take off one night - or an {{aircraft}} {{that matched the}} Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> I saw of it. I didn't hear it because {{the wind was blowing}} from behind me toward the base." [...] I asked when this had taken place. [...] "February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero - probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV." [...] The author then asked, [...] "Where's the tape?" [...] "Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 2007, Joe {{unexpectedly}} {{returns to}} the Fowlers' house, much to the horror of Pauline's friend Dot Branning (June Brown), who is inside {{the house at the}} time. Joe reveals to Dot that he had gone back to the house on Christmas Day to try to patch things up with Pauline, but that she harshly told him that he [...] was leaving, not her, and continued to insult him and his ways. He told Pauline he felt like lashing out at times, and she dared him to [...] "be a man" [...] and hit her. Joe then describes how, In an anger, he picked up a frying pan and hit Pauline hard on the head with it. He left the house after the incident, at which point Pauline was fine, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time he saw his wife, who later died due to a brain haemorrhage caused by the blow to the head Joe had given her. Dot then proceeds to try to convince Joe to tell the truth but he refuses. She then attempts to ring the police but Joe snatches the phone out of her hand and throws it away. Dot's husband, Jim (John Bardon) meanwhile, arrives at the Fowlers' house to find Dot. Seeing that Joe is holding Dot captive, Jim rushes over to save her and a struggle that follows results in Joe falling back and crashing out of a window and falling through a market stall. Jim looks out of the window as Joe lies on the street, dead.|$|E
