500|$|Kleine's {{private lessons}} for Busch were also {{attended}} by Erich Bachmann, {{the son of}} a wealthy Ebergötzen miller. Both became friends, according to Busch the strongest friendship of his childhood. This friendship was echoed in the 1865 story Max and Moritz. A small pencil portrait by the 14-year-old Busch depicted Bachmann as <b>a</b> <b>chubby,</b> confident boy, and showed similarities with Max. Busch portrayed himself with a [...] "cowlick", in the later [...] "Moritzian" [...] perky style.|$|E
500|$|Samuel Lord Black as George Sanderson, <b>a</b> <b>chubby,</b> oranged-furred monster with a sole horn {{on top of}} his head. A running gag {{throughout}} the film involves George repeatedly making contact with human artifacts (such as socks and the like which cling to his fur via static), prompting his scare coach to trigger [...] "23–19" [...] incidents with the CDA resulting in him mobbed, shaved bald, and sterilized. [...] He is good friends with Pete [...] "Claws" [...] Ward.|$|E
500|$|A five-minute blooper reel featuring, {{among other}} shots, unintentional pratfalls by Hathaway {{due to the}} high {{stiletto}} heels she had to wear. It also includes gag shots such as <b>a</b> <b>chubby</b> crewmember in loose-fitting clothing walking along the runway at the fashion show, and Streep announcing [...] "I have some nude photographs to show you" [...] at the Paris brunch scene. Unlike most blooper reels, {{it is not a}} collection of sequential takes but rather a fast-paced montage set to music from the film with many backstage shots and a split screenshot allowing the viewer to compare the actual shot with the blooper. The many shots of actors touching their noses are, Rich Sommer says, a game played to assign blame for ruined takes.|$|E
50|$|Previously in 1927, Oswald had an oval face, <b>a</b> <b>chubbier</b> waist, {{and pants}} {{with a single}} suspender. By 1928, he's given a makeover, having a rounder head, a slimmer waist, and shorts. Despite this change, the rabbit's 1927 {{appearance}} would still appear on the title cards until High Up.

500|$|In 1997, writer Ivan Velez, Jr., who had {{previously}} written for the adult underground Gay Comix, reintroduced Jennifer Kale with a closely cropped [...] "butch" [...] haircut {{in the pages of}} Ghost Rider, portrayed her as related to both Johnny Blaze and Daniel Ketch, and said that an issue of Howard the Duck had shown Jennifer and Doctor Strange as those who initially brought Howard to Earth-616 (no such issue of Howard the Duck exists, and Jennifer and Doctor Strange did not meet until Man-Thing (vol. 2) #4 (May 1980)), after Howard's series had concluded). In issue #92 (January 1998), he depicted Ketch having a vision of life without Ghost Rider in which Jennifer had been in a relationship with a woman, Marie, for three years. Jennifer's first boyfriend, Jaxon, was shown in Fear #13 (April 1973) and #18 (November 1973) and Man-Thing (vol. 2) #4 (May 1980), by which point they had broken up over Jennifer's sorcery. She was shown sharing a bed with <b>a</b> <b>chubby</b> boyfriend named Bernard Drabble in The Legion of Night (October 1991), which was written by her creator, Steve Gerber (later writer of the GLAAD Award-nominated Hard Time), who thought making her related to both Ghost Riders was bad writing, saying that Marvel should change its name to DC for [...] "Deliverance Comics" [...] for being so inbred (he did not read the issues in question, nor was he told of Jennifer's newfound lesbianism). In Witches, Brian Patrick Walsh presents her with the attitude that having slept with women makes her a [...] "bad girl" [...] as a direct character foil to Topaz as a [...] "good girl" [...] (which does not match earlier portrayals of Topaz), and Satana as [...] "the ugly." [...] In Marvel Zombies 4, Topaz teasingly calls Jennifer [...] "girlfriend" [...] to be ironic. Her entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe now states that she is bisexual.|$|E

2500|$|Fisk {{was born}} in Bellows Falls, Vermont, but {{according}} to Fisk, that was only because Vermont had the nearest hospital to his hometown, Charlestown, New Hampshire. He grew up in Charlestown, across the Connecticut River from Bellows Falls, and attended Charlestown High School, where he played baseball and basketball. Because his family is from New Hampshire, he insisted that the organization remove from his plaque in the Red Sox Hall of Fame its characterization {{of him as a}} Vermont native. Fisk earned his longtime nickname, [...] "Pudge", because he was <b>a</b> <b>chubby</b> youngster.|$|E

2500|$|An {{attempt was}} made (but failed) to pair Timmy with a pal his own age.

Todd Ferrell as Ralph [...] "Boomer" [...] Bates, <b>a</b> <b>chubby,</b> beanie-wearing character, entered the show to {{recreate}} something of the popular Jeff and Porky friendship from the Miller years.

2500|$|Alma Thomas' {{early work}} was {{representational}} in manner. [...] Upon further education at Howard and training under James V. Herring and Lois Mailou Jones her work became more abstract. Thomas {{would not be}} recognized as a professional artist until her retirement from teaching in 1960, when she enrolled in classes at American University. There she learned about the Color Field movement and theory from Ben L. Summerford and Jacob Kainen. She then became interested in the use of color and composition. Within twelve years after her first class at American, she began creating Color Field paintings, inspired by the work of the New York School and Abstract Expressionism. She worked out of the kitchen in her house, creating works like Watusi (Hard Edge) (1963), a manipulation of the Matisse cutout The Snail, in which Thomas shifted shapes around and changed the colors that Matisse used, and named it after <b>a</b> <b>Chubby</b> Checker song.|$|E
