5|$|The second rule of privity, that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a business, on the condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain <b>amount</b> <b>per</b> week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E
5|$|In Beswick v Beswick {{an uncle}} gifted his nephew a business, on the {{condition}} that the nephew would pay the uncle (Mr Beswick) a certain <b>amount</b> <b>per</b> week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow (Mrs Beswick). When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not benefit from it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate. As executrix she would be acting as a representative of Mr Beswick, and the doctrine of privity would not apply.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting <b>amount</b> <b>per</b> barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

25|$|In early December 2010, {{members of}} the Christianity subreddit decided to hold a fundraiser and later {{members of the}} atheism subreddit decided to give some {{friendly}} competition, cross-promoting fundraising drives for Doctors Without Borders and World Vision's Clean Water Fund, respectively. Later, the Islam subreddit joined in, raising money for Islamic Relief. In less than a week, the three communities (as well as the Reddit community at large) raised over $50,000. Most of this was raised by the atheism subreddit, though the smaller Christianity subreddit had a higher average donation <b>amount</b> <b>per</b> subscriber. A similar donation drive in 2011 saw the atheism subreddit raise over $200,000 for charity.|$|E

25|$|Bender {{brought the}} script to Miramax, the {{formerly}} independent studio that {{had recently been}} acquired by Disney. Harvey Weinstein— co-chairman of Miramax, along with his brother, Bob— was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up. Pulp Fiction, the first Miramax project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million. It became the first movie that Miramax completely financed. Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same <b>amount</b> <b>per</b> week, regardless of their industry status. The biggest star {{to sign on to}} the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw. On the strength of his name, Miramax garnered $11 million for the film's worldwide rights, virtually ensuring its profitability.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Richard's promise to uphold her interests, his {{close friend and}} ally, Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell claimed that the Hastings manors of Ashby and Bagsworth, and the Beaumont estates belonged to him, {{although}} these had been left to Katherine following her husband's execution. In order for Katherine to retain these properties, she was compelled to pay Lovell the sum of 200 marks in cash and give him lands totalling the same <b>amount</b> <b>per</b> annum. Richard {{made no move to}} curtail the avarice of his friend, who had assumed a powerful role in the government during the King's brief reign. King Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485 and the Lancastrian victor, Henry Tudor subsequently ascended the throne as Henry VII. Katherine's eldest surviving son, Edward fought on the side of King Henry against Lovell at the Battle of Stoke in June 1487. This battle saw the final defeat of the House of York and Lovell, as one of the Yorkists' chief leaders, afterwards fled to Scotland; however, his eventual fate remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 1985 the {{district}} auditors for Lambeth and Liverpool gave notice to 81 councillors (49 from Liverpool, 32 from Lambeth) that {{the delay in}} fixing the rates was wilful misconduct {{and so they were}} required to repay the costs as a surcharge: £106,103 in Liverpool, £126,947 in Lambeth. In both cases the <b>amount</b> <b>per</b> councillor was over £2,000 and therefore they were also disqualified. The district auditor found that Lambeth Borough Council had been embarked, since at least September 1984, on a political campaign against the Rates Act 1984 and the Government. Since its failure to make a rate was a political lever in that battle, the failure was wilful misconduct and therefore the councillors responsible were liable for the surcharge to make good the cost of the council's actions. The surcharged councillors from both Lambeth and Liverpool appealed to the High Court against the surcharges; when the case opened on 14 January 1986, counsel for the Lambeth councillors, Lionel Read QC, argued that the cost of delaying setting a rate was a legitimate expense in an attempt to secure more money from the Government which might have succeeded. He also argued that the loss of interest was not irrecoverable.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{promising}} crops for ethanol production that are gaining in popularity. Among these are algae, miscanthus, switchgrass, and sugarcane. Other options are {{what are known}} as cellulosic biomass which includes plant parts currently wasted in contemporary industrial, chemical agriculture like wheat stalks, corn stalks, and other biomass left after harvesting. Many of these crops yield much higher ethanol <b>amounts</b> <b>per</b> acre.|$|R
30|$|However, the {{coefficient}} of odds changes sign {{as soon as we}} add ExpAmount as a control variable (models 10 and 12). The reason is that large investors do not only invest large overall amounts, but also high <b>amounts</b> <b>per</b> bet. And as these amounts are placed on favorites, the favorite bets placed by these bettors exhibit a particularly large variance. This effect is very pronounced, and is responsible for the results in Table  6. Therefore, part of the high variance of favorite bets is now absorbed by ExpAmount. Consequently, odds have a positive sign when controlling for the amounts invested. By contrast, {{the coefficient}} for odds does basically not change compared to model 9 when we add ExpNumber instead of ExpAmount. ExpNumber itself has a negative sign which is not surprising as high-frequency bettors often invest low <b>amounts</b> <b>per</b> bet. In other words, bet sizes are ceteris paribus decreasing in the number of bets when controlling for the overall amount.|$|R
25|$|A poll tax, {{also called}} {{a per capita}} tax, or {{capitation}} tax, is a tax that levies a set <b>amount</b> <b>per</b> individual. It {{is an example of}} the concept of fixed tax. One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the Bible of a half-shekel per annum from each adult Jew (Ex. 30:11–16) was a form of poll tax. Poll taxes are administratively cheap because they are easy to compute and collect and difficult to cheat. Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply and poll taxes therefore do not lead to economic distortions. However, poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. In addition, the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time: on average, couples will choose to have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed. The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 Peasants' Revolt. Scotland was the first to be used to test the new poll tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990. The change from a progressive local taxation based on property values to a single-rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay (the Community Charge, but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax), led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest, known colloquially as the 'Poll Tax Riots'.|$|E
