5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include <b>anxiolytic,</b> anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an <b>anxiolytic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with <b>anxiolytic</b> properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An <b>anxiolytic</b> or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} dental {{prescriptions for}} <b>anxiolytics,</b> sedatives, and hypnotics for Brazilian outpatients in 2010. Methods. A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} using data {{on the use of}} <b>anxiolytics,</b> sedatives, and hypnotics from the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency, Brazil, 2010. For each prescription, prescribed drugs and the prescribed amount were identified. Prescribed medications were classified according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code. We calculated the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD) for <b>anxiolytics,</b> sedatives, and hypnotics by code, their mean DDD, and DDD per inhabitant per year. Results. There were 16, 436 prescriptions dispensed, including <b>anxiolytics,</b> sedatives, and hypnotics. These prescriptions corresponded to 3, 555, 780. 50 [*]mg, distributed as 2, 286, 200. 50 [*]mg (64. 30 %) of <b>anxiolytics</b> and 1, 269, 580. 00 [*]mg (35. 70 %) of sedatives and hypnotics. This amount allowed treating approximately 474, 106 individuals (number of DDD). The <b>anxiolytics</b> most frequently dispensed were bromazepam (25. 30 %), alprazolam (19. 19 %), and diazepam (15. 60 %). Sedatives and hypnotics mostly prescribed were zolpidem (9. 55 %), midazolam (6. 99 %), and flunitrazepam (2. 14 %). The per capita rates (100, 000 inhabitants) of <b>anxiolytics</b> and sedatives/hypnotics were 6. 83 and 1. 78, respectively. Conclusions. Benzodiazepines and derivatives were the most frequently prescribed drugs.

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses <b>anxiolytic,</b> sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

40|$|Objective. With {{depression}} {{being present}} in approximately 20 % {{of people with}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), we expect equally frequent prescription of antidepressants, <b>anxiolytics,</b> and hypnotics. Nevertheless, prescription data in people with T 2 DM is missing {{and the effect of}} depression on glycaemic control is contradictory. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence of antidepressants, <b>anxiolytics,</b> and/or hypnotics use in a large, managed, primary care system cohort of people with T 2 DM and to determine the sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, T 2 DM medication, and metabolic control associated with its use. Method. The prevalence of antidepressants, <b>anxiolytics,</b> and/or hypnotics use in the years 2007 – 2012 was assessed in the Hoorn Diabetes Care System Cohort from the Netherlands. Results. From the 7016 people with T 2 DM, 500 people (7. 1 %) used antidepressants only, 456 people (6. 5 %) used <b>anxiolytics</b> and/or hypnotics only, and 254 people (3. 6 %) used a combination. Conclusion. We conclude that in our managed, primary care system 17 % of all people with T 2 DM used antidepressants, <b>anxiolytics,</b> and/or hypnotics.

5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the <b>anxiolytic</b> and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, <b>anxiolytic,</b> and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, <b>anxiolytic,</b> anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E

5|$|Different GABAA {{receptor}} subtypes have varying distributions within {{different regions}} of the brain and, therefore, control distinct neuronal circuits. Hence, activation of different GABAA receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions. receptor subtype functions | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–23 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16376150 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2005.10.003 }} In terms of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, their similarities are too great to separate them into individual categories such as <b>anxiolytic</b> or hypnotic. For example, a hypnotic administered in low doses produces anxiety-relieving effects, whereas a benzodiazepine marketed as an anti-anxiety drug at higher doses induces sleep.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and <b>anxiolytic</b> effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} antidepressants, <b>anxiolytics</b> and hypnosedatives among community-dwelling people aged ≥ 65 years, living in Belgium. Methods A repeated cross-sectional study was carried out. Sociodemographic and medicine use data from random samples of people aged ≥ 65 years were extracted from the Federal Health Survey organized in Belgium in 2001 (N= 2103 out of 12050) and 2004 (N= 3249 out of 12945). Statistical analyses (Student’s t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-square tests) were performed with SPSS. Results Hypnosedatives were {{the most commonly used}} psychotropic drugs in people aged ≥ 65 years. In 2001, 19. 3 % of people reported on taking prescribed hypnosedatives in the previous two weeks; in 2004 this number had significantly increased to 25. 1 % (P< 0. 001). The proportion of people using prescribed <b>anxiolytics</b> also significantly increased between 2001 (11. 2 %) and 2004 (12. 8 %) (P< 0. 001), whereas the use of antidepressants did not significantly change over time (used by 7. 4 % of people in 2001 and 8. 4 % in 2004; P= 0. 272). More females than males were taking <b>anxiolytics</b> (68. 5 % and 70. 5 % of users), hypnosedatives (69. 4 %, 70. 0 %) and antidepressants (69. 9 %, 75. 5 %) in 2001 and 2004 respectively.
