500|$|In these conditions, Shackleton {{decided to}} try to reach help, using one of the boats. The nearest port was Stanley in the Falkland Islands, [...] away, but made {{unreachable}} by the prevailing westerly winds. A better option was to head for Deception Island, at the western end of the South Shetland chain. Although it was uninhabited, Admiralty records indicated that this island held stores for shipwrecked mariners, and was also visited from time to time by whalers. However, reaching it would also involve a journey against the prevailing winds—though in less open seas—with ultimately no certainty when or if rescue would arrive. After discussions with the expedition's second-in-command, Frank Wild, and ship's captain Frank Worsley, Shackleton decided to attempt to reach the whaling stations of South Georgia, to the north-east. This would mean a much longer boat journey, of [...] across the Southern Ocean, in conditions of rapidly approaching winter, but with the help of following winds it appeared feasible. Shackleton thought that [...] "a boat party might make the voyage <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> relief within a month, provided that the sea was clear of ice, and the boat survive the great seas".|$|E
