This optical imaging approach is sensitive, cost-effective, and does not involve any ionizing radiation. However, the image reconstruction of diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a nonlinear inverse problem and suffers from severe ill-posedness, especially {{in the cases of}} strong noise and incomplete data. In this paper, a novel image reconstruction method is proposed for the detection of breast cancer. This method split the image reconstruction problem into the localization of abnormal tissues and quantification of absorption variations. The localization of abnormal tissues is performed based on a new well-posed optimization model, which can be solved via differential evolution optimization method to achieve a stable image reconstruction. The quantification of <b>abnormal</b> <b>absorption</b> variations is then determined in localized regions of relatively small extents, which are potentially tumors. Consequently, the number of unknown absorption variables can be greatly reduced to overcome the underdetermined nature of diffuse optical tomography (DOT), allowing for accurate and stable reconstruction of the <b>abnormal</b> <b>absorption</b> variations in the breast.

The thickness of Co thin films was altered systematically by varying the number (n) of potential cycling within a defined potential range in electrodeposition. Electrochemical in situ {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) and ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the surface structure of Co thin films. It has been illustrated that the Co thin films were uniformly composed of Co nanoparticles, whose structure and size varied with increasing n. The structure of nanoparticles inside the Co thin films underwent a transition from bearded nanoparticles to multiform nanoparticles and finally to hexagonal nanosheets, accompanying with an increase of average size. In situ FTIR reflection spectroscopic studies employing CO adsorption as probe reaction revealed that the Co thin films all exhibited anomalous IR properties; that is, along with their different nanostructures they presented abnormal IR effects, Fano-like IR effects, and surface-enhanced IR absorption effects.

Clinically evident arthritis occurred in 8 / 10 mice receiving native CII (nCII; 100 /ig/mouse) alone at 9 - 13 weeks. Arthritis was aggravated by the further ingestion of CII, while remission occurred after withdrawal of the CII. Heat-denatured CII (dCII; 200 /*g/mouse) was also arthritogenic if co-administered with ovoinhibitor (OVI; 2 mg/mouse), a proteinase inhibitor. Co-oral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 /ig/mouse) with CII enhanced the antibody production and T-cell responses to CII, and induced a more chronic arthritis that progressed spontaneously without further administration of CII or LPS. Long-term oral administration of LPS alone also induced a mild arthritis characterized by destruction of bone rather than cartilage.

40|$|Excessive iron {{absorption}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} features of β-thalassemia and can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. Serial analyses of β-thalassemic mice indicate that while hemoglobin levels decrease over time, the concentration of iron in the liver, spleen, and kidneys markedly increases. Iron overload is associated with low levels of hepcidin, a peptide that regulates iron metabolism by triggering degradation of ferroportin, an iron-transport protein localized on absorptive enterocytes as well as hepatocytes and macrophages. Patients with β-thalassemia also have low hepcidin levels. These observations led us to hypothesize that more iron is absorbed in β-thalassemia than is required for erythropoiesis and that increasing the concentration of hepcidin in the body of such patients might be therapeutic, limiting iron overload. Here we demonstrate that a moderate increase in expression of hepcidin in β-thalassemic mice limits iron overload, decreases formation of insoluble membrane-bound globins and reactive oxygen species, and improves anemia. Mice with increased hepcidin expression also demonstrated an increase in the lifespan of their red cells, reversal of ineffective erythropoiesis and splenomegaly, and an increase in total hemoglobin levels.

The Zn 2 +-mediated neurotoxicity was inhibited by nonspecific TRPM 7 blockers Gd 3 + or 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, and by knockdown of TRPM 7 channels with small interfering RNA. In addition, Zn 2 +-mediated neuronal injury under oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions was also diminished by silencing TRPM 7. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of TRPM 7 channels in HEK 293 cells increased intracellular Zn 2 + accumulation and Zn 2 +-induced cell injury, while silencing TRPM 7 by small interfering RNA attenuated the Zn 2 +-mediated cell toxicity. Thus, TRPM 7 channels may represent a novel target for neurological disorders where Zn 2 + toxicity plays an important role...|$|R

50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of this disorder include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. The patients have brittle hair and metaphyseal widening. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood and are less severe. Affected infants may be born prematurely. Symptoms appear during infancy and are largely a result of <b>abnormal</b> intestinal copper <b>absorption</b> with a secondary deficiency in copper-dependent mitochondrial enzymes. Normal or slightly slowed development may proceed for 2 to 3 months, and {{then there will be}} severe developmental delay and a loss of early developmental skills. Menkes Disease is also characterized by seizures, failure to thrive, subnormal body temperature, and strikingly peculiar hair, which is kinky, colorless or steel-colored, and easily broken. There can be extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain. Arteries in the brain can also be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. This can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. Weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in fractures.|$|R
40|$|Hereditary {{haemochromatosis}} is {{a common}} genetic disorder involving dysregulation of iron absorption. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} <b>abnormal</b> iron <b>absorption</b> and metabolism may influence the status of other important trace elements. In this study, the effect of abnormal HFE genotypes and associated iron overload on the status of other trace elements was examined. Dietary data and blood samples were collected from 199 subjects (mean age = 55. 4 years; range = 21 - 81 years). Dietary intakes, serum selenium, copper and zinc concentrations and related antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) in subjects with normal HFE genotype (n = 118) were compared to those with abnormal HFE genotype, with both normal iron status (n = 42) and iron overload (n = 39). For most dietary and biochemical variables measured, {{there were no significant differences}} between study groups. Red cell GPx was significantly higher in male subjects with normal genotypes and normal iron status compared to those with abnormal genotypes and normal iron status (P = 0. 03) or iron overload (P = 0. 001). Red cell GPx was also highest in normal women and significantly lower in the abnormal genotype and normal iron group (P = 0. 016), but not in the iron overload group (P = 0. 078). Although it may not be possible to exclude a small effect between the genotype groups on RBC GPx, overall, haemochromatosis genotypes or iron overload did not appear to have a significant effect on selenium, copper or zinc status...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} test should give its answer quickly and require {{little help from}} the patient. Current methods for diagnosis of <b>abnormal</b> fat <b>absorption</b> present problems both with respect to prolonged test duration and dependence upon patient cooperation. Quantitative chemical determination of fecal fat requires that all stools be collected {{for a period of}} at least three days and that the patient maintain a normal dietary intake of fat before and during this period. Iodine- 131 -triolein fecal excretion measurement does not give information any more quickly, since it likewise requires three days of total stool collection. It eliminates the need for normal dietary fat intake, but it demands even more careful stool col lections than the chemical method does, strictly avoiding contamination of feces with urine. Though measurement of blood radioactivity for several hours after oral administration of 131 I-triolein avoids the drawbacks of three-day stool col lections, many investigators have found that this procedure does not give diag nostically reliable evaluation of fat absorption (1 - 3). Several years ago, the author and his co-workers (4) devised a method in which the intestinal absorption of 1311 -triolein was estimated by measuring ex ternally over the abdomen the radioactivity remaining 8 hours after oral ad ministration of labeled fat. This procedure can furnish results in one day. A minimum of stool collection and cooperation by the patient is required. Diag nostic validity is comparable to the fecal excretion method for measuring 131 I triolein absorption. Independent confirmation of our findings has been provided by others using a substantially similar method (5). The present report describes our technique of external abdomen counting and considers its advantages and limitations in detail...|$|R
