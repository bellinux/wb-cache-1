However, unlike the Qantas Boeing 747-400ER, the Singapore <b>Airlines</b> <b>flights</b> were flown with Airbus A340-500 aircraft configured with an all-business class cabin that carried only 100 passengers.|$|R

For example, from the sentence ‘The first commercial <b>airline</b> <b>flight</b> was from St. Petersburg to Tampa in 1914,’ we can learn two or three triples from the relational sentences as: (the first commercial <b>airline</b> <b>flight,</b> was from, St. Petersburg), (the first commercial <b>airline</b> <b>flight,</b> was to, Tampa), (the first commercial <b>airline</b> <b>flight,</b> was in, 1914) [25]. Trying to address this issue, Akbik and Löser [35] present an initial stage work performing the extraction of n-ary relations based on heuristic rules applied to sentences POS tagged and dependency parsed.

5|$|Few crashes {{have been}} {{attributed}} to design flaws of the 747. The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the Japan <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 123 and China <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. United <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 811, which suffered an explosive decompression mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military global positioning system (GPS) for civilian use.|$|E
5|$|Four {{passenger}} airliners {{operated by}} two major U.S. passenger air carriers (United Airlines and American Airlines) — {{all of which}} departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for California — were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes, American <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 11 and United <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story towers collapsed, with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex, including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia, leading to a partial collapse of the building's western side. The fourth plane, United <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 93, was initially steered toward Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. 9/11 was the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers {{in the history of}} the United States, with 343 and 72 killed respectively.|$|E

The aircraft was originally introduced into service on 1 April 1994. In addition, the airline operated its last two McDonnell Douglas DC-10 flights on 31 October 2005. One aircraft, JA8543, operated as Japan <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 736 from Hong Kong International Airport to Narita International Airport, touched down at 16:05. Another aircraft, JA8541, operated as Japan <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 952 from Incheon International Airport to Narita International Airport, touched down at 16:37.

The Western Airlines DC-10's crash, however, was due to low visibility and an attempt to land on a closed runway. Ironically, the crash of yet another DC-10, United <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 232, ten years later, restored some of the aircraft's reputation. Despite losing an engine and all flight controls and crash-landing in a huge fireball (which was caught on video by a local news crew), 185 people survived the accident. Experts praised the DC-10's sturdy construction as {{partly responsible for the}} high number of survivors, though the efforts of the crew were primarily responsible.|$|E

In both of those categories, Flight 370 was surpassed 131 days later by Malaysia <b>Airlines</b> <b>Flight</b> 17, another Boeing 777-200ER, which was shot down on 17 July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard.|$|E
