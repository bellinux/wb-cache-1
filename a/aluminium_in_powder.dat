40|$|A slurry-based powder {{process was}} {{developed}} to disperse a high volume fraction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) <b>in</b> <b>aluminium</b> (Al) <b>powders.</b> <b>In</b> this process, Al nanoflake powders with a high surface area were used and the powder surface was modified by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrosol before being mixed with CNTs aqueous dispersion. The PVA modification resulted {{in the formation of}} a hydrophilic membrane on the Al surface, which enhanced the water wettability and makes the surface property of the Al powder more compatible with that of the CNTs. Furthermore, the PVA membrane forms relatively strong bonds with the CNTs and prevent them from agglomeration during subsequent processing. Consequently, a high volume fraction and uniform dispersion of up to 10 vol CNTs was achieved in the Al nanoflake powders...|$|R

40|$|An aluminum-alloyed coating {{was applied}} {{onto the surface}} of {{magnesium}} alloy AZ 91 D. The coating formed <b>in</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> at 420 degrees C is rich in the beta (Mg 17 Al 12) phase. Polarisation curve, AC impedance, salt immersion and salt spray were carried out to investigate the corrosion behaviour and assess the corrosion performance of the coated magnesium alloy. It was found that a coated AZ 91 D specimen was much more corrosion resistant and harder than an uncoated one. The improved corrosion resistance was mainly ascribed to the high volume fraction of beta phase in the coating. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Composites type B were produced by {{two levels of}} fibers (Equisetum telmateia), 15 and 25 %, three levels of silica fume gel, 0, 7 and 10 % and three levels of fly ash, 0, 20 and 30 %.

40|$|Alex’, an {{ultrafine}} aluminium powder, burns {{more rapidly}} than conventional <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> <b>in</b> energetic materials. In TNT-based formulations, the increased rate of energy release leads to higher detonation pressures and velocities. In {{order to determine the}} rate of Alex combustion in solid explosives, and to further assess its effects on the detonation properties of TNT formulations, aquarium tests and detonation front curvature tests were performed on Tritonal variants. The aquarium tests definitively show that Alex combustion in detonating Tritonal is significantly faster than that of Cap 45 a, the conventional aluminium powder used for military explosives. Additional pressure and velocity measurements from the aquarium tests agree with previous experiments. The results of detonation front measurements were less conclusive, but show qualitive trends that support existing data...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium {{oxide layer}} on {{aluminium}} particles cannot be avoided. However, {{to make the}} metal-metal contacts possible, this sintering barrier has to be overcome in some way, necessarily to form sintering necks and their development. It is postulated that the disruption of alumina layer under sintering conditions may originate physically and chemically. Additionally, to sinter successfully non alloyed <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> <b>in</b> nitrogen, the operation of both types mechanism is required. It is to be noted that metallic aluminium surface has {{to be available to}} initiate reactions between aluminium and the sintering atmosphere, i. e. mechanical disruption of alumina film precedes the chemical reactions, and only then chemically induced mechanisms may develop. Dilatometry, gravimetric and differential thermal analyses, and microstructure investigations were used to study the sintering response of aluminium at 620 °C in nitrogen, which is the only sintering atmosphere producing shrinkage...|$|R
40|$|Ti-Al {{intermetallic}} coatings on titanium {{have been}} produced by laser surface alloying. A 5 -kW CO 2 laser was employed to melt {{the surface of the}} titanium specimens and to alloy it with <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> <b>in</b> a nitrogen atmosphere. The combination of titanium, aluminium and nitrogen and the specific characteristics of the high-power laser allow a new coating structure of titanium aluminides and nitrides to be produced. These coatings present a surface Al-TiAl 3 composition that gradually evolves to Ti 3 Al close to the titanium base. A dendrite structure of titanium nitrides (TiN and Ti 2 N) and titanium aluminium nitrides (Ti 2 AlN) is formed throughout the laser track.

40|$|High density Fe[sub 3]Al was {{produced}} through {{transient liquid phase}} sintering, using rapid heating rates of greater than 150 K min[sup - 1] and a mixture of prealloyed and elemental powders. Prealloyed Fe[sub 2]Al[sub 5]/FeAl[sub 2] (50 Fe/ 50 Al, wt-%) powder was added to elemental iron <b>powder</b> <b>in</b> a ratio appropriate for producing an overall Fe[sub 3]Al (13 • 87 wt-%) ratio. The heating rate, sintering time, sintering temperature, green density and powder particle size were controlled during the study. Heating rate, sintering time and powder particle size had the most significant influence upon the sintered density of the compacts. The highest sintered density of 6 • 12 Mg m[sup - 3] (92 % of the theoretical density for Fe 3 Al) was achieved after 15 minutes of sintering at 1350 °C, using a 250 K min[sup - 1] heating rate, 1 - 6 μm Fe powders and 5 • 66 μm alloy powders. SEM microscopy suggests that agglomerated Fe[sub 2]Al[sub 5]/ FeAl[sub 2] particles, which form a liquid during sintering, are responsible for {{a significant portion of}} the remaining porosity in high sintered density compacts, creating stable pores, larger than 100 μm diameter, after melting. High density was achieved by minimising the Kirkendall porosity formed during heating by unbalanced diffusion and solubility between the iron and Fe[sub 2]Al[sub 5]/FeAl[sub 2] components. The lower diffusion rate of <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> the prealloyed <b>powder</b> into the iron compared with elemental <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> iron, coupled with a fast heating rate, is expected to permit minimal iron-aluminium interdiffusion during heating so that when a liquid forms the <b>aluminium</b> dissolves <b>in</b> the iron to promote solidification at a lower aluminium content. This leads to a further reduction in porosity...|$|R
30|$|After the {{synthesis}} {{of different types of}} zeolites <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> form, bare biosensor surfaces were modified by drop-coating of zeolites and creatinine deiminase (CD) was adsorbed on this layer. The sensitivities of the obtained biosensors to 1  mM creatinine decreased in the order of BEA-Gold[*]>[*]BEA[*]>[*]Nano BEA[*]>[*]Silicalite[*]>[*]GA. The highest sensitivity belongs to BEA-Gold, having threefold increase compared to GA, which {{can be attributed to the}} presence of gold nanoparticle causing favourable microenvironment for CD to avoid denaturation as well as increased surface area. BEA zeolites, having <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> their framework, regardless of particle size, gave higher responses than silicalite, which has no <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> its structure. These results suggest that ISFET biosensor responses to creatinine can be tailored and enhanced upon carefully controlled alteration of zeolite parameters used to modify electrode surfaces.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) is an {{additive}} manufacturing technique, {{which can be}} used to produce solid components from a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model. The LMD process makes use of feeding powder, which is supported by the shielding gas, into the melt pool that is produced by sharply focused collimated laser beam on the substrate. This study employs <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> <b>in</b> its molten state on titanium substrate through the LMD process. The aluminium powder was deposited at varying laser scanning speeds while the laser power and gas flow rate were kept constant. The presence of alpha phase grains were observed in the microstructures of samples at a lower scanning speed and the beta phase grains at a higher laser scanning speed. It was found that the geometrical properties of the deposits, that is; the width, height and the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) of each sample decreased as the scan speed increases resulting from the laser-material interaction. The microhardness and the corrosion rates of each sample increased as the laser scanning speed increases...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{graphene}} nanoplatelets {{have attracted}} considerable research interest in all fields of science {{due to their}} unique properties. Their excellent mechanical properties lead it {{to be used in}} nano-composites for strength enhancement. Though CNT/Al composites are widely investigated, uniform dispersion of CNTs is still a big challenge for the researchers,which prohibits its use in practical applications. Graphene nanoplatelets(GNPs) can be dispersed in all kinds of solvents and matrices easily as compared to CNTs. Our novel nano-processing route is free of ball milling. As ball milling is considered a big problem because it produces heat, which can burn powder easily and damage the structure of GNPs or CNTs as well. Therefore, our method can be an alternative of ball milling and it has a great potential for the synthesis of Al based matrix nano-composite which is considered good for engineering applications. In this paper, Al- 0. 5 wt. % GNPs composite powders were successfully produced free from dispersion problems associated with GNPs. The SEM analysis of the as-produced composite powders indicate that the GNPs <b>in</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> is quite well dispersed. The effect of GNPs on the hardness of the composite was evaluated by Vickers hardnes...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> food can have different causes. Thus, for example, {{it can be}} due to natural contents in certain food ingredients or aluminium-containing additives. Another source can be the transfer of aluminium from food packaging, cooking utensils, or kitchen equipment etc. Below, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) assesses <b>aluminium</b> contents <b>in</b> baby food {{with regard to their}} potential health effects. The trigger for the BfR opinion was a British study which measured <b>aluminium</b> contents <b>in</b> infant food. In addition to that data, the BfR drew on <b>aluminium</b> contents <b>in</b> baby food which had been made available by the supervisory authorities of the federal states. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has inferred a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg of aluminium per kg of body weight. The analysis of the available data on <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> infant food shows that both the use of baby food <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> form which is then mixed with drinking water and the use of ready-to-eat liquid food can lead to a situation where the TWI value is reached or even exceeded. However, the toxicological concept used - referring to the TWI - only has limited informative value for the health assessment of infant food, since the TWI value does not apply to babies under the age of 12 weeks. So far, however, there has been no scientific evidence to sug-gest that aluminium intake levels resulting from the consumption of infant food are harmful to the health of babies.

It has been established well that aluminium powder can be appropriately used for foaming of traditional concrete. Reaction between aluminium powder and alkali activator in geopolymers of this study caused high porous structures based on the weight ratios of constituent materials. Different specimens were made by changing sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, and alkali activator to fly ash weight ratios. Fly ash was substituted by aluminium powder with 1. 5, 3. 0 and 5. 0 wt. % in different mixtures. Results indicated that substituting of 5. 0 wt. % of fly ash by <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> <b>in</b> the specimens with alkali activator to fly ash weight ratio of 0. 35 and sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide weight ratio of 2. 5 causes the best foamed specimen with the lowest density.

Finally, SEM analysis was conducted to evaluate the microstructure of successfully aerated geopolymer.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} possible neurotoxic effects <b>in</b> {{groups of}} <b>aluminium</b> pot room and foundry workers, aluminium welders, {{and a small}} group of workers exposed to <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> the production of flake powder.  METHODS—Exposure to aluminium was evaluated with <b>aluminium</b> concentrations <b>in</b> blood and urine as well as a questionnaire. The groups exposed to aluminium were compared with a group of mild steel welders. Neurotoxic effects were studied with mood and symptom questionnaires and several psychological and neurophysiological tests.  RESULTS—The pot room and foundry workers showed very low aluminium uptake as their <b>aluminium</b> concentrations <b>in</b> blood and urine were close to normal, and no effects on the nervous system were detected. The group of workers exposed to flake powder had high concentrations of <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> blood and urine, even higher than those of the aluminium welders. However, aluminium could not be shown to affect the functioning of the nervous system <b>in</b> flake <b>powder</b> producers. Although significant effects could not be shown in the present analysis of the data on welders, the performance of the welders exposed to high concentrations of aluminium was affected according to the analyses in the original paper from this group.  CONCLUSIONS—For the pot room and foundry workers no effects related to the exposure to aluminium could be found. For the group of flake powder producers exposed for a short term no effects on the nervous systems were evident despite high levels of exposure. Due to the high concentrations of <b>aluminium</b> <b>in</b> the biological samples of this group, measures to reduce the exposure to aluminium are recommended, as effects on the central nervous system might develop after protracted exposures. However, this assumption needs to be verified in further studies.    Keywords: aluminium; workers; nervous syste...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether it is possible to detect high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings <b>in</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> workers, which are consistent with early stages of aluminosis. 62 male workers from 8 departments of two plants producing aluminium (Al) powder were investigated using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, lung function analysis, biological monitoring of Al in plasma and urine, chest X-ray, HRCT and immunological tests. Chronic bronchitis was observed in 15 (24. 2 %) of the workers, and four workers (6. 5 %) reported shortness of breath during exercise. HRCT findings in 15 workers (24. 2 %) were characterized by ill-defined centrilobular nodular opacities. Workers with ill-defined centrilobular nodular opacities had a lower vital capacity than workers who had no such HRCT-findings (90. 9 % pred. vs. 101. 8 % pred., p = 0. 01). Biological monitoring in plasma and urine revealed higher internal exposure to Al in affected workers (33. 5 μg/l plasma to 15. 4 μg/l plasma, p = 0. 01) and (340. 5 μg/g creat. to 135. 1 μg/g creat., p = 0. 007). Years of exposure and concentration of aluminum in urine and plasma appear to be the best predictors for HRCT findings. Age and decreased vital capacity show borderline significance. We conclude that aluminosis is still relevant in occupational medicine. With HRCT it is possible to detect early stages of aluminosis and biological monitoring can be used to define workers at high risk. </p...|$|R
