40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{a circular}} double-stranded DNA virus {{belonging to the}} Papovaviridae family. It is the causative agent {{of one of the}} most common sexually transmitted diseases, known as condyloinata acuminata (i. e. genital warts). Some HPV infections can cause neoplasia and are associated with the development of cervical cancers. The most common cancer-inducing type is HPV 16 (associated with 40 - 60 % of cervical tumors). Currently, there is no medical treatment for HPV infection. The objective of this project is to develop a DNA vaccine candidate against HPV 16 infection. A plasmid, L 1 E 7 hpSCA 1, encoding the whole viral capsid protein (L 1) and its oncoprotein (E 7), was constructed. Mutations were introduced to the E 7 gene sequence to reduce its oncogenicity. DNA vaccine was chosen because of its capacity to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in immunized animals. <b>The</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>L</b> 1 E 7 hpSCA 1 plasmid was subjected to animal studies. In vitro immunogenicity tests showed that the vaccine candidate was able to raise virus-neutralizing antibodies and to kill the E 7 -expressing tumor cells (TC- 1). Further experimentation involving testing the tumor development in mice will be performed to verify its functional role in preventing and fighting tumor in the animal model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{stems from}} the ESRC TLRP Learning How to Learn—in Classrooms, Schools and Networks Project, and explores how Assessment for Learning (AfL) relates, conceptually, to {{learning}} how to learn (LHTL). The term LHTL was intended {{to draw attention to}} a primary focus on learning practices, and we have related the processes of AfL to LHTL. A third and more common term 'learning to learn' (L 2 L) has recently come to the fore in the teaching and learning practices of schools. This paper explores the relationships between all three, in three main sections. First, the meaning of the concept LHTL is explored. This is approached initially using the analysis of Dearden, followed by an exploration of the links with other research in the literature on learning. This exploration examines <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>L</b> 2 L and argues against its implication that there is a distinct capacity with generality of application across all forms of learning. The second section considers the ways in which teachers and schools might give more priority to pupils' capacity to LHTL, drawing on some research projects that demonstrate improved pupil outcomes, and hence support the rationale for the emphasis on learning practices. The third section examines the problem of assessing LHTL. An attempt to construct an instrument to assess LHTL did not succeed, but did serve to expose both the practical and the theoretical problems in characterizing pupils as having 'learned how to learn'. The overall conclusion is that emphasis should be placed on practices that have potential to promote autonomy in learning, a common theme in <b>the</b> literature <b>at</b> all levels, and one reflected in our empirical work on teachers' attitudes and practices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Let L 1 be {{a finite}} simple sloop of {{cardinality}} n or the 8 -element sloop. In this paper, we construct a subdirectly irreducible (monolithic) sloop L = 2 ⊗α L 1 of cardinality 2 n, for each n ≥ 8, with n ≡ 2 or 4 (mod 6), {{in which each}} proper homomorphic image is a Boolean sloop. Quackenbush [12] has proved that the variety V (L 1) generated by a finite simple planar sloop L 1 covers the smallest nontrivial subvariety (the class of all Boolean sloops).

40|$|Phytases are enzymes {{capable of}} {{sequentially}} dephosphorylating phytic acid to products of lower chelating capacity and higher solubility, abolishing its inhibitory effect on intestinal mineral absorption. Genetic constructions {{were made for}} expressing two phytases from bifidobacteria in Lactobacillus casei {{under the control of}} a nisin-inducible promoter. L. casei was able of producing, exporting and anchoring to the cell wall the phytase of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. The phytase from Bifidobacterium longum spp. infantis was also produced, although at low levels. L. casei expressing any of these phytases completely degraded phytic acid (2 mM) to lower myo-inositol phosphates when grown in MRS medium. Owing to the general absence of phytase activity in lactobacilli and to the high phytate content of whole grains, <b>the</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>L.</b> casei strains were applied as starter in a bread making process using whole-grain flour. L. casei developed in sourdoughs by fermenting the existing carbohydrates giving place to an acidification. In this food model system the contribution of L. casei strains expressing phytases to phytate hydrolysis was low, and the phytate degradation was mainly produced by activation of the cereal endogenous phytase {{as a consequence of the}} drop in pH. This work shows the capacity of lactobacilli to be modified in order to produce enzymes with relevance in food technology processes. The ability of these strains in reducing the phytate content in fermented food products must be evaluated in further models.
