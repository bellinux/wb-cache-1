By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source. A decade later, the sediment in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality <b>assessment</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Currently, CBTI {{programs}} {{fall into}} one of two categories: actuarial <b>assessment</b> <b>programs</b> or automated <b>assessment</b> <b>programs.</b> Actuarial <b>assessment</b> <b>programs</b> are based on statistical or actuarial prediction (e.g., statistical analyses, linear regression equations and Bayesian rules), which is empirically based while automated <b>assessment</b> <b>programs</b> consist of a series of if-then statements derived by expert clinicians and informed by published research and clinical experience. For the purposes of this article, both types will be referred to as computer-based test interpretations (CBTIs). The use of CBTIs is found in a variety of psychological domains (e.g., clinical interviewing and problem rating), but is most commonly utilized in personality and neuropsychological assessments. [...] This article will focus on the use of CBTIs in personality assessment, most commonly using the MMPI and its subsequent revised editions.|$|R

5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car <b>Assessment</b> <b>Program</b> (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 2006, Biman {{operated}} {{flights to}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, from Dhaka via Brussels. New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses {{to maintain a}} landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain. To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community {{in the north of}} England. On 8 April 2006, Biman's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International Aviation Safety <b>Assessment</b> <b>Program,</b> which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US. A former CAAB assistant director made scathing remarks about the CAAB in an opinion article in the Aviatour, a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine Weekly Holiday. For Biman, this meant that it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or make alterations to its routes, such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.|$|E

The following July, the China New Car <b>Assessment</b> <b>Program</b> (C-NCAP) awarded the Cruze a maximum five stars in their independent crash safety test. The Cruze SE 1.6-liter tested scored a maximum of 16 points in side-impact collision, 14.44 in front-end collision, and 15.73 in the 40percent frontal offset collision. Euro NCAP released its rating in November, with the Chevrolet Cruze again receiving the full five-star grading. While the Cruze scored 96percent for adult protection, and 84percent for child occupant protection, Euro NCAP's figure for pedestrian protection is quoted at significantly lower 34percent. In December 2009, the South Korean-specification Cruze—the Daewoo Lacetti Premiere—received the top rating of five stars from the Korean New Car <b>Assessment</b> <b>Program</b> (KNCAP).

40|$|Sherpa Romeo blue journalThe {{increasing}} {{diversity of}} students in contemporary classrooms and the concomitant increase in large-scale testing programs highlight the importance of developing writing <b>assessment</b> <b>programs</b> that {{are sensitive to the}} challenges of assessing diverse populations. To this end, this paper provides a framework for conducting consequential validity research on large-scale writing <b>assessment</b> <b>programs.</b> It illustrates this validity model through a series of instrumental case studies drawing on the research literature conducted on writing <b>assessment</b> <b>programs</b> in Canada. We derived the cases from a systematic review of the literature published between January 2000 and December 2012 that directly examined the consequences of large-scale writing assessment on writing instruction in Canadian schools. We also conducted a systematic review of the publicly available documentation published on Canadian provincial and territorial government websites that discussed the purposes and uses of their large-scale writing <b>assessment</b> <b>programs.</b> We argue that this model of constructing consequential validity research provides researchers, test developers, and test users with a clearer, more systematic approach to examining the effects of assessment on diverse populations of students.
