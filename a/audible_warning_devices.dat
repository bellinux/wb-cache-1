2500|$|A train horn is a {{powerful}} air horn that serves as an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> on electric and Diesel locomotives. [...] The horn's primary purpose is to alert persons and animals to an oncoming train, especially when approaching a grade crossing. The horn is also used for acknowledging signals given by railroad employees, such as during switching operations.|$|R
5000|$|Light bars - A long but narrow 'strip' {{of lights}} {{on top of}} an {{emergency}} vehicle, which can be configured with almost infinite combinations of different lighting technologies from the list below. These are typically the main source of flashing light for the vehicle, and are used on overt marked emergency vehicles. They can also be divided into sections, with an array of functions (for instance front blue flashing lights, and rear red flashing lights, switched separately). Due {{to the nature of the}} wind resistance encountered by these large units, the majority must be fixed to the car permanently, although some units (usually smaller) are available with either magnetic or suction cup mountings which can be removed. The Light bar may also contain the <b>Audible</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>devices.</b> Some jurisdictions disallow the sale of lightbars to the general public (especially if mandated under state and/or federal law regardless of lens coloring which are not red and blue).|$|E
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} balance monitor and alarm system {{developed}} at NASA Ames Research Center will produce several beneficial results. The costs of wind tunnel delays because of inadvertent balance damage {{and the costs of}} balance repair or replacement can be greatly reduced or eliminated with better real-time information on the balance static and dynamic loading. The wind tunnel itself will have enhanced utility with the elimination of overly cautious limits on test conditions. The microprocessor-based system features automatic scaling and 16 multicolored LED bargraphs to indicate both static and dynamic components of the signals from eight individual channels. Five individually programmable alarm levels are available with relay closures for internal or external visual and <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> and other functions such as automatic activation of external recording devices, model positioning mechanism, or tunnel shutdown...|$|E
40|$|The Energy Systems Laboratory (ESL) at Texas A&M University has {{monitored}} the real-time electrical energy consumption, demand, and power factor {{of a large}} metal fabrication plant in Houston, Texas for twelve months. Monthly reports that present the data in a format that plant personnel find useful are discussed. These reports allow plant personnel to see how power factor correction in conjunction with production retrofits have reduced utility bills despite production capacity increases. The reports have also been useful in detecting maintenance problems and monitoring productivity. A method that allows the calculation of power factor correction savings after correction is discussed. This method requires some power factor versus demand history prior to correction, and is used to determine what the demand {{would have been if}} the correction equipment had not been installed, even if the real demand of the plant changes. Major plant electrical modifications and their impact on a monitoring system are also discussed. Such modifications increase the potential for technical problems with the monitoring equipment and result in hard-to-find problems. A future step to be examined is one that uses visual or <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> in the plant to control demand. At least one plant has adopted this idea in the form of warning lights that inform employees to shut down unnecessary equipment. This concept appears to be potentially beneficial to all plants which have some type of demand monitoring device on-site...|$|E
5000|$|A train whistle or {{air whistle}} (originally {{referred}} to as a steam trumpet) is an audible signaling device on a steam locomotive used to warn that the train is approaching, and to communicate with rail workers. Modern locomotives primarily use a powerful air horn instead of a whistle as an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>device.</b> However, whistle continues to be used by railroaders in the context of audible signaling, such as [...] "whistling off" [...] when a train gets underway.|$|R
50|$|Today {{known as}} <b>audible</b> track <b>warning</b> signals, or <b>audible</b> track <b>warning</b> <b>devices,</b> {{detonators}} {{are used to}} attract the attention of train crews when track repairs or an obstruction are ahead, or when a hand signaller is acting for a signal.|$|R
5000|$|A horn is a sound-making {{device that}} can be {{equipped}} to motor vehicles, buses, bicycles, trains, trams (a.k.a. streetcars in North America), {{and other types of}} vehicles. The sound made usually resembles a [...] "honk". The vehicle operator uses the horn to warn others of the vehicle's approach or presence, or to call attention to some hazard. Motor vehicles, ships and trains are required by law in some countries to have horns. Like trams, trolley cars and streetcars, bicycles are also legally required to have an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> in many areas, but not universally, and not always a horn.|$|R

5000|$|Error codes were {{displayed}} on a two-digit seven-segment display (one of the first seen, and built with lamps rather than LEDs). The range of error codes included not only decimal and hexadecimal digits (as seven-segment displays are commonly used) but also a limited set of other letters; for example, [...] "P3" [...] {{was one of several}} printer error codes. A thick manual that came with the System/3 aided the operator in interpreting the error codes and suggested recovery procedures. The System/3 had no <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>device,</b> so a program that was not printing, reading cards, or causing other obvious activity could halt and the operator would not know it unless he or she happened to look at the status display. Models with the Dual Program Feature had two separate status displays.|$|R

50|$|In 1958, a {{full size}} system was {{successfully}} demonstrated by RCA Labs and the State of Nebraska on a 400-foot strip of public highway just outside Lincoln, Neb. A series of experimental detector circuits {{buried in the}} pavement were a series of lights {{along the edge of}} the road. The detector circuits were able to send impulses to guide the car and determine the presence and velocity of any metallic vehicle on its surface. It was developed in collaboration with General Motors, who paired two standard models with equipment consisting of special radio receivers and <b>audible</b> and visual <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> that were able to simulate automatic steering, accelerating and brake control.|$|R

This system uses a flashing dashboard icon and emits an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> when a white lane marking is being crossed, and emits a louder <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> when a yellow-line marking is crossed. This system is canceled when a turn signal is operating, or by pressing a deactivation {{switch on the}} dashboard; it works by using an optical sensor {{on both sides of}} the car.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|R

5000|$|Steam <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> {{have been}} used on trains since 1833 [...] when George Stephenson invented and {{patented}} a steam trumpet for use on the Leicester and Swannington Railway.Period literature makes a distinction between a steam trumpet and a steam whistle.A copy of the trumpet drawing signed May 1833 shows a device about eighteen inches high with an ever-widening trumpet shape with a six-inch diameter at its top or mouth. It is said that George Stephenson invented his trumpet after an accident on the Leicester and Swannington Railway where a train hit either a cart, or a herd of cows, on a level crossing and there were calls for {{a better way of}} giving a warning. Although no-one was injured, the accident was deemed serious enough to warrant Stephensonâ€™s personal intervention. One account states that driver Weatherburn had `mouthblown his horn' at the crossing in an attempt to prevent the accident, but that no attention had been paid to this <b>audible</b> <b>warning,</b> perhaps because it had not been heard.|$|R
