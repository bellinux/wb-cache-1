500|$|Both {{his parents}} were {{interested}} in natural sciences, and they answered Dawkins's questions in scientific terms. Dawkins describes his childhood as [...] "a normal Anglican upbringing". He embraced Christianity until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that {{the theory of evolution}} was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god. Dawkins states: [...] "the main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a good mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask {{scared the hell out of}} me only because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very quick, like {{right out of the}} gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E

500|$|Director Kim Manners {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not a great show, but a good one. It's {{a lighter}} show. There {{is a lot of}} humor in it, but I think it's a hit with fans because there is some {{wonderful}} Mulder and Scully's relationship stuff. The entire third act is {{just the two of them}} talking, which is actually kind of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That was so much fun, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written really well... It was just neat to have us separated from everything and stuck on this island where we could wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways." [...] Character Dr. Paul Farraday was named after English scientist, Michael Faraday, maybe.|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Night of Your Life" [...] {{was written}} by Cristyle Johnson, Anthony Preston, David Guetta and Giorgio Tuinfort, whilst {{production}} of the song was helmed by Guetta and Tuinfort. In an interview with Akshay Bhansali of MTV News, Guetta revealed {{that he did not}} know Hudson before collaborating on the song, saying, [...] "I had heard her voice [...] and I fell in love with it. It's a difficult song. You need a really big voice to be able to perform that song. I was like, 'Whoa!' She obviously has an amazing voice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a really interesting exercise for her and for me." [...] Guetta further explained that when he collaborates with artists, he likes to [...] "take them out of their boxes", and creating a dance record with Hudson was [...] "really exciting" [...] for him. On working with Hudson, he said, [...] "She is beautiful in every way: as a person, as a singer, as a human being. She delivered [...] like crazy." [...] "Night of Your Life" [...] was released for digital download on August 22, 2011, as the third and final promotional single from the album, as part of the iTunes Store's countdown to the album's release.|$|E

500|$|Actress Natalie Dormer, who {{was cast}} to play Queen Margaery Tyrell in the show's second season, also made her final {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member for the series. In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E
500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Australia cricket team toured Bangladesh in August and September 2017 to play two Test matches. It was Australia's {{first tour}} to Bangladesh since 2011.

Following the win, Bangladesh's captain Mushfiqur Rahim said [...] "It's a great feeling beating Australia, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great effort by the boys". Australia's Steve Smith said [...] "I think they're a {{dangerous}} side, particularly here at home". Australia won the second Test by 7 wickets, therefore drawing the series 1–1.|$|E

2500|$|After Griffith's death, Howard stated: [...] "His love of creating, the joy {{he took in}} it {{whether it}} was drama or comedy or his music, was inspiring to grow up around.

It was an amazing environment. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a reflection of the way he felt about having the opportunity to create something that people could enjoy. It was always with respect and passion for the opportunity and really what it could offer people in a very unpretentious and earthy way. He felt he was always working in service of an audience he really respected and cared about. He was a great influence on me. His passing is sad. But he lived a great rich life." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Radio London {{closed down}} on 14 August 1967, John Peel joined the BBC's new pop music station, BBC Radio 1, which began {{broadcasting}} the following month. Unlike Big L, Radio 1 {{was not a}} full-time station, but a hybrid of recorded music and live studio orchestras. Peel recalled, [...] "I {{was one of the}} first lot on Radio 1 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> mainly because ... Radio 1 had no real idea what they were doing so they had to take people off the pirate ships because there wasn't anybody else." [...] Peel presented a programme called Top Gear. At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs (Pete Drummond and Tommy Vance were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of Top Gear; he continued to present the show until it ended in 1975. Peel played an eclectic mix of the music that caught his attention, which he would continue to do throughout his career.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Bell's {{programming}} {{gave the}} song its [...] "militaristic mode", which further conveys {{the sense of}} mission expressed in the lyrics. Björk had recorded the vocals, bass line and chord structure of [...] "Hunter" [...] before Bell met her in Spain; he recorded the beats in one take after she had explained to him how she wanted them to sound like. In an interview with Sweater, Björk said: [...] "It amazes me that people still can't grasp that live element of it." [...] Regarding {{the beat of the}} song, engineer Markus Dravs stated it [...] "is very much a Mark Bell beat interpretation of her. The idea of it being a Boleric beat was hers, but we tried different versions <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Mark in the end {{who came up with the}} idea of just doing it on a 909. Then we all had a go on the filtering and played around with the decay of each individual drum." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Bauhaus {{released}} {{their first}} new studio album since 1983, Go Away White (Cooking Vinyl). It marked the band's {{end and the}} album had no promotional tour. In late 2007, Kevin Haskins said [...] "We were getting along really well, {{but there was an}} incident that occurred", and added that as a result, [...] "Some of us just felt that we didn't want to carry on as a working unit". In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he [...] "was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable", but in the end, [...] "that rocky character worked <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a bit right to finish it, really". The same year, David J commented on the breakup: [...] "You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, and it starts to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That's my answer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} later {{described}} by one journalist as [...] "the most pompous, overblown British rock {{record of the}} decade." [...] Anderson has said that its overblown sound was down to his use of psychedelic drugs. [...] "I was doing {{an awful lot of}} acid at the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> this that gave us the confidence to push boundaries." [...] Anderson has said that he thrived on the surreal environment he lived in at the time; next door were a sect known as the Mennonites, who would often sing hymns during Anderson's drug binges. After the success of their debut album, Suede were hailed as the inventors of Britpop, something they were proud of for a short while. However, Britpop started to be dominated by the [...] "big four", who along with Suede, were Blur, Oasis and Pulp. This disgusted Anderson, who called Britpop [...] "horribly twisted, a musical Carry On film", and he began to distance himself from the scene. [...] "We {{could not have been more}} uninterested in that whole boozy, cartoon-like, fake working-class thing." [...] the singer said in 2008, [...] "As soon as we became aware of it, we went away and wrote Dog Man Star. You could not find a less Britpop record. It's tortured, epic, extremely sexual and personal. None of those things apply to Britpop." ...|$|E
2500|$|... you ask who Mr. Millard is {{and what}} reason lies in his {{prejudice}} against Missions in general.

You have probably seen his articles {{in some of the}} magazines of America – Scribners or Cosmopolitan. These reporters come through Japan where there is a strong prejudice against Christianity, especially in newspaper circles, and then they stop a few days among the clubs in Shanghai where they are filled with all the yarns about missionaries. I have known of three or four who have admitted that they came north with prejudices against missionaries and that they vanished on acquaintance with our Peking and Tung Chou people.
