40|$|We {{report the}} results of an XMM-Newton {{observation}} of Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> and its surroundings. The X-ray spectrum of Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> is well represented with a two-temperature plasma model with temperatures of ~ 1 and ~ 4 keV. Only the iron abundance shows clear spatial variation; it concentrates in the core of Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East.</b> The derived plasma parameters suggest that Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> originated in <b>a</b> single supernova. Around Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East,</b> there is <b>a</b> broad distribution of hard X-ray emission with a superimposed soft excess component extending away from the location of Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> both above and below the plane. We discuss the nature of these structures as well as the close vicinity of Sgr A*.

5|$|Male elands {{and female}} greater kudus {{can produce a}} viable male hybrid, {{though it is not}} known if it is sterile. An {{accidental}} crossing of <b>an</b> <b>east</b> African common eland (T. o. pattersonianus) with <b>an</b> <b>east</b> African kudu (T. s. bea) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was sterile, which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic (Bos primigenius) and zebu cows (Bos indicus) have also produced sterile hybrids. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.|$|E

40|$|VLA {{observations}} of the Sgr A complex at 90 cm, 20 cm, and 6 cm are combined to obtain spectral index and optical depth distributions across the source and are used to constrain the three-dimensional structure at the Galactic center. At 90 cm the 'spiral' structure of the thermal source Sgr A West is clearly seen in absorption against the nonthermal emission of Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East,</b> showing conclusively that the former {{is in front of}} the latter. The entire shell of Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> shows <b>a</b> low-frequency turnover corresponding to an optical depth of 1 - 2. This turnover corresponds to free-free absorption with an emission measure of about 100, 000 pc/cm exp 6 if the electron temperature is about 5000 K. The approximately 7 arcmin halo surrounding Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> and West also shows a low-frequency turnover. It is suggested that the halo contains a mixture of thermal and nonthermal gas and that the thermal component is responsible for the absorption extending across Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East...</b>|$|R

40|$|We present Very Large Array (VLA) radio {{interferometry}} {{observations of the}} 1720 MHz OH masers in the Galactic Center (GC). Most 1720 MHz OH masers arise in regions where the supernova remnant Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> is interacting with the interstellar medium. The majority of the newly found 1720 MHz OH masers are located to the northeast, independently indicating and confirming an area of shock interaction with the + 50 km/s molecular cloud (M- 0. 02 - 0. 07) {{on the far side}} of Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East.</b> The previously known bright masers in the southeast are suggested to be the result of the interaction between two supernova remnants, instead of between Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> and the surrounding molecular clouds as generally found elsewhere in the Galaxy. Together with masers north of the circumnuclear disk (CND) they outline an interaction on the near side of Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East.</b> In contrast to the interaction between the + 50 km/s cloud and Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East,</b> OH absorption data do not support a direct interaction between the CND material and Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East.</b> We also present three new high-negative velocity masers, supporting a previous single detection. The location and velocities of the high-negative and high-positive velocity masers are consistent with being near the tangent points of, and physically located in the CND. We argue that the high velocity masers in the CND are pumped by dissipation between density clumps in the CND instead of a shock generated by the supernova remnant. That is, the CND masers are not coupled to the supernova remnant and are sustained independently. Comment: accepted to ApJ, 9 pages 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Maps of the Galactic electron-positron {{annihilation}} radiation show evidence for three distinct and significant features: (1) a central bulge source, (2) emission in the Galactic plane, and (3) an enhancement of emission at positive latitudes above the Galactic Center. In this paper, we explore {{the possibility that}} Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East,</b> <b>a</b> very prominent radio structure surrounding the Galactic nucleus, may be a significant contributer to the central bulge feature. The motivation for doing so stems from a recently proposed link between this radio object and the EGRET gamma-ray source 2 EG J 1746 - 2852. If this association is correct, then Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> {{is also expected to}} be a source of copious positron production. The results presented here show that indeed Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> must have produced a numerically significant population of positrons, but also that most of them have not yet had sufficient time to thermalize and annihilate. As such, Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> by itself does not appear to be the dominant current source of {{annihilation radiation}}, but it will be when the positrons have cooled sufficiently and they have become thermalized. This raises the interesting possibility that the bulge component may be due to the relics of earlier explosive events like the one that produced Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East.</b> Comment: This manuscript was prepared with the AAS Latex macros v 4. 0 It is 37 pages long and has 16 figure...|$|R
40|$|Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> is <b>a</b> {{supernova}} remnant {{located within}} few parsecs from the Galactic Centre (GC). There {{are good reasons}} {{to believe that this}} object {{is the source of the}} gamma-ray excess detected by HESS in the direction of the GC meaning that Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> is likely to be an efficient Cosmic Ray accelerator. Some observations suggest that strong magnetic fields may be present in that region allowing the acceleration of composite nuclei in Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> beyond the EeV. We show that, if this is case, EeV neutrons should be effectively produced by the photo-disintegration of Ultra High Energy nuclei onto the IR photon background (with temperature ∼ 40 K) in which Sgr <b>A</b> <b>East</b> is embedded. Neutrons with such an energy can reach the Earth before decaying and may be detectable under the form of a CR point-like excess in the direction of the GC. We determine the expected energy spectrum and the amplitude of this signal showing that it may be measurable by the AUGER observatory. Comment: 26 pages, 7 figures.
