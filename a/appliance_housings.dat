40|$|Glassy polymers, such as {{polystyrene}} (PS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC), {{are common}} engineering polymers that have found uses in consumer products ranging from portable computers and optical lenses, to automotive components and <b>appliance</b> <b>housings.</b> PMMA and PS are typically {{considered to be}} brittle polymers, since they fail in a brittle manner under low triaxiality conditions, such as under uniaxial tension. Polycarbonate {{is considered to be}} a more ductile polymer than PMMA and PS, since it will deform plastically under uniaxial tension. However, PC does exhibit brittle behavior under certain loading conditions, such as low temperatures, high strain rates, or highly (tensile) triaxial stress states. A technique used for reducing the brittleness (increasing the fracture toughness) of glassy polymers is rubber-toughening. The technology of rubber-toughening, which involves blending a small volume fraction (5 - 20 %) of rubber particles with the homopolymer, has been used commercially since the 1940 s, and has been of major importance to the plastics industry. The technology of rubber-toughening is qualitatively well understood, but quantitative tools to study the material response are still at an early stage of development. The purpose of this thesis is to develop numerical tools to investigate the mechanical behavior of rubber-toughened glassy polymers, with emphasis on rubber-toughened PC. To this end, several tools are developed. (cont.) Three-dimensional micromechanical models of the heterogeneous microstructure are developed to study the effects of particle volume fraction on the underlying elastic visco-plastic deformation mechanisms in the material, and how these mechanisms influence the macroscopic [continuum-level] response of the material. A continuum-level constitutive model is developed for the homogenized large-strain elastic-viscoplastic behavior of the material. The model is calibrated against micromechanical modeling results for rubber-toughened polycarbonate. The constitutive model is used to study boundary value problems such as notched tensile bars, where a multi-scale modeling approach enables assessment of failure due to local stress and strain levels in the material. The results are compared to experimental studies to establish correlations between the continuum-level response of the material, and observed failure mechanisms in the material. by Mats Danielsson.

40|$|In many {{manufacturing}} {{areas such}} as the automotive industry (outer panels, inner panels, stiffeners etc [...] .), the packaging industry (petfood containers, beverage cans etc [...] .) and the household <b>appliances</b> industry (<b>housings</b> etc [...] .), the control of the thinning variations in sheet metal forming process is a major point to study in order to ameliorate the final quality of the produced parts. In this framework, several bulge tests have been developed in order to study the thinning phenomenon during sheet metal forming processes. In this presentation, measurement of the thickness of the deformed specimens has been done using the ImageAnalyser software (based on an image analysis technique) developed by the CMAO research group in the LGP. The AISI 304 L stainless steel has been selected as the tested material. Both a cylindrical and an elliptical die allowing the analysis of the thickness variation versus the load ratio and the anisotropy of sheet have been used in this work. In a second part of this communication, we present a numerical model based on the Hill 1948 anisotropic material model. The numerical results are discussed and compared with the experiments...|$|R
