5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} concept of {{positive}} perfectionism as a misnomer that negatively impacts adolescent students.

Primarily a deleterious construct, perfectionism has been strongly associated with psychopathology. The author would like to offer perfectionism as a multidimensional construct that is ultimately maladaptive and harmful. Additionally, the author recommends replacing the term positive perfectionism with the more accurate concept of striving for excellence.

Multisensory applications that integrate tactile and audio stimuli can provide to individuals with blindness valuable information associated with the structure {{and the content of}} space. Low cost haptic devices can significantly contribute in this direction. The present study examines the spatial knowledge that individuals with blindness may build by studying an audio-haptic map of a multisensory application, through the use of the low cost haptic device Novint Falcon. Ten adults with blindness (totally blind or only light perception) took part in the research. The age ranged from 19 years to 46 years. Participants managed to build significant spatial knowledge using the multisensory application. More specifically, rich cognitive maps were observed. The results reveal the usefulness of similar <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>individuals</b> with blindness...|$|R
