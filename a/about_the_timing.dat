Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins {{have resorted to}} the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may tell us whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, we still don't know whether they actually spoke.

In 1998, one research team used the size of the hypoglossal canal in the base of fossil skulls in an attempt to estimate the relative number of nerve fibres, claiming on this basis that Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neanderthals had more fine-tuned tongue control than either australopithecines or apes. Subsequently, however, it was demonstrated that hypoglossal canal size and nerve sizes are not correlated, and it is now accepted that such evidence is uninformative <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> of human speech evolution.|$|E

The front line was relatively short: it stretched from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, near El Alamein railway station, to the effectively impassable Qattara Depression in the south, a distance of only about 30 miles. It was therefore clear to the enemy that the attack must come in this space, and since the only road was in the north, surprise and full-scale attack in any other location might have been thought unlikely. The deceptions were planned to make the enemy believe that the attack would take place to the south, far from the coast road and railway, and about two days later than the real attack.|$|E

500|$|After {{the notice}} was reactivated, {{detailed}} planning recommenced (essentially from scratch). Changes {{made to the}} organisation of the force approved ten years earlier were only minor. After many years of notice, there was still skepticism that the deployment would ever occur. The government and army were cautious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> of the commitment of funds; significant funding was only released in late 1988, {{a few months before}} deployment. The squadron's equipment deficiencies were valued at $16million, and there was a need to buy $700,000 of equipment immediately. The UN initially estimated the cost of the entire operation at $US1billion, equivalent to its own budget. The reluctance to commit funds ultimately reduced training of the deployed forces; Senator Jo Vallentine said in Parliament that the Namibia operation nearly fell apart {{due to a lack of}} advance funding, and Senator Jocelyn Newman called it disgraceful. The UN General Assembly did not approve the UNTAG budget until 1 March 1989, less than two weeks before the advance party deployed and after the deployment of the start-up team. Gration authorised Operation Picaresque on 3 March 1989. In addition to a lack of funds, there was little intelligence on Namibia; the region was [...] "generally unknown to the Australian public, the policy-makers and to the troops and civilians who deployed there".|$|E
