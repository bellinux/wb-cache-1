5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} several variables that individuals bring into a marriage enrichment program {{and their relationship}} to the direction and degree of change experienced. Several variables were identified in the literature that could influence the kinds of change an individual experiences: personality type, relationship style, sex, incoming relationship strength, and incoming expectations. There were 116 individuals (58 couples) who participated in one of three weekend marriage enrichment seminars involving 12 hours of actual instruction. ^ The study utilized a pre-, post-, and one-month follow-up design to test the null hypotheses: (a) there will be no significant difference in personality types of individuals who volunteer for a marriage enrichment program when compared to a norm group; there will be no significant relationship between (b) incoming personality types <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the treatment; (c) incoming relationship styles <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the treatment; (d) sex <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the treatment; (e) incoming marital strength <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the treatment; <b>and</b> (f) incoming expectations <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the treatment. ^ The personality type preferences of the participants was determined by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The relationship style was determined by the Relationship Style Inventory (RSI). The incoming relationship strength was determined by both the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) and the Marital Happiness Scale (MHS). The DAS and MHS were also used at posttest and follow-up to determine the direction and degree of change. The participant 2 ̆ 7 s level of incoming expectations was determined by the Oliver Expectations Inventory (OEI). ^ The results indicated (a) {{a significant difference in the}} personality types that volunteered for the marriage enrichment seminar compared to the norm group; (b) a significant relationship between incoming relationship styles <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the treatment; <b>and</b> (c) no significant relationship between personality type and treatment, sex <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> treatment, incoming relationship strength <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> treatment, <b>and</b> incoming level of expectations <b>and</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> treatment. One additional finding was that the program had a significant effect across time regardless of incoming subject variables. ...|$|R

5|$|Plant ecology is {{the science}} of the {{functional}} relationships between plants and their habitats—the environments where they complete their life cycles. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists. This information can relay {{a great deal of}} information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it has changed over that time. The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> environmental change.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of a {{substantial}} MoD file {{on the subject}} led to claims of a cover-up; some interpreted this {{as part of a}} larger pattern of information suppression concerning the true nature of unidentified flying objects, by both the United States and British governments. However, when the file was released in 2001 it turned out to consist mostly of internal correspondence <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> inquiries from the public. The lack of any in-depth investigation in the publicly released documents is consistent with the MoD's earlier statement that they never took the case seriously. Included in the released files is an explanation given by defence minister Lord Trefgarne as to why the MoD did not investigate further.|$|E
25|$|The {{sustained}} {{selection for}} lowered reactivity among mammal domesticates {{has resulted in}} profound changes in brain form and function. The larger {{the size of the}} brain to begin with and the greater its degree of folding, the greater the degree of brain-size reduction under domestication. Foxes that had been selectively bred for tameness over 40 years had experienced a significant reduction in cranial height and width and by inference in brain size, which supports the hypothesis that brain-size reduction is an early response to the selective pressure for tameness and lowered reactivity that is the universal feature of animal domestication. The most affected portion of the brain in domestic mammals is the limbic system, which in domestic dogs, pigs, and sheep show a 40% reduction in size compared with their wild species. This portion of the brain regulates endocrine function that influences behaviors such as aggression, wariness, <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> environmentally induced stress, all attributes which are dramatically affected by domestication.|$|E
500|$|During the attack, {{there were}} several delays between events <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> them.

[...] It took another two hours to mobilise the auxiliary patrol boats, which did not leave their anchorage for a further hour. [...] Part of these delays was {{due to a lack}} of effective communications. [...] None of the auxiliary patrol craft in the harbour had radio communications, so all instructions and reports came from signal lights via the Port War Signal Station or Garden Island, or by physical communication via launches. [...] In Muirhead-Gould's preliminary report on the attack, he stated that the Port War Signal Station was not designed for the volume of communications traffic the attack caused. Telephone communications with Garden Island were unreliable during the early part of the attack, and then the first torpedo explosion disabled them completely.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, the Mohawks of Kanesatake confronted the {{government}} about its failure to honour Indigenous land claims and recognize traditional Mohawk territory in Oka, Quebec. Referred to by media outlets as the Oka Crisis, the land dispute sparked a critical discussion about the Canadian government's complacency regarding relations with Indigenous communities <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> their concerns. The action prompted then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to underscore four government responsibilities: [...] "resolving land claims; improving {{the economic and social}} conditions on reserves; defining a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and governments; and addressing the concerns of Canada's aboriginal peoples in contemporary Canadian life." [...] The actions of the Mohawk community members led to, in part, along with objections from Indigenous leaders regarding the Meech Lake Accord, the creation of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples to examine the status of Indigenous peoples in Canada. In 1996, the Royal Commission presented a final report which first included a vision for meaningful and action-based reconciliation.|$|E
500|$|Its {{name and}} {{platform}} change were officially announced at E3 2013, with further trailers showcasing the game concept released later. The 2013 trailer was again a concept piece consisting mostly of CGI rather than actual gameplay footage. Staff later stated that XV had been announced and displayed too early. The game's next official appearance {{was made at}} TGS 2014, with the announcement of its commercial demo, and a tech demo showing off the game's engine. After its reappearance, regular livestreamed shows called [...] "Active Time Reports" [...] (ATR) were broadcast, giving updates to the game <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> fan questions. According to Tabata, the ATRs were created to help fans left confused by the game's change of platform and title, along with establishing a two-way communication with the fanbase. During 2015, official forums were created to allow the developers to receive direct feedback from fans. Starting from February 12, the Japanese forums were discontinued and replaced with a developer's blog. Their stated reason was to offer a more accessible medium for both feedback and developer updates.|$|E
500|$|From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC {{operated}} {{a de facto}} ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering {{her to be a}} [...] "second-rater" [...] whose work was without literary merit. The children's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton's books to [...] "slow poison", and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out [...] "mediocre material", noting that [...] "her capacity to do so amounts to genius... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago". Michael Rosen, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that [...] "I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books." [...] The children's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the [...] "drip, drip, drip of disapproval" [...] associated with the books. Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from [...] "stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books".|$|E
