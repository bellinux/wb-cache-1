5000|$|The first {{advance in}} the {{treatment}} of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> came in November 1960, when Dr. Jose Ramirez-Rivera at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Baltimore applied repeated [...] "segmental flooding" [...] as a means of physically removing the accumulated alveolar material.|$|E
50|$|The {{autosomal}} dominant syndrome associated with monocytopenia, B and NK cell lymphopenia and mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections (abbreviated MonoMAC) {{is a rare}} genetic disorder first described by Vihn and colleagues in 2010 and is associated with myelodysplasia, cytogenetic abnormalities, pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> and myeloid leukemias. Multiple mutations in the GATA2 {{are considered to be}} responsible for this syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} form of human nocardial disease is a slowly {{progressive}} pneumonia, the common symptoms of which include cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and fever. It is not uncommon for this infection to spread to the pleura or chest wall. Pre-existing pulmonary disease, especially pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis,</b> increases the risk of contracting a Nocardia pneumonia. Every organ can be affected if a systemic spread takes place.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of LPI {{consists}} of protein-restricted diet and supplementation with oral citrulline. Citrulline is a neutral amino acid that improves {{the function of}} the urea cycle and allows sufficient protein intake without hyperammonemia. Under proper dietary control and supplementation, the majority of the LPI patients are able to have a nearly normal life. However, severe complications including pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> and renal insufficiency may develop even with proper treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Sargramostim is {{primarily}} used for myeloid reconstitution after autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. It {{is also used}} to treat neutropenia induced by chemotherapy during the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Sargramostim has recently shown promise in treating Crohn's disease and other GI inflammatory disorders. This medication is being investigated in trials to treat autoimmune pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> (PAP). [...] It is also being investigated in combination with oncolytic reovirus in brain cancer.|$|E
50|$|The major {{signs of}} indium lung are {{pulmonary}} <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> and pulmonary fibrosis. Symptoms include dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough, and increased sputum production. Hemoptysis {{has also been}} seen in people with indium lung. Other symptoms seen in some but not all cases include digital clubbing, low DLCO (capacity to move oxygen from the alveoli into the blood), and lowered forced expiratory volume. Emphysema {{has been associated with}} indium lung, but may not be part of the syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> (PAP) {{is a rare}} {{lung disease}} in which {{abnormal}} accumulation of pulmonary surfactant occurs within the microscopic air sacs in the lung, interfering {{with the ability to}} exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide from the blood. PAP can occur in a primary form or secondarily in the settings of certain cancers (such as myeloid leukemia), lung infections, or environmental exposure to dusts or chemicals. Rare familial forms have also been recognized, suggesting a genetic component in some cases.|$|E
50|$|Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a well-tolerated {{diagnostic}} procedure in ILD. BAL cytology analyses (differential cell counts) {{should be considered}} in the evaluation of patients with IPF at the discretion of the treating physician based on availability and experience at their institution. BAL may reveal alternative specific diagnoses: malignancy, infections, eosinophilic pneumonia, histiocytosis X, or <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis.</b> In the evaluation of patients with suspected IPF, the most important application of BAL is in the exclusion of other diagnoses. Prominent lymphocytosis (>30%) generally allows excluding a diagnosis of IPF.|$|E
50|$|SP-B is encoded by SFTPB, a single, 11425 {{nucleotide}} long gene on chromosome 2. Mutations in {{this gene}} {{are the basis}} for several of the lung conditions mentioned above. Both frameshift mutations and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found correlated {{to a variety of}} lung conditions. A frame shift mutation responsible for congenital <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> (CAP) was identified by Kattan et al. Many SNP's have been identified in relation to lung conditions. They have been correlated to severe influenza, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation necessity, and more.|$|E
50|$|This {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} an increased susceptibility to disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, viral infections, especially with human papillomaviruses, and fungal infections, primarily histoplasmosis, and molds. There is profound monocytopenia, B lymphocytopenia and NK lymphocytopenia. Patients have an increased chance of developing malignancies, including: myelodysplasia/leukemia vulvar carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, cervical carcinoma, Bowen disease of the vulva, and multiple Epstein-Barr virus(+) leiomyosarcoma. Patients may also develop pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> without mutations in the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor or anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies. Last, patients may develop autoimmune phenomena, including lupus like syndromes, primary biliary cirrhosis or aggressive multiple sclerosis.|$|E
5000|$|Benjamin Castleman (born May 17, 1906, Everett, Massachusetts; died June 29, 1982, Boston, Massachusetts) was an American {{physician}} and pathologist {{best known for}} describing Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymphoid hyperplasia), which is named after him. He {{was also one of}} the authors of the first case series on pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> in a 1958 article in the New England Journal of Medicine (Rosen-Castleman-Liebow syndrome is a rarely used term for that condition). [...] Castleman undertook clinicopathologic investigations of parathyroid disease and wrote several important papers on diseases of the thymus and mediastinum. He authored or co-authored over 100 scholarly papers on a variety of disorders.|$|E
50|$|During {{the process}} of mining, {{production}} and reclamation, workers are potentially exposed to indium, especially {{in countries such as}} China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Canada and face the possibility of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis,</b> pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and granulomas. Workers in the US, China, and Japan have been diagnosed with cholesterol clefts under indium exposure. Silver nanoparticles existed in improved ITOs have been found in vitro to penetrate through both intact and breached skin into the epidermal layer. Un-sintered ITOs are suspected of induce T-cell-mediated sensitization: on an intradermal exposure study, a concentrarion of 5% uITO resulted in lymphocyte proliferation in mice including the number increase of cells through a 10-day period.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolic}} disorder, lysinuric protein intolerance {{is caused}} by the body's inability to digest and use certain protein building blocks or amino acids. These are lysine, arginine, and ornithine. These amino acids are found in many protein-rich foods. Since in this disorder the human body cannot effectively break down these amino acids people typically experience nausea and vomiting after ingesting protein rich foods. Associated features of this protein intolerance may include an enlarged liver and spleen, short stature, muscle weakness, impaired immune function, and progressively brittle bones that are prone to fracture and a lung disorder called pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> may also develop. In addition, the accumulation of amino acids in the kidneys can cause end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In ESRD the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively.|$|E
5000|$|Workers in {{the mining}} {{industry}} are often exposed to dust from freshly fractured mineral deposits. When these workers use inadequate, or lack, respiratory protection completely, {{the consequences are}} devastating. A prime {{example of this is}} the Hawks Nest mining activity in West Virginia beginning in 1927. During the boring of a tunnel, deposits of silica were identified and mined; however, the workers did not use respiratory protection during the operations. Estimates of the proportion of workers who died, often within a few years, are typically about 30% of the 2,000 exposed workers. This rapidly lethal form of silicosis has been called [...] "acute silicosis," [...] which is characterized by <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> and interstitial inflammation. The respiratory effects are not exactly like those one would expect from simple silicosis, a disease that usually requires decades to develop after prolonged exposure to lower concentrations of silica dust. The latter disease is characterized by silicotic nodules that are clearly distinct from surrounding tissue and often surrounded by an inflammatory response.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{pulmonary}} disease characterized by excessive alveolar accumulation of surfactant due to defective alveolar clearance by macrophages. There {{are only a few}} published case reports of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> occurring in association with solid cancers. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previously reported cases of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> associated with breast cancer. Case presentation. A 48 -year-old Asian woman, a nonsmoker, presented to our institution with a right breast mass. Biopsy examination of the lesion revealed scirrhous carcinoma. A chest computed tomography scan for metastases showed abnormal shadows in both upper lung fields. As a result of flexible fiberscopic bronchoscopy, this patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis.</b> This case was categorized as autoimmune pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> due to the positive anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor antibody. Pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> decreased gradually after mastectomy. Conclusions: The present case involved the coincident occurrence of autoimmune pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> with breast cancer; breast cancer may be a factor during pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> development...|$|E

40|$|SummaryPulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> can be {{secondary}} to inhaled dust exposure, malignancy, and chronic pulmonary infections. However, pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> {{secondary to}} extrapulmonary aspergillosis {{has never been}} reported. We report herein a case of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> secondary to invasive rhinocerebral aspergillosis. Neither immune modulators nor whole lung lavage was applied during the treatment course. The severe respiratory distress subsided, hypoxia resolved, and radiological infiltrates improved following the successful treatment of invasive rhinocerebral aspergillosis alone...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: For the {{diagnosis}} of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens it is normally necessary to make an ultrastructural examination. However, this {{is thought to be}} impractical for bronchoalveolar lavage specimens that have been routinely fixed in ethanol. In the present study, bronchoalveolar lavage cytology smears on slide glasses were examined directly ultrastructurally to make a diagnosis of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis.</b> METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage smears from three pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> patients were stained with Papanicolaou and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for identification of amorphous globular structures. Subsequently, they were refixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut and examined ultrastructurally. RESULTS: Papanicolaou stained specimens from pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> patients contained scattered amorphous or granular globules, 20 - 50 microns in diameter, which were PAS positive. Ultrastructural examination of the globules revealed multilamellated structures, characteristic of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis,</b> in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: In general, it is thought that the morphological diagnosis of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>proteinosis</b> from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens requires both cytological and ultrastructural examination. However, the amorphous globules evident on cytology smears proved to contain multilamellated structures so that they can themselves be used as diagnostic evidence...|$|E
