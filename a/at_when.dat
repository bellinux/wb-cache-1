5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were <b>at</b> <b>when</b> the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were <b>at</b> <b>when</b> the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} {{to do all}} the things on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look <b>at</b> <b>when</b> she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Alien vs. Predator {{originated}} from the Aliens versus Predator comic book in 1989, and was hinted <b>at</b> <b>when</b> an Alien skull {{appeared in a}} trophy case aboard the Predator ship in Predator 2. Screenwriter Peter Briggs created the original spec screenplay in 1990–1991, {{which was based on}} the first comic series. In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002. The project was delayed chiefly because 20th Century Fox was working on Alien Resurrection. A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer John Davis, who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of Soma Bringer was first hinted <b>at</b> <b>when</b> Nintendo filed a trademark {{for the title}} alongside others. It was officially announced in October that year at a Nintendo press conference. Published by Nintendo, Soma Bringer was the first Monolith Soft title to be released after its acquisition by Nintendo in April 2007. It was released on February 22, 2008. After positive impressions from previews during public gaming events in Japan, both IGN and 1UP.com voiced a hope that the game would receive a localization. Speaking in 2010, Saga said {{that she did not}} know whether it would be released outside Japan, or whether further games set in the Soma Bringer universe would be developed.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{existence}} was first hinted <b>at</b> <b>when</b> a trademark {{for the title}} was registered. Similar trademarks were registered in Europe and North America. The game was officially announced by Square Enix in an issue of Famitsu magazine in February 2014. The game's service began on March 6, 2014 for iOS. The version for Android released nearly three months later on June 25. A version for the Vita was announced later in 2014, originally scheduled {{for the fourth quarter}} of that year. Due to technical difficulties, the Vita port needed to be delayed well into the following year, and was eventually released on May 14, 2015. Pre-registration was made available from May 10.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} before dawn, the army {{surrounded}} Tel al-Sultan. Armoured vehicles, tanks and bulldozers supported by helicopter gunships entered the Tel al-Sultan quarter of Rafah simultaneously from several directions; the troops established a cordon {{around the area}} and separated the area {{from the rest of}} Rafah. A number of armoured vehicles entered through UNRWA schools in the southeastern part, causing extensive damage to the school grounds. Ambulances were prevented from evacuating the casualties out of fear that they would be hijacked by terrorists. Palestinians were prevented from accessing UNRWA’s health clinic in the area. An ambulance was fired <b>at.</b> <b>When</b> a convoy of four ambulances accompanied by a Reuters vehicle were sent, they were also fired <b>at.</b> <b>When</b> they arrived at the victim, Israeli soldiers continued to fire. Israeli IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozers erected sand-barriers around Rafah to isolate it. Later, the D9s entered into the Rafah in order to open routes and demolish houses, allegedly used by militants. Extensive damage was caused to roads, water and sewage pipes and agricultural areas with greenhouses.|$|E

25|$|In {{his most}} recent {{contributions}} to game studies, The Formation of Gaming Culture, Kirkpatrick {{has focused on the}} history of gameplay, looking <b>at</b> <b>when</b> the idea became the central term of game criticism in the 1980s. He argues that this corresponds to the period when games played on computers and arcade machines became ‘video (or computer) games’ in the sense we give that phrase today. As a social group formed in connection with the activity of playing the games, 'gamers' produced their own lexicon of game evaluation and appraisal, and their expectations and preferences shaped the subsequent development of gaming as a cultural practice.|$|E
25|$|Freight {{levels have}} {{returned}} to the level that they were <b>at</b> <b>when</b> the railway had a virtual monopoly, prior to 1983.

By 1999 tonnes carried had increased to 12.9 million tonnes, slightly more than the 1975 peak. In the 2006 – 2007 financial year, 13.7 million tonnes of freight were carried. This equated to 3.96 million net tonne kilometres (or the amount of tonnes of traffic gained in 2008 – 2009 compared to the amount of traffic hauled in the 2006 – 2007 year) in the 2008 – 2009 financial year, about 15% of the total freight market.|$|E

Early in 1951 he bought 1,600 shares of common stock in Air Associates, Inc., a New Jersey company, for $29,517.54 ($ in contemporary dollars). He claimed to have done so because his stockbroker at Hayden Stone, Joseph Swan, had represented to him that Air was about to conclude a merger with Borg Warner, which would likely lead to the price increasing by as much as $6 over what it was then trading <b>at</b> <b>when</b> the merger was announced. Swan did not tell Wilko that Haven Page, counsel for Air Associates and a director of that company, was selling a large holding of his, including some of the stock Wilko purchased.|$|E
25|$|Several of the {{foundations}} {{laid in the}} opening episodes are built upon as the series progresses. In the third episode, Naomi is traumatized by the discovery that her father is having an affair. In episode four, she is shown to maintain {{a close relationship with}} Ethan, despite their break-up, turning to him for comfort. She again reveals a friendly side when she pacifies Ethan's autistic brother. Later, she is presented with an opportunity to confront her father's mistress, and boldly does so. She and Erin Silver also take steps toward reconciliation. Afterward, Naomi schemes to save her parents' marriage, though her efforts are ultimately in vain. When her friend Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) encounters problems due to her drug habit, Naomi's good will is displayed again, as she eventually steps in and attempts to intervene. In the eighth episode, her intelligence is further hinted <b>at</b> <b>when</b> it is revealed that Naomi speaks Spanish.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} that the sockeye salmon are affected by thermal conditions and their responses to temperature are relatively strong and tend to vary from region to region. Canada has also used the Species at Risk Act to {{recognize the importance of}} biological diversity when it come to the conservation of the salmon population. This means that multiple species of salmon would be looked <b>at</b> <b>when</b> it comes to conservation as well as multiple areas that each species live in. COSEWIC, a Canadian organization for the conservation of species, has named the Interior Fraser River Coho, the Cultus Lake Sockeye, and the Sakinaw Lake Sockeye to all be endangered. In British Columbia sockeye salmon in four different watersheds were certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, or MSC, as sustainable fisheries in July 2010 and the certification is good for a period of five years. In 2011 MSC also certified the Pink Salmon Fishery and as of 2012 The Chum Salmon Fisheries started their review under the MSC to become certified as a sustainable fishery.|$|E
