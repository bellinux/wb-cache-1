5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap <b>and</b> <b>widely</b> spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
5|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many <b>and</b> <b>widely</b> diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.|$|E
5|$|Claiming that {{publishers}} {{would no}} longer accept anti-interventionist books, Townsend began self-publishing pamphlets. Between 1938 and 1940 he wrote a series of pamphlets which were extremely popular <b>and</b> <b>widely</b> circulated among anti-interventionists. Two of them, The High Cost of Hate and America Has No Enemies In Asia, had a circulation of at least 60,000 copies, while another, There Is No Halfway Neutrality printed 30,000 copies.

5|$|During {{the period}} that the {{original}} proposals were being studied, advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly. The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for supersonic flight, replacing earlier designs like the swept-wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the earlier WS-110 concepts. Engines {{able to cope with}} higher temperatures <b>and</b> <b>widely</b> varying intake ramp air speeds were also under design, allowing for sustained supersonic speeds.|$|E

5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism <b>and</b> <b>widely</b> believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.|$|E
5|$|In the 1810s and 1820s, greater {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside.

5|$|It is {{native to}} the steppes and hills of southwestern and central Asia.
