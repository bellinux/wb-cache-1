Why do some kleptocrats grant political opponents significant leeway to organize, while others enforce strict limits on such activities? Through detailed analysis of post-Soviet Georgia and Kazakhstan, I trace {{variation in}} the intensity of repression back to differences in the sources of rulers’ illegal wealth. I argue that where rulers’ wealth is <b>accumulated</b> from <b>society,</b> they are constrained in their treatment of wealthy opposition leaders. In contrast, rulers who can extract bribes from foreign companies based on natural resource wealth can pursue aggressive repression without jeopardizing their illicit profits.

This systematic review aims to survey the related literature {{on the effects of}} environmental pollutants and especially organohalogens and phthalates on early puberty. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of papers published in the English language was completed in January 2014. Studies on the associations of organohalogens and phthalates with the puberty time were included. A literature search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from 1995 to January 2014; moreover manual search through references of relevant manuscripts was considered. The literature search identified 212 papers, of which 13 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the current study. Two reviewers independently identified relevant papers for potential inclusion and assessed the methodological quality. Results: This review included 6572 participants in nine countries from three continents (Europe, North America, and Asia). Different studies determined the effects of pollutants on maturation signs and pubertal stages and confirmed the association of organohalogens and phthalates with early puberty. Conclusion: Based on the studied literature, environmental pollutants surround and <b>accumulate</b> in human <b>societies</b> and their adverse health effects are well documented.

In this study, a generic emission model has been developed and applied to estimate emissions of a set of organic chemicals from products. The scope of the estimate is emissions from products containing plastic materials during their average lifetime within the geographical boundaries of Sweden. The customs Combined Nomenclature has been used to divide the products into categories for which the chemical composition, surface area, thickness and <b>accumulated</b> stock in <b>society</b> has been described and estimated using several approaches for approximation in cases where data have been lacking. For this, information from national trade statistics as well as lifecycle assessments and building product declarations was used Anti-oxidants, flame retardants and plasticisers are among the most interesting use categories of additives that are emitted in significant quantities. Thus for anti-oxidants in plastic material in the economy-wide product stock in Sweden as an example, the emissions in the service-life were estimated to be almost 500 tons/year divided on 32 individual chemical organic substances, stemming from a stock of anti-oxidants of 84000 tons, contained in a stock of plastic material of 24 million tons. Until now, the method has only been used to estimate emissions of additives from plastic materials, but it is believed to also be applicable to other materials.

Malayalam Script which got final shape at the time of Tunjath Ezhuttachan and preserved as it is in printing by Benjamin Bailey (1821) and Herman Gundert who developed technology to suit the specificities of the language and script was modified and deformed by native scholars since 1970 to suit the English Typewriters. Adopting the same for computers also led to chaos and confusion. Digitizing local content was impossible till Rachana revived the original script that can be processed aas per their syntactic and semantic relations.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} socioeconomic history of Kütahya, an inland town in western Anatolia, {{with a specific}} emphasis on the transformation {{that took place in}} the Ottoman Empire during the eighteenth century. However, it is not a socioeconomic history of an urban center or of a region in the traditional sense. Rather, it uses Kütahya and the surrounding region as a ground upon which it seeks to answer a series of questions about this transformation. These questions concern the impact of the administrative function of a city on its socioeconomic development; the extent to which a new financial policy implemented at the end of the seventeenth century [...] the malikâne system [...] affected power relations in the region surrounding Kütahya; and the role played by the cash requirements of the state at the end of the eighteenth century in the monetization of the economy. The dissertation also examines various aspects of credit relations, changes in consumption patterns, and the relationship between privilege and the accumulation of wealth. 	The research does not subscribe to any particular perspective on the transformation {{that took place in the}} eighteenth century, nor does it focus on one particular framework of interpretation, such as center-periphery relations or the rise of the local notables. Rather, it is intended to provide as much concrete evidence as possible on these issues for a city and region for which there is literally no secondary literature. 	The findings of this research show that generalizations about the transformation that took place in the Ottoman Empire during the eighteenth century need to be qualified with further research [...] especially with in-depth studies on different regions of the empire. During this period, local notables emerged, the financial and military crisis took a serious toll on the region, the economy became more and more monetized, credit relations expanded, and some sectors of <b>society</b> <b>accumulated</b> wealth. But, relations of power vis-à-vis the center did not change significantly. The notables that emerged posed no challenge to the central authority, the economy was to a great extent regional, and the accumulation of wealth remained a function of political and economic privilege. 	The dissertation consists of two parts. The first three chapters are intended to provide a lengthy prelude to the eighteenth century, and draw largely on secondary sources. These chapters present a socioeconomic context for the changes that took place in the eighteenth century, and within which those changes can be assessed. The scarcity of secondary sources, and the highly descriptive nature of the few that exist also made it necessary to include an organized narrative for the period between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries in the first three chapters. The last three chapters cover the period roughly from 1671 to 1820, and are based to a great extent on primary sources [...] especially on the court registers. These three chapters seek to answer the questions concerning the transformation of the Ottoman Empire during the eighteenth century with the evidence provided by the primary sources...|$|R

Given the importance of {{medicinal plants}} in health care and simultaneously the scarce literature that analyzes their inclusion in the scope of services of the Primary Health Care, this study aimed to analyze the development of actions/programs with medicinal plants, described Brazilian literature, Brazilian municipalities in PHC services. We prepared an essay on the theoretical and conceptual diversity of knowledge, care settings and usage of medicinal plants that interact with the PHC services. This theoretical essay presents a conceptual approach anchored in the "ecology of knowledge" proposed by Boaventura de Souza Santos and authors of the anthropology of health on the forms and care sectors. The discussion of the state of the art of medicinal plants in the APS involved a documentary analysis of official publications of the Ministry of Health who reported on actions and phytotherapy services deployed in APS, a bibliometric analysis of the scientific production on the subject in the period 1988 - 2012 and meta-study on actions/programs with Brazilian medicinal plants described in the literature over the same period. We performed an empirical study with a qualitative approach that aimed to understand the risk factors, hindering and contributions of phytotherapy in APS, in four selected municipalities, from the look of health professionals. Information gathering were conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants. Results: discussion of the ecology of knowledge applied to the subject revealed the importance of dialogue between the knowledge and practices of medicinal plants for the NHS and the APS, beyond the scientific discourse, in order to exploit emerging knowledge present and <b>accumulated</b> in Brazilian <b>society,</b> without disparaging the scientific knowledge, important for the consolidation of herbal medicines in Brazil.
