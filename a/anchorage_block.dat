40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{connection}} details used for cable anchorage blocks on cable-stayed bridges have the potential for fatigue damage due to fluctuating stresses generated by the cyclic traffic loads passing over the bridge. To investigate the fatigue damage and determine the remaining fatigue life of a cable <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> used on a cable-stayed bridge, finite element (FE) analyses were undertaken by using the Fatigue Load Model 4 (FLM 4) proposed by the Eurocodes to identify the most fatigue-critical locations within the details. One of the main objectives of this research was to identify the critical area prone to fatigue in the <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> due to the response in traffic loads. Therefore, two types of numerical models of a typical cable <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> were analysed as a three dimensional sub-model which was driven by global cable forces obtained from the global analysis of a three-span cable-stayed bridge. These models are of the cable <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> without the longitudinal girder modelled and the cable <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> with the longitudinal girder modelled. The cable anchorage blocks without the longitudinal girder model were classified into three categories of model types namely; model types 0, A and B. Similarly, the cable anchorage blocks with the longitudinal girder model were classified as model types A-G, B-G and C-G. These model classifications are based on several boundary conditions simulated in the analyses. In addition to this, the fatigue behaviour of the cable <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> was analysed by using three different approaches namely; by using the nodal stresses at the location of the stress concentration (node stress concentration), by using a stress averaged over an area {{in the vicinity of the}} stress concentration (average elements) and by using the hot-spot method, in order to identify the stress ranges that adversely affect the remaining fatigue life of cable anchorages. Each approach was analysed with three different mesh sizes; 5 mm by 5 mm, 10 mm by 10 mm and 20 mm by 20 mm in order to carry out a mesh sensitivity analysis of the resulting stresses and associated stress ranges. The 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size was found to be most appropriate for this fatigue appraisal. This finding is supported because the 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size is specified in several code of practices such as the International Institute of Welding (IIW) and BS 7608 as guidance for use when determining hot-spot stress when using the hot-spot method for the fatigue analyses of a welded detail. The critical stresses from model type C-G were used in the fatigue appraisal as the behaviour of this model represented more accurately the actual cable <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> on the cable-stayed bridge compared to the other types of models used. Model type C-G were selected for further fatigue appraisal as this model include the correct boundary conditions and applied load that represented the actual condition of the anchorage behaviour on the cable-stayed bridge. This included the movement of the top <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> due to the displacement of the cable and in addition the deck movement. Also, non-uniform pressure was applied on the bearing plate which was included to model possible construction tolerances which was one of the important properties of the model type C-G. In evaluating the possible fatigue damage in the cable <b>anchorage</b> <b>block,</b> the cumulative model for fatigue failure expressed in terms of Miner’s rule was used. In addition to this, the condition of the structural detail due to fatigue with increasing traffic loading was determined by projecting traffic volume increases of up to 20...|$|E
40|$|The first {{generation}} of precast concrete deck system, NUDECK, was implemented on the Skyline Bridge, Omaha, NE in 2004. The second generation of NUDECK system was developed to further simplify the system and improve its constructability and durability. The new generation consists of full-width full-depth precast concrete deck panels that are 12 ft long to minimize the number of deck panels and transverse joints, and consequently accelerate bridge construction. It also uses covered individual pockets and bundled shear connectors at 4 ft spacing to simplify panel and girder production and {{eliminate the need for}} deck overlay. Precast deck panels are pre-tensioned in transverse direction and post-tensioned in the longitudinal direction to enhance deck durability. Post-tensioning strands are placed underneath the deck panels (at the haunch area) to eliminate threading strands through ducts and grouting operations. The objective of this project is to investigate the constructability of the 2 nd generation NUDECK system through full-scale testing of two key features: 1) using self-consolidating concrete (SCC) to fill the gap between precast concrete deck panels and bridge girders as well as covered deck pockets; and 2) using the proposed deviators and <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> in the end deck panels for post-tensioning the bridge deck. These investigations includes evaluating the pumpability/pouring of the developed SCC mixture in mockup and full-scale specimens. Sequence of pumping/pouring of SCC as well as its quality control and quality assurance procedures are also demonstrated. The investigations also include pullout testing of the deviators and pushoff testing of the <b>anchorage</b> <b>block</b> used for post-tensioning to evaluate their performance and refine their reinforcement details...|$|E
40|$|The cable <b>anchorage</b> <b>blocks</b> that {{transfer}} the deck loads to the cables have complex details which significantly influence the long – term fatigue behaviour of cable – stayed bridges in operation. Determination {{of the stress}} ranges {{at one of the}} most critical parts in the cable anchorage due to traffic loads passing over the bridge is determined by using the finite element (FE) method. This paper investigates three different approaches namely node stress concentration, average elements and the hot-spot method in order to identify the stress ranges that adversely affect the remaining fatigue life of a cable anchorage. Finally, by using the Fatigue Load Model 4 (FLM 4) proposed in the Euro code, the proposed fatigue remaining life in cable anchorage is determined and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Engineered fibre {{composites}} {{offer an}} extremely versatile option to strengthen existing structures to solve structural problems arising from environmental exposure, inadequate designs, increased traffic loads and continuous aging of existing structures. While the behaviour of structures by external post-tensioning using fibre composites for flexure is well understood, {{there is limited}} research on shear strengthening, specifically using prestressed fibre composites. An innovative system using fibre composites has been investigated for strengthening bridge headstocks with deficient structural performance. The innovative system uses fibre composite wraps which forms an infinite loop around the headstocks and together with <b>anchorage</b> <b>blocks,</b> these are pushed-out and the gap packed with a suitable spacer to maintain the applied pre-stressing force. This paper discusses the research, development and construction of this innovative fibre composite post-tensioning system and testing it on a model bridge headstocks in Tenthill Creek Bridge. Issues related {{to the effect of}} existing shear cracks and the importance of repairing such cracks will be discussed. With further investigation, this strengthening system could be implemented in actual structures to enhance the capacity of bridge headstocks. ...|$|R
50|$|Bérenger {{decided to}} {{approach}} Koh Chang at dawn from the southwest. Because the anchorage at {{was surrounded by}} islands and islets, many over 200 m high, the squadron would separate and use {{the cover of the}} islands to concentrate fire on portions of the Thai squadron, while also covering all the avenues of escape. The easternmost channel was the most likely route by which a breakout would be made. It was the most suitable route and where the reconnaissance had placed the largest Thai ships. Lamotte-Picquet would head to {{the eastern side of the}} <b>anchorage</b> to <b>block</b> the route, while the sloops blocked the center and pounded the Thai ships there. The smaller French ships would concentrate to the west.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} methodology {{to identify the}} block to anchorage-independent growth and position it within the fibroblast cell cycle. Results with NRK fibroblasts show that mitogen stimulation of the GO/G 1 transition and GI-associated increases in cell size are minimally affected by loss of cell anchorage. In contrast, the induction of Gl/S cell cycle genes and DNA synthesis is markedly inhibited when <b>anchorage</b> is <b>blocked.</b> Moreover, we demonstrate that the anchorage-dependent transition maps to late Gl and shortly before activation of the Gl/S p 34 cdc 2 -like kinase. The Gl/S block was also detectable in NIH- 3 T 3 cells. Our results: (a) distinguish control of cell cycle progression by growth factors and anchorage; (b) indicate that anchorage mediates Gl/S control in fibroblasts; and (c) identify a physiologic circumstance i...|$|R

5000|$|On 28 June 1943 the {{destroyer}} again sailed from Espiritu Santo {{as a part}} of the covering force for troops bound for landings at Rice <b>anchorage</b> to <b>block</b> Japanese movements from Vila to Munda, Solomon Islands. The group entered Kula Gulf shortly before midnight, 1 July, and began to bombard Vila and Bairoko Harbor, while the transports headed for the anchorage. During the operation the American force was attacked by three Japanese destroyers which launched torpedoes, and retired at high speed. One of the Japanese torpedoes hit , tearing open her hull amidships on both sides. Chevalier deliberately rammed her bow into Strongs port side and lay alongside for several minutes while Strongs survivors crawled on board. Japanese shore batteries opened fire on the stricken ship, but Chevalier remained alongside until 241 survivors had come on board, while [...] delivered counterfire against the Japanese. Chevalier pulled clear of Strong at 01:22, and the stricken destroyer sank a minute later. Chevalier had torn a hole 10 by 2 feet in her bow, but it did not seriously impair her operating ability as it was well above her waterline. The destroyer returned to Espiritu Santo 8 July for repairs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the 2 D and 3 D numerical analysis of pullout tests on steel <b>anchorages</b> in concrete <b>blocks</b> using standard and mixed finite elements. A novel (stabilized) mixed formulation in {{the variables of}} total strain 8 and displacements u is introduced to overcome the intrinsic deficiencies of the standard displacement-based one {{in the context of}} localization of strains, such as mesh dependency. The quasi brittle behavior of concrete is described through an elastoplastic constitutive law with a local Rankine yielding criterion. The proposed formulation is shown to be a reliable and accurate tool, sensitive to the physical parameters of the pullout tests, but objective with respect to the adopted FE mesh. Furthermore, the mixed epsilon/u finite element is able to capture the correct failure mechanism with relatively coarse discretizations. At the same time, the spurious behavior of the standard formulation is not alleviated by mesh-refinement. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present the}} first results of {{comparative}} studies of several hinge prostheses and the mechanical {{behavior of the}} complex femur, prosthesis and tibia. The conclusion of a vectorial analysis is that muscle strain is less with a Guepar prosthesis. If {{the diameter of the}} bolts is sufficient to withstand the shearing and bending forces, {{there appears to be a}} weakness in their <b>anchorage.</b> The Silastic <b>block</b> in the Guepar prosthesis reduces the jerk during extension and lessens the strains by 25 %. However, the authors have doubts of the resistance of Silastic. The cortical, femoral and tibial deformations (with and without total prosthesis) are registered for a 75 kg load. The measurements prove that diaphyseal strains increase with a short stem prosthesis and that its position is disturbed. Deformation is excessive when there is no valgus, but is more evenly distributed along femur and tibia if the implant has a long intra medullary stem. The final results of this comparative study of the implants are awaited before conclusions are drawn. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|On Sunday October 22, 1961, the Bianca C was {{ten days}} out of Naples and docked off Grenada when an {{explosion}} occurred in the engine room {{in the early hours}} of the morning. One crewman died immediately, and eight others were injured. As fires broke out, approximately 700 passengers and crew scrambled to abandon the ship while Grenadian fishermen and boat owners, awakened by the noise of the explosion, near the harbor of St. George's rushed to help. Survivors were taken to the capital, where makeshift hospitals were hastily established to provide shelter and food. Because Grenada did not have the equipment to quench such a large fire, a call for help was sent and was received by the British frigate [...] at Puerto Rico. It took two days for the Londonderry to arrive, and by that time the Bianca C had begun to sink. The burning ship was in the main <b>anchorage</b> and would <b>block</b> the harbor if it sank there, so a Londonderry boarding party boarded the flaming ship to attach a towline. The anchor lines of the Bianca C were burned, and today the anchors are still at the mouth of the St. George's harbor. Meanwhile, the Londonderry moved to tow the Bianca C, but the latter ship was listing to port. Thousands of Grenadians watched from the mountains as the tow progressed for six hours, but the Bianca C. had only moved three miles (5 km) when a squall started and the towline broke. The Bianca C sank quickly into 165 ft of water, about a mile from the popular tourist beach at Grand Anse.|$|R
