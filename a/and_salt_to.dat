This gave rise to the growth of Boston as a port in the 12th and 13thcenturies, exporting wool <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> the Hanseatic League, though Boston only received its charter in 1545.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also used}} for tooth whitening. It {{can be found in}} most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where the shade of the tooth can indeed become lighter. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with baking soda <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> make a home-made toothpaste.|$|E
25|$|Compressed tea was {{the most}} popular form of tea in China during the Tang dynasty. By the {{beginning}} of the Ming dynasty, it had been displaced by loose leaf tea. It remains popular, however, in the Himalayan countries and Mongolian steppes. In Mongolia, tea bricks were ubiquitous enough {{to be used as a}} form of currency. Among Himalayan peoples, compressed tea is consumed by combining it with yak butter <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> produce butter tea.|$|E

Horses in hard training may need a vitamin E supplement, as their requirements are higher than horses in more moderate work.

25|$|The three {{metallic}} principles: sulphur to flammability or combustion, mercury to volatility and stability, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> solidity. {{became the}} tria prima of the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus. He reasoned that Aristotle's four-element theory appeared in bodies as three principles. Paracelsus saw these principles as fundamental and justified them by recourse to {{the description of}} how wood burns in fire. Mercury included the cohesive principle, so that when it left in smoke the wood fell apart. Smoke described the volatility (the mercurial principle), the heat-giving flames described flammability (sulphur), and the remnant ash described solidity (salt).|$|E
25|$|Overland {{trade was}} {{principal}}ly with China. Burma's principal export to China was cotton. Based on Sun Laichen's analysis of Chinese sources, exports to Yunnan of Burmese raw cotton by c. 1600 had reached 1000 tonnes annually. Burma also exported finished Indian (and possibly Burmese) textiles {{as well as}} spices, gems, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> Yunnan. These goods were moved by boat to the upper Irrawaddy, where they were transferred to north-bound trains of oxen and ponies. In the opposite direction flowed Chinese iron and copper vessels, weapons, tea, and silk as well as copper and silver from Yunnanese mines.|$|E
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the {{disorder}} has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake {{and can lead to}} weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.|$|E

25|$|Serbian cuisine {{is largely}} heterogeneous, with heavy Oriental, Central European and Mediterranean influences. Despite this, it has evolved and {{achieved}} its own culinary identity. Food {{is very important}} in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as Christmas, Easter and feast days, i.e., slava. Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditionally, three meals are consumed per day. Breakfast generally consists of eggs, meat and bread. Lunch is considered the main meal, and is normally eaten in the afternoon. Traditionally, Turkish coffee is prepared after a meal, and is served in small cups. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it {{plays an important role in}} Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> guests, and also slatko (fruit preserve). Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include kajmak (a dairy product similar to clotted cream), proja (cornbread), kačamak (corn-flour porridge), and gibanica (cheese and kajmak pie). Ćevapčići, caseless grilled and seasoned sausages made of minced meat, is the national dish of Serbia.|$|E

500|$|The {{importance}} of bread as a daily staple meant that bakers {{played a crucial}} role in any medieval community. Bread consumption was high in most of Western Europe by the 14th century. Estimates of bread consumption from different regions are fairly similar: around [...] of bread per person per day. Among the first town guilds to be organized were the bakers', and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable. The English Assize of Bread and Ale of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size, weight, and price of a loaf of bread were regulated in relation to grain prices. The baker's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the London Baker's Company by adding the cost of everything from firewood <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> the baker's wife, house, and dog. Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet, swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense. Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or adulterating dough with less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties. This gave rise to the [...] "baker's dozen": a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat.|$|E
