50|$|Strictly speaking, the tappet, also termed <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> <b>follower,</b> or lifter, is {{that part}} that runs on the {{camshaft}} and is made to move vertically {{by the action of}} the rotating cam. In an overhead valve engine, this tappet is fitted low down in the engine block. From there it drives a long thin pushrod, {{up to the top of}} the engine, above the cylinder head. Here the rockers, arranged on a rocker shaft beneath the rocker cover, reverse the direction of the valve movement to press the valves downwards to open them.|$|E

Now slightly different types of eccentric cam followers are also available in which energy is transferred from the follower to the cam. The main benefit of this type of cam follower mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps to rotate the cam 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.|$|E

5000|$|... "Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling a single two-sided sliding cam. (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) Each arm has <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> <b>follower.</b> As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart. As {{the top of each}} arm moves outward, the brake shoe below the pivot is forced inward against the rim.There is much in favor of the roller cam brake design. Since the cam controls the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. And they require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless re-adjusted it can eventually contact the tyre's sidewall.|$|E
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> <b>follower.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of driving a machine with several {{reciprocating}} heavy inertias. The drive should also realize some programmable flexibility of the motion, so that {{the operation of the}} machine, e,g., synchronization between different motions and duration of standstills, can easily be modified. The use of a single servomotor for every motion is not the best solution, since it does not allow for energy recuperation. This means that the installed servomotor power will be much higher than the required net peak power for the machine as a whole. The presented solution, however, reduces the servomotor peak torque and power by one order of magnitude, and makes energy transfer between the motions possible. The hybrid cam mechanism consists of a hybrid drive, which is a combination of a servomotor, a constant velocity motor and <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism. The operation principle exploits the nonlinear characteristics of the cam to add flexibility at low cost of energy.

50|$|This type of cam {{was used}} for example in {{mechanical}} time keeping clocking-in clocks to drive the day advance mechanism at precisely midnight and consisted of a follower being raised over 24 hours by the <b>cam</b> in <b>a</b> spiral path which terminated at a sharp cut off at which the follower would drop down and activate the day advance. Where timing accuracy is required as in clocking-in clocks these were typically ingeniously arranged to have <b>a</b> roller <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> to raise the drop weight {{for most of its}} journey to near its full height, and only for the last portion of its travel for the weight to be taken over and supported by a solid follower with a sharp edge. This ensured that the weight dropped at a precise moment, enabling accurate timing. This was achieved by the use of two snail cams mounted coaxially with the roller initially resting on one cam and the final solid follower on the other but not in contact with its cam profile. Thus the roller cam was initially carried the weight, until at the final portion of the run the profile of the non-roller cam rose more than the other causing the solid follower to take the weight.|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of impacting components {{is of particular}} interest to engineers due to concerns about noise and wear, but is particularly difficult to study due to impact's non-linear nature. To begin transferring concepts studied purely analytically to the world of physical mechanisms, four experiments are outlined, and important non-linear concepts highlighted with these systems. A linear oscillator with a kicked impact, an impacting forced pendulum, two impacting forced pendulums, and <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> pair are studied experimentally, with complementary numerical results. Some important ideas highlighted are limit cycles, basins of attraction with many wells, grazing, various forms of coexistence, super-persistent chaotic transients, and liftoff. These concepts are explored using a variety of non-linear tools such as time lag embedding and stochastic interrogation, and discussions of their intricacies when used in non-smooth systems yield important observations for the experimentalist studying impacting systems. The focus is on experimental results with numerical validation, and spends much time discussing identification of these concepts from an experiment-first mindset, rather than the more traditional analytical-first approach.
