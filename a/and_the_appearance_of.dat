5|$|These new finds {{have been}} vital in {{illustrating}} {{the origins of}} horned dinosaurs in general, suggesting an Asian origin in the Jurassic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> truly horned ceratopsians {{by the beginning of}} the late Cretaceous in North America. As Triceratops is increasingly shown to be a member of the long-frilled Ceratopsinae subfamily, a likely ancestor may have resembled Chasmosaurus, which thrived some 5 million years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Though Vamei {{was officially}} {{designated}} as a tropical storm, its intensity is disputed; some agencies classify it as a typhoon, based on sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> an eye.

5|$|With {{the advent}} of radio, {{improved}} transportation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> traveling vaudeville acts in Portland, attendance at the Chautauqua began to dwindle. In 1927, the Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association went bankrupt. Judge Cross died on August 7, 1927, and shortly thereafter, Gladstone Park, including its buildings and Chautauqua Lake, were sold to the Western Oregon Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.|$|E
5|$|After delays due to {{concerns}} over nearby wetlands <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> the ramps from street level, the Town of Winchester granted approval in March 2011. In April 2011, the MBTA began soliciting bids {{for the primary}} construction work on the station, worth $1.525 million. The scope of work included construction of the mini-high platforms and ramps from street level, as well as adding lighting, rehabilitating the low level platforms, and creating accessible parking spaces. After bids came in higher than expected, a $2.503 million contract was awarded in July 2011 with notice to proceed in August.|$|E

5|$|Mini Metro is {{a puzzle}} {{strategy}} video game developed by indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by drawing lines. Levels are based on real cities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural audio system to generate sounds based on the player actions and transit network. The rhythms and sounds created took inspiration from works of minimal music.|$|E
5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, {{given to him by}} officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E

5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this flurry of work {{is known as the}} second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} case of orbital {{resonance}} in exoplanets {{has been noted}} between Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. The two planets, whose orbits correspond in a roughly 1:2 ratio, maintain the orbit of the other by gravitational tug. Kepler-9b's orbit grows, on average, four minutes longer every orbital period. Eventually, this trend will reverse and increase. Over time, {{it can be seen}} that the planets' orbits oscillate slightly above and below the 1:2 ratio. Alycia Weinberger of the Carnegie Institution has stated that the Kepler-9 gas giants probably formed further away from the star than they are, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> the orbital resonance phenomenon may help explain the history of their inward migration.|$|E

5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} pranking war was instigated in April 2005, when Caltech {{students}} pulled multiple pranks during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend for prospective freshmen. MIT students responded {{a year later}} by stealing Caltech's antique Fleming Cannon and transporting it {{across the country to}} MIT's campus. Subsequent pranks have included fake satirical school newspapers distributed by Caltech students at MIT <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> a TARDIS device on top of Caltech's Baxter Hall.|$|E

There, she silenced the Austrian coastal batteries protecting the main port, but she was too badly damaged {{to take part in the}} ensuing Battle of Lissa. The ship's postwar career was limited due to a combination of drastically reduced naval budgets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> more modern ironclads. Formidabile was used as a training ship starting in 1887; she was discarded in 1903 and broken up for scrap.|$|E

The ship's postwar career was limited due to a combination of drastically reduced naval budgets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> more modern ironclads. In 1885, Terribile was withdrawn from service for use as a training ship. She remained in service until 1904 when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an {{assassination}} attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had {{been reported to be}} in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
