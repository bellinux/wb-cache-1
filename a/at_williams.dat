5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1830, Yancey was {{enrolled}} <b>at</b> <b>Williams</b> College in northwestern Massachusetts. The 16-year-old Yancey was admitted as a sophomore based on the required entrance examinations. <b>At</b> <b>Williams,</b> he participated in the debating society and {{for a short time}} was the editor of a student newspaper. In the autumn of 1832, Yancey took his first steps as a politician by working on the campaign for Whig Ebenezer Emmons. Overall, Yancey had a successful stay <b>at</b> <b>Williams</b> academically that was marred only by frequent disciplinary problems. Despite being selected as the Senior Orator by his class, Yancey left the school in the spring of 1833, six weeks before graduation.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He {{returned}} to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. <b>At</b> <b>Williams,</b> he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career. In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Prost went on {{a sabbatical}} year in 1992, which was {{dominated}} by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team. After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the CART series. The Frenchman had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year. Prost {{was part of a}} new-look driver line-up <b>at</b> <b>Williams,</b> with test driver Damon Hill coming in to replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.|$|E

After Williams College, he considered being a lawyer, businessman or government worker. His brother William advised against his becoming a government worker or businessman, {{so he decided to}} become a minister. He attended the Princeton Theological Seminary starting in October 1834 and continuing for three years. Here he also came near to being expelled after a dispute with the teacher John Breckenridge. He graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1837 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree. Waller moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1838.|$|E
5|$|After the Thuns {{learned the}} game, they began {{teaching}} its rules to their fraternity brothers <b>at</b> <b>Williams</b> College around 1926. Daniel W. Layman, in turn, learned {{the game from}} the Thun brothers (who later tried to sell copies of the game commercially, but were advised by an attorney that the game could not be patented, as they were not its inventors). Layman later returned to his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, and began playing the game with friends there, ultimately producing hand-made versions of the board based on streets of that city. Layman then commercially produced and sold the game, starting in 1932, with a friend in Indianapolis, who owned a company called Electronic Laboratories. This game was sold under the name The Fascinating Game of Finance (later shortened to Finance). Layman soon sold his rights to the game, which was then licensed, produced and marketed by Knapp Electric. The published board featured four railroads (one per side), Chance and Community Chest cards and spaces, and properties grouped by symbol, rather than color. Also in 1932, one edition of The Landlord's Game was published by the Adgame Company with {{a new set of}} rules called Prosperity, also by Magie.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill <b>at</b> <b>Williams.</b> As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E

5|$|James Abram Garfield {{was raised}} in humble {{circumstances}} on an Ohio farm by his widowed mother. He worked at various jobs, including on a canal boat, in his youth. Beginning at age 17, he studied <b>at</b> <b>Williams</b> College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, from which he graduated in 1856. A year later, Garfield entered politics as a Republican. He married Lucretia Rudolph in 1858, {{and served as a}} member of the Ohio State Senate (1859–1861). Garfield opposed Confederate secession, served as a major general in the Union Army during the Civil War, and fought in the battles of Middle Creek, Shiloh, and Chickamauga. He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio's 19th District. Throughout Garfield's extended congressional service after the Civil War, he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator. Garfield initially agreed with Radical Republican views regarding Reconstruction, but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson's {{second game}} for the 2015–16 Michigan Wolverines men's {{basketball}} team, he posted 19 points on 6–6 shooting (5–5 3-point shots) from the floor against Elon. On December 12, Michigan defeated Delaware State 80–33, as Robinson made his first career start for Michigan by posting 11 points on 3–5 three-point shooting. At the time Robinson ranked third {{in the nation in}} three-point shooting percentage. Note that various sources have various eligibility thresholds. E.g., while BigTen.org only requires a minimum of 1.0 made per game, NCAA.org requires a minimum of 2.5 made per game. On December 23, Robinson tied his career high (set twice <b>at</b> <b>Williams)</b> with six assists against Bryant. The game marked the ninth consecutive game in which he made at least 3 3-point shots. Robinson entered conference play as the Big Ten leader in three-point field goal percentage and led the Big Ten Conference in both three-point field goals (52) and three-point field goal percentage (.565) through {{the first week of the}} Big Ten Conference schedule. On January 12, with leading scorer Caris LeVert sidelined, Michigan defeated (#3/#3) Maryland 70–67 as Robinson contributed 17 points on 5–9 three-point shooting. On January 23, Michigan defeated Nebraska 81–68, behind a game-high and season-high 21 points by Robinson. With the Cornhusker defense challenging his three-point shot, he scored more points inside the three-point line than outside it for the first time as a Wolverine. The January 27 game against Rutgers marked the 17th consecutive game in which Robinson made at least two three-point shots. Robinson made only one three-point shot in each the subsequent two games against Penn State and (#22/21) Indiana. Nonetheless, Robinson entered the February 6 Michigan–Michigan State men's basketball rivalry game against the #10-ranked 2015–16 Spartans as the Big Ten Conference leader in three-point shots made and three-point field goal percentage, but he was held to 0–3 three-point shooting in the game. The game marked the first time since the season opener, that Robinson did not make a single three point shot, ending a 22-game streak. On February 10, Michigan defeated Minnesota as Robinson posted a game- and season-high nine rebounds to go along with 14 points on 4-for-7 three-point shooting.|$|E
