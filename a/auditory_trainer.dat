40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of using an FM <b>auditory</b> <b>trainer</b> on the speech intelligibility with unilateral hearing loss. Half lists of the NU- 6 was administered to 20 normal hearing adults under the following conditions: binaurally (quiet and noise), one ear occluded without and FM <b>auditory</b> <b>trainer</b> (quiet and noise), and one ear occluded with an FM <b>auditory</b> <b>trainer</b> (quiet and noise). The occlusion of the right and left ears was performed in order to control for the dominance of the right ear in speech discrimination under noise. The results indicated a significant improvement in speech discrimination when an FM <b>auditory</b> <b>trainer</b> is used with the unilaterally hearing impaired.

40|$|Two {{groups of}} seven autistic {{children}} wore an <b>auditory</b> <b>trainer</b> {{for an average}} of 24 minutes per day over two 5 - week periods interspersed with 5 -week control periods in a time series design. Videotapes were coded for three attentional states (normal, withdrawn, attacking), for verbalization and signing, and for appropriate and acceptable behaviors. Results demonstrated a decrease in time spent withdrawn and increases in signing and in schoolappropriate behavior. Results are interpreted as congruent with Katz's theory of reduced attention due to deficits in auditory conductance...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the frequency response characteristics of three behind-the-ear hearing aids alone and in combination with three FM auditory trainers. The hearing aids and FM auditory trainers were coupled using two different methods: direct audio input and personal mini-loop. Also, two different gain control settings were used. Frequency responses were evaluated using a template method specified in ANSI S 3. 22 1982 standards. A larger percentage of the personal mini-loop combinations failed to meet this ANSI standard {{as compared to the}} direct audio input combinations (72. 3 % vs. 50 %). The frequency response curves for various combinations of hearing aids and FM auditory trainers were also separated into high and low frequency bands. Significant changes in output were found for the low frequency region, and these changes were dependent upon the coupling method. Specifically, the personal mini-loop tended to produce a significant reduction in output in the low frequency band as compared to that of the hearing aid alone. The use of direct audio input resulted in a significant increase in output in the low frequency band as compared to that of the hearing aid alone. This latter method produced the best overall agreement with the hearing aid frequency response, especially when the FM <b>auditory</b> <b>trainer</b> was set at full on gain and the hearing aid at a low gain setting...|$|E
40|$|Two sets of {{synthetic}} sentences were tape recorded through two identical hearing aids at different distances from the talker in {{a background of}} noise. The recordings were made during a regular session of a hearing-impaired nursery program. One hearing aid was approximately 2. 5 meters from the talker and constituted the "Far " condition, while a second aid was ap-proximately 25 centimeters from the talker and constituted the "Near " condition. The two aids led to separate channels of a tape recorder. Sentences under the two conditions were recorded simultaneously on the two channels of the recorder. The tape was played back to eleven normal listeners. Their sentence identification scores were 10 percent for the "Far" and 98. 5 percent for the "Near " condition. These results sup-port recommendations that personnel working with hearing-impaired children should talk as near {{as possible to the}} microphone of the aided child. Talking near the microphone improves speech reception through hearing aids, <b>auditory</b> <b>trainers</b> or any other electroacoustic system...|$|R
40|$|Research {{evidence}} indicates that hearing aids and <b>auditory</b> <b>trainers</b> worn by school children routinely malfunction. Ensuring properly functioning amplification is a preferred educational practice and is required by PL 94 - 142 regulations. Research was needed to determine if schools were complying with the regulations and recommended educational procedures. This study described and evaluated procedures used by educational agencies to monitor and maintain amplification units worn by hearing-impaired students. Two examiner-developed survey intruments were mailed to residential and public day school teachers and administrators to collect data and answer 11 research questions pertaining to: (1) monitoring and maintenance procedures, (2) relationships between demographic, personnel, and placement characteristics and preferred monitoring and maintenance practices, and (3) monitoring and maintenance practices compared with a model of preferred practice. Personnel were surveyed in one residential school for the deaf in each state and a stratified random sample of 200 public day schools. A total of 310 (63 %) surveys were returned from 164 (65. 6 %) administrators and 146 (58. 4 %) teachers. Results indicated {{that the majority of}} programs had some system of monitoring and maintaining amplification units, but only 54. 1 % (73) performed daily checks of hearing aids and 58. 3 % (67) performed daily checks of <b>auditory</b> <b>trainers.</b> Teachers in 76. 9 % of the sample reported that electroacoustic analysis was available as one part of audiologic evaluation, but not usually scheduled on a routine basis. Teachers were responsible for monitoring activities in over 75 % of programs, regardless of the educational model: self-contained, resource, or itinerant. Significant positive relationships were found between (1) program size and one preferred monitoring and maintenance variable, (2) full-time audiologist and three preferred variables, (3) residential school placement and four preferred variables, (4) inservice training and three preferred variables, (5) full-time audiologist and program size and (6) full-time audiologist and residential school placement. These and additional findings suggest that while some improvement in monitoring and maintenance practices has occurred since the implementation of PL 94 - 142, full compliance by employing preferred professional practices has not been achieved. Recommendations are made for improving personnel preparation, monitoring and maintenance practices, and research...|$|R
