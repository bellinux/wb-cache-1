To identify the genetic cause of the complex I deficiency, we screened the gene encoding the NDUFS 1 subunit. We report 3 patients with low residual complex I activity expressed in cultured fibroblasts, which displayed novel mutations in the NDUFS 1 gene. One mutation introduces a premature stop codon, 3 mutations cause a substitution of amino acids and another mutation a deletion of one amino acid. The fibroblasts of the patients display a decreased amount and activity of complex I. In addition, a disturbed <b>assembly</b> <b>pattern</b> was observed. These results suggest that NDUFS 1 is a prime candidate to screen for disease-causing mutations in patients with a very low residual complex I activity in cultured fibroblasts...|$|E
40|$|New {{memories}} are labile, {{but over time}} {{some of them are}} stabilized. This thesis investigates the network mechanisms in the brain underlying the gradual consolidation of memory representations. Specifically, I performed a causal test of the long-standing hypothesis that the offline reactivation of new, memory-representing cell assemblies supports memory consolidation by stabilizing those assemblies and increasing the likelihood of their later reinstatementâand therefore presumably of memory recall. I performed multi-unit extracellular recordings in the dorsal CA 1 region of behaving mice, from which I detected short-timescale (25 ms) co-activation patterns of principal neurons during exploration of open-field enclosures. These cell assembly patterns appeared to represent space as their expression was spatially tuned and environment specific; and these patterns were preferentially reactivated during sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) in subsequent sleep. Importantly, after exposure to a novelâbut not a familiarâenclosure, the strength with which an <b>assembly</b> <b>pattern</b> was reactivated predicted its later reinstatement strength during context re-exposure. Moreover, optogenetic silencing of hippocampal pyramidal neurons during on-the-fly detected SWRs during the sleep following exposure to a novelâbut again not a familiarâenclosure impaired subsequent <b>assembly</b> <b>pattern</b> reinstatement. These results are direct evidence for a causal role of SWR-associated reactivation in the stability of new hippocampal cell assemblies. Surprisingly, offline reactivation was only important for the stability of a subset of the assembly patterns expressed in a novel enclosure. Optogenetic SWR silencing only impaired the reinstatement of "gradually strengthened" patterns that had had a significant increasing trend in their expression strength throughout the initial exposure session. Consistent with this result, a positive correlation between reactivation and subsequent reinstatement was only found for these gradually strengthened patterns and not for the other, "early stabilized" patterns. An interesting interpretation is that the properties of the gradually strengthened patterns are all consistent with the Hebbian postulate of "fire together, wire together". To enable investigation of the relation between interneurons and principal cell assembly patterns from extracellular recordings, as a final contribution this thesis describes a statistical framework for the unsupervised classification of interneurons based on their firing properties alone. </p...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{ability to}} {{reinstate}} neuronal assemblies representing mnemonic information {{is thought to}} require their consolidation through offline reactivation during sleep/rest. To test this, we detected cell <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> formed by repeated neuronal co-activations in the mouse hippocampus during exploration of spatial environments. We found that the reinstatement of <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> representing a novel, but not a familiar, environment correlated with their offline reactivation and was impaired by closed-loop optogenetic disruption of sharp wave-ripple oscillations. Moreover, we discovered that reactivation was only required for the reinstatement of <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> whose expression was gradually strengthened during encoding of a novel place. The context-dependent reinstatement of <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> whose expression did not gain in strength beyond {{the first few minutes}} of spatial encoding was not dependent on reactivation. This demonstrates that the hippocampus can hold concurrent representations of space that markedly differ in their encoding dynamics and their dependence on offline reactivation for consolidation.

This study evaluated trait-convergence <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> and trait-divergence <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> in successional areas of Araucaria forest. Plant species were sampled in both {{the upper and lower}} strata and were described by 15 functional traits. Data analyses were based on multiplication and Procrustes adjustment of matrices, which permit to discriminate trait-convergence <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> and trait-divergence <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> along the forest succession (our environmental variable), and the influence of phylogeny on these patterns. Initial and late forests were highly different in species composition, but the regenerating stratum was already more similar especially in functional terms. Traits related to the acquisitive-conservative trade-off (wood density, leaf nitrogen content, leaf area, leaf dry matter content) revealed strong convergent patterns of successional changes. Moreover divergence was maximized by specific leaf area, seed mass, deciduousness, and dispersal mode, showing a higher functional diversity in late Araucaria forests...|$|R

There is almost no {{information}} on the structural orga- nization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This <b>assembly</b> <b>pattern</b> generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specializa- tion. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (num- ber of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organi- zation that may be relevant for our understanding of the organi- zation and persistence of biodiversity. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The fixture {{plays an important role}} in satisfying the intimate metal fit-up that laser weld requires. The fixturing quality for sheet metal laser welding is directly related to the <b>assembly</b> weld <b>patterns</b> used (weld location, weld length, etc.). The design of <b>assembly</b> weld <b>patterns</b> is a critical phase in the fixture design cycle. Traditionally, the determination of the weld pattern is based on the designer's experience.

However, the molecular mechanisms that generate such tension remain unknown. We found that Tuba, which is a Cdc 42 -specific GEF, was concentrated at the apical-most region of cell junctions in simple epithelia via its interaction with ZO- 1. RNAi–mediated depletion of Tuba altered the geometrical configuration of cell junctions, resulting in a curved and slack appearance. At the subcellular level, Tuba inactivation modified the <b>assembly</b> <b>pattern</b> of junctional F-actin and E-cadherin. Tuba RNAi also retarded cell junction formation in calcium-switch experiments. Suppression of Cdc 42 activity or depletion of N-WASP, which is an effector of Cdc 42, mimicked the effects of Tuba depletion. Conversely, overexpression of dominant-active Cdc 42 or N-WASP enhanced the junction formation of Tuba-depleted cells.

In each case only one major polypeptide was demonstrated, although some strains possessed apparently sheathed flagella. Considerable differences in the molecular weight of flagellin accompanied the previously described structural differences between flagella from strains with different H antigens. The relationship between flagellar diameter and the molecular weight of the corresponding flagellins was similar for both unsheathed and apparently sheathed flagella. Cross-polymerization occurred between seed consisting of fragments of unsheathed flagella and flagellin solution from apparently sheathed flagella and vice versa. Co-polymerization of flagellin from unsheathed flagella and flagellin from apparently sheathed flagella was also demonstrated. These polymerization experiments indicate that the <b>assembly</b> <b>pattern</b> of flagellin molecules is probably the same in all E. coli flagella.

Here we show that remembering newly-learnt goal locations requires the NMDA receptor-dependent stabilization and enhanced reactivation of goal-related hippocampal assemblies. During spatial learning, place-related firing patterns in the CA 1, but not CA 3, region of the rat hippocampus were reorganized to represent new goal locations. Such reorganization did not occur when goals were marked by visual cues. The stabilization and successful retrieval of these newly-acquired CA 1 representations for behaviorally-relevant places was NMDAR-dependent and necessary for subsequent memory retention performance. Goal-related <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> associated with sharp wave/ripple network oscillations, during both learning and subsequent rest periods, predicted memory performance.

The 32 S and 45 S ribosomal particles (precursors to 50 S subunits) and 21 S ribosomal particles (precursors to 30 S subunits) accumulate under these conditions. They are authentic precursors, not degraded or dead-end particles. The 21 S particles are shown, {{by way of a}} modified 3 ′ 5 ′ RACE procedure, to contain 16 S rRNA unprocessed, or processed at its 5 ′ end, and not at the 3 ′ end. This implies that maturation of 16 S rRNA is ordered and starts at its 5 ′-terminus, and that the 3 ′-terminus is trimmed at a later step. This observation is not limited to heat stress conditions, but it also can be verified in bacteria growing at a normal temperature (30 °C), supporting the idea that this is the general pathway. Assembly defects at very high temperature are partially compensated by plasmid-driven overexpression of the DnaK/DnaJ chaperones.

The novel sulfonate analogue (4) was formed by displacement of the phenylphosphonate dimer anion in (3) by a phenylsulfonate anion (Route B). This reaction also proved reversible.

An embryonic chicken muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) cDNA was linked to constitutive promoters from adenovirus or SV 40 and transiently expressed in COS cells. These cells accumulate hybrid myosin molecules composed of muscle MHCs and endogenous, nonmuscle, myosin light chains. The muscle myosin is found associated with a Triton insoluble fraction from extracts of the COS cells by immunoprecipitation and is detected in 2. 4 +/- 0. 8 -micron-long filamentous structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm by immunofluorescence microscopy. These structures are shown by immunoelectron microscopy to correspond to loosely organized bundles of 12 - 16 -nm-diameter myosin filaments. The muscle and nonmuscle MHCs are segregated in the transfected cells; the endogenous nonmuscle myosin displays a normal distribution pattern along stress fibers and does not colocalize with the muscle myosin filament bundles.

Key features in the methodology, such as power weighting of batch reactivity values and correlation of neutron leakage effects with peripheral assembly power, were verified against results generated using detailed state-of the- art computer analyses. A relation between batch power fraction and batch reactivity was derived from a 1 / 2 -group diffusion theory model, and similarly validated. These prescriptions have been used in two ways: to develop analytical models which allow quick scoping calculations; and, programmed into a code, to facilitate more rigorous applications. The methodo! logy has been applied to evaluate fuel management schemes of contemporary interest, {{such as the use of}} burnable poison to shape the power history profile, the use of low-leakage fuel loading patterns, and extended cycle length/ burnup, and combinations of these individual schemes.

However, the distinct choline-binding ability and their substrate-binding surfaces may reflect a divergent evolution directed by the different roles played by them in the host (LytC) or in the bacteriophage (Cpl- 1). The tight binding of LytC to the pneumococcal envelope, mediated by the acquisition of additional choline-binding repeats, could facilitate the regulation of the potentially suicidal activity of this autolysin. In contrast, a looser attachment of Cpl- 1 to the cell wall {{and the establishment of}} more favourable interactions between its highly negatively charged catalytic surface and the positively charged chains of pneumococcal murein could enhance the lytic activity of the parasite-encoded enzyme and therefore liberation of the phage progeny. © 2005 Biochemical Society.

30|$|Single-molecule force {{spectroscopy}} is {{an ideal}} technique to study the structural change of biological macromolecules, especially the nucleosome and chromatin fibers. By applying different external forces on the single chromatin fiber or mononucleosome, we can manipulate conformational changes of the molecule, which could be monitored by tracking {{the extension of the}} chromatin fiber or mononucleosome. We can also deduce the stability and <b>assembly</b> <b>pattern</b> of the chromatin fiber or mononucleosome by analyzing the step size and the transition force of structural intermediates. The main techniques of single-molecular force spectroscopy include atomic force microscopy (AFM; Piontek and Roos 2018), optical tweezers (Neuman and Block 2004), and magnetic tweezers (Gosse and Croquette 2002). AFM captures biological macromolecules by a chemically modified probe and applies a pulling force, but the pulling force is usually very large {{and it is difficult to}} ensure only one single-molecule is captured. The optical tweezers require the two ends of molecule binding to two polystyrene beads respectively, and then the optical tweezers grab the polystyrene beads through the optical traps constructed by the laser, and then move the laser to apply the pulling force. Optical tweezers can achieve relatively high resolution (Abbondanzieri et al. 2005; Mahamdeh and Schäffer 2009), but it is difficult to keep constant force when tracking the conformational changes. Besides that, optical tweezers are not suitable for long time measurement, because high-intensity laser may damage the sample (Simpson et al. 1998). The magnetic tweezers connect the two ends of biological macromolecules to surface and paramagnetic bead respectively, and then apply the pulling force with an external magnetic field. Magnetic tweezers can track many biological macromolecules at the same time, but the resolution is slightly lower than optical tweezers. In this paper, we report a strategy to study the structural dynamics of chromatin fibers based on single-molecule magnetic tweezers. We modified the magnetic tweezers by adopting solid-microscope optical system, large-field objective lens, and high-speed sampling CCD camera to improve the time resolution of magnetic tweezers and the number of magnetic beads tracked at the same time. We also developed a home-built control software of magnetic tweezers based on LabVIEW to achieve more advanced bead tracking and data analysis algorithm, which further improves the resolution of magnetic beads position and pulling force. The chromatin fiber labeled with either biotin or digoxigenin at the two ends of DNA was reconstituted in vitro and attached to the modified magnetic tweezers. The extensions of chromatin fibers under different tension were recorded at single-molecule level to trace the dynamic structural transition. This strategy provides a new research platform to dissect the structural dynamics of chromatin fiber and its regulation by different chromatin factors.|$|E

He held his first [...] "Holy Convocation", based on Leviticus 23, in Madras in 1941. After this, the convocations were held annually in Madras and Hyderabad in the South, and in Ahmedabad and Kalimpong in the North. The one in Hyderabad was always the largest, drawing up to 25,000 participants. They would eat and sleep in huge tents, and meet under a large thatched pandal for hours-long prayer, praise and teaching meetings that began at dawn and ended late at night. The care and feeding of guests was handled by volunteers. Expenses for the meetings were given by voluntary offerings; no appeals were issued.|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing the MAQAO loop static analyzer, we {{characterize}} a {{corpus of}} binary loops extracted from common benchmark suits such as SPEC, NAS, etc. and several industrial applications. For each loop, MAQAO extracts low-level assembly features such as: integer and floating-point vectorization ratio, number of registers used and spill-fill, number of concurrent memory streams accessed, etc. The distributions {{of these features}} on a large representative code corpus {{can be used to}} evaluate compilers and architectures and tune them for the most frequently used <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns.</b> In this paper, we present the MAQAO loop analyzer and a characterization of the 4857 binary loops. We evaluate register allocation and vectorization on two compilers and propose a method to tune loop buffer size and stream prefetcher based on static analysis of benchmarks...|$|R
40|$|Investigation {{of viruses}} in the {{environment}} often requires the amplification of viral DNA before sequencing of viral metagenomes. In this study, {{two of the most}} widely used amplification methods, the linker amplified shotgun library (LASL) and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) methods, were applied to a sample from the seawater surface. Viral DNA was extracted from viruses concentrated by tangential flow filtration and amplified by these two methods. 454 pyrosequencing was used to read the metagenomic sequences from different libraries. The resulting taxonomic classifications of the viruses, their functional assignments, and <b>assembly</b> <b>patterns</b> differed substantially depending on the amplification method. Only double-stranded DNA viruses were retrieved from the LASL, whereas most sequences in the MDA library were from single-stranded DNA viruses, and double-stranded DNA viral sequences were minorities. Thus, the two amplification methods reveal different aspects of viral diversity...|$|R
