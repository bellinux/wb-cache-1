5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} <b>appropriate</b> <b>arrangements</b> for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E

30|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this article is}} organized as follows. The relation between polynomial matrix decomposition and DFT matrix decomposition is formulated in Section 2. In Section 3, two important spectral properties of decomposition, namely spectral majorization and smooth decomposition, are provided using <b>appropriate</b> <b>arrangement</b> of singular values (eigenvalues) and corresponding singular vectors (eigenvectors). The equality of polynomial matrix and dft matrix decomposed matrices decompositions are guaranteed via the finite duration constraint, which is investigated in Section 4. The finite duration constraint imposes the phase angles of singular vector (eigenvector) to minimize a nonlinear quadratic function. A solution for this problem is proposed in Section 5. Section 6 presents the results of some computer simulations which are considered to demonstrate performance of the proposed decomposition algorithm.|$|R
