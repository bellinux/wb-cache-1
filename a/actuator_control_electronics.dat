In this study, thermopiezoelastic characteristics of piezoelectric beam continua are studied and applications of the theory to active structures in sensing and optimal control are discussed. Using linear thermopiezoelastic theory and Timoshenko assumptions, a generic thermopiezoelastic theory for piezolaminated composite beam is derived.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{users of}} today's {{commercial}} prosthetic hands {{are not given}} any conscious sensory feedback. To overcome this deficiency in prosthetic hands we have recently proposed a sensory feedback system utilising a "tactile display" on the remaining amputation residual limb acting as man-machine interface. Our system uses the recorded pressure in a hand prosthesis and feeds back this pressure onto the forearm skin. Here we describe the design and technical solution of the sensory feedback system aimed at hand prostheses for trans-radial/humeral amputees. Critical parameters for the sensory feedback system were investigated. Methods A sensory feedback system consisting of five <b>actuators,</b> <b>control</b> <b>electronics</b> and a test application running on a computer has been designed and built. Firstly, we investigate which force levels were applied to the forearm skin of the user while operating the sensory feedback system. Secondly, we study if the proposed system could be used together with a myoelectric control system. The displacement of the skin caused by the sensory feedback system would generate artefacts in the recorded myoelectric signals. Accordingly, EMG recordings were performed and {{an analysis of the}} these are included. The sensory feedback system was also preliminarily evaluated in a laboratory setting on two healthy non-amputated test subjects with a computer generating the stimuli, with regards to spatial resolution and force discrimination. Results We showed that the sensory feedback system generated approximately proportional force to the angle of control. The system can be used together with a myoelectric system as the artefacts, generated by the actuators, were easily removed using a simple filter. Furthermore, the application of the system on two test subjects showed {{that they were able to}} discriminate tactile sensation with regards to spatial resolution and level of force. Conclusions The results of these initial experiments in non-amputees indicate that the proposed tactile display, in its simple form, can be used to relocate tactile input from an artificial hand to the forearm and that the system can coexist with a myoelectric control systems. The proposed system may be a valuable addition to users of myoelectric prosthesis providing conscious sensory feedback during manipulation of objects. </p...|$|R
40|$|Environment {{and fire}} risks {{together}} with high maintenance costs generate the main drive {{in recent years}} to replace hydraulic actuators in aircrafts by electromechanical actuators. However, conventional electromagnetic motors with reduction gears increase the weight of the drive train and require high electrical peak power due to the kinetic energy of the drive train during anti-skid operation. Thus, actuators with high torque or force at low speed and very low inertia are needed. A promising candidate as novel brake actuator is the multi-mass ultrasonic motor (MM-USM) derived from the well known travelling-wave type motor (TW-USM), which is the subject of the European project PIBRAC.

40|$|Performance of {{contemporary}} high-tech equipment {{is more and}} more determined by accuracy. Positional deviations due to high frequent vibrations in the floor can be suppressed by mounting the equipment on a frame that acts as a low-pass filter, but low frequent deviations and deviations due to motions inside the machine can only be reduced by increasing the machine frame stiffness. When only passive elements are used during design, large stiffness can only be attained with rigid bodies, which often exhibit bad dynamic behaviour. In case a machine should be both accurate and fast, a design with active elements should be considered. The Smart Disc is an example of such an active element. It integrates a piezoelectric sensor, a piezoelectric <b>actuator</b> and <b>control</b> <b>electronics,</b> such that it expands when it experiences a compressing force, and vice versa. Insertion of Smart Discs at discrete locations in a machine might compensate for the lack of frame stiffness. To evaluate the feasibility of the Smart Disc concept an experimental set-up has been designed. Though only one prototype Smart Disc is utilised, the set-up resembles a large class of machines suffering from deviations caused by the non-infinite frame stiffness and non-filtered vibrations in the floor. Experiments with this set-up show a reduction of the positional error of interest in the order of 20 dB in a frequency range of 0. 1 to 10 Hz. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction We have {{developed}} a low-cost stopcock valve actuator for radiochemistry automation built using a stepper motor and an Arduino, an open-source single-board microcontroller. The con-troller hardware can be programmed to run by serial communication or via two 5 – 24 V digital lines for simple integration into any automation control system. This valve actuator allows for automated use of a single, disposable stopcock, providing a number of advantages over stopcock manifold systems available on many commercial radiochemistry rigs or over using solenoid valves. This actuator allows for the use {{a wide variety of}} stopcocks, ranging in size, shape and material, giving flexibility to be used in a large variety of applications. Material and Methods The actuated valve consists of two main parts, the <b>actuator</b> and the <b>control</b> <b>electronics.</b> The <b>actuator</b> consists of a stepper motor, an infrared ‘home position’ sensor, a stopcock backplate, and a coupler from the driveshaft to stopcock handle. The stepper motor is a NEMA- 17 size that runs 200 steps/rotation with a 5 mm drive shaft. The coupler is an interchangeable part, custom to each stopcock model, with each part drilled out to fit the motor drive shaft and milled out for a tight fit to the stopcock handle. The backplane consists of a plate offset from the motor body with 5 screws positioned to keep the stopcock body from rotating relative to the motor. A reflective optical sensor (Vishay TCRT 1000) is used as a limit switch to determine a ‘home’ position for the stopcock. With a slight modification to most any stopcock in cutting off a tab that limits rotation, the handle can rotate 360 °. This allows for opening all three ports to each other, which has been done to all stopcocks used with this <b>actuator.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>electronics</b> consist of an Arduino Uno board and a motor shield (add-on board), connecting to the actuator by an Ethernet cable. The motor shield functions to interface the low-power Arduino circuitry with a high power H-bridge motor driver circuit. The Arduino runs two sets of code, initialization and its loop. The initialization routine runs when power is first powered up, and then continues to run the loop. The initialization routine rotates the valve until the IR limit switch is activated, and rotates an-other 45 ° from position home, sealing off all ports on the stopcock. Following initialization, the Arduino enters its loop, which repeatedly compares its current position to its target posi-tion. When the target position and current posi-tion do not match, the stepper motor turns in the shortest direction towards its target position. The hardware can be interfaced by either serial communication or by two 5 – 24 V digital signals defining positions 1 – 4. The wide range of allowed input signal voltages is realized by using an optocoupler that accepts 5 – 24 V inputs but outputs TTL signals compatible with the Arduino’s hardware. Results and Conclusion A photo of the implementation of the actuator is shown in FIGURE 1. It has overall dimensions of 3. 5 × 1. 75 × 2. 5 ”, excluding a mounting bracket. <b>Control</b> <b>electronics</b> are housed in a compact box built for an Arduino, giving the control electron-ics a clean, professional look.

40|$|Tuned {{vibration}} absorbers {{have become}} common for passive vibration reduction in many industrial applications. Lightly damped absorbers (also called neutralizers) {{can be used}} to suppress narrowband disturbances by tuning them to the excitation frequency. If the resonance is adapted in-operation, the performance of those devices can be significantly enhanced, or inertial mass can be decreased. However, the integration of <b>actuators,</b> sensors and <b>control</b> <b>electronics</b> into the system raises new design challenges. In this work, the development of adaptive-passive systems for vibration reduction at an industrial scale is presented. As an example, vibration reduction of a ship engine was studied in a full scale test. Simulations were used to study the feasibility and evaluate the system concept at an early stage. Several ways to adjust the resonance of the neutralizer were evaluated, including piezoelectric actuation and common mechatronic drives. Prototypes were implemented and tested. Since vibration absorbers suffer from high dynamic loads, reliability tests were used to assess the long-term behavior under operational conditions and to improve the components. It was proved that the adaptive systems are capable to withstand the mechanical loads in an industrial application. Also a control strategy had to be implemented in order to track the excitation frequency. The most mature concepts were integrated into the full scale test. An imbalance exciter was used to simulate the engine vibrations at a realistic level experimentally. The neutralizers were tested at varying excitation frequencies to evaluate the tracking capabilities of the control system. It was proved that a significant vibration reduction is possible...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{microactuator}} limitations prevent {{control of}} small-scale, spin-stabilized vehicles. These applications require actuators insensitive to shock that have {{forces on the}} order of Newtons and millisecond control periods. This research presents batch-fabrication lamination approaches for the realization of large arrays of high-impulse, short-duration gas generator actuators (GGAs), and system implementation approaches to integrate these GGAs into a small-scale, spin-stabilized projectile for the purpose of generating steering forces on the projectile. Electronic packaging and MEMS processing are combined to batch-fabricate millimeter-scale GGAs insensitive to large shocks. Robust, prefabricated thermoplastic and metal films are patterned by laser machining or photolithography, and multilayer devices are assembled by adhesive lamination. The GGAs remained operational after 10, 000 g shocks. Optimized design and propellant selection enables control of the force profile and actuation timing. Rapid force rise times are achieved using appropriately selected solid propellants and specially designed hot-wire igniters that create a larger combustion fronts. By reshaping the combustion profile of the solid propellant, tens of Newtons are generated within milliseconds. In addition to force control, the timing of the force application was controllable to within 1 ms for optimized GGAs. Performance results demonstrate that GGA actuator arrays actuate within appropriate timescales and with enough authority to control a 40 mm projectile with a spin rate of 60 Hz. After <b>actuator</b> characterization, GGAs, <b>control</b> <b>electronics,</b> and power supply are mounted into a 40 mm diameter projectile, and a full flight system was flown to demonstrate divert authority of the GGAs.
