Although {{only a handful}} of solicitors acquired higher rights as the first batch of advocates in 1994, they included some of the most senior figures in the legal establishment of the time, such as Sir David Napley, founding partner of Kingsley Napley. Approximately 4,000 advocates have since been authorised for crime, civil, or both. They represent a wide spectrum of experience.|$|R
50|$|Marriageable {{age and the}} {{marriage}} of minors is dealt with in Part II (s10-21). In the original 1961 law, marriageable age was set at 16 for females and 18 for males, but the age was equalised in 1991 by the Sex Discrimination Amendment Act 1991 which raised {{the marriage}}able age of females to 18. If there are 'unusual and exceptional circumstances’, the marriage of one person aged 16 or 17 to another aged over 18 is possible, subject to {{the consent of the}} younger person's parents and <b>authorisation</b> <b>by</b> a <b>court.</b> Part II establishes the procedures required in this instance. Prior to the 1991 change, the 'unusual and exceptional circumstances' procedures applied to a girl aged 14 or 15 (wanting to marry a male aged 18 or above) or a male aged 16 or 17 (wanting to marry a female aged 16 or above). For many years, courts have refused to accept the applicant's state of pregnancy as a pressing consideration in deciding whether to allow the marriage.|$|R

ECRI expressed concerns as regards to the authorisation of a gathering, commemorating soldiers who had fought in a Latvian unit of the Waffen SS, that takes place every year on 16 March and is held in the centre of Riga, and expressed dismay at the <b>authorisation</b> <b>by</b> the competent <b>courts</b> of an event set to celebrate the Nazi occupation of Riga (on 1 July). It also expressed concern, that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs had not condemned the march, and on the contrary, supported it. ECRI recommended, that “the Latvian authorities condemn all attempts to commemorate persons who fought in the Waffen SS and collaborated with the Nazis. ECRI further recommends that the authorities ban any gathering or march legitimising in any way Nazism.” On 13 March 2014, UK Labour MEP Richard Howitt, {{a spokesperson for the}} European Parliament Human Rights Sub-Committee issued a statement that included the view that [...] "Whether local boys were forced to don the SS uniforms or were eager volunteers, celebration of their actions not only insults the memory of the victims but also honours Nazism itself." [...] On his own website, MEP Howitt, citing the Waffen SS marches, criticized the UK Conservative Party for its alliance with nationalist elements in the Latvian government.|$|R

It was not unusual for Mass and the Divine Office in SSC parishes to be disrupted by Protestant protesters, some hired for the occasion, shouting during the readings and sermon or hurling furniture and books. Lawsuits were filed against priests for Catholic practices. Some of these prosecutions were successful and priests were suspended from their ministries. In other actions, some Catholic practices were permitted <b>by</b> the <b>courts</b> while others were ruled illegal. Still other practices were sometimes ruled <b>by</b> the civil <b>courts</b> not to be illegal per se but that their continued use would require direct <b>authorisation</b> <b>by</b> the diocesan bishop.|$|R

50|$|This is {{properly}} the correct {{usage of the}} term sheik according to the Sufis.
