5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> in Civil War presentations.|$|E

5|$|If Stellenbosch marked Smuts's {{intellectual}} awakening, it {{also was}} where he came to mature socially. Here he began to cast off the shyness and reserve which afflicted him, joining the local militia, becoming {{a regular contributor to}} the college magazine, and becoming leader of the Victoria College debating society. For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to grapple with the political <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> facing South Africa.|$|E

RepRisk data is used in the on-boarding process to screen potential new clients and sourcing partners, alongside periodic client reviews and, also, to evaluate the risks related to transactions in investment banking and institutional lending.|$|E
5|$|Mahaleo is a folk-pop {{band from}} Madagascar that is {{widely viewed as}} the most popular Malagasy group of all time. The band was founded by Dama (Rasolofondraosolo Zafimahaleo) with six of his classmates after first {{performing}} together during the rotaka student protests at their high school on 13 May 1972. Mahaleo's lyrics draw upon the indirect language of traditional hainteny and ohabolana (Malagasy poetry and proverbs) to expose contemporary political <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> and invite listeners to identify their own solutions.|$|E

5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E

His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader's notes in his characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday's books were even those of religious opponents. He was later charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by the noted agnostic Robert Ingersoll.|$|E
5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his political philosophy into political action. Having read Croly's The Promise of American Life and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in economic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues,</b> {{he joined the}} Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from the political <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time {{that he and his}} wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E

5|$|John Stuart Mill was {{impressed}} by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in The Malay Archipelago. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his Land Tenure Reform Association, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written {{only a handful of}} articles on political <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and land reform in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.|$|E
5|$|Tillman as {{governor}} initially took a strong stand against lynching. The Shell Manifesto, in reciting {{the ills of}} Conservative government, had blamed the Bourbons for encouraging lynching through bad laws and poor administration. Although Governor Richardson, Tillman's predecessor, had taken action to prevent such murders, they still occurred, with no one being prosecuted for them. In {{about half of the}} lynchings in South Carolina between 1881 and 1895, there were claims that the black victim had raped or tried to rape a white woman, though studies have shown that lynchings were tied to economic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues.</b> More lynchings took place in South Carolina in the 1890s than in any other decade, and in Edgefield and several other counties, such killings outnumbered lawful executions.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, {{relief work}} helped keep the women's {{societies}} in Wales active, though membership numbers began to fall. After the People's act of 1918, {{many of the}} regional branches began to wither. The Llangollen WSS resolved to disband in December 1918, handing their marching banner to the National Council, believing their work was done. While others, such as the Newport branch, revised their aims to form a Women's Citizen Association taking an active interest in welfare <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues.</b> Other branches continued the political vision of equal suffrage, notably Bangor, while the Cardiff WSS busied itself by attempting to secure the election of women to local government posts. The fact that the terms of enfranchisement were not equal to men ensured that the surviving suffragist societies still had a focus, and the first point of order was the bill to admit women as MPs. This was passed in October 1918 and seventeen women stood at the 1918 General Election. There was one female candidacy in Wales, Millicent Mackenzie, a former professor of education from the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, who unsuccessfully contested the newly formed University of Wales seat. It took until 1929 for Wales to return its first female MP, Megan Lloyd George, the youngest daughter of the former Prime Minister.|$|E
