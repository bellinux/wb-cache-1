5|$|A {{side effect}} of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied {{assertion}} of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he {{made a point of}} celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E

Martin Cameron scored his second goal for Alloa in the 104th minute to take a 4–3 lead but was cancelled out when Sheerin completed a hat-trick of goals for Inverness to make it 4–4 <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> game to penalties.

5|$|An {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} ministry, the tunnel company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to build the tunnel. The company {{had the right to}} collect tolls for up to 15 years on fees dictated by the county municipality, and would have to pay NOK27 million for the tunnel, with the county paying {{for the rest of the}} costs. The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with the tunnel company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls. An {{agreement was}} made with Selmer, whereby they would charge NOK59,422,500 <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> risk of the project, including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases. They were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim the investments should it be proven impossible to build the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British {{would not be able to}} see them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, and Montgomery ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided and Montgomery called off the attack. As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E

5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Ernest was {{an active}} member of the House of Lords, where he {{maintained}} an extremely conservative voting record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet and had fathered a son by his sister, Princess Sophia. Before Victoria succeeded to the British throne, it was rumoured that Ernest intended to murder her <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> throne himself. When King William IV died on 20 June 1837, Ernest acceded to the Hanoverian throne. Becoming Hanover's first ruler to reside in the state since George I, he had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy when he dismissed the Göttingen Seven (including the two Brothers Grimm) from their professorial positions for agitating against his policies.|$|E

5|$|For a while, Red and {{her pack}} are happy, feeding off the {{plentiful}} carrion left by receding flood waters, but the pack's {{way of life}} is upset by an invasion of large Acrocanthosaurus, huge meat-eating dinosaurs. The added competition for food puts strain on the pack, as does the unexpected death of one of the chicks. A fight erupts between the male raptor and Red's sister. Red, torn between a prospective mate and her kin, tries to defuse the situation. Two Acrocanthosaurus watch the commotion <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to attack the Utahraptor. Meanwhile, a Kronosaurus ambushes one of the chicks on the beach. Seeing the danger, Red lures the female Acrocanthosaurus into deep water where the larger predator is dragged under by the Kronosaurus. Red saves her family, but at a price—her consort is forced away by Red's sister.|$|E
5|$|France's {{claim to}} Madagascar as its {{protectorate}} was officially recognized by Britain in the Anglo-French agreement of 1890. Between 1890 and 1894, the French sought to aggressively claim {{what they believed}} to be the territorial rights established by the treaty. However, these French land claims and settlements were perceived by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony as an unjustifiable encroachment upon Malagasy sovereignty. Ultimately Charles Le Myre de Vilers was sent to persuade the queen and her prime minister to submit to the French interpretation of the treaty with the intent to launch a war <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> island by force if an agreement was not reached. The French offer was flatly refused and diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar were broken off in November 1894.|$|E

5|$|In regular time, Cardiff took {{an early}} lead with a penalty before Leicester's Scott Hamilton scored a {{converted}} try and they kicked another penalty.

Early in the second half, Geordan Murphy scored another try for Leicester, which again was converted and kicked two more penalties to extend their lead to 26–12 with 20 minutes remaining. Leicester then had two players sent to the sin bin, and Cardiff scored two tries in the last 10 minutes of regular time, first by Jamie Roberts and then Tom James, with both conversions successful to bring the scores level at 26–26 <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> game into extra time.|$|E
