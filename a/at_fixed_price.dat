An American put option is one exercise right of selling a share of underlying security (stock) <b>at</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>price,</b> E, any time up to expiry, T.

40|$|The very {{specific}} {{features of the}} spot prices, especially occurrence of severe jumps, create a spot price risk for retailers who purchase electricity at unregulated highly volatile prices but resell it to consumers <b>at</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>price.</b> Therefore, it is of high im- portance to forecast whether jump is likely to occur during the next hour. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, such research has not been devoted to the Czech power market yet. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to forecast the jump occurrence in the Czech day-ahead market. For this purpose we suggest four logit model spec- ifications, each containing various independent variables (for example, electricity demand, outside temperature, lagged price and various dummy variables) where the variable selection is supported by the previous literature and by the characteristic features of the spot prices. Within the in-sample period we compare the suggested models based on the values of pseudo-R squared and Bayesian information criterion. When evaluating the out-of sample performance of suggested models we apply jump prediction accuracy and confidence, but opposed to the previous literature we sug- gest a kind of sensitivity analysis which, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, has not be proposed by any other power research.

50|$|Beurtvaart was a Dutch line {{shipping}} {{system for}} (mostly) inland navigation, that existed {{from the late}} 15th century. It {{was a form of}} packet trade and a precursor of public transport. The beurtships transported passengers, livestock and freight along <b>fixed</b> routes <b>at</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>prices.</b> Departures were scheduled, with ships even sailing when not fully laden, and local authorities took legal measures to rule out the competition.|$|R

Ships of the beurtvaart carried passengers, {{livestock}} end freight along <b>fixed</b> routes <b>at</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>prices</b> with scheduled departures. Organised by the cities, it grew to an extensive and reliable network over the following century. Some of the cities arranged for international (seagoing) connections as well.|$|R

50|$|A {{stock option}} is {{a class of}} option. Specifically, a call option is the right (not obligation) to buy stock in the future <b>at</b> a <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> and a put option is the right (not obligation) to sell stock in the future <b>at</b> a <b>fixed</b> <b>price.</b> Thus, {{the value of a}} stock option changes in {{reaction}} to the underlying stock of which it is a derivative. The most popular method of valuing stock options is the Black Scholes model. Apart from call options granted to employees, most stock options are transferable.|$|R
40|$|Firms seeking {{initial public}} listings on the Stock Exchange of Singapore can choose between {{offering}} their shares <b>at</b> a <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> or selling them in two tranches: the first tranche is offered <b>at</b> a <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> while the issue {{price of the}} second tranche is determined via a tender system. Consistent with the existing signalling literature, tendering IPO firms underprice their <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> tranche more than non-tendering IPO firms. The underpricing in the fixed tranche is recouped through higher proceeds from the tender tranche. Our evidence suggests that IPO firms use the tender option to signal superior firm quality.
