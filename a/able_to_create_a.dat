5|$|Critics {{found the}} Game Gear port {{to be well}} done given the system's less {{powerful}} technology. Electronic Gaming Monthly staff called {{it one of the}} best portable action games. Richard Leadbetter of Sega Magazine believed that since much of the Genesis verions's playability came from the system's technical capabilities, the Game Gear version suffers in that sense; however, he still believed Treasure was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> fun 8-bit port.|$|E
5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} in early 1967. A race of people were wiped out by powerful robots that they created. The robots having become so advanced that they are then <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new race of people. The robots then fear that these new humans will dominate them, and when the Doctor arrives on their planet, they take this as proof of their fears.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E

5|$|Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, 3329 {{images of}} the star WASP-13 by the SuperWASP-North program based at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands led to the {{identification}} of WASP-13 as host to a potentially transiting object. Photometric follow-up observations were taken on February 16, 2008 using the James Gregory Telescope (JGT) in Scotland, which took 1047 exposures of the star, although the last twenty images taken were obscured by cloud cover and were discarded. Using HD 80408 as a reference star along with JGT measurements, the astronomers investigating the system were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> light curve for the transiting planet.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} grown from five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E
5|$|Costa Gomes {{argued that}} African {{soldiers}} were cheaper and were better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> {{relationship with the}} local populace, a tactic similar to the 'hearts and minds' strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory {{at the very end}} stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga {{on the eve of the}} Portuguese coup in 1974 – the Carnation Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war.|$|E

5|$|Jean and Reiss left The Simpsons {{after its}} fourth season {{in order to}} create The Critic, an {{animated}} show about film critic Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz); the show was executive produced by Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. The Critic was moved to the Fox network for its second season. Since The Simpsons also aired on that network, Brooks was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> crossover between it and The Critic.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then he should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-1940s, {{the school}} {{required}} {{students to be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> simple electric motor regardless of their major. During World War II, as an engineering school with strong military ties through its ROTC program, Georgia Tech was swiftly enlisted for the war effort. In early 1942 the traditional nine-month semester system {{was replaced by a}} year-round trimester year, enabling students to complete their degrees a year earlier. Under the plan, students were allowed to complete their engineering degrees while on active duty. During World War II, Georgia Tech was one of 131 colleges and universities that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. The school was also one of only five U.S. colleges feeding into the United States Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|As {{development}} continued, id Software hired {{their former}} Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud {{as an assistant}} artist, and moved the company out to Mesquite, Texas, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their royalty rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ScubaVenture, so that id could focus on Wolfenstein. The game {{was intended to be}} released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. Upon finding out that the team was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> level in a single day, using {{a modified version of the}} Commander Keen 2D map editor, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increased}} running time, budget and facilities, the team {{were able to}} include more cels in animations, as well as longer and more intricate action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, who handled the opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown the research team round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire story in a twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E

5|$|The Congress disbanded in {{the third}} week of December, and the next step would be a {{congress}} at Laibach to discuss intervention with Ferdinand. Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress, overseeing Ferdinand's rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before. Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March. The Congress was adjourned but, forewarned or by luck, Metternich kept representatives of the powers close at hand until the revolt was put down. As a result, when similar revolts broke out in Piedmont in the middle of March, Metternich had the Tsar at hand, who agreed to send 90,000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity. Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich's policy was too expensive. He responded that Naples and Piedmont would pay for stability; nonetheless, he, too, was clearly worried for the future of Italy. He was relieved when <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> Court Chancellor and Chancellor of State on 25 May, a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794. He was also pleased at the renewed (if fragile) closeness between Austria, Prussia and Russia; however, it had {{come at the expense of}} the Anglo-Austrian entente.|$|E
