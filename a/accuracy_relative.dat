The criterion validity of accuracy was established under controlled conditions using an instrumented Gimbal table.

Static and absolute accuracy was assessed by comparing the AHRS orientation measurement to those obtained using an optical gold standard. <b>Relative</b> <b>accuracy</b> was assessed by measuring the variation in relative orientation between modules during trials. Evaluated AHRS systems demonstrated good absolute static accuracy (mean error < 0. 5 (o)) and clinically acceptable absolute accuracy under condition of slow motions (mean error between 0. 5 (o) and 3. 1 (o)). In slow motions, <b>relative</b> <b>accuracy</b> varied from 2 (o) to 7 (o) {{depending on the type of}} AHRS and the type of rotation.
