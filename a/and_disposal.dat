5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the health}} effects of mercury exposure, {{industrial}} and commercial uses are regulated in many countries.

5|$|Governments {{around the}} world are {{considering}} a range of waste management <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions.

5|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, city leaders debated the {{responsibility}} and expense {{of creating a}} waterworks system <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s {{as a sign of}} prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. With little regard for beauty, steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT {{for violating}} the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its {{hazardous}} waste storage <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they {{may be used for}} the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon-dioxide sequestration, <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of dredge spoils.|$|E

5|$|The large {{population}} in Antananarivo {{and the high}} density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation and access to clean drinking water. Processing <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of industrial and residential waste is inadequate. Waste water is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhausts, residential coal-burning stoves and other sources is worsening. While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density, worsening access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city. Antananarivo {{is one of the}} two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.|$|E
5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of urban solid waste.|$|E
