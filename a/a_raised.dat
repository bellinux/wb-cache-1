5|$|Per Jared Cohon's {{announcement}} {{on the day}} of the Last Lecture, <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> pedestrian bridge at CMU that connects the Gates Computer Science building and the Purnell Center for the Arts is named after Pausch, symbolizing the way he linked the two disciplines.|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> earth {{mound and}} {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Memorial stands upon <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> mound {{ringed by}} five boxwoods within the {{original}} section of Indian Mound Cemetery, {{not far from}} the cemetery's entrance. Several family interment plots surround the memorial and its circular raised lawn. A burial ground where Confederate and Union dead were buried during the American Civil War lies adjacent to the memorial.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>raise</b> of five {{does not}} mean {{anything}} more than unwillingness to pass, if the bid is below 160. Above 160, <b>a</b> <b>raise</b> of 5 means that being the declarer {{would not be a}} disaster.|$|R
5|$|The game {{is played}} on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is {{referred}} to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} comprises a {{base with}} obelisk and capstone, standing on <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> mound. The list of 125 names engraved on the monument includes four captains, seven lieutenants (one {{of which was}} a chaplain), three sergeants, and 119 privates. The memorial underwent a restoration in 1984, and is decorated annually with a handmade evergreen garland and wreath on Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{positioned}} {{on the southern}} edge of Rushbeds Wood, a surviving part of the Bernwood Forest. It was on the western side of the level crossing over Kingswood Lane. Intended primarily for goods use, Wood Siding initially had no facilities for passengers, and the platform was simply <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> earth bank.|$|E

5|$|The trial {{opened on}} 1 June 1891 and {{entry to the}} court was by ticket only. The Prince of Wales was present, and sat on a red leather chair on <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> {{platform}} between the judge and the witness box; his appearance {{was the first time}} since 1411 that an heir to the throne had appeared involuntarily in court.|$|E
5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by <b>a</b> <b>raised,</b> circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E

5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E
5|$|Cortina {{is home to}} some of {{the most}} prestigious names in fashion, {{including}} Bulgari, Benetton, Gucci and Geox, and various artisan shops, antiquarians, and craft stores. It is also home to many stores specializing in mountaineering equipment. The symbol of Cortina shopping remains La Cooperativa di Cortina, founded on June 28, 1893 as Consumverein Ampezzo. In this shopping centre many trades can be found, from confectioners to newspaper vendors, toys, gift shops, skiing stores and blacksmiths. The building is divided into three levels (more <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> plan and a balcony). The cooperative in Cortina was one of the first cooperatives founded in the Italian Peninsula, and currently provides employment to approximately 200 people.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E

Are you getting a good salary for your contributions? Do you deserve more benefits in the workplace? If you think you deserve <b>a</b> <b>raise</b> or more benefits in your job, then you should do your homework before asking for <b>a</b> <b>raise</b> or additional remuneration. As a valuable and engaged employee, you must be prepared to ask for <b>a</b> <b>raise</b> by planning properly to demonstrate your overall value and to do it at the right time and in the right manner...|$|R

5|$|During the Japanese heyday in Middle Road, {{the area}} was synonymous with the Echigoya, a Japanese draper shop. The Echigoya sold high quality {{textiles}} to Japanese and non-Japanese customers alike. The textiles and clothing were stored in full-height timber cabinets that ran {{along the length of}} the ground level walls. On one length side, <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> platform was also constructed, known as Koagari, where customers would sit while they examine the merchandise.|$|E
5|$|East of Montrose Road, {{the highway}} is a four lane roadway divided by <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> paved median, and passes north {{of a forest}} as it {{approaches}} an interchange with the QEW. As well as a partial cloverleaf interchange that provides almost all directional movements, this four-level stack interchange features two flyovers that arc from south to east {{as well as a}} four lane mainline that curves from north to east, directing most westbound Highway420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW.|$|E
5|$|Emu leather has a {{distinctive}} patterned surface, due to <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> {{area around the}} feather follicles in the skin; the leather is used in such items as wallets, handbags, shoes and clothes, often {{in combination with other}} leathers. The feathers and eggs are used in decorative arts and crafts. In particular, emptied emu eggs have been engraved with portraits, similar to cameos, and scenes of Australian native animals.|$|E

5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the computer on 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall. The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that displayed {{the state of the}} game, with the actual computer taking up no more than two percent of the total volume of the machine. The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> stand in front of it with buttons corresponding with the lights, which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. <b>A</b> <b>raised</b> cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the air with <b>a</b> <b>raised</b> fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E
