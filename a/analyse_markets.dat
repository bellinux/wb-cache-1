It reviews business strategy literature and EC competition law and concludes that, while there are similarities in the way both <b>analyse</b> <b>markets</b> and market power, there are still significant differences which may provide unwelcome surprises for those who plan commercial strategy without expert competition law advice {{and for those who}} seek to advise on competition law without understanding the basis on which investment decisions may have been taken...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{consumers}} {{are driven by}} their demand for energy services (such as space and water heating, cooking, transportation, lighting, entertainment and computing). This piece introduces the reader {{to the concept of}} energy services, and explains why it is important to analyze energy markets and climate policies from the perspective of energy services. The paper discusses the theoretical foundations and empirical evidence, particularly related to the rebound effect and the demand in developing economies. The paper concludes that governments should encourage the collection of statistical information about energy services in order to help economists <b>analyse</b> <b>markets</b> and policies through this lens. Most importantly, governments should formulate more integrated policies that focus explicitly on energy services, connecting markets for energy and for energy-using equipment with the development of technologies. Careful and balanced energy service policies are especially important as economies industrialise because they can help reduce economic, political and environmental vulnerability...|$|E
40|$|In {{his article}} “The Allocation of Resources in the Presence of Indivisibilities,” Scarf {{points out that}} the major problem {{presented}} to economic theory by the presence of indivisibilities is the impossibility of detecting optimality {{at the level of the}} firm, or the economy as a whole, using the creation of profitability based on competitive linear prices. In the absence of such competitive prices, Scarf instead introduces a quantity test. Further development of the quantity test idea has lead to algorithms that are used to solve parametric integer programming problems. However, the quantity test is not a fully acceptable replacement of prices to <b>analyse</b> <b>markets</b> with indivisibilities. Recently, O’Neill et al. have suggested a new scheme that generates discriminatory equilibrium prices in markets with non-convexities. In this paper we elaborate this idea even further and use it to generate non-linear price functions that can be interpreted as a non-linear pricing scheme for markets with non-convexities...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the relationship between the announcement of acquisitions, the existence of positive abnormal return for shares of these firms and market efficiency in Germany, France and Great Britain. The sample of transactions ranged from January 2010 to December 2015. This thesis has used the event study methodology where the Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns (CAAR) of the target and bidder firm's stock prices in different event windows have been analysed. Across all the markets, target firm's stock price yields positive CAAR that is significantly different from zero {{on the day of the}} announcement. Unlike the target firms, bidder firms do not show statistically significant CAAR for all <b>analysed</b> <b>markets.</b> The second goal was to <b>analyse</b> <b>market</b> efficiency using CAAR data from the event study. It was concluded that the <b>analysed</b> <b>markets</b> behave in a semi-strong form of market efficiency with potential cases of insider trading identified...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the usefulness of}} voluntary health insurance (VHI) as a lever for improving health system performance. It posits that VHI may further health policy goals if it addresses gaps in statutory coverage, {{if it does not}} make those who rely on statutory coverage worse off, and if those who need VHI have access to it. The thesis presents four studies that <b>analyse</b> <b>markets</b> for VHI in the European Union; developments in public policy towards VHI, including the implications of the EUlevel regulatory framework for VHI; the impact of VHI on health system performance; the effects of allowing people to choose between statutory and voluntary health insurance; and VHI’s influence on consumer mobility where insurers compete to offer statutory benefits. The thesis finds that while VHI is critical to financial protection in some countries, it does not always address key gaps in statutory coverage or reach those who need it, and the depth of its coverage has declined over time, even in heavily regulated markets. VHI has a regressive effect on equity in health financing, lowers equity in the use of health services and {{does not seem to have}} a positive effect on efficiency, partly because insurers in many countries lack appropriate incentives. What is more, a failure to align incentives across VHI and statutory health insurance can undermine the efficiency of public spending on health. Many of VHI’s negative effects can be attributed to poor policy design. Policy makers can try and ensure VHI contributes to rather than undermines health system performance through the following mechanisms: better understanding of VHI’s interaction with the health system; stronger policy design, focusing on aligning incentives in pursuit of health policy goals and ensuring efficiency in the use of public resources; willingness and capacity to regulate the market to secure financial and consumer protection; and regular monitoring and evaluation...|$|E
