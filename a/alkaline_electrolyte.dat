25|$|The {{alkaline}} battery gets its name {{because it has}} an <b>alkaline</b> <b>electrolyte</b> of potassium hydroxide, instead of the acidic ammonium chloride or zinc chloride electrolyte of the zinc-carbon batteries.

40|$|The oxygen {{reduction}} reaction (ORR) is {{a complex}} process. This is particularly the case for carbon-supported electrocatalysts in <b>alkaline</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> because carbon can catalyze the ORR via a two-electron transfer to generate hydroperoxide (HO 2 -), which subsequently undergoes either chemical decomposition to generate O- 2 and OH- (HODR) or electrochemical reduction to OH- (HORR). In this study, we elucidated the ORR pathway {{on a series of}} carbon-supported manganese oxides, which have been extensively studied as electrocatalysts in <b>alkaline</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> A comparison of the turnover frequencies of the HODR and HORR showed that although an apparent four-electron transfer process was identified when the HO 2 - yield was measured using the rotating ring disk electrode technique, the real ORR pathway involved a two-electron transfer process to generate HO 2 -, with subsequent chemical decomposition of HO 2. These results will help us to understand the intrinsic catalytic behavior of carbon-supported transition-metal oxides for the ORR in <b>alkaline</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> (C) 2015, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

25|$|In 1899, a Swedish {{scientist}} named Waldemar Jungner {{invented the}} nickel–cadmium battery, a rechargeable battery that had nickel and cadmium electrodes in a potassium hydroxide solution; the first battery {{to use an}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> It was commercialized in Sweden in 1910 and reached the United States in 1946. The first models were robust and had significantly better energy density than lead-acid batteries, but were much more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s the zinc–carbon battery {{continued}} to be a popular primary cell battery, but its relatively low battery life hampered sales. In 1955, an engineer named Lewis Urry, working for Union Carbide at the National Carbon Company Parma Research Laboratory, was tasked with finding a way to extend the life of zinc-carbon batteries, but Urry decided instead that alkaline batteries held more promise. Until then, longer-lasting alkaline batteries were unfeasibly expensive. Urry's battery consisted of a manganese dioxide cathode and a powdered zinc anode with an <b>alkaline</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> Using powdered zinc gave the anode a greater surface area. These batteries hit the market in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Normally the anode foil {{is covered}} by the {{dielectric}} aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer, which protects the base aluminum metal against the aggressiveness of aqueous alkali solutions. However, some impurities or weak points in the oxide layer offer the possibility for water-driven anodic corrosion that forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). In e-caps using an <b>alkaline</b> <b>electrolyte</b> this aluminum hydroxide will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The weak point remains and the anodic corrosion is ongoing. This corrosive process can be interrupted by protective substances in the electrolyte known as inhibitors or passivators. Inhibitors—such as chromates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, fluorides, benzoates, soluble oils, and certain other chemicals—can reduce the anodic and cathodic corrosion reactions. However, if inhibitors are used in an insufficient amount, they tend to increase pitting.|$|E
50|$|Last, but not least, {{the right}} choice of {{catalyst}} is important too. In acidic electrolytes the catalysts are usually precious metals like platinum, ruthenium, iridium and rhodium. In <b>alkaline</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> like zinc-air batteries and alkaline fuel cells, it is usual to use less expensive catalysts like carbon, manganese, silver, nickel foam or nickel mesh.|$|R
