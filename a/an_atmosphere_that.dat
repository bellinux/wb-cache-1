For example, Venus has a solar rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's, producing prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight over time intervals shorter than several months, unilluminated areas of Venus are kept almost as hot as the day side by globally circulating winds. Simulations have shown that an atmosphere containing appropriate levels of CO2 and H2O need only be a tenth the pressure of Earth's atmosphere (100 mbar) to effectively distribute heat to the night side. Current technology cannot determine the atmospheric or surface composition of the planet due to the overpowering light of its parent star.|$|E

[...] For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that the series continues to be [...] "very predictable and bland" [...] which is [...] "at this point fun but entirely forgettable."

Womack views the track as an effective blending of a print source and music: [...] "The interpretive power of the mixed-media application accrues its meaning through the musical production with which the group imbues the Ur-text of the poster." [...] MacDonald notes Lennon's request for a [...] "fairground production wherein one could smell the sawdust", <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>that</b> Martin and Emerick attempted to create with a sound collage that comprised randomly assembled recordings of harmoniums, harmonicas and calliopes. MacDonald describes the song as [...] "a spontaneous expression of its author's playful hedonism". Everett thinks that the track's use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album's opening number.|$|E

He started composing the score in October 1998 and began recording the music with the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on February 10, 1999. Williams {{decided to use}} electronic instruments such as synthesizers to enhance the sound and choral pieces to [...] "capture the magical, mystical force that a regular orchestra {{might not have been}} able to provide", and create <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>that</b> was [...] "more mysterious and mystical and less military" [...] than those of the original trilogy. One of the most notable tracks is [...] "Duel of the Fates", which uses the chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel. The track was made into a music video.

500|$|Titan is {{the only}} known moon with a {{significant}} atmosphere, and its atmosphere {{is the only}} nitrogen-rich dense atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth's. Observations of it made in 2004 by Cassini suggest that Titan is a [...] "super rotator", like Venus, with <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>that</b> rotates much faster than its surface. Observations from the Voyager space probes have shown that Titan's atmosphere is denser than Earth's, with a surface pressure about 1.45 atm. It is also about 1.19 times as massive as Earth's overall, or about 7.3 times more massive on a per surface area basis. Opaque haze layers block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and obscures Titan's surface features. Titan's lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth's. The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many wavelengths and as a result, a complete reflectance spectrum of the surface is impossible to acquire from orbit. It {{was not until the}} arrival of the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft in 2004 that the first direct images of Titan's surface were obtained.|$|E
500|$|Talking to Nashville Scene, Lewis {{said that}} the songs [...] "weren't written off-the-cuff, but they were {{definitely}} recorded, not carelessly, but with a real effort to capture a live feeling, particularly with the vocals". Lewis continued, [...] "To me, it's a big step in a different direction...and {{to be able to}} sink into the vocal take while the band was playing was a very liberating experience for me." [...] Lewis told The A.V. Club, [...] "We played them on the road 100 times, so we knew that we could walk into the studio and record them the same way. [...] It wasn't really a studio record, but more of a live record in some ways. It was about getting the band together and creating <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>that</b> lent itself to good chemistry between the band members and trying to capture as much of the record live as we could." [...] As [...] "a child of digital generation", Lewis had generally worked with Pro Tools, but wanted to capture the [...] "not-perfect sound" [...] of some of her favorite records.|$|E
500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>that</b> reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|E

500|$|... d [...] The {{propaganda}} line of Jewish Bolshevism {{was used}} intensively by Nazis in instigating antisemitic feelings among Lithuanians. It built upon the pre-invasion antisemitic propaganda of the anti-Soviet Lithuanian Activist Front which had seized upon {{the fact that}} more Jews than Lithuanians supported the Soviet regime. This had helped to create an entire mythos of Jewish culpability for the sufferings of Lithuania under the Soviet regime (and beyond). A LAF pamphlet read: [...] "For the ideological maturation of the Lithuanian nation it is essential that anticommunist and anti-Jewish action be strengthened [...] It is very important that this opportunity be used {{to get rid of the}} Jews as well. We must create <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>that</b> is so stifling for the Jews that not a single Jew will think that he will have even the most minimal rights or possibility of life in the new Lithuania. Our goal is to drive out the Jews along with the Red Russians. [...] The hospitality extended to the Jews by Vytautas the Great is hereby revoked for all time because of their repeated betrayals of the Lithuanian nation to its oppressors." [...] An extreme faction of the supporters of Augustinas Voldemaras, a group which also worked within the LAF, actually envisioned a racially exclusive [...] "Aryan" [...] Lithuanian state. With the start of German occupation, one of Kaunas' newspapers – Į Laisvę (Towards Freedom), commenced a spirited antisemitic crusade, reinforcing the identity of the Jew with communism in popular consciousness: [...] "Jewry and Bolshevism are one, parts of an indivisible entity." ...|$|E
500|$|For [...] "Top Hat, White Tie and Tails", {{probably}} Astaire's {{most celebrated}} tap solo, {{the idea for}} the title song came from Astaire who described to Berlin a routine he had created for the 1930 Ziegfeld Broadway flop Smiles called [...] "Say, Young Man of Manattan," [...] in which he gunned down a chorus of men – which included teenagers Bob Hope and Larry Adler – with his cane. Berlin duly produced the song from his trunk and the concept of the film was then built around it. In this number Astaire had to compromise on his one-take philosophy, as Sandrich acknowledged: [...] "We went to huge lengths to make the 'Top Hat' number look like one take, but actually it's several." [...] Astaire's remarkable ability to change the tempo within a single dance phrase is extensively featured throughout this routine and taken to extremes – as when he explodes into activity from a pose of complete quiet and vice versa. This routine also marks Astaire's first use of a cane as a prop in one of his filmed dances. The number opens with a chorus strutting and lunging in front of a backdrop of a Parisian street scene. They make way for Astaire who strides confidently {{to the front of the}} stage and delivers the song, which features the famous line: [...] "I'm stepping out, my dear, to breathe <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>that</b> simply reeks with class," [...] trading the occasional tap barrage with the chorus as he sings.The dance begins with Astaire and chorus moving in step. Astaire soon lashes out with a swirling tap step and the chorus responds timidly before leaving the stage in a sequence of overlapping, direction-shifting, hitch steps and walks. In the first part of the solo which follows, Astaire embarks on a circular tap movement, embellished with cane taps into which he mixes a series of unpredictable pauses. As the camera retreats the lights dim and, in the misterioso passage which follows, Astaire mimes a series of stances, ranging from overt friendliness, wariness, surprise to watchful readiness and jaunty confidence. Jimmy Cagney attended the shooting of this scene and advised Astaire, who claims to have ad-libbed much of this section. The chorus then returns in a threatening posture, and Astaire proceeds to dispatch them all, using an inventive series of actions miming the cane's use as a gun, a submachine gun, a rifle and, finally, a bow and arrow.|$|E
