5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a radar {{signature}} within a thunderstorm characterized by a local minimum in radar reflectivity at low levels which extends upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities aloft. This feature is associated with a strong updraft and is almost always found in the inflow region of a thunderstorm. It cannot be seen visually. The BWER has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> detection system equivalent known as <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> hole.|$|E

5|$|In 1724 the 14th century spire of the Church of the Holy Ghost in Crowcombe {{was damaged}} by <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> strike. The top {{section of the}} spire was removed and is now planted in the churchyard, and stone from the spire {{was used in the}} {{flooring}} of the church. Inside the church, carved bench-ends dating from 1534 depict such pagan subjects as the Green Man and the legend of the men of Crowcombe fighting a two-headed dragon.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
5|$|Rura Penthe {{was created}} {{with a mixture}} of on-set and {{location}} shots, along with an establishing sequence created by Matte World. The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a white plastic underfoot. Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect. Additional passes were made on fiberfill clouds with lights behind them to create <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> storm underway in the background.|$|E
25|$|The soliton {{model of}} <b>a</b> ball <b>lightning</b> was further developed. It was {{suggested}} that <b>a</b> ball <b>lightning</b> {{is based on}} spherically symmetric nonlinear oscillations of charged particles in plasma – the analogue of a spatial Langmuir soliton. These oscillations were described in both classical and quantum approaches. It {{was found that the}} most intense plasma oscillations occur in the central regions of <b>a</b> ball <b>lightning.</b> It is suggested that bound states of radially oscillating charged particles with oppositely oriented spins – the analogue of Cooper pairs – can appear inside <b>a</b> ball <b>lightning.</b> This phenomenon, in its turn, can lead to a superconducting phase in <b>a</b> ball <b>lightning.</b> The idea of the superconductivity in <b>a</b> ball <b>lightning</b> was considered earlier. The possibility of the existence of <b>a</b> ball <b>lightning</b> with <b>a</b> composite core was also discussed in this model.|$|R

5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius physicist. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his {{high-tech}} underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> bolt can be five times hotter than {{the surface of}} the sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot, some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E
5|$|To {{test his}} theory, Franklin {{proposed}} a potentially deadly experiment, {{to be performed}} during an electrical storm, where a person would stand on an insulated stool inside a sentry box, and hold out a long pointed iron rod to attract <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> bolt. This experiment was first performed successfully in France On May 10, 1752, and later repeated several more times throughout Europe. Franklin proved by this sentry-box experiment that lightning and electricity were one and the same.|$|E
50|$|On her three-year-old debut, Quick <b>As</b> <b>Lightning</b> {{ran in the}} Fred Darling Stakes, a trial {{race for}} the 1000 Guineas, over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April and {{finished}} third behind Millingdale Lillie and the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Mrs Penny. Two weeks later, Quick <b>As</b> <b>Lightning</b> started at odds of 12/1 in the 168th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. She was ridden by Brian Rouse, who was a late reserve after four better-known jockeys reportedly turned down the chance to ride the filly. The highly regarded but lightly raced Saison started the 4/1 favourite ahead of the Nell Gwyn Stakes winner, Evita, on 15/2 with Millingdale Lillie, Mrs Penny, and Our Home at 8/1 {{in a field of}} twenty-three fillies. Rouse settled Quick <b>As</b> <b>Lightning</b> near the back of the field before moving up to challenge the leaders in the last quarter mile. At least seven horses were still in contention a furlong from the finish, as Our Home took a narrow lead from Mrs Penny. Quick <b>As</b> <b>Lightning</b> produced <b>a</b> sustained run on the outside to take the lead a hundred yards out and won by a neck and half a length from Our Home and Mrs Penny.|$|R

5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|Abel Starkey (died September 28, 1827) was {{a convicted}} {{counterfeiter}} whose death is {{closely tied to}} Old Newgate Prison after fatally falling during an escape attempt {{the night before the}} close of the prison. Starkey was from Roxbury, Massachusetts and became a counterfeiter. Members of a counterfeiting ring had eluded authorities for years, but they finally discovered the secret third attic of <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> splitter home. Starkey was arrested, tried and convicted of counterfeiting. He was sentenced to a term of twenty years in the prison, where he would amass a sum of money. His attempt to escape ended in his death, accounts of Starkey's attempt continued to be popular in reference to the prison's history.|$|E
5|$|At a dock {{owned by}} Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> bolt from {{thunderstorms}} of Elena struck the oil supertanker SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a {{fire on the}} ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the fire on the tanker in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to unsettled weather from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).|$|E
50|$|On 7 June, Quick <b>As</b> <b>Lightning</b> {{was moved}} up in {{distance}} {{and started the}} 3/1 favourite for the 202nd running of the Oaks Stakes over {{one and a half}} miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Rouse again restrained the filly until the last quarter mile before switching to the outside, but the favourite was unable to make significant progress and finished fourth of the eleven runners behind Bireme, Vielle, and The Dancer, beaten a total of eight lengths. Quick <b>As</b> <b>Lightning</b> was brought back in distance and equipped with blinkers for her next race, the Group Two Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. She produced an improved effort, but was beaten a neck by the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Cairn Rouge, with Our Home in third place. Quick <b>As</b> <b>Lightning</b> was then moved up again to one and a half miles for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh Racecourse but appeared unable to stay the distance as she dropped away in the last quarter mile to finish fifth of the nine runners behind Shoot A Line.|$|R

5|$|By 1528, Spanish {{colonial power}} had been {{established}} in the Chiapas Highlands, and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores. Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva, across Comitán and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley. The north and northwest were incorporated into the Villa de Espíritu Santo district, that included Ch'ol Maya territory around Tila. In {{the early years of}} conquest, encomienda rights effectively meant rights to pillage and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and were sold in exchange for weapons, supplies, and horses.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Roma {{took part}} in a naval {{demonstration}} off Ragusa in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro. The following year, she was involved in a collision with the ironclad , though neither ship was damaged. That year, Venezia was converted into a torpedo training ship, while Roma remained in service until 1890, when she became a guard ship at La Spezia. In 1895, both ships were stricken from the naval register. Venezia was broken up for scrap the following year, but Roma was converted into a depot ship in La Spezia. On 28 July 1896, she was set on fire by <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> strike and badly burned. The damage proved to be beyond economical repair, and so she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of conquest, encomienda rights {{effectively}} meant rights to pillage and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and taken to a port to be sold, in order that the conquistadores could purchase weapons, supplies, and horses. In some cases the conquistadores would round up the elders, chain them up, whip them and set their war dogs upon them, in order to force the natives to hand over tribute such as food and clothing.|$|E

He became a successful breeding stallion, siring La Prevoyante, Relaxing, Numbered Account, and L'Enjoleur. Quick <b>As</b> <b>Lightning's</b> dam, Clear Ceiling, won five races and was a half-sister to several good winners including Misty Morn, Bold Queen (Black-Eyed Susan Stakes), and What A Pleasure (Hopeful Stakes, twice Leading sire in North America).
