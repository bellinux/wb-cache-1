5|$|When I assumed office, I {{found that}} my {{predecessor}} {{had signed a}} contract for {{the building of the}} battleship Rio de Janeiro, a vessel of 32,000tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.|$|E
5|$|Captain Scarlet also {{formed the}} basis of three comic strips drawn for the weekly children's comic, TV Century 21. Spanning 17 issues (numbers 141–157) from September 1967 to January 1968, the strip adventures were written by Angus P. Allan with artwork by Ron Embleton, and were titled We Will Destroy Unity City, We Will Destroy the Observatory Network <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Shall</b> Make Earth a Planet of Silence. Following the end of the TV series, the comic {{continued}} the story of the Captain Scarlet universe, with later strips revealing that the Mysterons deactivate their Martian complex and relinquish their control over Captain Black, while Scarlet himself leaves Spectrum to make use of his powers in the fight against Earth-bound criminals and threats. The Mysterons ultimately re-awaken, prompting Scarlet and Spectrum to resume their struggle. Keith Watson also worked on these comic book adaptations.|$|E

5|$|The building, {{designed}} by James Lewis was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital {{which had been}} vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere, who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely {{in order to provide}} a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'. The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel. The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.|$|E

After wandering about in search of new ways, we shall again return to realism for more strength. I do not doubt that every abstraction on the stage, such as impressionism, for instance, could be attained by way of a more refined and deeper realism. All other ways are false and dead.|$|E
25|$|We ought, then, to set {{up images}} of a kind that can adhere longest in memory. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> do so if we {{establish}} similitudes as striking as possible; if we set up images that are not many or vague but active; if we assign to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we ornament some of them, as with crowns or purple cloaks, so that the similitude may be more distinct to us; or if we somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud and smeared with red paint, so that its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E

25|$|We {{look for}} a solid and impregnable barrier of the Democracies against the three Axis powers, and we refuse to accept the dictum that the Pacific {{struggle}} must {{be treated as a}} subordinate segment of the general conflict. By that it is not meant that any one of the other theatres of war is of less importance than the Pacific, but that Australia asks for a concerted plan evoking the greatest strength at the Democracies' disposal, determined upon hurling Japan back. The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say {{in the direction of the}} Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. We know the problems that the United Kingdom faces. We know the dangers of dispersal of strength, but we know too, that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on. We are, therefore, determined that Australia shall not go, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> exert all our energies towards the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its keystone, which will give to our country some confidence of being able to hold out until the tide of battle swings against the enemy.|$|E

[...] The Ohio State Journal opposed any sympathetic treatment of the strikers: [...] "When a policeman strikes, he should be debarred not only from resuming his office, but from citizenship as well.

500|$|As Cadwalader's {{men began}} to flee, the American guns opened fire onto the British, who were {{preparing}} to attack, and the guns were able to hold them off for several minutes. Cadwalader {{was able to get}} one company to fire a volley but it fled immediately afterwards. At this point, Washington arrived with the Virginia Continentals and Edward Hand's riflemen. Washington ordered the riflemen and the Virginians to take up a position on the right hand side of the hill and then Washington quickly rode over to Cadwalader's fleeing men. Washington shouted, [...] "Parade with us my brave fellows! There is but a handful of the enemy <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> have them directly!". Cadwalader's men formed into battle formation at Washington's direction. When Daniel Hitchcock's New England Continentals arrived, Washington sent them to the right, where he had put the riflemen and the Virginians.|$|E
500|$|In March 1930, Garrett {{was posted}} as adjutant/quartermaster to the 3rd Light Horse Regiment at Mount Gambier, South Australia. As a speaker at Mount Gambier's Anzac Day commemorations on 25 April 1934, he was {{reported}} as {{warning of the}} poor state of Australia's preparedness for war, admonishing: [...] "We shall {{not have the time}} that we had before the last war, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> not be fighting for our homes thousands of miles away. We shall be fighting at our own back door. That is what we have to prepare for." [...] In August that year he was transferred to the 4th Light Horse Regiment at Warrnambool, Victoria, as adjutant/quartermaster. Garrett was posted to the staff of Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1936, and departed for England in November the following year to attend the Staff College, Camberley. He was promoted to major in July 1938, and returned to Australia upon the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E

500|$|Songs such as [...] "Fight the Power", [...] "Power to the People", and [...] "Brothers Gonna Work It Out" [...] {{propose a}} {{response}} for African Americans {{to the issues}} criticized throughout the album. [...] "Power to the People" [...] has a tempo of approximately 125 beats per minute and elements of Miami bass, electro-boogie, and fast-paced Roland TR-808. Addressing their plight {{at the turn of}} the 1990s, [...] "Brothers Gonna Work It Out" [...] features cacophonic sound textures and a theme of unity among African Americans, with Chuck D preaching [...] "Brothers that try to work it out / They get mad, revolt, revise, realize / They're superbad / Small chance a smart brother's gonna be a victim of his own circumstance". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post writes that songs such as [...] "War at 33⅓" [...] and [...] "Fight the Power" [...] "may sound like a call to ohms and arms, but they are really a call to action ('turn us loose <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> overcome'), a message to conscience and a plea for unity ('move as team, never move alone,' both cautionary advice and game plan)". [...] "War at 33⅓" [...] has a theme of resistance and a 128 bpm-tempo, cited by Chuck D as [...] "the fastest thing I've ever rapped to, rapping right on top of the beat".|$|E
