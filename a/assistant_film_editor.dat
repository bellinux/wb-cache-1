Scheider's then-wife, Cynthia Scheider, was an <b>assistant</b> <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> who had previously worked with Bud Smith on The Exorcist. Since shooting the film required a prolonged stay in South America, the actor asked Friedkin if she could stay with him and have a job in an editing capacity. The director fulfilled his wish and was reportedly [...] "delighted". [...] Sorcerer was filmed during a ten-month production schedule, using approximately 1,200 camera set-ups. The director attempted to complete the picture [...] "without relying on dialogue", and [...] "telling the story through imagery" [...] instead. In the film's pressbook Friedkin states that for him creating a film is multi-faceted experience: [...] "very film is actually three films There is the film you conceive and plan. There is the film you actually shoot. And there is the film that emerges with you in the editing room".|$|E
