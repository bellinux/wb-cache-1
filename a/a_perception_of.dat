5|$|The {{behaviour}} of the Crusaders appalled the Greeks and Muslims, {{creating a}} lasting barrier between the Latin world {{and both the}} Islamic and Orthodox religions. It was an obstacle to the reunification of the Christian church and created <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> Westerners as defeated aggressors.|$|E
5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> scarcity that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E
5|$|To {{service clients}} without {{ready access to}} {{low-cost}} financing, the IFC relies on structured or securitized financial products such as partial credit guarantees, portfolio risk transfers, and Islamic finance. The IFC committed $797 million {{in the form of}} structured and securitized financing in 2010. For companies that face difficulty in obtaining financing due to <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> high credit risk, the IFC securitizes assets with predictable cash flows, such as mortgages, credit cards, loans, corporate debt instruments, and revenue streams, in an effort to enhance those companies' credit.|$|E

5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, {{water and electricity}} infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused of}} corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> arrogance among his colleagues, and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} Dalmatia, the JNA Knin Corps attacked Zadar on 4 October, {{reaching its}} outskirts and lifting the ZNG siege of the Šepurine Barracks the next day. The advance {{was blocked by}} the ZNG and a truce was agreed on 7 October. Two days later, {{it was followed by}} an agreement to evacuate JNA facilities in Zadar, including equipment stored there. Further south, the JNA Titograd Corps and its Military-Maritime District forces advanced from eastern Herzegovina and the Bay of Kotor, and pushed east and west of Dubrovnik on 1 October, placing besieging the city {{by the end of the}} month. The JNA was supported by Montenegro's TO in the area. Even though the Croatian troops defending the city were few, the city held out, sustaining increasingly intensive artillery, naval and air bombardment until a ceasefire was agreed in the area on 7 December. As the siege shaped international opinion on the Croatian War of Independence, it became a major contributor to a shift towards the international diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia, and resulted in the creation of <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> Serbia and rump Yugoslavia as an aggressor state.|$|E

25|$|The New Cannibalism is {{a phrase}} coined by {{anthropologist}} Nancy Scheper-Hughes in 1998 for an article written for The New Internationalist.

History) and <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> censorship of anti-Saudi content, Al Arabiya has successfully emulated Al Jazeera, garnered a significant audience share, and has also become involved in controversy – Al Arabiya has been severely criticised by the Iraqi and US authorities and has had journalists killed on the job.|$|E
25|$|Michigan State University scholar Baljit Singh, {{interviewing}} Indian {{foreign policy}} experts in 1965, found that 77 {{percent of them}} favoured discussions with Pakistan on all outstanding problems including the Kashmir dispute. However, only 17 percent were supportive of holding a plebiscite in Kashmir. The remaining 60 percent were pessimistic of a solution due to a distrust of Pakistan or <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> threats to India's internal institutions. They contended that India's secularism was far from stable {{and the possibility of}} Kashmir separating from India or joining Pakistan would endanger Hindu–Muslim relations in India.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, {{while serving}} as mayor, Wallace sought out a private {{development}} company, Cherokee Investments, to redevelop the Imperial Sugar Company’s original site constructed more than 160 years ago. Also {{in need of a}} local partner, Wallace turned to a local real estate development firm. Wallace had co-invested with this local developer on other real estate investments.

25|$|Very outspoken {{about his}} ideas, he begged Nicholas II {{to cancel the}} {{coronation}} ball at the French embassy in Moscow following the Khodynka Tragedy, warning him that holding it would create <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> monarchical indifference such as had made Marie Antoinette unpopular. When it was held nevertheless, he arrived with his brothers, then departed soon after in protest. His manner could turn caustic. The Imperial family always {{said he had a}} mean and critical tongue. He loathed Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her family, the Vladimirovichi. A vehement critic of most of his male cousins, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich in particular, Nicholas Mikhailovich was a divisive figure among the Romanovs.|$|E
25|$|Then, for the {{ultimate}} truth, there are two schools of Madhyamaka: those who assert {{the ultimate}} is the illusory nature, and those who make no assertions. To explain further, the first says that the illusory nature is established when the perceiver of an object experiences <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> that object as being unreal. This view was put forth by Kamalashila, Shantarakshita, and other proponents of the Svatantrika Madhyamaka school. Their view is clearly explained in Mipham Jamyang Gyatso's commentary on Shantarakshita's 'Ornament of the Middle Way.' This commentary by Mipham Rinpoche is often considered the most important philosophical text of the Nyingma lineage in Tibet, particularly for those who follow Mipham Rinpoche's understanding of the Shentong Madhyamaka view.|$|E

The data was obtained from 440 employees at 13 Portuguese companies. Both ANOVA and Regression Analysis were conducted {{in order to understand}} the impact three Intellectual Capital Scale components have on <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> investment and organizational productivity. Results show that companies with higher scores of Structural Capital have <b>a</b> lower <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> investment in human resources and research, as well as <b>a</b> higher <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> investment in marketing and sales. Moreover, employees of companies with higher Structural Capital scores also have higher <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> productivity.

40|$|Sonic logos are {{increasingly}} {{being used as a}} way of sonic branding in marketing activities. Scholars have acknowledged the benefits of sonic logos, such as communicating brand attributes to consumers. However, studies about consumers’ attitudes towards sonic logos are scarce. This paper examined consumers’ attitudes towards sonic logos, particularly how cognitive and affective elements correlated with such attitudes, whether such attitudes had correlations with consumers’ attitudes towards the associated brands of sonic logos, and whether such attitudes had relationships with consumers’ purchase intentions towards the associated brands of sonic logos. Through a PowerPoint-assisted questionnaire, data were collected from 78 Chinese students who were from the University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China. With the help of SPSS, it was found that consumers’ attitudes towards sonic logos were close to positive; both cognitive elements (<b>a</b> consumer’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> attractiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sonic logo, <b>a</b> consumer’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sonic logo, <b>a</b> consumer’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> fitness for its brand of a sonic logo) and affective elements (<b>a</b> consumer’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> emotionality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sonic logo, <b>a</b> consumer’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> activation of emotional memories of a sonic logo, <b>a</b> consumer’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> pleasure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sonic logo) had positive relationships with consumers’ attitudes towards it; and a consumer’ attitude towards the sonic logo had positive relationships with her/his attitude towards the associated brand of the sonic logo and with her/his purchase intention towards the associated brand of the sonic logo. These findings not only could contribute to understanding that how sonic logos were perceived in consumers’ minds, but also to some extent could help marketing practitioners make better decisions about whether to implement sonic logos or not and how to design good sonic logos...|$|R
25|$|University {{management}} itself {{came under}} increasing grassroots pressure to implement change within the university. A Wits-initiated research project, Perspectives of Wits (POW), published in 1986, revealed a surprising disconnect between the perceptions disadvantaged communities had of Wits {{and the image}} Wits had been attempting to convey of itself as a progressive opponent of apartheid. POW, which had involved interviews with members of organisations among disadvantaged communities in the PWV area, international academics, students and staff at Wits, and even {{a meeting with the}} then-banned ANC in Lusaka, revealed that to many in the surrounding disadvantaged communities, there was <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> Wits as an elitist institution dominated by white interests.

25|$|The {{border between}} {{mainland}} China and Hong Kong runs along Chung Ying Street. There is <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> {{it being a}} notorious point of goods trafficking. When the checkpoint opened a flow of Chinese nationals enter Chung Ying Street with visiting permits. Some may make several trips a day acquiring goods and abusing the custom tariff limits on goods. These traffickers then unload their burden to collect their pay inside mainland Shatoujiao. Although {{there are a lot}} of goods leaving Hong Kong from Sha Tau Kok via Chung Ying Street there is also an inflow of foodstuffs and other commodities that come through from China into Hong Kong throughout the day, and only limited by the closure of the Chinese custom post.|$|E
25|$|Assuming that an indeterministic {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is {{for all practical purposes}} confined to microscopic phenomena. This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some hardware random number generators work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> free will). If a person's action is, however, only result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition), this in itself would mean that such traditional free will does not exist (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).|$|E
