The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E
25|$|The balloon follows Pascal {{through the}} streets of Paris, and they draw {{inquisitive}} looks from adults and the envy of other children as they wander the streets. At one point it enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who becomes angry with him and locks him up in his office until school is over. At another, he and the balloon encounter a little girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own too, as evidenced by its act of following his.|$|E

Sheltering in the stable in Bethlehem, it witnesses the birth of Jesus, the shepherds, the three wise men and the visitation of an angel. Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men for something to eat, the baby Jesus touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed. It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing by instinct when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E

Most {{of the film}} was shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Some of the sets were designed {{so that they could}} be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in Jaws was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, [...] "When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own sometimes." [...] As an added homage to Jaws, the license plate pulled from the shark's teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the tiger shark carcass from Spielberg's film.|$|E

500|$|Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson) {{approaches}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{and asks}} her to cure {{her of her}} vampirism, as she no longer wants to be immortal. Bubblegum agrees to perform an experimental procedure which extracts the vampiric essence from Marceline's body, but is unsure of whether it has worked or not. As Marceline recovers, the extracted essence gains <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own and escapes. Meanwhile, Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) are called out to investigate livestock being attacked by a bloodsucking creature. Suspecting Marceline, Finn and Jake confront of her, only to discover the extracted essence has transformed into the vampire attacking the livestock. However, as Finn and Jake chase the vampire, a mob of angry villagers capture Marceline and leave her to be destroyed by the rising sun. As the light engulfs her body, Marceline begins reliving memories of her past. As a child, she's comforted by a lullaby sung by her mother (voiced by Rebecca Sugar), entitled [...] "Everything Stays." [...] She witnesses Simon leaving her {{to protect her from}} himself. As a teenager, she hunts vampires and discovers she can absorb their powers. Later she befriends a tribe of Hyoomans, who are constructing a boat to escape the continent and avoid an impending catastrophe they fear will happen. Marceline helps fight off more vampires, and tells the Hyoomans to flee when the Vampire King arrives. Back in the present, everybody is shocked when they see that the sunlight doesn't kill Marceline, meaning that she has been cured of her vampirism. Meanwhile, Jake encounters the vampires Marceline had previously killed, now resurrected from Marceline's freed vampiric essence.|$|E

6000|$|... § 28. And then observe, farther, as I {{kept the}} names of Wordsworth and Scott out of the second list, I withdrew, also, certain names from the first; and for this reason, that in all the men who are named in that list, there is evidently some degree of love for nature, {{which may have been}} {{originally}} of more power than we suppose, and may have had an infinitely hallowing and protective influence upon them. But there also lived certain men of high intellect in that age who had no love of nature whatever. They do not appear ever to have received the smallest sensation of ocular delight from any natural scene, but would have lived happily all their lives in drawingrooms or studies. And, therefore, in these men we shall be able to determine, with the greatest chance of accuracy, what the real influence of natural beauty is, and what the character <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> destitute <b>of</b> <b>its</b> love. Take, as conspicuous instances, Le Sage and Smollett, and you will find, in meditating over their works, that they are utterly incapable of conceiving a human soul as endowed with any nobleness whatever; their heroes are simply beasts endowed with some degree of human intellect;--cunning, false, passionate, reckless, ungrateful, and abominable, incapable of noble joy, of noble sorrow, of any spiritual perception or hope. I said, [...] "beasts with human intellect;" [...] but neither Gil Blas nor Roderick Random reach, morally, anything near the level of dogs; while the delight which the writers themselves feel in mere filth and pain, with an unmitigated foulness and cruelty of heart, is just as manifest in every sentence as the distress and indignation which with pain and injustice are seen by Shelley and Byron.|$|R

40|$|The brain {{constructs}} {{representations of}} what is sensed and thought about in the 					form of nerve impulses that propagate in circuits and network assemblies 					(Circuit Impulse Patterns, CIPs). CIP representations of which humans are 					consciously aware occur {{in the context of}} a sense of self. Thus, research on 					mechanisms of consciousness might benefit from a focus on how a conscious sense 					of self is represented in brain. Like all senses, the sense of self must be 					contained in patterns of nerve impulses. Unlike the traditional senses that are 					registered by impulse flow in relatively simple, pauci-synaptic projection 					pathways, the sense of self is a system- level phenomenon that may be generated 					by impulse patterns in widely distributed complex and interacting circuits. The 					problem for researchers then is to identify the CIPs that are unique to 					conscious experience. Also likely to be of great relevance to constructing the 					representation of self are the coherence shifts in activity timing relations 					among the circuits. Consider that an embodied sense of self is generated and 					contained as unique combinatorial temporal patterns across multiple neurons in 					each circuit that contributes to constructing the sense of self. As with other 					kinds of CIPs, those representing the sense of self can be learned from 					experience, stored in memory, modified by subsequent experiences, and expressed 					in the form of decisions, choices, and commands. These CIPs are proposed here to 					be the actual physical basis for conscious thought and the sense of self. When 					active in wakefulness or dream states, the CIP representations of self act as an 					agent of the brain, metaphorically as an avatar. Because the selfhood CIP 					patterns may only have to represent the self and not directly represent the 					inner and outer worlds of embodied brain, the self representation should have 					more degrees of freedom than subconscious mind and may therefore have some 					capacity for <b>a</b> free-will <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own. S everal lines of evidence for this 					theory are reviewed. Suggested new research includes identifying distinct 					combinatorially coded impulse patterns and their temporal coherence shifts in 					defined circuitry, such as neocortical microcolumns. This task might be 					facilitated by identifying the micro-topography of field-potential oscillatory 					coherences among various regions and between different frequencies associated 					with specific conscious mentation. Other approaches can include identifying the 					changes in discrete conscious operations produced by focal trans-cranial 					magnetic stimulation...|$|R
