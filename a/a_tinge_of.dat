25|$|It {{has been}} claimed Frederick had a {{same-sex}} {{relationship with his}} friend, Carl Berling (18121871), publisher {{and owner of the}} newspaper Berlingske Tidende. The bisexual Berling had an illegitimate child with Louise Rasmussen, Carl Christian (18411908) who was much liked by the King, {{to the extent that he}} insisted on signing the new constitution on Carl Christian's 8th birthday on 5 June 1849. To retain <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> decency, the King married Louise Rasmussen and the trio then moved into the royal castle where Berling was appointed Chamberlain and remained until 1861. The public indignation within higher circles over Frederick's morganatic marriage is well-known, but reasons have rarely been explained in detail.|$|E

25|$|In the consistory of the Protestant {{church in}} Paris Guizot {{exercised}} a similar influence. His early education and his experience of life conspired {{to strengthen the}} convictions of a religious temperament. He remained throughout his life {{a firm believer in}} the truths of revelation, and a volume of Méditations on the Christian Religion was one of his latest works. But though he adhered inflexibly to the church of his fathers and combated the rationalist tendencies of the age, which seemed to threaten it with destruction, he retained not <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> the intolerance or asperity of the Calvinistic creed. He respected in the Church of Rome the faith of the majority of his countrymen, and the writings of the great Catholic prelates, Bossuet and Bourdaloue, were as familiar and as dear to him as those of his own persuasion, and were commonly used by him in the daily exercises of family worship.|$|E
500|$|In {{a highly}} {{complimentary}} review for The New Republic, Juliet Kleber wrote that [...] "Islands does a dizzying amount of plot development in 80-something minutes." [...] Furthermore, she argued that [...] "Finn's coming-of-age {{story and the}} exploration of the post-apocalyptic plotline" [...] as featured in the miniseries [...] "are handled just as deftly as any other subject—with fun and <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> sorrow." [...] Zach Blumenfeld of Paste Magazine gave Islands a slightly more mixed, albeit still positive, review. He complimented the philosophical musing of the miniseries, which he argued [...] "takes on shades of Black Mirror and existentialism to cast a critical eye on technology and the human spirit." [...] Blumenfeld wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|True Blue {{received}} generally critical acclaim. Jon Pareles, in {{a review}} for The New York Times, said that True Blue reprised the themes of fidelity in its songs and complimented her addition of <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> real world storytelling in her songs, making her reach the [...] "fringes of the permissible". Stephen Holden in another review complimented the album and said that [...] "Madonna goes heavy on heart in this record". In a Rolling Stone review, Davitt Sigerson stated that Madonna was [...] "singing better than ever". The album's songs were described as [...] "catchy", but Sigerson also commented {{on the lack of}} [...] "outstanding tracks". He ultimately stated that True Blue is a [...] "sturdy, dependable, lovable new album" [...] which [...] "remains faithful to her past while shamelessly rising above it".|$|E

500|$|Popular cultivars in Malaysia and Singapore (Singapore imports {{most of its}} durians from Malaysia {{hence the}} {{varieties}} are similar although there may be slight variation in the names) include [...] "D24" [...] which is a popular variety known for its bitter sweet taste; [...] "XO" [...] which has a pale color, thick flesh with <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> alcoholic fermentation; [...] "Chook Kiok" [...] (Cantonese meaning: bamboo leg) which has a distinctive yellowish core in the inner stem and [...] "Musang King" [...] ('musang' is the Malay word for civet cat) which is usually the priciest of all cultivars. Musang King {{is known for its}} bright yellow flesh and is almost like a more potent or enhanced version of the D24. This particular variety should be consumed last since it tends to make other durians taste bland in comparison.|$|E
500|$|The gills are {{attached}} by a tooth and are narrowly , close to subdistant, narrow, equal, white or grayish, and with edges [...] and often slightly eroded. Berkeley {{noted that the}} gills [...] "vary a good deal in colour, and are sometimes very dark". The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, equal in width throughout, cartilaginous and tough. The stem color is brown with <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> pink, and the color lightens towards the top. It is usually straight but often curved toward the base, and roots into in the debris, or is attached to sticks. Smith has noted that in optimal weather conditions, [...] "robust" [...] forms may be found that are [...] "strict and rigid in their appearance." [...] The buried portion of the stem is covered with thick, stiff whitish hairs, and is surrounded with a thin subgelatinous layer, which causes it to be slimy to the touch. Its color is initially bluish-black, soon gray, nearly {{the same color as}} the cap, with the apex somewhat fibrous-striate. The mushroom is inedible.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing. I was really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so that meant a lot to me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> religious fervor." ...|$|E

500|$|Anthony Burgess, in Ninety-nine Novels, cited {{it as one}} of the 99 best {{novels in}} English since 1939. [...] "Fleming raised the {{standard}} of the popular story of espionage through good writing — a heightened journalistic style — {{and the creation of a}} government agent — James Bond, 007 — who is sufficiently complicated to compel our interest over a whole series of adventures. A patriotic lecher with <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> Scottish puritanism in him, a gourmand and amateur of vodka martinis, a smoker of strong tobacco who does not lose his wind, he is pitted against impossible villains, enemies of democracy, megalomaniacs. Auric Goldfinger is the most extravagant of these. All this is, in some measure, a great joke, but Fleming's passion for plausibility, his own naval intelligence background, and a kind of sincere Manicheism, allied to journalistic efficiency in the management of his recit, make his work rather impressive. The James Bond films, after From Russia With Love, stress the fantastic and are inferior entertainment to the books. It is unwise to disparage the well-made popular. There was a time when Conan Doyle was ignored by the literary annalists even though Sherlock Holmes was evidently one of the great characters of fiction. We must beware of snobbishness." ...|$|E
500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be pretty sure he has something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E
500|$|Since {{his arrival}} in America, Priestley had {{continued}} to defend his Christian Unitarian beliefs; now, falling increasingly {{under the influence of}} Thomas Cooper and Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, he was unable to avoid becoming embroiled in political controversy. In 1798, when, in response to the Pinckney affair, a belligerent President Adams sought to enlarge the navy and mobilise the militia into what Priestley and Cooper saw as a 'standing army', Priestley published an anonymous newspaper article: Maxims of political arithmetic, which attacked Adams, defended free trade, and advocated a form of Jeffersonian isolationism. In the same year, a small package, addressed vaguely: [...] "Dr Priestley in America," [...] was seized by the Royal Navy on board a neutral Danish boat. It was found to contain three letters, one of which was signed by the radical printer John Hurford Stone. These intercepted letters were published in London, and copied in numerous papers in America. One of the letters was addressed to [...] "MBP", with a note: [...] "I inclose a note for our friend MBP—but, as ignorant of the name he bears at present among you, I must beg you to seal and address it." [...] This gave the intercepted letters <b>a</b> <b>tinge</b> <b>of</b> intrigue. Fearful lest they be taken as evidence of him being a 'spy in the interest of France', Priestley sent a clumsy letter to numerous newspaper editors, in which he naively named [...] "MBP" [...] (Member of the British Parliament) as Mr. Benjamin Vaughan, who [...] "like me, thought it necessary to leave England, and for some time is said to have assumed a feigned name." [...] William Cobbett, in his Porcupine's Gazette, 20 August 1798, added that Priestley [...] "has told us who Mr MBP is, and has confirmed me in the opinion of their both being spies in the interest of France." ...|$|E
