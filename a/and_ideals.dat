5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, {{it is hard to}} be able to publicly debate the notions <b>and</b> <b>ideals</b> that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E

40|$|Chronic or {{situational}} self-construal moderates {{the effects}} of four self-congruity (SC) dimensions (i. e., actual, <b>ideal,</b> social, <b>and</b> <b>ideal</b> social) on brand evaluations. Past research has mainly focused on the actual <b>and</b> <b>ideal</b> SC effects; these effects {{have been found to}} be stronger than the social <b>and</b> <b>ideal</b> social SC effects. However, the findings of past research are based on samples from individualistic cultures. Individualists have a dominant independent self-construal. We conduct two experiments to show that the social <b>and</b> <b>ideal</b> social SC effects are stronger than the actual <b>and</b> <b>ideal</b> SC effects for individuals with a dominant interdependent self-construal. In Study 1, using samples from collectivistic cultures, four SC effects are compared. In Study 2, we examine how primed self-construal, whether independent or interdependent, impacts the four SC effects. This research documents the importance of the social <b>and</b> <b>ideal</b> social dimensions in SC research...|$|R

5|$|Much work on hypercomplex {{numbers and}} group {{representations}} {{was carried out}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras. Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules <b>and</b> <b>ideals</b> in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the staff}} of The Political Cesspool {{organized}} a rally at the Tennessee area known as Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, {{has been the subject}} of a longtime controversy for honoring Confederate soldiers <b>and</b> <b>ideals.</b> The park had been criticized earlier by a black Shelby County official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist Al Sharpton, who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and The Political Cesspool staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route.|$|E
5|$|The Five {{was among}} the myriad of {{subjects}} Tchaikovsky discussed with his benefactress, Nadezhda von Meck. By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world <b>and</b> <b>ideals.</b> In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took {{a back seat to}} his official duties as a professor of chemistry.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} to London in August 1917, Nevinson first completed six lithographs {{on the subject of}} Building Aircraft for the War Propaganda Bureau portfolio of pictures, Britain's Efforts <b>and</b> <b>Ideals,</b> and then spent seven months in his Hampstead studio working up his sketches from the Front into finished pieces. A number of officials from the Department of Information visited the studio and soon began complaining about these new works. Nevinson was now focused on individuals, either as people displaying heroic qualities or as victims of warfare. He did this by painting in a realistic manner using a limited colour palette, sometimes only mud-brown or khaki. Whereas for his 1916 exhibition Nevinson had displayed both realistic works and pieces using Cubist and Futurist techniques, for his 1918 exhibition all the works were realistic in style and composition.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Takahashi {{talked with}} Hirohide Sugiura, who had {{likewise}} worked at Square and {{was beginning to}} feel frustrated {{due to a lack of}} creative freedom. After discussing the matter, the two decided to create their own company and pursue projects they wanted to create. When planning their new company, Takahashi and Sugiura decided that they needed a publisher with substantial market presence to help them rather than being an independent studio. Takahashi and Sugiura approached multiple companies for support, but most of the companies they contacted outright rejected their offer as they believed that Monolith Soft should be an independent company. However, Namco were interested in investing into Monolith Soft as a dedicated subsidiary, whilst handling logistics and marketing so that the core staff could focus on game development. An important supporter of Monolith Soft was Namco's founder Masaya Nakamura, who shared many of Takahashi and Sugiura's goals <b>and</b> <b>ideals.</b> Monolith Soft is noted as being one of a group of video game companies—alongside Sacnoth, Love-de-Lic and Mistwalker—founded by Square staff who had worked on notable titles produced during the 1990s. The company was officially founded on 1 October 1999 by Takahashi, Sugiura, and Yasuyuki Honne, who had worked at Square on both the Chrono series and with Takahashi on Xenogears. The company's offices were originally based in Yokohama.|$|E
