25|$|Unsustainable {{land use}} {{practices}} <b>are</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> degrade watersheds and are {{adding to the}} growing complexities of managing groundwater. Additionally, the volcanic aquifers consist mainly of interstratifications of gaps and fissures which allow for high permeability and infiltration. In many cases, these make the aquifers highly vulnerable to human contamination from the cities in which they support. The heterogeneity of these aquifers make them complicated to study and manage. Consequently, growing signs of conflict and competition for water use between sector needs are being observed in some regions.|$|E

According to the Environmental Defense Fund’s website, environmentalists and private land owners are working together to maintain the wildlife habitat while maintaining crops productivity. Groups provide assistance to private landowners to ensure funding for conservation incentives to landowners {{who are willing to}} preserve wildlife on their soil. Most lands in the East are privately owned. Landowners used “prescribed burns’ to restore favorable habitat conditions. Prescribed burns managed by the Safe Harbor Agreement benefits U.S. Fish & Wildlife, serve under Federal Endangered Species Act help reduces and prevents the amount of invasive species that <b>are</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> the tortoise; Invasive species such as the (1) cogongrass aka Imperata cylindrica and (2) Fire ants disrupt gopher tortoise’s habitat and kill tortoise eggs can be controlled.

500|$|The U.S. {{frequently}} {{uses its}} economic power {{in order to}} punish other countries. [...] One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food. [...] Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they {{can be broken down}} into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives. [...] The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who <b>are</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. [...] An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government. [...] More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries, socialist governments, countries who support radical regimes, regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements. [...] An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically. [...] The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{recorded}} {{well over a}} hundred antisemitic attacks in Belgium in 2009. This was a 100% increase from the year before. The perpetrators were usually young males of immigrant background from the Middle East. In 2009, the Belgian city of Antwerp, {{often referred to as}} Europe's last shtetl, experienced a surge in antisemitic violence. Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam resident and Auschwitz survivor, was quoted in the newspaper Aftenposten in 2010: [...] "The antisemitism now is even worse than before the Holocaust.

2500|$|... "Why {{the future}} doesn't need us" [...] is an article written by Bill Joy, then Chief Scientist at Sun Microsystems, in the April 2000 issue of Wired magazine. In the article, {{he argues that}} [...] "Our most {{powerful}} 21st-century technologies — robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech — <b>are</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> make humans an endangered species." [...] Joy argues that developing technologies provide a much greater danger to humanity than any technology before it has ever presented. In particular, he focuses on genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. He argues that 20th-century technologies of destruction, such as the nuclear bomb, were limited to large governments, due to the complexity and cost of such devices, {{as well as the}} difficulty in acquiring the required materials. He also voices concern about increasing computer power. His worry is that computers will eventually become more intelligent than we are, leading to such dystopian scenarios as robot rebellion. He notably quotes the Unabomber on this topic. [...] After the publication of the article, Bill Joy suggested assessing technologies to gauge their implicit dangers, as well as having scientists refuse to work on technologies that have the potential to cause harm.|$|E

60|$|The {{wheels of}} {{industry}} <b>are</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> stop. The laborer {{will not work}} because the pay is too low and the hours are too long. The producer cannot employ him because the wage is too high, and the hours are too short. If the high wage is paid and the short hours are granted, then {{the price of the}} thing made, so it seems, rises higher still. Even the high wages will not buy it. The process apparently moves in a circle with no cessation to it. The increased wages seem only to aggravate the increasing prices. Wages and prices, rising together, call perpetually for more money, or at least more tokens and symbols, more paper credit in the form of checks and deposits, with a value that is no longer based on the rock-bottom of redemption into hard coin, but that floats upon the mere atmosphere of expectation.|$|E

It was the penetrating comment of chance upon our entire social situation. Beneath a surface of magnificent efficiency was--slap-dash.
