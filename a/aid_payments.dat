25|$|The {{most common}} {{property}} tax assessed on Wisconsin residents {{is the real}} property tax, or their residential property tax. Wisconsin does not impose a property tax on vehicles, but does levy an annual registration fee. Property taxes {{are the most important}} tax revenue source for Wisconsin's local governments, as well as major methods of funding school districts, vocational technical colleges, special purpose districts and tax incremental finance districts. Equalized values are based on the full market value of all taxable property in the state, except for agricultural land. In order to provide property tax relief for farmers, the value of agricultural land is determined by its value for agricultural uses, rather than for its possible development value. Equalized values are used to distribute state <b>aid</b> <b>payments</b> to counties, municipalities, and technical colleges. Assessments prepared by local assessors are used to distribute the property tax burden within individual municipalities.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{unprecedented}} {{scale of the}} destruction many of the country's leading banks, businesses, institutions and local administrations have offered considerable amounts of cash {{in order to help}} the people and businesses that suffered financially due to the fires. The government has created a special account in all Greek banks, where financial help in relief of the people affected by the fire {{from all over the world}} is accepted. Additionally, financial aid from the EU is expected. Forms of assistance in nature were also offered such as olive plants contributed by a Turkish municipality and businessmen to a collect already organized in Mytilene. The Greek Government plans to spend 645.7million euros ($946.7million) to restore and rehabilitate areas burnt by the fires. This amount will be provided by both the European Union and the Greek Government. The government has earmarked 150 million euros ($222 million) to help the people affected by the fire rebuild their homes and other buildings. The rapid nature of the response given in the form of a direct aid scheme free of red tape led to official claims in reverse a year after the calamity, as it has been the case for the residents of Ileia who were notified to return the <b>aid</b> <b>payments.</b> Opposition parties, in the meantime, accused the government of using the scheme to “buy” the votes of locals in the weeks before the Greek legislative election, 2007.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between the change in town property wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> grant <b>payment</b> to a town in support of equalizing public elementary and secondary education per pupil expenditures in Connecticut. In addition to studying the change in total town property wealth, the subgroup of industrial and commercial town property wealth is examined. ^ The sample population for this study was the 169 towns in Connecticut. The independent variables measuring the change in town property wealth were developed using each town 2 ̆ 7 s Equalized Net Grand List data. The dependent variable measuring the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> grant <b>payment</b> to a town was developed from Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s major state education grant program. This study involved an analysis of town data on a statewide basis and an analysis of town data aggregated into Education Reference Group (ERG) domains. ^ Six null hypotheses were generated to investigate the relationship between the change in town property wealth and the change in Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s major state education grant provided to towns. Hypotheses One, Two and Three were examined through correlation analysis. Hypothesis One was rejected because a significant correlation existed between the change in total town property wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> grant <b>payment</b> provided to a town for 111 of the 14 change periods studied. Hypothesis Two was rejected, as a significant correlation existed between the change in town commercial and industrial property wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> grant <b>payment</b> to a town for 10 of the 14 change periods examined. Hypothesis Three was rejected because a significant correlation existed between a proportional change in commercial and industrial property wealth relative to total town wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> grant <b>payment</b> provided to a town for five of the 14 change periods. Null Hypotheses Four, Five and Six were not rejected. ^ This study concludes with policy implications and research recommendations. ...|$|R
5|$|Germanwings' {{parent company}} Lufthansa offered victims' {{families}} an initial <b>aid</b> <b>payment</b> {{of up to}} €50,000, separate from any legally-required compensation for the disaster. Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Technical University of Berlin quoted by the Rheinische Post, said he expected the airline would pay €10–30million in compensation. The Montreal Convention sets a per-victim cap of €143,000 in the event an airline is held liable, unless negligence can be proved. Insurance specialists said although co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid a serious illness from his employer and deliberately crashed the passenger aircraft, these facts would not affect the issue of compensation nor be applicable to the exclusion clause in Lufthansa's insurance policy. Lufthansa's insurance company set aside US$300million (€280million) for financial compensation to victims' families and {{for the cost of}} the aircraft.|$|R

50|$|By {{comparison}} with other means tested benefits, the income treatment of claimants of tax credits is especially generous; it permits deduction of the full gross amount (rather than 50% net)of any individual pension contributions and any Gift <b>aid</b> <b>payments.</b> Since increases in income are subject to withdrawal at 39%(in the initial range), such reductions are effectively 'rebated' {{at the same rate}} through the tax credits received. Thus, while a pension (or Gift Aid) contribution of £100 will cost the employee £80 (after basic rate tax relief) directly from net pay, it attracts an additional £39 in tax credits; so the true cost is only £41.|$|E
