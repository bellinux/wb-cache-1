40|$|We present extensive, {{high-density}} Swift {{observations of}} V 2491 Cyg (Nova Cyg 2008 No. 2). Observing the X-ray emission from {{only one day}} after the nova discovery, the source is followed through the initial brightening, the super-soft source phase and back to the pre-outburst flux level. The evolution of the spectrum throughout the outburst is demonstrated. The UV and X-ray light curves follow very different paths, although changes occur in them <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>times,</b> indicating a link between the bands. Flickering in the late-time X-ray data indicates the resumption of accretion. We show that if the white dwarf (WD) is magnetic, it would be among the most magnetic known; the lack of a periodic signal in our later data argues against a magnetic WD, however. We also discuss the possibility that V 2491 Cyg is a recurrent nova, providing recurrence time-scale estimates. Publisher Version 4400...|$|R
