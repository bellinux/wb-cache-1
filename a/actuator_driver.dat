The proposed Smart Output ASIC is a dedicated terminal system for actuation feature. The main component includes MCU core, four types of <b>actuator</b> <b>drivers,</b> CAN/LIN transceiver, temperature sensor, and BGR/LDO regulator. The Smart Output ASIC communicates with a central ECU by using CAN or LIN protocols. Therefore, the first step for the Smart Output ASIC is to implement the CAN transceiver meeting ISO 11898 - 2 /- 5.

40|$|Sensor fusion and sensor {{integration}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly popular approach in dealing with complex sensor systems in autonomous mobile robots (AMR). However, the procedure for the sensor integration and sensor fusion is a non-trivial process. This paper presents a scenario based approach to sensor fusion based on the Autonomous Evolution of sensory and <b>actuator</b> <b>Driver</b> layers through Environmental Constraints (AEDEC) [1]. Using the scenario based approach, the programmer’s work of creating a sensory driver will be eliminated by having the AMR learn the driver on is own. In {{the process of creating}} each scenario, sensor fusion is automatically implemented. If sensors change or even if the sensor configuration changes, the driver can be updated by having the AMR relearn the driver over again. Due to the tabular structure of the scenario based sensory drivers, malfunctioning sensors can not only be detected, but the driver can automatically adapt to the malfunctioning sensor in real-time. Furthermore, different AMRs trained using AEDEC architecture will have similar interpretations of its environment. This is guaranteed by having the AMR learn the driver in the same highly structured training environment. The behavioral coding is simplified by eliminating any reference to hardware dependent parameters. Finally, the level of abstraction and the consistency of the highly structured environment will allow for code portability. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{refractive}} index of air varies a. o. with temperature, humidity, {{pressure and the}} CO 2 concentration. Due to atmospheric turbulence this {{refractive index}} varies both in space and in time, leading to aberrations in images of light having passed though it. These aberrations limit the achievable resolution of optical telescopes such {{that the quality of}} their images is no longer diffraction limited. An adaptive optics (AO) system is a means to recover the diffraction limited quality of the images. This can be achieved a. o. by reflecting the incoming light on a deformable mirror (DM) that adapts its shape to the wavefront of this light such that some norm of the residual wavefront after reflection is minimal. In this thesis novel designs are considered for the DM and its control system. They are primarily aimed at the 8 m class of telescopes in visible light, leading to a 200 Hz controller bandwidth requirement and 6 mm actuator spacing or 5000 actuators on a 500 mm diameter DM [...] To observe fainter celestial objects and/or increase the image resolution, optical telescopes are foreseen with primary mirrors of up to 40 m in diameter. Therefore, the DM system design is aimed at extendibility to a larger number of Degrees Of Freedom (DOF), which is realized using a modular concept. Other drivers are low power consumption to prevent the need for active cooling systems and low production costs. The DM design is realized using electromagnetic reluctance type actuators that are connected to the DM's reflective membrane by a thin rod. Modules containing 61 hexagonally arranged actuators are manufactured using techniques suitable for mass-production. To generate the currents through the <b>actuator</b> coils, <b>driver</b> electronics are developed based on Pulse-Width Modulation (implemented in FPGAs) in combination with analog low-pass filters. Several prototype DMs are realized whose behavior is analyzed both statically and dynamically by comparing Wyko and laser vibrometer measurements with first principle models of the <b>driver</b> electronics, the <b>actuators</b> and the facesheet. To retain modularity of the system, a distributed control system architecture is foreseen in which each (group of) actuator(s) has its own controller that has a fixed computational power, communicates only to its neighbors and receives only a subset of the wavefront measurement data. The design of a distributed controller with good performance is complicated by the wavefront reconstruction step made necessary by the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. Nevertheless, a distributed algorithm that combines wavefront reconstruction with adaptive prediction is shown in simulation to approximate the performance of a centralized finite impulse response (FIR) predictor/reconstructor and does not deteriorate as the number of DOFs increases.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development of a modeling and simulation framework for diesel engine vehicles to enable soot emissions as a constraint in powertrain design and control. To this end, numerically efficient models for predicting temporallyresolved transient soot emissions are identified {{in the form of a}} third-order dual-input single-output (DISO) Volterra series from transient soot data recorded by integrating real-time (RT) vehicle level models in Engine-in-the-loop (EIL) experiments. It is shown that the prediction accuracy of transient soot significantly improves over the steady-state maps, while the model remains computationally efficient for systemslevel work. The evaluation of powertrain design also requires a systematic procedure for dealing with the issue that drivers potentially adapt their driving styles to a given design. In order to evaluate the implications of different powertrain design changes on transient soot production it is essential to compare these design changes on a consistent basis. This problem is explored in the context of longitudinal motion of a vehicle following a standard drive-cycle repeatedly.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to demonstrate desktop-size and cost-effective flexure-based multi-axis nanopositioning capability over a motion range of several millimeters per axis. Increasing the motion range will overcome {{one of the main}} drawbacks of existing nanopositioning systems, thereby significantly improving the coverage area in nanometrology and nanomanufacturing applications. A single-axis nanopositioning system, comprising a symmetric double parallelogram flexure bearing and a traditional-architecture moving magnet actuator, is designed, fabricated, and tested. A figure of merit for the actuator is derived and shown to directly impact the system-level trade-offs in terms of range, resolution, bandwidth, and temperature rise. While linear feedback controllers provide good positioning performance for point-to-point commands, the tracking error for dynamic commands prove to be inadequate due to the nonlinearities in the <b>actuator</b> and its <b>driver.</b> To overcome this, an iterative learning controller is implemented in conjunction with linear feedback to reduce the periodic component of the tracking error by more than two orders of magnitude. Experimental results demonstrate 10 nm RMS tracking error over 8 mm motion range in response to a 2 Hz bandlimited triangular command. For the XY nanopositioning system, a lumped-parameter model of an existing XY flexure bearing is developed {{in order to understand the}} unexplained variation observed in the transfer function zeros over the operating range of motion. It is shown that the kinematic coupling, due to geometric nonlinearities in the beam mechanics, and small dimensional asymmetry, due to manufacturing tolerances, may conspire to produce complex-conjugate nonminimum phase zeros at certain operating points in the system's workspace. This phenomenon significantly restricts the overall performance of the feedback control system.

Several generations of such MEKA arrays have been fabricated that explore the use of non-conventional MEMS materials such as quartz, polymers or mylar and are combined where needed with conventional MEMS design and fabrication processes. The present study is the first attempt to exploit the potential advantages of using the electrokinetic principle as the basis for a new class of microscale actuators suitable for active sublayer control. Among such advantages are that these actuators have no moving parts, and that they achieve the flow rates required for this type of flow control. Moreover, the inherent problem of matching the length and time scales between microactuators and the physical system being controlled makes the viscous sublayer a natural choice for these types of <b>actuators.</b> The electrokinetic <b>drivers</b> are fabricated inside microchannels, 250 mm to 2 mm in diameter, using a liquid-phase polymerization process that generates 1 µm doped pores.

40|$|Fiber Bragg {{gratings}} (FBGs) are {{key elements}} in modern telecommunication and sensing applications. In optical communication, {{with the advancement}} of the Erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), {{there is a great}} demand for devices with wavelength tunability over the Erbium gain bandwidth (in particular, for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks). The center wavelength of a FBG can be shifted by means of change of temperature, pressure or mechanical axial strain. The axial strain approach is the best method among all other techniques because it allows relatively large wavelength shifts with high speed. Axial strain of up to 4 % will be required to cover the whole EDFA region (more than 40 nm of central wavelength shift). The formation of Bragg grating results in significant reduction in mechanical strength of optical fibers especially in tension. As a result, axial strain of only about 1 % can be achieved by mechanical stretching of FBGs. In order to achieve the remaining 3 % strain compression of FBGs has to be applied. In this thesis, the design and analysis of a novel device for achieving central wavelength shift are presented. In particular, the device has achieved, for a fiber with 12 mm FBG, a shifting of 46 nm in compression and 10. 5 nm in tension with a reflection power loss of less than 0. 25 dB and a FWHM bandwidth variation of approximately 0. 1 nm. Both variations are well below the Bellcore standards requirement of 0. 5 dB for peak reflectivity variation and 0. 1 nm for bandwidth variation. The device consists of two fixed and one guiding ferrules. The difficulties associated with compressing the FBG were handled by carefully selecting tolerances and adjustment procedures. The device allows both tension and compression of FBGs, and the use of different FBG lengths and actuators. The effects of glue deformation and bending of the FBG during compression were analyzed in detail. Further, using the piezoelectric transducer (PZT) <b>actuator</b> as a <b>driver,</b> tuning speed of around 1. 5 nm/ms was achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} this {{research}} was to conduct an experimental analysis in which a THUNDER™ (Thin Unimorph <b>DrivER)</b> <b>actuator</b> was used to adjust the flow of air through a specified cross sectional area inside a Plexiglas housing. The THUNDER™ actuator was developed over ten years ago as a high displacement piezoelectric actuator. It is a curved, bilayer actuator made up of a piezoelectric layer (PZT, lead zirconate titanate) and a stainless steel layer. In this study, the THUNDER™ is the prime mover in an air flow control valve. The valve is made up of a flow channel that allows air to pass {{over the top of the}} actuator. When voltage is applied to the actuator, causing the piezo ceramic layer to expand or contract, the curvature of the actuator changes, thus changing the orifice area in the valve and causing a change in flow. Testing is done with single and dual flow loop arrangements. In the dual flow loop, one flow line contains the control valve while the other is a bypass line. The valve is used to balance flow between the lines. Both lines have adjustable outlet valves so that the valve can be tested under a wide range of flow conditions. Pressure transducers were placed along the experimental setup to observe various pressures conditions in the system. Two flow meters were used to measure either the single loop flow rate or the corresponding flow rate in each line of the dual flow loop. Several lids for the control valve were manufactured and tested to reveal that alternative channel geometries could lead to increased performance over a specific range. The test results showed that the THUNDER™ control valve could modulate the air flow by as much as 16 % at 4. 4 SCFM (125 LPM) in single loop flow and 30 % at 2. 3 SCFM (65 LPM) in dual loop flow for inlet pressures up to 25 PSI (172 kPa) ...|$|R
40|$|Magnetostrictive {{actuators}} are {{the focus}} of many research and development activities, especially for high frequency applications. A key component of these actuators is the magnetic field driving system. In this research work, magnetic field <b>drivers</b> for magnetostrictive <b>actuators</b> are studied and a detailed methodology to build a low cost, power efficient, High Frequency High Amplitude (HFHA) magnetic field driver system is developed. The detailed study of magnetic field drivers suitable for magnetostrictive actuators revealed that the design of the driver must be done at a system level. Changes in geometry of the magnetostrictive material and the mechanical structure have significant effect on the efficiency of the driver. For the purposes of the research work, the magnetostrictive material was limited to two forms, viz. bulk rod and thin film. First, a suitable mechanical structure must be selected based on the amplitude and frequency requirements. For purposes of this work, a cantilever beam was chosen so that large amplitude can be achieved with proper sizing. Simple vibration analysis was used to size the beam so that the designed actuator frequency is within the third bending mode. Second, the magnetostrictive actuator was designed so that a mechanical bias and a magnetic bias can be applied to maximize the output of the <b>actuator.</b> The <b>driver</b> design primarily consists of a coil, a least resistant magnetic return path, a power source, and a command signal generator. Power drawn by the magnetic field driver increases with the frequency of operation due to increases in its inductance, skin effect losses, and eddy current losses. The magnetostrictive material with its low resistivity, when used as a core, therefore requires system level approach in designing the driver. Methodology developed to drive a magnetostrictive actuator includes determining optimal values of diameter of the magnetic wire, number of turns, length of the coil, and overall geometry. This methodology also accounts for the skin effect losses in the driving coil wire and the eddy current losses in magnetostrictive material. The power consumption is further reduced by creating an electrical resonance at the desired operating frequency by adding a capacitor in series with the driver. The least resistance magnetic return path is ensured by using a high magnetic permeability material and custom geometry permanent magnets. In this research work, response of the system comprising a well known model of cantilever beam with mirror and 1 - d model of actuator with nonlinear magnetostrictive rod is measured empirically. The developed methodology is validated experimentally using a custom fabricated magnetostrictive mirror deflector for rapidly tunable laser system. The fabricated mirror deflector is capable of producing a deflection of 6. 1 mrad at 5. 28 kHz with a power consumption of 0. 8 W and a deflection of 3. 8 mrad at 10. 8 kHz with 0. 65 W. The electrical resonance circuits used have further reduced the power consumption by as much as 32 %. The methodology is extended to MEMS thin film mirror deflectors.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of an active rotor system capable of primary control and vibration reduction for rotorcraft. The objective is to investigate the feasibility of a novel Trailing Edge Flap (TEF) actuation system driven by Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs). A significant design effort led to a series of experimental apparatuses which tested various aspects of the performance of the actuators themselves and of TEF systems driven by them. Analytical models were developed in parallel to predict the quasistatic and dynamic behavior of these systems. Initial testing of a prototype blade section with an integrated PAM driven TEF proved the viability of the concept through successful benchtop testing under simulated M = 0. 3 loading and open jet wind tunnel tests under airspeeds up to M = 0. 13. This prototype showed the ability of PAM actuators to generate significant flap deflections over the bandwidth of interest for primary control and vibration reduction on a rotorcraft. It also identified the importance of high pneumatic system mass flow rate for maintaining performance at higher operating frequencies. Research into the development and improvement of PAM actuators centered around a new manufacturing technique which was invented to directly address the weaknesses of previous designs. Detailed finite element model (FEM) analysis of the design allowed for the mitigation of stress concentrations, leading to increased strength. Tensile testing of the swaged actuators showed a factor of safety over 5, and burst pressure testing showed a factor of safety of 3. Over 120, 000, 000 load cycles were applied to the actuators without failure. Characterization testing before, during, and after the fatigue tests showed no reduction in PAM performance. Wind tunnel testing of a full scale Bell 407 blade retrofitted with a PAM TEF system showed excellent control authority. At the maximum wind tunnel test speed of M = 0. 3 and a derated PAM operating pressure of 28 psi, 18. 8 ° half-peak-to-peak flap deflections were achieved at 1 /rev (7 Hz), and 17. 1 ° of half-peak-to-peak flap deflection was still available at 5 /rev (35 Hz). A quasistatic system model was developed which combined PAM forces, kinematics and flap aerodynamics to predict flap deflection amplitudes. This model agreed well with experimental data. Whirl testing of a sub-span whirl rig under full scale loading conditions showed the ability of PAM TEF systems to operate under full scale levels of centrifugal (CF), aerodynamic, and inertia loading. A commercial pneumatic rotary union was used to provide air in the rotating frame. Extrapolation of the results to 100 % of CF acceleration predicts 15. 4 ° of half-peak-to-peak flap deflection at 1 /rev (7 Hz), and 7. 7 ° of half-peak-to-peak flap deflection at 5 /rev (35 Hz). A dynamic model was developed which successfully predicted the time domain behavior of the PAM actuators and PAM TEF system. This model includes control valve dynamics, frictional tubing losses, pressure dynamics, PAM forces, mechanism kinematics, aerodynamic hinge moments, system stiffness, damping, and inertia to solve for the rotational dynamics of the flap. Control system development led to a closed loop control system for PAM TEF systems capable of tracking complex, multi-sinusoid flap deflections representative of a combined primary control and vibration reduction flap actuation scheme. This research shows the promise that PAM <b>actuators</b> have as <b>drivers</b> for trailing edge flaps on active helicopter rotors. The robustness, ease of integration, control authority and tracking accuracy of these actuators have been established, thereby motivating further research...|$|R
40|$|Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) varactors {{have the}} {{potential}} to replace conventional varactor diodes, due to their high loss and non-linearity, in many applications such as phase shifters, oscillators, and tunable filters. The objective of this thesis is to develop novel MEMS varactors to improve the capacitance tuning ratio, linearity, and quality factor. Several novel varactor configurations are developed, analyzed, fabricated and tested. They are built by using standard MEMS fabrication processes, as well as monolithic integration techniques in CMOS technology. The first capacitor consists of two movable plates, loaded with a nitride layer that exhibits an analog continuous capacitance tuning ratio. To decrease the the parasitic capacitance, a trench in the silicon substrate under the capacitor is adopted. The use of an insulation dielectric layer on the bottom plate of the MEMS capacitor increases the capacitors’ tuning ratio. Experimental and theoretical results are presented for two versions of the proposed capacitor with different capacitance values. The measured capacitance tuning ratio is 280 % at 1 GHz. The proposed MEMS vararctor is built using the MetalMUMPs process. The second, third, and fourth capacitors have additional beams that are called carrier beams. The use of the carrier beams makes it possible to obtain an equivalent nonlinear spring constant, which increases the capacitors’ analog continuous tuning ratio. A lumped element model and a continuous model of the proposed variable capacitors are developed. The continuous model is simulated by commercial software. A detailed analysis for the steady state of the capacitors is presented. The measured capacitance tuning ratios of these three capacitors are 410 %, 400 % and 470 %, respectively at 1 GHz. Also, the selfresonance frequency is measured and found to exceed 11 GHz. The proposed MEMS variable capacitors are built by the PolyMUMPs process. The fifth novel parallel-plate MEMS varactor has thin-film vertical comb <b>actuators</b> as its <b>driver.</b> Such an <b>actuator</b> can vertically displace both plates of the parallel-plate capacitor. By making use of the fringing field, this actuator exhibits linear displacement behavior, caused by the induced electrostatic force of the actuator’s electrodes. The proposed capacitor has a low parasitic capacitance and linear deflection due to the mechanically connected and electrically isolated actuators to the capacitor’s parallel-plates. The measured tuning capacitance ratio is 7 : 1 (600 %) at 1 GHz. The fabricated MEMS varactor exhibits a self resonance frequency of 9 GHz and built by MetalMUMPs process. The sixth parallel-plate MEMS varactor exhibits a linear response and high tuning capacitance ratio. The capacitor employs the residual stress of the chosen bi-layer, and the non-linear spring constants from the suspended cantilevers to obtain a non-linear restoring force that compensates for the nonlinear electrostatic force induced between the top and bottom plates. Two existing techniques are used to widen the tuning range of the proposed capacitor. The first technique is to decrease the parasitic capacitance by etching the lossy substrate under the capacitor’s plates. The second technique is employed to increase the capacitance density, where the areas between the top and bottom plates overlap, by applying a thin film of dielectric material, deposited by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The measured linear continuous tuning ratio for the proposed capacitor, built in the PolyMUMPs process, is 5 : 1 (400 %). The seventh and eighth MEMS variable capacitors have plates that curl up. These capacitors are built in 0. 35 μm CMOS technology from the interconnect metallization layers. The plates of the presented capacitors are intentionally curled upward to control the tuning performance. A newly developed maskless post-processing technique that is appropriate for MEMS/CMOS circuits is proposed. it consists of dry and wet etching steps, developed to integrate the proposed MEMS varactors in CMOS technology. Mechanically, the capacitors are simulated by the finite element method in ANSYS, and the results are compared with the measured results. The seventh capacitor is a tri-state structure that exhibits a measured tuning range of 460 % at 1 GHz with a flat capacitance response that is superior to that of conventional digital capacitors. The proposed capacitor is simulated in HFSS and the extracted capacitance is compared with the measured capacitance over a frequency range of 1 GHz to 5 GHz. The eighth capacitor is an analog continuous structure that demonstrates a measured continuous tuning range of 115 % at 1 GHz with no pull-in. The measured quality factor for both CMOSbased capacitors is more than 300 at 1. 5 GHz. The proposed curled-plate capacitors have a small area and can be realized to build a System-on-Chip (SoC). Finally, a tunable band pass filter that utilizes the MEMS variable capacitors in 0. 18 μm CMOS technology from TSMC is designed, modeled and fabricated...|$|R
