5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> completely redesigned queue {{experience that}} places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over his head, and arching tracks passing over him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E

5|$|Eddy changed {{printers}} for {{the second}} edition, which was also poorly proofread, and for the third edition in 1881 switched again, this time to John Wilson & Sons, University Press, Cambridge, MA. John Wilson and his successor, William Dana Orcutt, continued to print the book until after Eddy's death. To the 6th edition in 1883, Eddy <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Key to the Scriptures (later retitled with Key to the Scriptures), a 20-page glossary containing her definitions of biblical terms. The book sold 15,000 copies between 1875 and 1885.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals won the toss {{and decided}} to receive. On the opening kickoff, David Johnson {{returned}} it 108 yards for a touchdown. After both teams exchanged punts, receiver Josh Bellamy caught a 48-yard touchdown pass from Cutler, his first career touchdown reception. On the Cardinals' ensuing drive, the Bears forced fourth down after Palmer's pass to Johnson went out of bounds, but was reversed after it was determined he had a knee and elbow inbounds. Two plays later, Arizona gained 42 yards on Palmer's pass to John Brown, <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> defensive pass interference penalty on corner Kyle Fuller, placing the offense at the Bears' 11-yard line. After two plays, Palmer threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Jaron Brown. On Chicago's next drive, runningback Jeremy Langford scored on a one-yard dive. However, the Cardinals scored two touchdowns in 52 seconds: after Larry Fitzgerald's eight-yard touchdown reception, Tony Jefferson intercepted Cutler, scoring on the 26-yard return. Cutler tried to dive to tackle Jefferson, but landed on his right shoulder and suffered a hamstring injury; Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler {{for the rest of}} the game. Despite losing Cutler, the Bears were able to score three points with Robbie Gould's 40-yard field goal, and got the ball back on the next drive with linebacker Jared Allen intercepting Palmer's pass intended for J. J. Nelson on the first play; however, the Bears had to settle for Gould's 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Clausen's pass for Marquess Wilson was intercepted by Patrick Peterson, with the Cardinals capitalizing on the turnover with Palmer's 28-yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald. After the Bears punted, Arizona increased the score with Johnson's 13-yard touchdown run. Gould eventually kicked a 51-yard field goal to make the score 42–23, but Fitzgerald caught another touchdown pass, this time of nine yards, to widen the margin by 25 points, though Chandler Catanzaro's extra point was wide left.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag of the}} Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic {{was adopted}} by decree on December 25, 1951. The flag was {{slightly}} modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the red star, and golden hammer and sickle. The final specifications of the flag was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and {{are very similar to}} the current Belarusian flag. The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two (1:2), just like the flag of the Soviet Union (and the other fourteen union republics). The main portion of the flag was red (representing the Revolution), with the rest being green (representing the Belarusian forests). A pattern of white drawn on red decorated the hoist portion of the flag; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes. In the upper corner of the flag, in the red portion, a gold hammer and sickle was <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> red star outlined in gold above it. The hammer represented the worker, and the sickle the peasant; according to Soviet ideology, these two symbols crossed together symbolized co-operation between the two classes. The red star, a symbol commonly used by Communist parties, was said to stand either for the five social groups (workers, youth, peasants, military, and academics), the five known continents, or the five fingers of the worker's hand. The hammer, sickle and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse of the flag. The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other. The designer of the flag was Milkahil Gusyev.|$|E

25|$|Wheat and soy {{macaroni}} products – {{begins as}} macaroni products {{with the addition}} of at least 12.5% of soy flour as a fraction of the total soy and wheat flour used. The addition the various forms of egg whites and disodium phosphate are not permitted. Gum gluten may be <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> limitation that the total protein content derived from the combination of the flours and added gluten not exceed 13%.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{improvement was}} {{the extraction of}} smoke through a flue. Still later, a proper hearth would be <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stone chimney. This made cooking easier and meant {{that the house was}} now free of smoke. On the down side, the hearth was no longer really a source of light and there was less energy for heating the house. Later still, one of the larger rooms would be built as a parlour with a separate stove heated from the Diele.|$|E
25|$|As of 2006 {{this former}} site, {{now known as}} Monterey Community Park had a skate park and {{playground}} <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> toilet block and walking/cycle track also now in place. There are current plans for a village green type area to be built including a shaded performance area and further pathways. These works are reported {{to be completed by}} February 2010 and will be utilised at that time for Pines Pride Day, an annual event now held on the site.|$|E

25|$|Suffixes {{are added}} to {{personal}} names without hyphens. If a suffix is attached, it follows the pronunciation of the word, including obsolete consonant clusters (e.g. Móricz, pronounced , suffixed: Móriczcal). However, if a surname or a foreign name ends in a double consonant, suffixes are <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hyphen, so that the original form can be restored (e.g. Papp is suffixed like Papp-pal, because Pappal would refer to another name, Pap). However, given names are suffixed in a simplified way, because they are from a limited set, so their original forms can be retraced (e.g. Bernadett + tel > Bernadettel).|$|E
25|$|Similar to STV, {{the vote}} {{counting}} procedure occurs in rounds. The {{first round of}} RRV is identical to range voting. All ballots are added with equal weight, and the candidate with the highest overall score is elected. In all subsequent rounds, ballots that support candidates who have already been elected are <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced weight. Thus voters who support none of the winners in the early rounds are increasingly likely to elect one of their preferred candidates in a later round. The procedure {{has been shown to}} yield proportional outcomes if voters are loyal to distinct groups of candidates (e.g. political parties).|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{nursing home}} complex was a 1,906sqft(177m²) brick building {{consisting of two}} floors. In 1959, a second building {{was added to the}} rear which includes a garden. The addition increased the size of the complex to 5,179sqft(481m²). The addition was built with precast concrete floor and roof slabs connected to steel beams and columns. In 1966, the brick building was removed and was replaced by a three story building; at the same time, a third floor was added to the original building constructed in 1959. Overall, the second addition expanded the complex to 9,466sqft(879m²). In 1973, a third building was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10ft(3m) corridor connecting to the existing building complex. The third building also consisted of three floors and had a floor area of 3,613sqft(336m²). The construction of the third building, consisted of precast concrete floor slabs, metal roof deck on steel bar joists. All of the buildings were covered with a 5/8inch fire rated plasterboard.|$|E

25|$|Holoxica has successfuly {{demonstrated}} {{several generations}} of holographic video displays. The technical approach advocates a simplified approach by starting with basic building blocks and scaling towards higher resolution and performance. The first-generation holographic display demonstrator, built in 2010, had up to nine voxels and could show simple numeric information, icons, symbology etc. This technology {{can be used to}} build segmented 3D displays, similar to the early segmented LCDs found in calculators and clocks. The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air that can change in real time. Interactivity is <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Kinect motion sensor that allows you to 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a volumetric display. The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E
500|$|The ice surface {{measured}} [...] by , dimensions {{very similar}} to today's National Hockey League (NHL) ice rinks. It {{was surrounded by a}} -wide platform, or promenade, which was elevated approximately [...] above the ice surface and upon which spectators could stand or skaters could rest. Later, a gallery was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> royal box for visiting dignitaries. The ice itself was a 'natural' ice surface, frozen by the coldness of the season, not by the later invention of mechanically-frozen ice.|$|E
500|$|Christian Science {{theology}} differs {{in several}} respects {{from that of}} traditional Christianity. Eddy's Science and Health reinterprets key Christian concepts, including the Trinity, divinity of Jesus, atonement and resurrection; from the 1883 edition she included a glossary that redefined the Christian vocabulary, and <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Key to the Scriptures to the title. At the core of Eddy's theology is {{the view that the}} spiritual world is the only reality and is entirely good, and that the material world, with its evil, sickness and death, is an illusion. Eddy saw humanity as an [...] "idea of Mind" [...] that is [...] "perfect, eternal, unlimited, and reflects the divine," [...] according to Bryan Wilson; what she called [...] "mortal man" [...] is simply humanity's distorted view of itself. Despite her view of the non-existence of evil, an important element of Christian Science theology is that evil thought, in the form of malicious animal magnetism, can cause harm, even if the harm is only apparent.|$|E

2500|$|In 1929 and 1930, a {{total of}} five eight-wheeled {{electric}} locomotives HGe 4/4 I were procured for electric operations. [...] In 1939, a sixth locomotive was <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new bodywork design. [...] These six vehicles were supplemented in 1960 and 1965 by {{a total of}} five two-car railcars of types ABDeh 6/6 and ABDeh 8/8. [...] In 1975 and 1976, four heavy baggage railcars of type Deh 4/4 arrived in the Mattertal.|$|E
2500|$|Mac OS 8 added {{a number}} of {{features}} from the abandoned Copland project, while leaving the underlying operating system unchanged. A multi-threaded Finder was included; files could now be copied in the background. The GUI was changed in appearance to a new shaded greyscale look named Platinum, {{and the ability to}} change the appearance themes (also known as skins) was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new control panel (though Platinum was the only one shipped). This capability was provided by a new [...] "appearance" [...] API layer within the OS, one of the few significant changes.|$|E
2500|$|Phase 2 {{construction}} {{began in}} 2002, and was originally {{expected to be}} completed in December 2008. However, in an attempt to have the airport ready for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which took place in August 2008, the schedule was modified, and Phase 2 construction was completed on 20 June 2008. During this construction phase, a third parallel [...] runway and a 13-hectare cargo terminal area were added. A 16.5-hectare concourse connected to the main passenger building via two parallel [...] underground passageways was <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Mitsubishi Crystal Mover shuttle train APM shuttling passengers between the concourse and the main terminal.|$|E
