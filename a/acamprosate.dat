5|$|<b>Acamprosate</b> may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. By reducing excessive NMDA activity which occurs {{at the onset of}} alcohol withdrawal, <b>acamprosate</b> can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity. <b>Acamprosate</b> reduces the risk of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications <b>acamprosate,</b> disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E

25|$|<b>Acamprosate,</b> {{disulfiram}} and topiramate (a novel anticonvulsant sulphonated sugar) {{are also}} used to treat alcohol addiction. <b>Acamprosate</b> has shown effectiveness for patients with severe dependence, helping them to maintain abstinence for several weeks or months. Disulfiram (also called Antabuse) produces a very unpleasant reaction when drinking alcohol that includes flushing, nausea and palpitations. It is more effective for patients with high motivation and some addicts use it only for high risk situations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acamprosate</b> {{may work}} better than {{naltrexone}} for eliminating drinking, while naltrexone may decrease the desire for alcohol to a greater extent.|$|E

25|$|<b>Acamprosate</b> is {{occasionally}} used {{in addition}} to other treatments, and is then carried on into long term use {{to reduce the risk of}} relapse. If status epilepticus occurs it is treated in the usual way. It can also be helpful to control environmental stimuli, by providing a well-lit but relaxing environment for minimizing distress and visual hallucinations.|$|E

2500|$|... {{there were}} no {{medications}} effective for tinnitus. There is not enough evidence to determine if antidepressants or <b>acamprosate</b> is useful. While there is tentative evidence for benzodiazepines, it is insufficient to support usage. Anticonvulsants have not {{been found to be}} useful. Steroid injections into the middle ear also {{do not seem to be}} effective.|$|E
2500|$|Psychopharmacological {{intervention}} in disorders of impulsivity has shown evidence of positive effects; common pharmacological interventions {{include the use}} of stimulant medication, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants. ADHD has a well-established evidence base supporting the use of stimulant medication for the reduction of ADHD symptoms. Pathological gambling has also been studied in drug trials, and there is evidence that gambling is responsive to SSRIs and other antidepressants. [...] Evidence based pharmacological treatment for trichotillomania is not yet available, with mixed results of studies investigating the use of SSRIs, though Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown positive effects. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is most often treated with mood stabilizers, SSRIs, beta blockers, alpha agonists, and anti-psychotics (all of which have shown positive effects). There is evidence that some pharmacological interventions are efficacious in treating substance use disorders, though their use can depend on the type substance that is abused. [...] Pharmacological treatments for SUD {{include the use of}} <b>acamprosate,</b> buprenorphine, disulfiram, LAAM, methadone, and naltrexone.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of <b>acamprosate</b> is unknown and controversial. At high concentrations, well above those that occur clinically (1-3 μM), reports of inhibition of glutamate receptor-activated responses (1 mM), enhancement of NMDA receptor function (300 μM), weak antagonization of the NMDA receptor, partial agonism of the polyamine site of the NMDA receptor, and possible inhibition of the mGluR1 and mGluR5 (10 μM) have all been published. However, no direct action of <b>acamprosate</b> at clinically-relevant concentrations has yet been reported. Moreover, a subsequent study found no action of <b>acamprosate</b> on the mGluR1 or mGluR5 at concentrations as high as 100 μM, nor at GABAA or glycine receptors or voltage-gated sodium channels.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acamprosate</b> is {{primarily}} removed by the kidneys {{and should not}} be given to people with severely impaired kidneys (creatinine clearance less than 30ml/min). A dose reduction is suggested in those with moderately impaired kidneys (creatinine clearance between 30ml/min and 50ml/min). It is also contraindicated in those who have a strong allergic reaction to <b>acamprosate</b> calcium or any of its components.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the aforementioned wide array of purported mechanisms of action, a 2013 profile animal study published in Neuropsychopharmacology suggests that <b>acamprosate</b> has by itself no psychotropic profile, no N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor or metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 activity, and that therapeutic effects are due to the active calcium moiety co-administered with the <b>acamprosate</b> salt form.

50|$|In {{addition}} to its apparent ability to help patients refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that <b>acamprosate</b> is neuroprotective (that is, it protects neurons from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, and possibly other causes of neurotoxicity). For example, <b>acamprosate</b> {{has been found to}} protect cultured cells from damage induced by ischemia (inadequate blood flow). The drug also protected infant hamsters from brain damage induced by injections of the toxin ibotenic acid (which exacerbates excitotoxicity, the harmful over-activation of glutamate receptors).|$|E

50|$|<b>Acamprosate,</b> a drug used {{to promote}} {{abstinence}} from alcohol, an NMDA antagonist drug, reduces excessive glutamate activity in {{the central nervous system}} and thereby may reduce excitotoxicity and withdrawal related brain damage.|$|E

50|$|Pharmacological {{treatments}} for alcohol addiction include drugs like naltrexone (opioid antagonist), disulfiram, <b>acamprosate,</b> and topiramate. Rather than substituting for alcohol, these drugs {{are intended to}} affect the desire to drink, either by directly reducing cravings as with <b>acamprosate</b> and topiramate, or by producing unpleasant effects when alcohol is consumed, as with disulfiram. These drugs can be effective if treatment is maintained, but compliance can be an issue as alcoholic patients often forget to take their medication, or discontinue use because of excessive side effects. According to a Cochrane Collaboration review, the opioid antagonist naltrexone {{has been shown to}} be an effective treatment for alcoholism, with the effects lasting three to twelve months after the end of treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acamprosate</b> {{is useful}} when used along with {{counselling}} {{in the treatment}} of alcohol dependence. Over three to twelve months it increases {{the number of people who}} do not drink at all and the number of days without alcohol. It appears to work as well as naltrexone.|$|E
50|$|Serious {{side effects}} include {{allergic}} reactions, abnormal heart rhythms, and low or high blood pressure, while less {{serious side effects}} include headaches, insomnia, and impotence.
