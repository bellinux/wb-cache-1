Additionally, she shows great appreciation for the movement away from feminist thought as led by bourgeois white women, and towards a multidimensional gathering of both genders to fight for the raising up of women. This shifts the original focus of feminism away from victimization, and towards harboring understanding, appreciation, and tolerance for all genders and sexes so that all <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> their own destinies, uncontrolled by patriarchal, capitalist tyrants.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from the}} general {{question}} of the [...] "hard problem" [...] of consciousness, roughly speaking, {{the question of how}} mental experience arises from a physical basis, a more specialized question is how to square the subjective notion that we <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> our decisions (at least in some small measure) with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events. The topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.|$|E

They then hunt down Loren in his own building, freeing Oleg Kirrlov, a former KGB agent turned test subject for the Syndicate's cloning initiative. After the Boss kills Loren by crushing him with a heavy chandelier, they either destroy the building or claim it for the Saints, declaring victory over the Syndicate regardless.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea that}} {{intention}} co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement {{is reminiscent of}} [...] "forward models of motor control" [...] (or FMMC, which {{have been used to}} try to explain inner speech). FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction – the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see self serving biases) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation).|$|E

He tells them the Zhentarim no longer wish to reactivate the Onyx Tower, and that the Harpers and the Zhentarim have a common enemy; Mordoc SeLanmere. Mordoc believes he can use the Tower to bring about the downfall of Baldur's Gate, which will please his [...] "allies in the east."

2500|$|... 19 SeptemberSeán Mac Eoin {{begins a}} Free State sweep of {{northern}} County Sligo {{to clear it}} of Anti-Treaty guerrillas. The operation is largely successful. By {{the end of the}} operation, Free State forces <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> all the towns in County Sligo and the conflict there becomes a low level guerrilla affair. 54 people are killed in the county during the entire civil war, 22 Free State troops, 21 Republicans and 11 civilians. Of these, all but 8 have been killed by the end of September 1922. During MacEoin's operation, a Republican column, including an armoured car, is cornered north of Sligo town. The car is put out of action and six Republicans flee up the slopes of Ben Bulben mountain. All six are killed by the pursuing Free State troops, four of them, it is alleged, are killed after surrendering. Among those killed are Cpt. Harry Benson, and Brian MacNeill, (son of Eoin MacNeill, founder of the Irish Volunteers), who is shot at close range in the forehead. One National Army sergeant is killed in the operation and 30 Irregulars are taken prisoner.|$|E
2500|$|The Hayward-Hughes inquiry, which {{reported}} in June 1982, found that Militant {{was guilty of}} breaking Clause II, section 3 of the Labour Party constitution. It took {{only one of the}} four parts of this passage to render an organisation incompatible with the Labour Party: [...] "Programme, Principles and Policy for separate and distinctive propaganda, possessing branches in the constituencies; promoting their own candidates for public office; and, finally, owing allegiance to any political organisation situated abroad." [...] In the words of the authors: [...] "It is clear that the Militant Tendency is a well organised caucus centrally controlled operation within the Labour Party and it is equally clear that supporters of the Tendency <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Party Young Socialists at National and Regional level." [...] Crick though, pointed out that numerous other groups within Labour left and right, had also broken the strictly worded constitution, such as Labour Solidarity, the Labour Co-ordinating Committee and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, but that [...] "dislike of Militant" [...] had developed [...] "because it has breached the constitution so blatantly and, perhaps more importantly, so effectively".|$|E
