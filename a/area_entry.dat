Among labour-intensive industries in urban <b>areas,</b> <b>entry</b> of new enterprises appears {{to be driven by}} surplus labour. This is supported by low barriers to entry and the negative relationship between economic growth and entry rates. In contrast, entry in capital-intensive industries is unrelated to economic growth and it is characterized by significant barriers to entry, including capital, working capital, and proprietor experience. With the exception of labour-intensive industries in rural <b>areas,</b> <b>entry</b> in all other small-enterprise industries is positively correlated with agricultural income.

50|$|Competition {{for entry}} is fierce as over 1000 girls apply each year. Applications range {{from all around}} the West Midlands, Shropshire and Staffordshire <b>area.</b> <b>Entry</b> to the school is via the Shropshire, Walsall and Wolverhampton Grammar Schools Consortium (Adams' Grammar, Newport Girls High, Queen Mary Grammar and High School and Wolverhampton Girls High School), testing Maths, English, verbal and non-verbal reasoning. These tests take place during Year 6 of primary {{education}} (in September). 11+ examinations must be taken in order to be enrolled in the school. Entrance is determined purely from entrance examination results (although the school does operate an appeals and waiting list system) but the chance is very slim, and each year only 145 pupils are awarded a place at the school. Entry after this point is very limited and does not fully open again until sixth form. Sixth form admission is then granted {{on the basis of a}} variety of factors such as GCSE predictions and results, as well as performance in an interview. Both internal and external pupils must achieve more than six A*-B grades (including Maths and English) in their GCSEs to pursue studies in the sixth form, as well as high grades in the options they propose to take.|$|E

40|$|Liquidity in {{government}} securities markets, despite their importance to {{both private and}} public agents, has received much attention in the literature only recently {{due to the fact that}} high-frequency data from trading in those markets were previously unavailable. This paper attempts to measure liquidity in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, where Greek government securities are traded, by estimating six different liquidity measures from high-frequency data. The most appropriate measures for this specific market are derived from the analysis and comparison of the obtained estimates. By any of the measures examined, the ten-year benchmark bond is the most liquid security. The bid-ask spread emerges as a good measure of liquidity for the pre euro <b>area</b> <b>entry</b> period, but looses part of its importance in the post euro <b>area</b> <b>entry</b> period of our sample. An interesting finding is that, in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, liquidity is only weakly related to price volatility, probably due to the specific structure of the government securities market in Greece. Therefore, trading activity is also found to be a good proxy of liquidity in this specific market. Money demand; Greek bond market, market microstructure, liquidity, order flow. ...|$|E

Another reason to look at the post- 2000 era relates to the fact it is only since 2000 that the statistical authorities of Greece have started the production and dissemination of quarterly non interpolated fiscal and economic activity data. It should be taken into account that all fiscal and economic activity data have been approved by Eurostat, i.e., the data used in the analysis are not subject to any statistical deficiencies (see Eurostat 2013).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{scope of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the Romanian strategy towards the euro adoption. We structured our article on sections that cover four main research directions. The first one illustrates the interlinkages between nominal and real convergence; the second presents a comparative analysis Romania-Slovakia; the third one points out the possible scenarios ex post common currency’ introduction and the fourth underlines the necessity of reforming the euro <b>area</b> <b>entry</b> criteria. We conclude by saying that the decision to join the Eurozone should not be taken only in terms of the ability to achieve the nominal convergence criteria, but also in relation to the progress of real convergence phenomenon. In their absence, the economy will become peripheral, less flexible and unable to manage and eliminate the shocks affecting it. ...|$|E
