25|$|Antimony(III) oxide is an {{amphoteric}} oxide, it dissolves in <b>aqueous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> {{solution to}} give the meta-antimonite NaSbO2, which can be isolated as the trihydrate. Antimony(III) oxide also dissolves in concentrated mineral acids {{to give the}} corresponding salts, which hydrolyzes upon dilution with water. With nitric acid, the trioxide is oxidized to antimony(V) oxide.|$|E

50|$|Copper aspirinate can be {{prepared}} by several methods. In one route of preparation, an excess of acetylsalicylic acid is dissolved in <b>aqueous</b> <b>sodium</b> carbonate. <b>Sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is not suitable for this purpose, because it will hydrolyse acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) into salicylic acid and sodium acetate.|$|R
25|$|As a reagent, {{chloroform}} {{serves as}} a source of the dichlorocarbene CCl2 group. It reacts with <b>aqueous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> usually {{in the presence of a}} phase transfer catalyst to produce dichlorocarbene, CCl2. This reagent effects ortho-formylation of activated aromatic rings such as phenols, producing aryl aldehydes in a reaction known as the Reimer–Tiemann reaction. Alternatively, the carbene can be trapped by an alkene to form a cyclopropane derivative. In the Kharasch addition, chloroform forms the CHCl2 free radical in addition to alkenes.|$|E
25|$|It also {{reacts with}} strong alkali to form polyoxovanadates, {{which have a}} complex {{structure}} that depends on pH. If excess <b>aqueous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is used, the product is a colourless salt, sodium orthovanadate, Na3VO4. If acid is slowly added to a solution of Na3VO4, the colour gradually deepens through orange to red before brown hydrated V2O5 precipitates around pH2. These solutions contain mainly the ions HVO42− and V2O74− between pH9 and pH13, but below pH9 more exotic species such as V4O124− and HV10O285− (decavanadate) predominate.|$|E
25|$|Acyl {{chlorides}} {{can be used}} {{to prepare}} carboxylic acid derivatives, including acid anhydrides, esters, and amides by reacting acid chlorides with: a salt of a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, or an amine respectively. The use of a base, e.g. <b>aqueous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> or pyridine, or excess amine (when preparing amides) is desirable to remove the hydrogen chloride byproduct, and to catalyze the reaction. While it is often possible to obtain esters or amides from the carboxylic acid with alcohols or amines, the reactions are reversible, often leading to low yields. In contrast, both reactions involved in preparing esters and amides via acyl chlorides (acyl chloride formation from carboxylic acid, followed by coupling with the alcohol or amine) are fast and irreversible. This makes the two-step route often preferable to the single step reaction with the carboxylic acid.|$|E

25|$|Naphthalene is {{the most}} {{abundant}} single component of coal tar. Although the composition of coal tar varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical coal tar is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with <b>aqueous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound benzothiophene (<nbsp&2%), indane (0.2%), indene (<nbsp&2%), and methylnaphthalene (<nbsp&2%). Petroleum-derived naphthalene is usually purer than that derived from coal tar. Where required, crude naphthalene can be further purified by recrystallization from any {{of a variety of}} solvents, resulting in 99% naphthalene by weight, referred to as 80nbsp&°C (melting point). Approximately 1.3M tons are produced annually.|$|E

2500|$|Glass reacts {{slowly with}} <b>aqueous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> {{solutions}} at ambient temperatures to form soluble silicates. Because of this, glass joints and stopcocks exposed to sodium hydroxide {{have a tendency}} to [...] "freeze". Flasks and glass-lined chemical reactors are damaged by long exposure to hot sodium hydroxide, which also frosts the glass. Sodium hydroxide does not attack iron since iron does not have amphoteric properties (i.e., it only dissolves in acid, not base). A few transition metals, however, may react vigorously with sodium hydroxide.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1887. [...] A contemporary preparation entails treatment of 2-methylpyridine with formaldehyde, followed by dehydration {{of the resulting}} intermediate alcohol. The reaction is carried out between 150–200 °C in an autoclave. The conversion must be kept relatively low with short reaction time to suppress the formation of byproducts. After removal of unreacted 2-methylpyridine by distillation, concentrated <b>aqueous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> {{is added to the}} residue and the resultant mixture is distilled under reduced pressure.
