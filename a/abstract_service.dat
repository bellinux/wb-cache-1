[...] For each EHS, the list includes the name, the Chemical <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> number of the substance, and a number called a threshold planning quantity (TPQ). The TPQ, expressed in pounds, is the critical number. If {{a facility}} has within its boundaries an amount of an extremely hazardous substance equal to or in excess of its threshold planning quantity, the facility {{is subject to the}} EPCRA emergency planning requirements and must notify both the SERC and the LEPC of this fact. The facility must also appoint an emergency response coordinator who will work with the LEPC on developing and implementing the local emergency plan at the facility.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper proposes an OWL DL {{ontology}} for Web {{service description}} which aims at automating selection of composite Web services. In this ontology, we identify communities {{as a mean to}} organize Web services {{for a given}} shared domain. We relate concepts of community, service’s functionality (atomic <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> or composite <b>abstract</b> <b>service)</b> and provided service (concrete service) to each other by using description logic axioms. Concrete services are defined as instances of the specific communities. Thereafter, we propose an approach for classifying services to their corresponding community under the condition that a concrete service must have at least all operations of the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> describing the functionality of the community, {{in order to ensure that}} the concrete services of a community meet correctly the user request. This classification needs to use the automatic generation of SPARQL queries. Eventually, this classification will be helpful in selecting an adequate composite concrete service for a requested composite service...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} speed up the {{generation}} of such description files, this approach leverages the use of patterns and templates to guide the first steps of development. Design patterns guide the creation of a formal requirements document (the service guideline) which, in turn, can be translated into a technology-free consistent description (<b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> code) assisted by implementation patterns. The <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> code is finally compiled into the executable service code, with the help of technology templates. In the pattern-based approach, we added a third phase in the service creation process, which is aimed at the compilation of the service to generate the final service code.|$|E

30|$|Service {{creation}} {{should be}} performed without a need to bind the solution to specific technologies at first, like in our pattern-based approach, where an intermediate <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> code is generated. A service specification should contain the main components that consistently define its behavior, constraints, and interfaces and should be independent of the environment {{it is going to}} be executed on. This approach can foster the interchange of services - which can be run in different data centers in the cloud - between different organizations. The translation of the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> code into executable languages and standards should be left to the very last moment, immediately before deployment.|$|E
