5|$|At federal level, Hamersley {{is within}} the Division of Stirling, a {{marginal}} seat which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party.</b> It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{achievements}} {{and support for}} Catholics were particularly praised by Bob Santamaria, the unofficial leader and guiding influence of the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). The DLP had broken away from the <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> (ALP), the nation's main centre-left social democratic party. The split occurred in the 1950s during the McCarthyism scares, as the Catholic factions broke away to form the DLP {{on the basis that}} the ALP was too lenient towards communists. One of the reasons that Menzies strongly backed Diệm was to gain further favour with the DLP and accentuate the divisions among his left wing opponents.|$|E
5|$|Hamersley has {{consistently}} favoured the centre-right Liberal Party at both {{federal and state}} elections throughout its history. However, in the 2001 and 2005 state elections and at the 1983 federal election, Hamersley booths recorded a majority for the centre-left <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> (ALP). Hamersley has also shown a higher preference than the regional average for progressive minor parties such as the Australian Greens and Australian Democrats. Hamersley is both socially and geographically between the safe Liberal suburbs west of the Mitchell Freeway such as Carine, Duncraig and North Beach, and the safe Labor suburbs east of Wanneroo Road such as Balga and Girrawheen.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{former federal}} {{opposition}} leader Kim Beazley approached Tinley {{to run for}} the federal Division of Stirling as the <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party's</b> endorsed candidate at the 2007 election.

It was sworn in on 30 January 2000, and operated until 26 August 2001, and was succeeded by the First Martin Ministry after the <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party's</b> victory in the 2001 election.|$|R
5000|$|O'Malley's other legacy was the {{spelling}} of [...] "Labor" [...] in the <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party's</b> {{title in the}} American style. He was a spelling reform enthusiast and persuaded the party that [...] "Labor" [...] was a more [...] "modern" [...] spelling than [...] "Labour".

5|$|In 1911, {{the seat}} was {{won for the}} first time for the <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> by Walter Dwyer, a lawyer who helped to draft the Industrial Arbitration Act 1912 during the first Scaddan administration; however, he was {{defeated}} by James Connolly of the new Liberal Party in 1914. Connolly became a minister without portfolio in the new Wilson government in 1916, but resigned in June 1917 when appointed to the role of Agent General for Western Australia. Robert Pilkington of the Nationalist Party won the subsequent by-election on 21 July 1917 and election two months later, before leaving for England in 1921. Harry Mann, a former detective who, amongst other things, oversaw gaming and racing, was elected in his place.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 {{his first}} book, How Labour Governs, was {{published}} by the London Labour Company. Examining the <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> and its wider connection with the Australian labour movement, it reflect Childe's disillusionment with the party, believing that the politicians that it managed to get elected had abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort. Childe's biographer Sally Green noted that How Labour Governs was of particular significance at the time because it was published just as the British Labour Party was emerging as {{a major player in}} British politics, threatening the two-party dominance of the Conservatives and Liberals; in 1924 they were elected to power. Childe had planned a sequel expanding on his ideas, but it was never published.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Weaver was {{appointed}} by Premier Thomas Bavin on 16 April 1929 as the Secretary for Mines and Minister for Forests. Taking over the worsening dispute on the northern coalfields, he believed the struggle to be communist-inspired and made possible by unemployment relief and child endowment and attempted to resolve an industrial dispute by supporting the use of non-union labour in the Rothbury coal mine. The resultant protests led to the Rothbury Riot {{and the death of}} one miner. His suspension of unemployment relief gained him many enemies from the Labor Party. This promotion proved short-lived however, when the Bavin Government was defeated at the October 1930 election, at which Weaver was returned with 65.42%, by Jack Lang's <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party's</b> {{position}} has increasingly shifted {{in favour of}} pro-LGBTI policies, in part to counter the electoral rise of the Australian Greens. Despite support from the left faction, the party opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions in 2009, but by 2013 the Labor Right faction also supported same-sex marriage.|$|R
50|$|In 1980 Nick Greiner {{was elected}} to the NSW Legislative Assembly for the Liberal Party of Australia, {{becoming}} Leader of the Opposition in 1983, and defeating the <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party's</b> Barrie Unsworth in 1988 to become Premier of New South Wales. He was forced to resign as Premier in 1992.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party's</b> Jill Hennessy, {{a lawyer}} {{who sits on the}} board of Western Health, won the seat despite a 13 percent swing away from Labor.
