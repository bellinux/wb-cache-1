40|$|Since the 19802 ̆ 7 s, {{the tuition}} at public colleges and {{universities}} has increased at a rate far beyond that of normal inflation. During this period, many public institutions have increased their tuitions exponentially, while others have chosen or been able to retain stable and relatively inexpensive tuition rates. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine what policies and external trends are responsible for public institutions having such wide variation in their tuition costs. Therefore, this study isolated one type of public institution, which was land-grant universities, that have a mission and tradition of providing affordable educations to examine the causes of this wide level of tuition variation. Data for this study were collected by utilizing a mixed methods approach that focused on the characteristics of specific institutions. A quantitative examination was conducted to evaluate the effects of certain external aspects of tuition setting. Also, a qualitative policy and content analysis was conducted to evaluate the causes, both policy and otherwise, for the variation at both the institutional and state level. Combined, the findings of this study indicated some significant, and some less than significant, factors that were directly linked to tuition setting and the tuition variation. Essentially, the research indicated that the tuition variation was the result of a variety of issues. The content and policy analysis of institutions with exceptionally high tuition rates revealed that their respective state legislatures and state coordinating boards had very little control over the tuition setting process. Conversely, universities with relatively low tuition rates had very little autonomy over tuition setting. Thus, institutional autonomy over tuition setting seems to be a major contributing factor to the wide range of tuition costs across the nation. The quantitative analysis was utilized to examine the effects of external aspects on the tuition rates of each state. The composition of each universities respective state 2 ̆ 7 s legislature, the quality of the institution as measured by U. S. News and World Report (USNWR), the geographic location of the university, and the percentage of each states budget dedicated to higher education were a few of the variables that were examined. Essentially, the research indicated that while some of the variables were either predictive or correlated, many were not. For instance, geographic location is a significant predictor of college costs as is the percentage of a state budget dedicated to higher education. Further, the partisan makeup, level of professionalism, or the amount of <b>appropriations</b> <b>committed</b> to higher education in each institution 2 ̆ 7 s respective state legislature was not predictive nor was institutional quality as measured by USNWR. Finally, the study demonstrated a frail and only marginally significant correlational linkage between college quality and costs. This study successfully indicated that state policies regarding institutional autonomy have a significant affect on college tuition rates. Essentially, the more autonomy and discretion that an institution had, the more likely it was to have significantly higher tuition costs. Further, the less tuition setting autonomy and discretion an institution had, the more likely it was to have lower tuition costs. Additionally, college tuition could be significantly predicted by both geographic location and the percentage of a state 2 ̆ 7 s budget dedicated to higher education. Finally, this study more-or-less discounted the conventional logic that price was positively correlated with quality as this study demonstrated a very frail and only marginally valid correlation between quality and tuition costs...|$|E
50|$|The 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta {{reflected}} {{some lessons}} learned from criticism of the 1976 games, but according to critics, they still perpetuated legacies of erasure, cultural and land theft, and <b>appropriation</b> <b>committed</b> by past Games and Canadian governmental bodies.|$|R
30|$|In addition, ‘pillaging a town or place, {{even when}} taken by assault’ is {{prohibited}} through the provisions RS Art 8 War crimes 2. (b) (xvi) applicable in IAC, and under RS Art 8.2 (e) (v) applicable in NIAC. A number of authors bring to light that {{the reference to}} a ‘town or a place’ is not in line with IHL, and further, the prohibition of pillage is universal (Stewart 2011; Keenan 2014). Furthermore, AP II (1977) Art 4 g) underlines that ‘pillage is prohibited {{at any time and}} in any place whatsoever’. In relation to CIHL, the ICC in Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga [2014] found ‘In the opinion of the Chamber, the pillaging of a town or place comprises all forms of appropriation, public or private, including not only organized and systematic appropriation, but also acts of <b>appropriation</b> <b>committed</b> by combatants in their own interest’ [ICC- 01 / 04 - 01 / 07 - 3436 para 905].|$|R

40|$|Multiyear {{contracting}} {{has largely}} {{fallen out of}} favor due to an inability to quantify savings, Congressional reluctance to <b>commit</b> <b>appropriations</b> for greater than one year and the restrictive nature of cancellation ceilings. Previous studies of multiyear contracting have concentrated on advantages to the Government and neglected the needs and motivation of industry. This study examines the perspective of prime contractors awarded a major system multiyear contract from 1985 to 1991. A survey was conducted to obtain the contractor perspective, counterbalanced with responses from the Government program offices which administered the contracts. This study concluded that: contractors desire a greater say in what programs are selected for multiyear; successful programs, as often as not, still contain an element of instability; contractors believe compensation for risk undertaken is not entirely adequate; and savings from multiyear are potentially greater but still derived entirely from economic order quantity purchases.
