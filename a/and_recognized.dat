5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains <b>and</b> <b>recognized</b> as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E

Mansur's ouster and the subsequent disorder in northern Syria drove Basil to halt all travel and trade with Syria and Egypt, but Salih persuaded him to exempt Aleppo and the Kilab from these sanctions.|$|E

5|$|Islamic society paid careful {{attention}} to medicine, following a hadith enjoining the preservation of good health. Its physicians inherited knowledge and traditional medical beliefs from the civilisations of classical Greece, Rome, Syria, Persia and India. These included the writings of Hippocrates such as {{the theory of the}} four humours, and the theories of Galen. al-Razi (ca. 854–925/935) identified smallpox and measles, <b>and</b> <b>recognized</b> that fever {{was a part of the}} body's defenses. He wrote a 23-volume compendium of Chinese, Indian, Persian, Syriac and Greek medicine. al-Razi questioned the classical Greek medical theory of how the four humours regulate life processes. He challenged Galen's work on several fronts, including the treatment of bloodletting, arguing that it was effective.|$|E

Thus, after defeating the Pechenegs, he set up viceroys to rule Russia in his absence and turned his sights southward again.|$|E
