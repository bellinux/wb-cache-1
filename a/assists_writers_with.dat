40|$|This study {{claims a}} space for the Victorian short story in the {{literary}} canon. It explores what forces were at work between 1830, when {{the rise of the}} magazine created a venue for short story publication, and 1884, when critics codified the British short story. Contemporary criticism tends to compare the short story to the novel to show what it lacks. This project examines the short story in relation to the novel to see what it reveals about the novel as well as what it offers short story writers. Ultimately, the short story develops as a reaction against the limitations imposed upon authors by the novel and by the culture that so strongly valorizes the novel. Although British writers failed to theorize overtly about the short story's form, close readings indicate that they delineate the short story's aesthetic in an economy of narrative and thematic confinement. Significantly, that confinement allows them to take liberties with subject and plot in the short story that they could not take in the novel. In fact, writers of the short story revise the novel's realist aesthetic. The rise of photography <b>assists</b> <b>writers</b> <b>with</b> this revision. As the photograph captures the Victorian imagination, a shared aesthetic develops between the two art forms that teaches readers and writers that meaning is subject to interpretation. The stories suggest that the novel's objective, omniscient third-person narrator may not accurately reflect the reality of the Victorians after all. This project suggests several opportunities for scholarship and teaching. For scholarship, it brings to light texts previously unknown to many readers, offering them new insights into well-known authors' oeuvres. Second, it suggests lines of inquiry for those interested in the ways a text can be shaped by its publication and market. For teaching, it delineates ways of complementing studies of the novel, either through the themes of confinement and freedom or the themes of marriage and community. Finally, it provides a fascinating look at the self-conscious development of a genre as it finds its own generic aesthetic...|$|E

In this paper we focus on methods for automatically choosing nearsynonyms by their semantic coherence with the context. Our statistical method uses the Web as a corpus to compute mutual information scores. Evaluation experiments show that this method performs better than a previous method on the same task. We also propose and evaluate two more methods, one that uses anticollocations, and one that uses supervised learning.

50|$|When {{it comes}} to world {{building}} for historical romances, she points to several elements that can <b>assist</b> the <b>writer</b> <b>with</b> effectively setting the reader in another time: showing practices and habits we frown upon today; practices we find acceptable today that they frowned upon; showing the similarities; using the correct forms of address; and, showing the cost of living. But she cautions that above all, the story must work or the reader will not care about the details. She studies how authors like Laura Kinsale, Courtney Milan, Judith Ivory, Ariana Franklin, and Laurie R. King integrate historical world-building into their narratives.|$|R
40|$|Technical {{documents}} are mostly written in natural languages {{and they are}} highly ambiguity-prone {{due to the fact}} that ambiguity is an inevitable feature of natural languages. Many researchers have urged technical documents to be free from ambiguity to avoid unwanted and, in some cases, disastrous consequences ambiguity and misunderstanding can have in technical context. Therefore the need for ambiguity detection tools to <b>assist</b> <b>writers</b> <b>with</b> ambiguity detection and resolution seems indispensable. The purpose of this thesis work is to propose an automated approach in detection and resolution of syntactic ambiguity. AmbiGO is the name of the prototyping web application that has been developed for this thesis which is freely available on the web. The hope is that a developed version of AmbiGO will assist users with ambiguity detection and resolution. Currently AmbiGO is capable of detecting and resolving three types of syntactic ambiguity, namely analytical, coordination and PP attachment types. AmbiGO uses syntactic parsing to detect ambiguity patterns and retrieves frequency counts from Google for each possible reading as a segregate for semantic analysis. Such semantic analysis through Google frequency counts has significantly improved the precision score of the tool’s output in all three ambiguity detection functions. AmbiGO is available at this URL: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Although {{standard}} tools {{have been used}} for lexical and syntactic analysis since the late 1970 's, no {{standard tools}} exist for the remaining parts of a compiler. Part of the reason for this deficiency is due to the difficulty of producing elegant tools capable of handling the large amount of variation involved in the compiling process. The Object-oriented Compiler Support toolkit is a suite of reusable software components designed to <b>assist</b> the compiler <b>writer</b> <b>with</b> symbol management, type checking, intermediate representation construction, optimization, and code generation. A collection of C++ classes defines a common interface to these tools. Variations in implementation are encapsulated in separately compiled modules that are selected and linked into the resulting compiler. 1 Introduction A compiler is a program that translates a source language into an equivalent target language. The process of compilation is well studied [ASU 86, FL 91, Hol 90, Pys 88]. Standard tools have been in use s [...] ...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. Drama. Tshwane University of TechnologyHow does {{a writer}} write good dialogue? This {{is the basis}} of this study. The need for {{investigation}} of this question arose {{due to the lack of}} information currently available to <b>assist</b> a <b>writer</b> a <b>with</b> a good dialogue-writing approach. Upon review of various literature contributions and articles, it was evident that this subject is relatively explored. The focus of the reviewed sources was mainly on the 'supposed' form and not on the theoretical methodology on constructing dialogue. Enganging this problem a qualitative method was used whereby a literature study identified three aspects, namely, discourse analysis, power dynamics and Stanislavsky's notions on acting. The works of James P. Gee, James C. Scott and Stanislavsky were the main sources used in the respective fields. From their work and others, a series of strategies for development of effective dialogue was developed. Essentially, these strategies drew on the notion of "language in Action" and thus engaged dialogue for film as a series of interactive utterance exchanges. The findings lead to a proposed model which integrates the above mentioned aspects, which were tested and analyzed. This model can <b>assist</b> a <b>writer</b> in the process of constructing dialogue. The conclusion of this study is that the aspects of the created model effects dialogue. If one of the aspects should change, then the dialogue will also change. This ensures a consistent methodical approach to construct dialogue...|$|R
