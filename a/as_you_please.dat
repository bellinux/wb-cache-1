500|$|In a much-noted incident, Model had to {{deal with}} an attempt by Adolf Hitler to {{interfere}} with his arrangements. A telephone call from Army Group Center's chief of staff on 19 January 1942 informed him that Hitler, having become nervous about the direct Soviet threat against Vyazma, had decided that XLVII Panzer Corps, 2nd SS Division Das Reich and 5th Panzer Division were not to be employed in the imminent counterattack but reserved for other use in the rearguard. Immediately, Model drove back from Rzhev to Vyazma in a raging blizzard and boarded a plane for East Prussia. Bypassing the figure of field marshal Günther von Kluge, his immediate superior, he sought a personal confrontation with Hitler. At first he attempted to lay out his reasons in the best, dispassionate General Staff manner, only to find the Führer unmoved by logic. Suddenly, glaring at Hitler through his monocle, Model brusquely demanded to know: [...] "Mein Führer, who commands Ninth Army, you or I?". Hitler, shocked at the defiance of his newest army commander, tried to find another solution favorable for both, but Model still was not satisfied. [...] "Good, Model", the exasperated Hitler finally responded. [...] "You do it <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>please,</b> but it will be your head at risk".|$|E
500|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek {{independence}} from Macedon in {{what became known}} as the Lamian War. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of Kalaureia (modern-day Poros), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family. When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: [...] "Now, as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> you may commence the part of Creon in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." [...] After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died. Years after Demosthenes's suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honour him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the Prytaneum.|$|E
500|$|The {{school is}} {{run as a}} democracy, with {{students}} deciding affairs that range from the curriculum to the behavior code. Lessons are non-compulsory. Neill emphasizes [...] "self-regulation", personal responsibility, freedom from fear, [...] "freedom in sex play", and loving understanding over moral instruction or force. In his philosophy, all attempts to mold children are coercive in nature and therefore harmful. Caretakers are advised to [...] "trust" [...] in the natural process and let children self-regulate such that they live by their own rules and consequently treat with the highest respect {{the rights of others}} to live by their own rules. Neill's [...] "self-regulation" [...] constitutes a child's right to [...] "live freely, without outside authority in things psychic and somatic"—that children eat and come of age when they wants, are never hit, and are [...] "always loved and protected". Children can do as they please until their actions affect others. In an example, a student can skip French class to play music, but cannot disruptively play music during the French class. Against the popular image of [...] "go <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> schools", Summerhill has many rules. However, they are decided at a schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote apiece. This does not necessarily mean total cessation to the children, as Neill thought adults were right to bemoan child destruction of property. He considered this tension between adult and child living styles to be natural. Neill felt that most schoolwork and books kept children from their right to play, and that learning should only follow play and not be mixed [...] "to make [...] palatable". Neill found that those students interested in college would complete the prerequisites in two years and of their own volition.|$|E

2500|$|Nicolodi {{devised the}} {{original}} story concept but received no on-screen credit {{for her work}} on the screenplay. Nicolodi explained {{that she did not}} seek credit because [...] "having fought so hard to see my humble but excellent work in Suspiria recognized (up until {{a few days before the}} première I didn't know if I would see my name in the film credits), I didn't want to live through that again, so I said, 'Do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>please,</b> in any case, the story will talk for me because I wrote it.'" [...] Working from Nicolodi's original story notes, Argento wrote the screenplay while staying in a New York hotel room with a view of Central Park.|$|E

In response, Truth said, [...] "You may hiss as much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>please,</b> but women will get their rights anyway. You can't stop us, neither". Sojourner, like other public speakers, often adapted her speeches {{to how the}} {{audience}} was responding to her. In her speech, Sojourner speaks out for women's rights. She incorporates religious references in her speech, particularly the story of Esther. She {{then goes on to}} say that, just as women in scripture, women today are fighting for their rights. Moreover, Sojourner scolds the crowd for all their hissing and rude behavior, reminding them that God says to [...] "Honor thy father and thy mother." ...|$|E
