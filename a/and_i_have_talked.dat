60|$|When my {{botanist}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> {{over and}} exhausted every possibility of our immediate position, we should turn, I think, to more general questions.|$|E
6000|$|After Miss Fanny <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{told her}} my plan, which she {{pronounced}} to be delightful, she continued:--"I never was so provoked in my life, Mr. Titmarsh, as when that odious man came and interrupted that dear delightful conversation." ...|$|R
6000|$|Reuben Camp broke out: [...] "That was my blunder, Mr. Twelvemough. Mr. Homos <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> it over conditionally, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was not {{to speak}} of it till he had told you; but it slipped out in the {{excitement}} of the moment." ...|$|R

The times have somewhat changed [...] Since thou <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talk</b> beneath a tree, [...] Albeit ye are not gods yet. [...] Eve. [...] Adam! hold [...] My right hand strongly! It is Lucifer-- [...] And we have love to lose.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have thought}} {{a good deal}} about it, my dear aunt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> {{a good deal about}} it with Steerforth. I like it very much indeed. I like it exceedingly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Lane," [...] said he, [...] "I suppose by this Christmas you've {{gotten over}} {{being afraid of}} that fellow McRoy, haven't you? Madison <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> about it, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dolores <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> {{the matter}} over often, and {{have arrived at}} the {{conclusion}} long since {{that there is no}} such great difference between us as would lead us to hate each other." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{came back}} on Tuesday afternoon, {{explained}} Mr. Andrews, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a <b>talk</b> with her.|$|R
5000|$|Green {{recalls how}} the {{collaboration}} came about: [...] "Alecia <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about (working together) {{for a long}} time — not about making a record, but the idea of singing together and trying to write a song. (...) When we had the time to do it, that really lit a fire of creativity because it was something different. The idea of collaborating with a female voice and a different writer was what I needed, I guess, to create a bunch of new songs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad that}} you came this afternoon," [...] Rachael continued. [...] "Bertrand <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking.</b> We think it well {{that you should be}} married very soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can easily}} tell you, Miss Minna. I am David Glenney, nephew of Mrs. Wagner, of London. Fritz is staying in her house, and he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> about {{you by the}} hour together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see what}} she can have on her mind," [...] the miller said, shaking his head. [...] "It may only be a fancy of mine. Hesba <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> it over a score of times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is another}} story, Colonel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> until I am hoarse now, so that that must keep until another sitting. It is quite time that I {{was off to}} see how my men are getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] Andrew said. [...] "I {{never so}} much as dreamt of it. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done so he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> {{together}} to a purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] said Veronica. [...] "I don't {{really mean}} any harm. He's a sailor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to <b>talk</b> {{to him like}} that, else he don't know he's being talked to." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{never told}} you that I loved you, nor have you [...] {{expressed}} your willingness to receive my love. Dear Mary, [...] how shall it be?

May I not {{think that it was}} so? May it not be [...] so? May I not call you my Mary? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Lord Chamberlain is wrong, sire," [...] {{returned}} the Prince; [...] "my tutor, Borland, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> {{with many of}} these beggars the past few days, and we find the tithes and taxes which have enriched you have taken the bread from their wives and children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} you would be back by the spring, Captain," [...] he said. [...] "Donald <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> it over, many a time, and we were of one mind that, if any one could get away from an Austrian prison, you would do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So is {{this message}} of the Iroquois to me," [...] {{answered}} Judith rising, {{as if she had}} determined on her own course for the present. [...] "My answer shall be given, Deerslayer, after you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> together alone, when the others have laid themselves down for the night." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason behind}} the cities chosen {{in the song}} Greenwood says, [...] "I'm from California, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know anybody from Virginia or New York, so when I wrote it—and my {{producer}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about it—we talked about the four cities I wanted to mention, {{the four corners of}} the United States. It could have been Seattle or Miami but we chose New York City and Los Angeles, and he suggested Detroit and Houston because they both were economically part of the basis of our economy—Motortown and the oil industry, so I just poetically wrote that in the bridge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That instant,' said Ralph. 'I {{was coming}} to call for you, making sure to catch you before you left; but your mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> over family affairs, and the time has slipped away so rapidly--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you know}} that because you've been getting so savage about Frazer the whole team 's getting mad?" [...] said the coach. [...] "Cowles <b>and</b> Griffin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> over the whole proposition. Your {{boosting}} Frazer----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a most}} {{necessary}} step. I am {{a plumber}} with a rising business, Escott, by name. I have walked out with her each evening, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> with her. Good heavens, those talks! However, I have got all I wanted. I know Milverton's house as I know the palm of my hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> that over, and I {{have made}} up my mind to try her way first. There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick," [...] {{answered}} Meg tranquilly.|$|E
6000|$|... "We see that, Mortiz. Dick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> it over, a {{thousand}} times. But {{so long as}} there is but a shadow of a chance of his finding his father, he is ready to undertake the search. He is a boy in years, but he has been trained for the undertaking, and will, when the trial comes, bear himself as well as a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I imagine I know enough. Gerald's in trouble; he or {{you must}} meet the bill Hallam will bring. You see, the fellow belongs to my club <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a <b>talk</b> with him when I was in town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, so <b>have</b> <b>I</b> been {{thinking}} too, Rick," [...] said my guardian, [...] "and our little woman likewise; she <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> {{of it this}} very day. I dare say her husband won't object. What do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{let that}} go;" [...] and Jordan {{looked at him}} with a smile in his keen dark eyes. [...] "Your sister <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> about you. She feels that you ought to stay with the old man, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, Quilp, good Quilp,' gasped the old man, {{catching}} at his skirts, 'you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> together, {{more than}} once, of her poor mother's story. The fear of her coming to poverty has perhaps been bred in me by that. Do not be hard upon me, but {{take that into}} account. You are a great gainer by me. Oh spare me the money for this one last hope!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wilson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> it over, Frances, but {{at present}} we don't see our way. It is too serious a matter {{to make up}} our minds in a hurry. Your mother is in favour of giving him a {{handsome}} present; but I don't think, myself, that that would do. Men who will do such deeds as that are {{not the sort of}} men to be paid by money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{in no way}} {{surprised}} at your request, Edgar," [...] the knight said; [...] "and, indeed, {{for the past two}} years my dame <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> this over, and hoped that it might be. I have during the past year had more than one request for her hand, but have refused them, for her mother told me she believed that Aline's fancy has long inclined towards you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} to do' she went on; 'I <b>have</b> taught <b>and</b> taught. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> till I'm tired. I've whipped her. I've punished her in every way I can think of, and still she is as naughty as she was at first.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Arthur, my dear boy,' said Mr Meagles, on {{the evening}} of the {{following}} day, 'Mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> this over, and we don't feel comfortable in remaining as we are. That elegant connection of ours--that dear lady who was here yesterday--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think much}} about all this. Sir William Martin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> much <b>talk</b> about it; and the strong {{practical}} mind of the Primate, I hope, would keep me straight if I was disposed to theorise, which I don't think is the case.|$|R
