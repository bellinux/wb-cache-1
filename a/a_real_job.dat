He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>job.</b> He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

She {{was the first person to}} be selected as the parliamentary candidate for a major British political party through a postal open primary; during the campaign she emphasised that she was not a career politician and had actually had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>job.</b> As the Conservative Party candidate for Totnes at the 2010 general election she won the seat with an increased majority, increasing it further in 2015.|$|E

When she was around 9–10 years old, she was {{inspired}} by an interview by Christy Carlson Romano who voiced Kim Possible, in which Romano said that with voice acting, {{you could go to}} work in your pajamas. Harlacher's mother responded that it was not <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>job,</b> and suggested she pursue acting only as a hobby. Her first exposure to anime was through Dragonball Z and Pokémon shows, which she considered more like cartoons, and that she really got into manga and anime in school when Fruits Basket was being published in English. At La Reina High School, she was active in the Speech and Mock Trial team, which was noted statewide and even attended a national event. She also competed on the school's diving team.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of the {{commander}} of the V Bomber Command, Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, in an air raid over Rabaul in January 1943, the commander of the Fifth Air Force, Lieutenant General George Kenney asked Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the chief of Army Air Forces to send Ramey to Australia as a replacement. The two men had known each other for years and Ramey had recently been on Kenney's staff when Kenney was commander of the Fourth Air Force. [...] "I had {{a lot of confidence in}} him," [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "and believed he would do <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>job</b> for me. Arnold replied the next day that I could have him." [...] Ramey assumed command of V Bomber Command in January 1943. After the arguments over bombing tactics with Walker, Kenney was pleased that Ramey liked the skip bombing tactics the Fifth Air Force was developing. These tactics were put in practice with devastating effect at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943.|$|E

This paper continues the work in ”Scheduling optimization of <b>a</b> <b>real</b> flexible <b>job</b> shop including fixture availability and preventive maintenance” [Thörnblad et al., European Journal of Industrial Engineering, 2015], with an improvement of the iterative solution procedure, and the inclusion of constraints regarding night shifts during which only unmanned processing is allowed to be scheduled.

[...] Illinois did not have an opening, but the school's athletic director passed along Yost's letter to Baird at Michigan. [...] Baird asked Yost to come to Ann Arbor to interview for the football coaching job. [...] Before leaving for Ann Arbor, Yost sent Baird a box of clippings and scrapbooks. [...] Baird met Yost at the Ann Arbor train station, where Yost is reported to have told Baird, [...] "There are three things that make a winning football team, spirit, manpower and coaching. [...] If your boys love Meeshegan, they've got the spirit, you see. [...] If they turnout, that takes care of the manpower. [...] I'll take care of the coaching."
