50|$|In November 2010, the Marine Stewardship Council {{certified}} the Ross Sea <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> fishery as {{a sustainable}} and well-managed fishery. The certification is contentious, with many conservation groups protesting the certification {{due to the}} paucity of information needed to reliably manage the fishery, and that only eight of the nineteen vessels in the fishery during the latest year for which data are publicly available were certified. During the 2013-14 season vessels operating under the Marine Stewardship Certification landed 51.3% of all <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> from the Ross Sea Region (CCAMLR Subarea 88.1) and 64.7% of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> from the Amundsen Sea sector (CCAMLR Subarea 88.2).|$|E

50|$|Aging data {{indicate}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> are relatively fast-growing when young, but then growth slows later in life. They reach {{about one-third of}} maximum size after five years, and half maximum by 10 years, after which growth slows considerably. To grow fast when small is an adaptation of most predatory fish, e.g., sharks, {{so as not to}} be small for very long. The maximum age recorded so far has been 48 years. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> take a long time to mature (13 years for males, 17 years for females) and once mature may not spawn every year, though the actual spawning interval is unknown. Only a few <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> with mature eggs have ever been caught, meaning knowledge is sparse about fecundity. They spawn sometime during winter. Large, mature, older fish have been caught among the seamounts of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, a location thus thought to be important for spawning. Smaller, subadult <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> tend to concentrate in shallower waters on the continental shelf, while a large portion of the older fish are found on in the continental slope. This sequestering by size and age could be another adaptation for small fish to avoid being eaten by large ones. The recruitment potential of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish,</b> a measure of both fecundity and survival to spawning age, is not known.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> has a lightweight, {{partially}} cartilaginous skeleton, lacks a swim bladder, and has fatty deposits which {{act as a}} {{stored energy}} source, particularly during spawning. This fat also makes large toothfish neutrally buoyant. Many toothfish caught over the seamounts are very depleted of fat, and this is thought perhaps {{to be related to}} spawning and spawning migration, which are energy-demanding activities. It is not known what happens to these fat-depleted fish, including whether they reach, or how long it takes them to reach, breeding condition again; this ostensibly occurs upon returning to continental slope waters. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> have vision and lateral line systems well adapted to find prey in low light levels. Since ice covers the surface of the ocean where <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> occur even in summer, these sensory specializations likely evolved to enable survival in the reduced light levels found under ice and in the Antarctic winter, as well as at deep depths. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> also have a very well developed sense of smell, which is why they are easily caught by baited hooks and also scavenge the remains of penguins killed by other predators.|$|E
5000|$|Over the {{continental}} shelf, <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> feed on shrimp (Nauticaris spp.) and small fish, principally another neutrally buoyant nototheniid, the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum). This loosely schooling species {{is also a}} major prey of Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). [...] Therefore, competition for prey among toothfish and these other mesopredators (middle trophic level predators) could be very important. The large <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> are eaten by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), killer whales (Orcinus orca), Weddell seals and possibly colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). Toothfish that are dwelling on the bottom, particularly those caught during the summer on {{the continental}} slope, eat mainly grenadiers (Macrouridae) but also feed on other smaller fish species and skates (Raja spp.). <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> have been caught to depths of 2200m, though based on commercial fishing effort, few occur that deep.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{challenges}} that faced toothfish management in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g., IUU fishing, mislabelling, and inadequate data for management), consumer seafood guides such as Seafood Watch placed toothfish of both species (Chilean seabass) on their red, or “avoid”, list; however, in light of up-to-date, internationally peer-reviewed scientific information, in April 2013, Seafood Watch upgraded the Ross Sea <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> fishery to a [...] "good alternative". Following a comprehensive review in 2012 the Monterey Bay Aquarium revised its rating of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> to 'good alternative'.|$|E
5000|$|The {{argument}} {{that only a}} portion of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> is certified, the high price it commands and the remote areas where {{a large proportion of the}} fish are caught have been advanced as an encouragement to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and mislabeling. A 2011 genetic study of MSC-labeled <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> found in markets revealed a significant proportion were not from the MSC-certified stock, and many were not toothfish at all. The MSC had conducted its own internal study which found no evidence of mislabelling. [...] The MSC conducts an annual audit of the fishery which includes sampling of certified product.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> is noteworthy, {{like most}} other Antarctic notothenioids, for {{producing}} antifreeze glycoproteins, a feature not seen in its closest relative, the Patagonian toothfish, which typically inhabits slightly warmer waters. The presence of antifreeze glycroproteins allows the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> (and other notothenioids) to thrive in sub-zero waters of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. The Antarctic toothfish’s voracious appetite also is important in coping with cold water. It is mainly caught in the Ross Sea in the austral summer, but has also been recorded from Antarctic coastal waters south of the Indian Ocean sector, {{in the vicinity of}} the Antarctic Peninsula, and near the South Sandwich Islands.|$|E
50|$|The {{total catch}} of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> in 2013-14 was 3820 tonnes. 3,320 tonnes {{of this was}} taken from the Ross Sea (FAO Statistical Divisions 88.1 and 88.2) with the {{remainder}} taken from other high seas areas within the CCAMLR convention area.|$|E

5000|$|Dissostichus mawsoni, the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish,</b> is {{a species}} of cod icefish native to the Southern Ocean. It is often mistakenly {{referred}} to as an Antarctic cod, consistent with the misnaming of other notothenioid Antarctic fish as rock cods. However, notothenioid fishes are unrelated to cods, which are in another taxonomic order, the Gadiformes. The generic name Dissostichus is from the Greek dissos (twofold) and stichus (line) and refers {{to the presence of}} two long lateral lines, which are very important to the species’ ecology. The common name [...] "toothfish" [...] refers to the presence of biserial dentition in the upper jaw, thought to give it a shark-like appearance.

These fisheries took significant steps to exclude illegal vessels from their waters: ...|$|E
50|$|A fishery for <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish,</b> {{managed by}} the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), has existed since 1997. The {{existence}} of this fishery in the Ross Sea, the area where most <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> are caught, is very contentious - the main argument proposed for this being the lack of accurate population parameters, such as original stock size, fecundity, and recruitment. Moreover, the main fishing grounds is presumed by some researchers to cover the area through which the entire stock of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> pass. Typically the fishing season has finished in the area {{by the end of}} February and {{for the remainder of the}} year much of the area is covered by sea-ice providing a natural impediment to fishing. This fishery is characterised by opponents as being a challenge to manage owing to the nature of benthic longline fishing. The bycatch of other fish can also be significant, with the ratio to tonnes of toothfish caught ranging from 4.5% to 17.9% and averaging 9.3% from the 1999/2000 fishing season to 2013/14 in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1 when the toothfish catch first exceeded 50 tonnes and from 2.3% to 24.5% averaging 12.4% in CCAMLR Subarea 88.2 up to the latest publicly available figure from 2013/14. The bycatch of other fish species is also regulated to a maximum amount annually by CCAMLR. CCAMLR decision rules are based on determining the catch level that will ensure that the median estimated spawning stock biomass (not total biomass) is greater than or equal to 50% of the average pre-exploitation spawning biomass after a further 35 years of fishing (i.e. 35 years from each year of assessment), with the additional condition that there is less than a 10% probability that the spawning biomass will decline below 20% of the pre-exploitation level at any time during this period. Current spawning stock biomass for <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> in the Ross Sea Region is estimated to be at 75% of the pre-exploitation level (95% Bayesian probability interval 71-78%), well above the 50% target reference point.|$|E
50|$|Incidental {{mortality}} of seabirds {{as a result}} of fishing has fallen to near-zero levels in the CCAMLR convention area. No {{mortality of}} seabirds or marine mammals was recorded {{as a result of}} fishing for <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> in 2011-12 and only two seabirds (Southern Giant Petrels Macronectes giganteus) have been killed as a result of fishing in the Ross Sea since 1996/97.|$|E
5000|$|An {{independent}} study {{was reported to}} have detected the disappearance of large fish at the southern periphery of its range in the McMurdo Sound area and was postulated to be consistent with this apparent loss of large fish. However more recent work has shown this was not to be the case in 2014. Some studies have reported that the prevalence of fish-eating killer whales has been apparently decreasing in the southern Ross Sea, foraging efficiency of Weddell seals is decreasing, and numbers of Adélie penguins (competitors for silverfish) have been increasing. More recent studies have confirmed visual sightings of Weddell seals and Type-C killer whales holding and consuming large toothfish in the McMurdo Sound area and raise questions over the previously assumed importance of assumed dominance of Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the diet of Weddell seal and Type-C killer whales. [...] These reports highlight the importance of managing this fishery {{in the best interests of}} the ecosystem by continuing to collect information on both <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> life history and the interaction of that species with predators and prey. An important research programme in this regard is the annual 'Shelf' survey carried out annually since 2012 which is designed to monitor the abundance of subadult <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> in areas where subadult-sized fish have been regularly found (e.g., in the southern Ross Sea) has been designed provide data to better estimate recruitment variability and provide an important early-warning signal of changes in toothfish recruitment. The project also is used for additional targeted data collection to better understand the life cycle and ecosystem role of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Critics {{condemn the}} Marine Stewardship Council for {{certifying}} specific fisheries {{that may be}} in trouble, harmful to the environment, or {{where there is a}} lack of information available. For example, the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> fishery in the Ross Sea was awarded an MSC label, despite a lack of basic information on the stock itself. A Marine Policy study that analyzed the stocks of MSC fisheries found that 31% of the stocks were overfished, and 11% did not have suitable information available.|$|E
50|$|At {{the peak}} of IUU fishing, illegal catches were {{estimated}} to be 32,000 tonnes in 1997 with approximately 55 vessels believed to be active. By 2010, IUU catches had fallen to an estimated 1,615 tonnes, all taken in high seas areas, with just four IUU fishing vessels reported to be active. This is a decrease in IUU fishing by over 95% since the mid 1990s. CCAMLR estimates that 90% of IUU catches are now of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish,</b> not Patagonian toothfish.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Chilean Seabass" [...] {{was invented}} by a fish {{wholesaler}} named Lee Lantz in 1977. He {{was looking for a}} name that would make it attractive to the American market. He considered [...] "Pacific sea bass" [...] and [...] "South American sea bass" [...] before settling on [...] "Chilean sea bass". In 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted [...] "Chilean Seabass" [...] as an [...] "alternative market name" [...] for Patagonian toothfish, and in 2013 for <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ross Sea {{is home to}} {{at least}} 10 mammal species, half a dozen species of birds, 95 species of fish, and over 1,000 {{invertebrate}} species. Some species of birds that nest in and near the Ross Sea include the Adélie penguin, emperor penguin, Antarctic petrel, snow petrel, and south polar skua. Marine mammals in the Ross Sea include the Antarctic minke whale, killer whale, Weddell seal, crabeater seal, and leopard seal. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish,</b> Antarctic silverfish, Antarctic krill, and crystal krill also swim in the cold Antarctic water of the Ross Sea.|$|E
50|$|Fully grown, {{these fish}} (and their warmer-water relative, the Patagonian toothfish, D. eleginoides) can grow {{to more than}} 1.7 m in length and 135 kg in weight, {{twice as large as}} the next largest Antarctic fish. Being large, and {{consistent}} with the unstructured food webs of the ocean (i.e., big fish eat little fish regardless of identity, even eating their own offspring), the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> has been characterized as a voracious predator. Furthermore, by being by far the largest midwater fish in the Southern Ocean, it is thought to fill the ecological role that sharks play in other oceans. Aiding in that role, the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> is one of only five notothenioid species that, as adults, are neutrally buoyant. This buoyancy is attained at 100-120 cm in length and enables them to spend time above the bottom without expending extra energy. Both bottom-dwelling and mid-water prey are therefore available to them. Most other notothenioid fish and the majority of all Antarctic fish, including smaller toothfish, are confined to the bottom. Coloring is black to olive brown, sometimes lighter on the undersides, with a mottled pattern on body and fins. Small fish blend in very well among the benthic sponges and corals. They have a broad head, an elongated body, long dorsal and anal fins, large pectoral fins and a rudder-like caudal fin. They typically move slowly, but are capable of speed bursts that can elude predatory seals.|$|E
50|$|The Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Patagonian {{toothfish}} (Dissostichus eleginoides) and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus mawsoni) was {{one measure}} that ensured reductions in illegal fishing for toothfish {{and reduced the}} scope for trade in illegally caught fish. The CDS is an innovative online catch document information system (DCD: Dissostichus Catch Document) developed to identify legal toothfish harvested, which tracks toothfish {{from the point of}} landing throughout the trade cycle to point of sale. The CDS requires verification and authorisation by national authorities at regular intervals in the trade cycle. Identification of the origin of toothfish entering the ports and markets of CDS Parties is essential.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the Ross Sea <b>Antarctic</b> <b>toothfish</b> fishery was {{independently}} {{certified by}} the Marine Stewardship Council, and has been rated as a 'Good Alternative' by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program. However, a 2008 document submitted to the CCAMLR reported significant declines in toothfish populations of McMurdo Sound coinciding {{with the development of}} the industrial toothfishing industry since 1996, and other reports have noted a coincident {{decrease in the number of}} orcas. The report recommended a full moratorium on fishing over the Ross shelf. In October 2012, Philippa Ross, James Ross' great, great, great granddaughter, voiced her opposition to fishing in the area.|$|E
