5|$|In December 2005, 10 {{years after}} signing its first record {{deal with the}} {{publishing}} company Warner/Chappell Music Scandinavia, Meshuggah extended its cooperation with the company. In November 2005, Haake {{said in an interview}} that the band was not content with the productions of Chaosphere <b>and</b> <b>Nothing,</b> because, being on tour, they had little time to devote to them.|$|E
5|$|Jim avidly {{read the}} Liverpool Echo or Express, liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His {{attitude}} to life {{was based upon}} self-respect, perseverance, fairness and a strong work ethic. His political views were far from left-wing, as he insisted {{that there was nothing}} anyone could do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> would ever change.|$|E

5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. It only perches in trees in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> else is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1875, Jeanne d′Arc {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Bonie, {{but she was}} placed in reserve on 1 January 1876 at Brest, France.

5|$|The first {{church was}} set up by St Paulinus of York {{on the site of the}} present All Saints Parish Church {{sometime}} in the early 7th century. It was made from wood <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> survives of it. In 855 a stone church was built on the same site, fragments of stone have been found during restoration work which provide strong evidence of this Saxon church.|$|E
5|$|The royal tomb {{found in}} the royal palace G is {{designated}} hypogeum G4; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> of the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.|$|E

5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} private operations along the line. Continental Railway Systems {{was established by}} Rasmus Surdal.

5|$|With Tiberius's departure, {{succession}} rested {{solely on}} Augustus' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar. The situation became more precarious in AD2 {{with the death}} of Lucius. Augustus, with perhaps some pressure from Livia, allowed Tiberius to return to Rome as a private citizen <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> more. In AD4, Gaius was killed in Armenia, and Augustus had no other choice but to turn to Tiberius.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Donna {{accepts the}} Doctor's {{original}} offer to travel in the TARDIS. The Doctor makes it clear to her that he only wants to be friends <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> more, and she emphatically agrees. She makes a detour to leave her car keys in a litter bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be Rose Tyler, who fades from view as she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred. He sees her in his telescope and celebrates on his allotment.|$|E

5|$|European {{exploration}} {{continued in}} the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century, boosted by Champollion's translation of hieroglyphs. Early in the century, the area was visited by Belzoni, working for Henry Salt, who discovered several tombs, including those of Ay in the West Valley (WV23) in 1816 and Seti I (KV17) the following year. At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been located <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> of note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General.|$|E
5|$|Farmiga's {{breakthrough}} role came in 2004 for her {{portrayal of}} a mother harboring a secret drug habit in the drama film Down to the Bone. She co-starred in The Manchurian Candidate (2004), The Departed (2006), The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008), <b>and</b> <b>Nothing</b> But the Truth (2008). She later gained further critical acclaim {{for her role as}} Alex Goran in the 2009 comedy-drama film Up in the Air, for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award, SAG Award, BAFTA Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E
5|$|In 1203 Norreis, {{secure in}} his {{alliance}} {{with his own}} monks, once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit {{and that of his}} family and friends. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas, along with other monks, to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non-member of the community. Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> was done about Norreis's exactions and abuse of his monks.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, {{it was not possible}} to exactly confirm the locations of the holes, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the band}} contributed {{a cover of}} the Underdog theme song to be {{included}} on the tribute album , produced by Ralph Sall for MCA. Later that year, Haynes's side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey's Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album. Titled The Hole Truth... <b>and</b> <b>Nothing</b> Butt, it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991. In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with Touch and Go. At first they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion. The case quickly became a fight for all ownership rights that dragged {{on for more than}} three years.|$|E
5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> more.|$|E
