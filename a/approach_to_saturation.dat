30|$|It can {{be found}} that the fitted curve shows a good {{agreement}} with the experimental data. The conducting mechanism of Ni-DNA in alkaline environment can be demonstrated as follows. When small amount of nickel ions was added to DNA solution (< 0.01 mM), they firstly combine with the phosphate groups so that electron doping of DNA occurs [14] and the conductance remarkably increases. At the range of 0.01 – 0.05 mM, the nickel ions bonding to phosphate backbone are nearly saturated, meanwhile, few ions intercalate into base pairs so that the increase of conductance becomes slowly. And the conductance increase remarkably again when the concentration was above 0.05 mM, indicating that nickel ions intercalate into base pair and bind to N 3 and N 1 of Thymine and Guanine. Therefore, not only a π-stack but also an intercalated metal ion channel forms for Ni-DNA so that the conductance could be improved, in agreement with Ref. [14]. But the conductance did not change when the concentration was above 0.1 mM, denotes that the combination between Ni 2 + and DNA <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>saturation.</b>|$|R
