5|$|Postovulatory follicles are {{structures}} formed after oocyte release; they do {{not have}} endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A degenerative process called follicular <b>atresia</b> reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} common {{congenital}} malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal <b>atresia</b> where the oesophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula – an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea. Both of these conditions usually occur together. These are found in about 1 in 3500 births. Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur singly.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (<b>atresia),</b> or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E

40|$|Several {{clinical}} {{centers have}} reported an increased incidence of intestinal <b>atresias</b> in twin pregnancies. In all cases only one infant {{of the twin}} appeared to be affected. A correlation has been suggested {{with the use of}} methylene blue. This dye is injected into one amniotic sac in order to discriminate between amniotic fluids of both conceptuses when amniocentesis is performed, around the 16 th week of pregnancy. The etiology as well as the nature of these intestinal <b>atresias</b> are matters of dispute. The defect may be mediated by vascular effects, or by direct toxic effects on the intestinal epithelium after swallowing of amniotic fluid by the conceptus. We have investigated in a pilot study whether the rat provides an animal model for methylene blue induced intestinal <b>atresias.</b> Pregnant Riv:TOX rats were treated with methylene blue on day 16 p. c. by intraamniotic injection of 5 mul of 1 to 4 % in water. The results showed no intestinal <b>atresias</b> at day 20 of pregnancy. However, an increased incidence of dead conceptuses and of cleft palate and digit malformations were found {{as a consequence of the}} operation procedure without exposure to methylene blue. Additional effects of methylene blue included high frequencies of dead conceptuses at 3 and 4 % methylene blue. Clinically, 10 ml 1 % methylene blue in water is injected in a total amniotic volume of around 200 ml. We injected 5 mul methylene blue solution in a total volume of 0. 5 ml amniotic volume in the rat. Therefore, concentrations in the order of the clinically used dosage appear embryotoxic in the rat. The dosage used in clinical practice is high in view of the safety factor approach that requires at least a factor of 100 between no-effect-level in animal tests and dosages for human exposure. ...|$|R
50|$|Intestinal <b>atresias</b> {{are often}} {{discovered}} before birth: either during a routine sonogram which shows a dilated intestinal segment {{due to the}} blockage, or {{by the development of}} polyhydramnios (the buildup of too much amniotic fluid in the uterus). These abnormalities are indications that the fetus may have a bowel obstruction which a more detailed ultrasound study can confirm.|$|R
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary <b>atresia</b> are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E

Both situations requires emergency surgery to prevent death, and often still has a poor prognosis for survival with surgical correction.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{standard}} {{treatment for}} TTC7A Deficiency at this time. Management of TTC7A deficiency currently entails bowel resection for any <b>atresias,</b> possibly {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation to correct the immunodeficiencies, and immunosuppression to help alleviate bowel disease and immune disregulation.

40|$|Severe {{combined}} immunodeficiency (SCID) is a life-threatening syndrome of recurrent infections and gastro-intestinal alterations due to severe compromise of T cells and B cells. Clinically, most patients present symptoms {{before the age}} of 3 months and without intervention SCID usually results in severe infections and death by the age of 2 years. Its association with intestinal anomalies as multiple intestinal <b>atresias</b> (MIA) is rare and worsens the prog-nosis, resulting lethal. We describe the case of a four year-old boy with SCID-MIA. He presented at birth with meco-nium peritonitis, multiple ileal <b>atresias</b> and underwent several intestinal resections. A targeted Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous 4 -bp deletion (c. 313 ΔTATC; p. Y 105 fs) in tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7 A (TTC 7 A).

40|$|Acute abdomen in {{the infants}} and {{children}} is defined as sudden onset of crying, abdominal "ndistension, vomiting, failure to pass meconium or gas that necessitates urgent attention if one wants to avoid catastrophic consequence. "nThe radiologist {{plays an important role}} in arriving at the most likely diagnosis. This information will be critical to both the radiologist and surgeon in choosing the safest treatment options, be it fluoroscopic/ sonographic reduction, open surgical intervention or conservative management. This session will highlight the most common scenarios that a radiologist may encounter in his daily practice. Meconium ileus syndrome and <b>atresias</b> usually present during the first day or two of life. Hirschsprung disease (aganglionosis and hypoganglionosis) is more insidious and usually present a few days later. The clinical signs and symptoms depend on the level of obstruction, the more proximal ones (gastric <b>atresias</b> or webs, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, duodenal <b>atresias</b> and stenosis and annular pancreas) present with refusal to feed and vomiting, the distal ones with distension of the proximal segments and failure to pass gas and stools. Intussusceptions usually seen in the older infants, present with typical episodes of crying, with or without bloody stools. The baby appears entirely normal between the attacks. Intussusceptions in the older children may not be as dramatic and may be initially overlooked. The pain may be mild but the child could look quite ill. Also in this age group it is imperative to search for a "lead point" (polyps, Meckel's diverticulum and lymphoma). Other causes of acute abdomen are necrotizing enterocolitis, gastric and mid-gut vol-vulus.

50|$|The hindgut {{gives rise}} to the region from the distal third of the {{transverse}} colon to {{the upper part of the}} anal canal. The distal part of the anal canal originates from the ectoderm. The hindgut enters the posterior region of the cloaca (future anorectal canal), and the allantois enters the anterior region (future urogenital sinus). The urorectal septum divides the two regions and breakdown of the cloacal membrane covering this area provides communication to the exterior for the anus and urogenital sinus. The upper part of the anal canal is derived from endoderm of the hindgut. The lower part (one-third) is derived from ectoderm around the proctodeum. Ectoderm, in the region of the proctodeum on the surface of part of the cloaca, proliferates and invaginates to create the anal pit. Subsequently, degeneration of the cloacal membrane establishes continuity between the upper and lower parts of the anal canal.
