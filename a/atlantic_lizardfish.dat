2500|$|Sand divers have an {{elongated}} body and can grow to {{a length of}} up to [...] The dorsal (upper) surface is dappled brownish-gray {{and there is a}} black patch on the shoulder girdle at {{the upper end of the}} gill slits. There are about eight pairs of reddish-brown bars on the top and sides of the body, broadest at the lateral line and narrowing towards the belly. There are also slender yellowish-gold longitudinal lines running along the body. The ventral (under) surface of the fish is pale. The tip of the lower jaw is rounded, without a fleshy knob, and the soft rays of the dorsal fin are relatively short, the tip of the front one lying on top of the origin of the hind one when depressed. These characteristics helps to distinguish this species from the offshore lizardfish (Synodus poeyi). The anal fin of the sand diver has ten to twelve soft rays which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar diamond lizardfish (Synodus synodus) which has eight to ten. Another fish with which it might be confused is the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>lizardfish</b> (Synodus saurus), but that species is uncommon in the Caribbean and has slender blue or turquoise longitudinal lines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>lizardfish</b> {{is known}} to be found in a marine {{environment}} within a general demersal depth range of about 400 meters. They are more specifically found in a depth range of about 20 meters. This species is native to a subtropical climate. The maximum recorded length of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>lizardfish</b> as an unsexed male is about 40 centimeters or about 15.74 inches. The distribution of this species occupies the areas of Eastern Atlantic, Morocco, Cape Verde, Azores, Mediterranean, Western Atlantic, Bermuda, Bahamas, Lesser Antilles, and the Leeward Islands. This species is mainly known to be found in insular waters and on top of sandy or sand-rock bottoms. The diet of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>lizardfish</b> mainly includes other species of fish, but it {{is known to}} also feed occasionally on other animals. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>lizardfish</b> can be found occupying waters around islands. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>lizardfish</b> keeps itself hidden and camouflaged by burrowing itself in the sand. While it is burrowed in the sand, this species reveals his eyes so that it can watch its prey and pounce when food is available.|$|E

40|$|The diet {{composition}} of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>lizardfish</b> Synodus saurus, caught on sandy bottoms of the north-western coast of Sicily (southern Tyrrhenian Sea) is described. The stomachs of 224 specimens (from 73 to 280 mm TL) were collected between June 2005 and May 2006. The analysis of stomach contents showed that this species is almost exclusively piscivorous. Unlike other benthic predators of the study area, it mainly feeds on pelagic school-forming fish, such as Clupeidae, Engraulidae and Myctophidae and juveniles of Sparidae and Centracanthidae, and benthic prey play a secondary role. The diet of S. saurus {{is related to the}} seasonal availability of resources, depending on the occurrence of juveniles of several species and on the migration of pelagic fishes in the study area. There were no significant changes in prey items between predator length groups, but a positive, significant linear relationship between prey size and predator size was recorded...|$|E
