40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to {{identify}} and analyze scenarios of business development in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> market under conditions of international trade integration using the case of present-day Russia and to determine the need for state support for domestic production. As a methodological provision, we use the scenario analysis method adapted by the authors for the determination and analysis of possible scenarios of business development in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> market under conditions of international trade integration. From the research results, the authors conclude that the Russian <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> market develops dynamically {{under the influence of}} multiple favorable factors and positive tendencies, which include a population's income growth, increases in crop areas of farm crops, and state <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> modernization programs, among other. In view of recent events in the currency market, Russian manufacturers of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> are presented with better opportunities to export their products. The performed analysis of features of the Russian <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> market under conditions of international trade integration shows that increased demand and market prices are probable and that this could lead to enterprise income growth. From our scenario analysis of business development in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> market under conditions of international trade integration, we identify the absence of an urgent need for state interference in market processes in the Russian market for <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> in the next five years...|$|R

30|$|In 2008, the {{agricultural}} productivity of China was 47 % {{of the world}} on an average, while only 2 % of the same was recorded high-income countries (Wang 2012) indicating great disparity. Recently, the government of China introduced policies to encourage farmers to buy <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery.</b> Inadequate irrigation system has become a serious constraint for agricultural production (Wang 2012), and the degree of agricultural mechanization is very low in China, even though China’s government has subsidized <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> in recent years. Even though extensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> application is believed to improve productivity, this issue still needs further study in the case of China. Low rural income and the high price of machinery is another reason for the low application rate of large-scale <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery.</b> 1 The application of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> largely depends on government subsidy (Liu 2013).|$|R
40|$|The {{education}} of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> technicians is {{performed by the}} vocational schools in Turkey. One of the main problems of the agricultural sector in Turkey {{is the lack of}} qualified technicians. Parallel to the changing agricultural engineering concept in Europe, new technologies have been launched for teaching of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> technicians. New and expanded areas like GPS and GPRS for management, technical-biological system analysis, and natural Resources Technology have been included in the agricultural technologies disciplines of traditional Universities of Agricultural Colleges in the EU. Modern <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> technician courses include the subjects of information technologies, mechatronics, sensor technology and robotics. The most important step to take in <b>Agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> programs is to increase the quality of agricultural education and to identify where it stands in international standards.

In {{order to}} make the virtual {{experiment}} results close to or equivalent to the real movement patterns, the <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> virtual test based on virtual reality requires realistic scene model and it also needs more accurate <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> dynamic model. As for the rice and wheat combine harvester of hydraulic steering, firstly, model transformation technology is used to convert Pro/E harvester model into three-dimensional geometric model that can be identified by Vega Prime virtual reality systems. Secondly, classical dynamics equation is used to construct the mathematical models of the rice and wheat combine harvester. Finally, mathematical models are combined with geometric models by VC++ programming, and then the physical behavioral model of combine harvester which has the physics properties is created. It can effectively strengthens the authenticity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> virtual test, and provides an important platform to start <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> virtual characteristics test.
