In addition, AASHTO suggested using a 3-digit number when the <b>application</b> <b>was</b> resubmitted. Later, the state submitted another application to AASHTO for the freeway to be named Interstate155.

5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major <b>application</b> <b>was</b> electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E

5|$|Image filters. Image filter theory {{grew out}} of {{transmission}} line theory and the design proceeded {{in a similar manner}} to transmission line analysis. For the first time filters could be produced that had precisely controllable passbands and other parameters. These developments took place in the 1920s and filters produced to these designs were still in widespread use in the 1980s, only declining as the use of analogue telecommunications has declined. Their immediate <b>application</b> <b>was</b> the economically important development of frequency division multiplexing for use on intercity and international telephony lines.|$|E
