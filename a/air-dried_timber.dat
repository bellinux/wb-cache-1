50|$|The sector, however, faced several problems. The most {{important}} was severe deforestation. A century ago, Ghana's tropical hardwood forest extended from {{about the middle}} of the country southward to the sea. Moreover, nearly half the country was covered with forests, which included 680 species of trees and several varieties of mahoganies. Most of this wood has been cut. By the early 1990s, only about one-third of the country was still forested, and not all of this was of commercial value. This situation has forced the government to make difficult choices between desperately needed hard currency earnings and conservation. The Forest Resource Management Project, part of the economic recovery program (ERP), was initiated in 1988, and in 1989 the government banned log exports of eighteen species. The government later extended the list and imposed high duties on other species, planning to phase out log and <b>air-dried</b> <b>timber</b> exports altogether by 1994.|$|E
30|$|Fixed {{effects of}} the three {{recommended}} models explained 51 – 60  % {{of the variation in}} MOE, and random effects a further 8 – 10  %. The unexplained variation could be due to other factors, such as knots, bark, and other wood defects not examined here. Moisture content may also have been a contributing factor. Moisture content of Douglas-fir timber when green is about 45  % (Rietz 1999) and values of 24  % are typical for <b>air-dried</b> <b>timber.</b> Though the latter moisture content, which was used in this study, may appear to be high, {{it should be noted that}} “Douglas-fir is unique among all softwood species in that it is naturally dimensionally stable, having the ability to season well in position. Many builders prefer to cut, nail and fasten Douglas-fir in the “green” or unseasoned condition, allowing it to air dry during construction” (WWPA 2002). Therefore, the MC values used in this study are accepted values, and appropriate. Beyond wood-related factors, further variation could be due to human factors associated with application of the acoustic tools. For example, Paradis et al. (2013) demonstrated that acoustic velocities are sensitive to probe depth, with increased acoustic velocity (of about 0.25  km s− 1) associated with increased penetration depth (from 1.5  cm to 3.0  cm); therefore, with a team of people facilitating data collection, it is highly possible that there was variation amongst operators. However, the somewhat lower acoustic velocity of logs in this study, in comparison to those reported by Wang et al. (2013), are thought to be due to age differences of the study trees, with velocity, and MOE, being lower for younger trees.|$|E
30|$|The <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers</b> were <b>air-dried</b> {{outdoors}} for 8 – 9  months. After being air-dried, the <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers</b> {{were subjected}} to the test using the same method as for the green round timbers.|$|R
30|$|The {{bending test}} results showed no {{significance}} at the 5  % significance level on average regarding the Young’s modulus {{obtained by the}} longitudinal vibration method, and the apparent Young’s modulus for green round <b>timbers</b> and <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers.</b> Meanwhile, the average bending strength showed significant differences at the 5  % significance level between green round <b>timbers</b> and <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers.</b> When considering that the average for green round timbers would actually increase because the green round timbers included those that did not show failure, {{it was difficult to}} simply conclude that there were differences between green round <b>timbers</b> and <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers.</b> The 5  % PTL of bending strength was slightly higher for <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers</b> than green round timbers, although we should also consider the fact that the bending strength of green round timbers would actually increase.|$|R
30|$|As for the {{compressive}} test {{parallel to}} the grain results, there was no significance seen in the average Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method for <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers</b> and green round timbers. Significance was seen in average compressive strength {{parallel to the}} grain at the 5  % significance level for <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers</b> and green round timbers. The 5  % PTL of compressive strength parallel to the grain was higher in <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timber</b> than green round timber. In terms of average, the strength ratios of dry/green round timbers were larger in compressive strength parallel to the grain than in bending strength, {{as well as the}} other timbers [5, 6] and small clear specimens [7].|$|R
30|$|For {{the static}} bending test, a {{universal}} testing machine of 200 -kN capacity (made by Tokyokoki Seizosho Ltd.) {{was used for the}} 100 -kN range. Third-point loading was applied with a total span of 360  cm. The total span deflection of green round timber was measured using the CDP- 100 displacement gauge with 10 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection. The targeted duration of testing was 5  min. The apparent Young’s modulus was obtained based on the total span deflection, and calculated at the middle circumference of the round timber. The bending strength was calculated at the circumference of a failure part from the ratio of the mid-length circumference to the circumference at the loading point. However, 9 of the 40 green round timbers did not show failure, even at the extension limit of the testing machine’s ram cylinder. For these specimens, load at the extension limit of the test machine’s ram cylinder was considered the maximum load. For the <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timber,</b> the total span deflection was measured using the rolled-in type DP- 500 E displacement gauge with 50 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection of <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timber.</b> All <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timbers</b> failed within the extension limit of the ram cylinder.|$|R
30|$|Static bending {{tests and}} {{compressive}} test {{parallel to the}} grain of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica) green round timber were conducted to confirm whether its strength would satisfy the referenced strength determined by the Construction Ministry. The strength of green round <b>timber</b> and <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timber</b> were compared for bending and compression parallel to the grain. The strength change ratio {{in response to a}} 1  % change in the moisture content of round timber was compared with that of small clear specimens and timber. The results revealed that a 5  % parametric tolerance limit of bending and compressive strength parallel to the grain satisfied the referenced strength, even when using green round timber. The average strength of <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timber</b> was higher than that of green round timber, in both bending and compression parallel to the grain, with significant differences indicated at a 5  % significance level. The relation between the cross-section area that includes round timber, timber and the small clear specimens, and the strength change ratio in response to a 1  % change in moisture content change was fitted to a logarithm curve. Thus, the size of the specimen was considered to affect the strength change ratio.|$|R
30|$|Eighty green round timbers (each {{measuring}} 16 – 20  cm {{in diameter}} {{at the top}} end, and about 5  m in length) were procured. The dynamic Young’s modulus for all green round timbers was obtained by using the longitudinal vibration method. The density of round timber was calculated according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard for logs [2]. The average Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method was 8.20 kN/mm 2, with minimum and maximum values of 5.88 and 9.71 kN/mm 2, respectively. Green round timbers {{were divided into two}} groups of 40 specimens by the Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method for that average, with largely uniform standard deviation. One group was tested as green round timber and the other group as <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timber.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{expand the}} use of wood that {{includes}} thinned round timber, wood should be used not only for construction products but also for civil engineering products. One use of wood products for civil engineering would be for underground bearing piles. Wooden bearing piles would {{be used in the}} form of round timber without lumbering. When round timber is used underground, it must always be under a green condition. The strength of a small clear specimen and that of timber are known to decrease in line with higher moisture content [1]. The strength data of green round timber was very poor, however, when compared with that of a small clear specimen and timber. In this study, static bending tests and compressive tests parallel to the grain of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica) green round timber were conducted to confirm whether its strength would satisfy the referenced strength determined by the Construction Ministry. The strength of green round <b>timber</b> and <b>air-dried</b> round <b>timber</b> were also compared for bending and compression parallel to the grain. The strength change ratio in response to a 1  % change in the moisture content of round timber was compared with that of small clear specimens and timber.|$|R
