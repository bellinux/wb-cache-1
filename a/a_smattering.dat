5|$|The route leaves South Granville, passing {{patches of}} trees and <b>a</b> <b>smattering</b> of homes as it heads toward the border village of Granville. Just south of the village limits, NY149 intersects with NY22. NY22 and NY149 briefly overlap before NY22 forks off to bypass Granville to the west.

The route proceeds through the village to its center, where NY149 forks northeastward onto West Main Street and crosses over the Mettawee River.

5|$|Almost {{all of the}} 400 North Atlantic {{right whales}} live in the western North Atlantic Ocean. In {{northern}} spring, summer and autumn, they feed in areas off the Canadian and northeast U.S. coasts in a range stretching from New York to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they head south towards Georgia and Florida to give birth. There have been <b>a</b> <b>smattering</b> of sightings further east {{over the past few}} decades; several sightings were made close to Iceland in 2003. These are possibly the remains of a virtually extinct eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers' records suggests {{they are more likely to}} be strays. However, a few sightings are regular between Norway, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and even Italy and Sicily; at least the Norway individuals come from the Western stock.|$|E
5|$|During September and October 2010, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual {{increases}} in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at Nevado del Ruiz prompted an alert level of Yellow on October 1. Chemical {{analysis of the}} volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months <b>a</b> <b>smattering</b> of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight {{times as many as}} had been recorded from 2009–2010. 2010 marked the beginning of {{increases in}} sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a dramatic increase in earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|NY31E {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY31 {{in the village}} of Middleport in eastern Niagara County. The route heads north as Main Street, overlapping with NY271 (which also begins at NY31) through the mostly residential village.

Here, NY31E and NY271 split, with NY31E following State Street eastward through the eastern portion of the community. Along this stretch, the route serves Royalton–Hartland High School and Royalton-Hartland Middle School before exiting Middleport and entering a slightly more open area of the town of Royalton.

Its tail has a skin fold running along either side and a leaf-shaped caudal fin, but no dorsal fin.|$|E
5|$|Brown was {{classified}} 1-A in 1944 and commissioned as a {{lieutenant in the}} U.S. Navy. He served at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside Chicago as head coach of its Bluejacket football team, which competed against other service teams and college programs. The station was a waypoint for Navy recruits between training and active service in World War II, but its commanders took athletics seriously and saw winning as a morale-booster and a point of personal pride. Brown could have been called up for active duty – Tony Hinkle, his predecessor, was already serving in the Pacific – but the war began to wind down as Brown arrived. Brown had little time to institute his system, and instead adopted Hinkle's offensive scheme, borrowed from the Chicago Bears. He had <b>a</b> <b>smattering</b> of talented players, including defensive end George Young and halfback Ara Parseghian. In 1944, the team lost to Ohio State and Notre Dame, but finished with a 9–2–1 record and was among the top 20 teams in the AP Poll.|$|E

5|$|In February of the 2009–10 season, James {{was forced}} into a {{temporary}} point guard role following a series of injuries to the Cavaliers' backcourt. Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with {{the best record in}} the league for the second consecutive season. Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award. To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round. James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to <b>a</b> <b>smattering</b> of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.
