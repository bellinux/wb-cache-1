The {{variation}} of temperature distribution in the cup-shaped frozen soil wall is real-timely monitored during {{the whole process of}} the horizontal freezing reinforcement project in Yixian Bridge Station, the first phase in Line 2 of Nanjing Subway. The development characteristic of the temperature field <b>at</b> <b>different</b> depth is analyzed, and the formation time and developing speed of the frozen soil wall is further calculated. The monitoring results show that, the average growth rate of the temperature field at the interface between the frozen soil and the underground continuous wall is significantly faster than the one in the cylinder reinforced area. There is significant differences in the average growth rate of temperature field in the frozen soil wall <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>area</b> of the reinforcing plates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the galvanic interaction between pure titanium, a CoCrMo alloy, as well as their galvanic interaction with a high copper and a conventional amalgam <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>area</b> ratios. Pure titanium, a CoCrMo alloy and two dental amalgams with different copper compositions were tested in this study in 0. 9 % NaCl environment of pH 7. Polarization curves were recorded for different couples with <b>different</b> <b>area</b> ratios. The conventional amalgam is more prone to galvanic corrosion than the higher copper containing amalgam in contact with the CoCrMo alloy as well as titanium. Since there is higher galvanic interaction of amalgams with CoCrMo casting alloys, either all amalgams should be exchanged with non-metallic restorations, or titanium should be chosen as casting metal for partial denture framework, if too many amalgam restorations exist in the oral cavity...|$|R

3000|$|This paper further {{explores the}} effect of area {{occupancy}} (ρ [...] a [...]) of road {{on the amount of}} interaction between heavy and light vehicle types. Simulations were carried out <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>area</b> occupancies keeping vehicular proportion equal for different vehicle types, and interaction rates were measured for LMVs and other vehicle types. Similarly, interaction rates were also measured between HMVs and other vehicle types. It was found that for all vehicle pairs the interaction rate had a parabolic relationship with the area occupancy, as shown in Figs.  15 and 16. Here the interaction rate between two vehicle types was measured as the number of vehicles of type A found to be interacting (following or overtaking) with type B for every 1, 000 simulated vehicles of type A found in measurement area. For example, interaction rate for LMV–HMV would mean the number of LMVs found following or overtaking HMVs out of 1, 000 LMVs observed in measurement area.|$|R
50|$|The {{study of}} how {{developmental}} genes are expressed during embryogenesis has become an important new tool in {{the last twenty years}} for understanding the structure and evolution of morphology. The arthropod head problem has been tackled in three main ways in this regard, first by using genetic segmental markers to probe the obscure region in front of the mouth, especially in insects; second by looking at Hox gene expression patterns to detect patterns of homology between different arthropods; and third, by studying gene expression in particular features (especially the labrum) to determine its appendiculate or other status. Because all arthropods have the same complement of nine Hox loci, the morphological diversification observed is caused by these genes being expressed <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>areas</b> and times.|$|E

40|$|Ceramic {{materials}} {{are widely used}} from everyday life to space technology. Properties of ceramics are widely affected {{by the type of}} their raw materials, their shaping and production methods. The use of conventional techniques and materials in the production of traditional ceramics are preferred in terms of continuity and their productivity. To avoid monotonous and to open different visual effects in traditional ceramic industry, one needs to have a look <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>area</b> of use. The term of aggregate describes materials, which are different in chemical and structural feathers but hold together in one body. However, in ceramic sector, aggregate is defined as particulates of rocks and mineral pieces. There are limited results reported in literature about the use of these materials in the traditional ceramic bodies. Therefore, in this work, the properties of the ceramic bodies having natural aggregates in to different ceramic pastes were investigated after firing. Findings showed that ceramics produced with aggregate additives could be useful in using them at artistic applications...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{nonlinear}} evolution of the cosmic gravitational clustering is approximately spatial local in the $x$-$k$ (position-scale) phase space if the initial perturbations are Gaussian. That is, if viewing the mass field with modes in the phase space, the nonlinear evolution will cause strong coupling among modes with different scale $k$, {{but at the same}} spatial area $x$, while the modes <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>area</b> $x$ remain uncorrelated, or very weakly correlated. We first study the quasi-local clustering behavior with the halo model, and demonstrate that the quasi-local evolution in the phase space is essentially due to the self-similar and hierarchical features of the cosmic gravitational clustering. The scaling of mass density profile of halos insures that the coupling between $(x-k) $ modes <b>at</b> <b>different</b> physical positions is substantially suppressed. Using high resolution N-body simulation samples in the LCDM model, we justify the quasi-locality with the correlation function between the DWT (discrete wavelet transform) variables of the cosmic mass field. Although the mass field underwent a highly non-linear evolution, and the DWT variables display significantly non-Gaussian features, there are almost no correlations among the DWT variables <b>at</b> <b>different</b> spatial positions. Possible applications of the quasi-locality have been discussed. Comment: AAS Latex file, 33 pages, 7 figures included, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
