40|$|The report {{presents}} the results of the independent certified public accountants` review of the Department of Energy`s Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 1 interim financial statements as of December 31, 1996 and 1995. The review was done in accordance with Statements on Standards for <b>Accounting</b> and <b>Review</b> <b>Services</b> issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of inquiries of NPR- 1 personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data. It is substantially less in scope than an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements take as a whole. Accordingly, the certified public accountants do not express such an opinion. The auditors have stated that, except for the omission of certain disclosures, they are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements {{in order for them to}} be in conformity with the other comprehensive basis of accounting described in Note 1 to the financial statements...|$|R
