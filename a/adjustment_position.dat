40|$|Collimator {{design is}} {{essential}} for meeting the requirements of high-precision telescopes. The collimator diameter should be larger {{than that of the}} target for alignment. Special supporting structures are required to reduce the gravitational deformation and control the surface deformation induced by the mounting force when inspecting large-aperture primary mirrors (M 1). A ZERODURÂŽ mirror 620 mm in diameter for a collimator was analyzed using the finite element method to obtain the deformation induced by the supporting structures and adjustment mechanism. Zernike polynomials were also adopted to fit the optical surface and separate corresponding aberrations. The computed and measured wavefront aberration configurations for the collimator M 1 were obtained complementally. The wavefront aberrations were adjusted using fine adjustment screws using 3 D optical path differences map of the mirror surface. Through studies using different boundary conditions and inner ring support positions, it is concluded that the optical performance was excellent under a strong enough supporter. The best <b>adjustment</b> <b>position</b> was attained and applied to the actual collimator M 1 to prove the correctness of the simulation results...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for the adjustment of mechanical assemblies, in particular {{for the production}} of a multi-mirror polygon, whereby the module comprises a rack (5) and at least one clamping device (3) linked to the rack (5) for attaching at least one component to be adjusted (mirror 1) with the necessary retaining force. At least one mechanical pulse encoder (4) connected to the rack acts on at least one component to be adjusted (mirror 1) {{in such a way that}} the planned final <b>adjustment</b> <b>position</b> is reachable. The mechanical pulse encoder (4) acts on a support (2) of the component to be adjusted (mirror 1) with pulses by means of a striker pin (10) similar to a moved hammer. The actual position of the component can be determined by means of a measuring instrument (7). The measuring instrument is connected to a positioning device (6) in which the actual position is comparable to the target position and the positioning device (6) is connected to at least one mechanical puls e encoder (4) so that at least one mechanical pulse can be generated so that the component (mirror 1) can be moved into the target position...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the requirements imposed on suspension mechanism of tractors through which agricultural machines are coupled to tractors. Also, {{it is presented}} the functional principles of hydraulic action systems of suspension mechanism, such as: simple systems of lifting and descending, hydraulic systems with <b>position</b> <b>adjustment,</b> hydraulic systems with force adjustment. The hydraulic systems of simple lifting and descending can be equipped with a hydraulic cylinder with simple action or with double action. The hydraulic systems with <b>position</b> <b>adjustment</b> achieves the maintenaing of the agricultural machine in a fix position towards the supporting plane of tractor. In the case of plowghing agregates, hydraulic systems with <b>position</b> <b>adjustment</b> assure the constant maintenaing of the work depth when the grounds are better leveled up. The hydraulic systems with force adjustment achieve the modifying of machine position towards tractor depending on the resistance held by the agricultural machine (plow, for example) during work.

40|$|Purpose: Interportal {{adjustment}} {{was applied}} to patients with prostate cancer using three fiducial markers and two sets of fluoroscopy in a real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) system. The incidence of table <b>position</b> <b>adjustment</b> required to keep intrafractional uncertainty within 2. 0 mm was investigated in this study. Methods and Materials: The coordinates {{of the center of}} gravity of the three fiducial markers were measured at the start of every portal irradiation in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with seven ports. The table position was adjusted to the planned position if the discrepancy was larger than 2. 0 mm in the anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC), or left-right (LR) directions. In total, we analyzed 4541 observations in 20 patients who received 70 Gy in 30 fractions (7. 6 times a day in average). Results: The incidence of table <b>position</b> <b>adjustment</b> at 10 minutes from the initial set-up of each treatment was 14. 2 %, 12. 3 %, and 5. 0 % of the observations in the AP, CC, and LR directions, respectively. The accumulated incidence of the table <b>position</b> <b>adjustment</b> was significantly higher at 10 minutes compared to that at 2 minutes for AP (p = 0. 0033) and CC (p = 0. 0110) but not LR (p = 0. 4296). An adjustment greater than 5 mm was required at least once in the treatment period in 11 (55 %) patients. Conclusions: Interportal <b>adjustment</b> of table <b>position</b> was required in more than 10 % of portal irradiations during the 10 -minute period after initial setup to maintain treatment accuracy within 2. 0 mm...|$|R

5000|$|The Lancer was {{designed}} specifically for flight schools seeking an inexpensive way to train students for a multi-engine rating, a role in which the craft's modest performance and payload were anticipated to matter little. To increase its appeal to flight schools, the Lancer was equipped with a mock landing gear retraction switch that operates green “safe” and red “unsafe” lights in the cockpit, allowing a student pilot to feign operation of imaginary [...] "retractable" [...] (it was permanently fixed) landing gear on takeoff and landing during instructional flights. In a peculiar combination, the front seat was equipped with a control yoke, while the rear-seat pilot had a centre stick. Both seats were equipped with engine controls mounted overhead, with solo flight being performed from the front seat. Braking was controlled with a lever {{on the right-hand side}} of the front-seat instrument panel; differential braking was not possible, and no brake controls were provided for the rear-seat pilot. Other features included single-slotted wing flaps with 4 <b>adjustment</b> <b>positions,</b> and pilot-adjustable trim tabs for the elevator and rudder; elevator trim was adjusted using a sidewall-mounted lever.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} front {{passenger}} airbag disabling strategy, developed based on first‐generation airbags, is valid for modern airbag designs and restrained forward‐facing children from three‐year‐old (3 YO) size. In total, 19 different frontal impact situations were evaluated, comparing with and without airbag activation, using one vehicle model. Restrained child crash test dummies (3 YO, 6 YO, 10 YO), of varied seat positions, booster types, crash pulses and sitting postures (up‐right and forward leaning), were tested in sled tests representative of a modern airbag and seatbelt technology. In addition, some typical misuse cases were evaluated. To different extents, all 19 situations tested demonstrated relative positive, or comparable, effect for activated airbag compared to no airbag. The influence of the airbag was relatively more pronounced in the more forward seat <b>adjustment</b> <b>positions.</b> In the misuse situations, it was clearly more robust using the airbag to help protect the child. Based on the results, Volvo Cars is revising its recommendations for restrained forward facing children travelling in car models with front passenger airbag designs as tested in this study. For these specific car models it is revised to recommend that the airbag should be Enabled for all forward‐facing restrained child occupants (as for adults), while kept Disabled for all rearward‐facing children...|$|R

50|$|Mechanical {{actuators}} typically convert {{rotary motion}} of a control knob or handle into linear displacement via screws and/or gears {{to which the}} knob or handle is attached. A jackscrew or car jack is a familiar mechanical actuator. Another family of actuators {{are based on the}} segmented spindle. Rotation of the jack handle is converted mechanically into the linear motion of the jack head. Mechanical actuators are also frequently used in the field of lasers and optics to manipulate the position of linear stages, rotary stages, mirror mounts, goniometers and other positioning instruments. For accurate and repeatable positioning, index marks may be used on control knobs. Some actuators include an encoder and digital position readout. These are similar to the adjustment knobs used on micrometers except their purpose is <b>position</b> <b>adjustment</b> rather than <b>position</b> measurement.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of the free pedal <b>position</b> <b>adjustment</b> on {{clutching}} movements of the left lower limb {{as well as on the}} perceived discomfort. Six automotive clutch pedal configurations were tested by 20 subjects (5 young females, 5 young males, 5 older females, 5 older males) using a multiadjustable experimental mock-up. Results showed that the pedal position was adjusted to ensure a good starting pedal position allowing a less flexed ankle and avoiding unnecessary leg displacement from the foot rest to the position at start depression. Pedal <b>position</b> <b>adjustment</b> seemed not motivated by reducing joint torque though discomfort ratings were found significantly correlated with knee and ankle torques at the end of depression.

30|$|In this work, we have {{evaluated}} three methods. However, it is {{not that}} easy to select the one suitable method for universal use. The superior method certainly is application-dependent. Thus, if a navigational system is equipped with supporting sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) and algorithms (e.g., landmarks-based positioning correction) allowing for the <b>adjustment</b> of <b>positioning</b> results, then the fastest method shall be chosen (the density-based method). Otherwise, depending on the required precision, a robuster method would be preferable (our distance-based method). The connectivity-based approach returns also good results; however, due to its cubical algorithmic complexity, the approach is not suitable for the applications requiring iterative outlier removal in the point clouds containing hundreds of thousands of points.|$|R
