5|$|It is a centuries-old custom for Jews {{to place}} kvitelach {{containing}} personal prayers to God between {{the stones of}} the Western Wall in Jerusalem. This practice has been also adopted by Christian pilgrims and foreign dignitaries as well. More than a million prayer notes <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the Western Wall each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a tantalum crucible {{and fired}} in a helium atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting halide compounds and molten dysprosium separate due {{to differences in}} density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.|$|E

5|$|The {{layout of}} {{buildings}} follows ancient customs laid down in the Classic of Rites. Thus, ancestral temples are {{in front of the}} palace. Storage areas <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the front part of the palace complex, and residences in the back.|$|E
5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> solitary confinement.|$|E

5|$|In the ride's {{narrative}} of events preceding those that occur during the ride, King Adelsten entered {{the mountain to}} fight a dragon called Ormaar. During the battle, the king lost his crown. Stansein, one of the king's servants, guides riders through the mountain to find and retrieve the crown. Throughout the ride, riders can score points by hitting objects on the screen with their light guns. At the end, the highest scores <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the 'Wonder Mountain's Guardian Hall of Fame'.|$|E
5|$|In {{two-dimensional}} articulography, transmitter coils <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> an {{equilateral triangle}} along the midsagittal plane at the forehead, chin, and neck. Because of the geometric {{orientation of the}} transmitter coils, accurate readings are able to be taken {{as long as the}} sensor coils placed on the tongue stay within about a centimeter of the midsagittal plane and are not angled at more than 30 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{has been}} mistakenly called {{the founder of}} Jainism. Jains believe that there were 23 {{teachers}} before the Mahavira, and they believe that Jainism was founded in far more ancient times {{than that of the}} Mahavira, whom they revere as the 24th Tirthankara. The first 22 Tirthankaras <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> mythical times. For example, the 22nd Tirthankara Arishtanemi is believed in the Jain tradition to have been born 84,000 years before the 23rd Tirthankara named Parshvanatha. Mahavira is sometimes placed within Parshvanatha lineage, but this is contradicted by all Jain texts, which state that Mahavira renounced the world alone.|$|E
50|$|The genus Siphlophis may <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the {{subfamily}} Dipsadinae in {{the family}} Colubridae, or it may <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the subfamily Xenodontinae {{in the family}} Dipsadidae.|$|R

5|$|Pet rats {{can also}} develop {{pituitary}} tumors {{if they are}} given high-calorie diets, and ringtail if they <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> areas with low humidity or high temperatures. Staphylococcus spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly reside {{on the top of}} the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause ulcerative dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|Seorsumuscardinus is a genus {{of fossil}} dormice {{from the early}} Miocene of Europe. It is known from zone MN 4 (see MN zonation) in Oberdorf, Austria; Karydia, Greece; and Tägernaustrasse-Jona, Switzerland, and from zone MN 5 in a single site at Affalterbach, Germany. The MN 4 records <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the species S.alpinus and the sole MN 5 record is {{classified}} as the species S.bolligeri. The latter {{was placed in a}} separate genus, Heissigia, when it was first described in 2007, but it was reclassified as a second species of Seorsumuscardinus in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> {{and around the}} mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by {{the placement of the}} pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E

50|$|Shortly before flight, the {{jellyfish}} {{samples were}} loaded into {{a total of}} 10 Nizemi cuvettes containing ASW and <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Type I containers. For the behavior study, a group of normal ephyrae {{and a group of}} ephyrae without statoliths <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the Biorack 22 °C incubator. The third group of ephyrae <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the Biorack 1-G centrifuge. Two groups of polyps were used for the development study. One group <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the incubator and the other <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the 1-G centrifuge. A similar set of equipment was maintained at the KSC ground-control facility.|$|R
5|$|The algae are a polyphyletic {{group and}} <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> various divisions, some {{more closely related}} to plants than others. There are many {{differences}} between them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation, chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves. The algal division Charophyta, sister to the green algal division Chlorophyta, is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants. The Charophyte class Charophyceae and the land plant sub-kingdom Embryophyta together form the monophyletic group or clade Streptophytina.|$|E
5|$|The key {{activities}} of cultivated plant taxonomy relate to classification (taxonomy) and naming (nomenclature). The rules associated with naming plants are {{separate from the}} methods, principles or purposes of classification, except that the units of classification, the taxa, <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a nested hierarchy of ranks – like species within genera, and genera within families. There are three classification categories used in the Cultivated Plant Code, the cultivar and the Group and the grex, but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code.|$|E
5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} the Western Wall differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall, and the Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts. More than a million prayer notes <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the Western Wall each year.|$|E

5|$|Two-page book embeddings with a fixed {{partition}} of the edges into pages {{can be interpreted}} as a form of clustered planarity, in which the given graph must be drawn {{in such a way that}} parts of the graph (the two subsets of edges) <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the drawing in a way that reflects their clustering. Two-page book embedding has also been used to find simultaneous embeddings of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one must find a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly with straight edges.|$|E
5|$|Very pure lead can be {{obtained}} by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the Betts process. Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> an electrolyte of lead fluorosilicate (PbSiF6). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.|$|E
5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E
50|$|The genus Nephrolepis {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> this family, but because its exact phylogenic {{placement}} is uncertain, it has <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> its own family, Nephrolepidaceae, pending more complete data.|$|R
