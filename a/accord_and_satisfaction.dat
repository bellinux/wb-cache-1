25|$|To conclude, {{the above}} {{limitations}} help to clearly outline its parameters. This essay has defined {{with the use}} of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from the traditional approach set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of promissory estoppel to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of promissory estoppel, manifested from the continuing evolution of promissory estoppel, may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern promissory estoppel replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases. This equitable doctrine which originally acts as an exception to the doctrine of <b>accord</b> <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with subject to limitations now appears as an open and unlimited doctrine.|$|E

D & C Builders Ltd (the respondent) {{had been hired}} by Rees (the appellant) to do some construction work at his shop, where he sold building materials. EWCA Civ 3 (12 November 1965) |publisher=BAILII|accessdate=6 May 2009}} The respondent finished the work and repeatedly phoned the appellant to request the money they were owed. After three phone calls spread out over several months the appellant's wife spoke to the respondents; she said there were several problems with the work that they had done, and she would only pay £300 of the £482 owed. The respondents replied that £300 would barely {{cover the costs of}} the materials, but that they would accept it anyway. If the respondents had not received the money they would have gone bankrupt, something the appellant's wife was well aware of. In his judgment, Denning modified English case law on part payment and <b>accord</b> <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> saying that the rules on part payment can be set aside in situations where one of the parties is under duress. The fact that D & C Builders were effectively forced into accepting the lesser amount meant that the payment was not valid.|$|E

40|$|Administration of {{the same}} Quality of Life Enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>Satisfaction</b> Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) in major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) and in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) before and after treatment allowed us to compare quality of life enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in these two disorders and to compare outcome based on symptoms versus functioning. Q-LES-Q and symptom-specific Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) data from eight randomized, 8 -week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials with escitalopram were used. MDD (n= 1, 140) or GAD (n= 1, 045) patients report a substantial degree of quality of life enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> impairment (baseline scores 64 % and 76 % of community norm, respectively). Treatment resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvement in quality of life enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> The improvement was greater in patients treated with escitalopram than with placebo. In MDD, the majority of remitters (MADRS<or= 12) reached 'normal' quality of life enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> levels, whereas in GAD, 67 % of remitters (HAMA<or= 7) reached 'normal' quality of life, enjoyment, <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> A strong correlation between the symptom-specific scales and the Q-LES-Q was observed. These analyses suggest that remission with scores of 6 on the MADRS and 5 on the HAMA correspond with a quality of life enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> found in community comparison patients (Q-LES-Q score of 58 +/- 10 %). Treatment with escitalopram results in a significant improvement of quality of life enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in patients with MDD or GAD.

The goals of the present study were {{to examine the relationship between}} work-family conflict (work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict) <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction,</b> the relationship between work-family conflict <b>and</b> domain-specific <b>satisfactions</b> (family <b>satisfaction</b> <b>and</b> work <b>satisfaction),</b> <b>and</b> the mediators and moderators of these relationships among a sample of female graduate students. Participants included 187 female graduate students. Both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict were hypothesized to be negatively related to domain-specific <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfactions.</b> Work/family conflict self-efficacy and perceived social support were hypothesized to be positively related to domain-specific <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfactions.</b> Neuroticism was hypothesized to be negatively related to domain-specific <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfactions,</b> whereas extraversion was hypothesized to be positively related to domain-specific <b>and</b> global <b>satisfactions.</b> These hypothesized relationships were significant except the positive relationships of extraversion to family, work, <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfactions.</b> It was also predicted that domain-specific satisfactions would mediate the relationships between work-to-family conflict <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>and</b> between family-to-work conflict <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction.</b> Work/family conflict self-efficacy and perceived social support were hypothesized to moderate the relationships between work-to-family conflict <b>and</b> domain-specific <b>satisfactions,</b> <b>and</b> between family-to-work conflict <b>and</b> domain-specific <b>satisfactions.</b> Results suggested family <b>satisfaction</b> <b>and</b> work <b>satisfaction</b> partially mediated the relationships between work-to-family conflict <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>and</b> between family-to-work conflict <b>and</b> global life <b>satisfaction.</b> Work/family conflict self-efficacy moderated both the relationship between work-to-family conflict <b>and</b> work <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>and</b> between family-to-work conflict <b>and</b> work <b>satisfaction.</b> No other significant moderators were found.

40|$|Background: Developing a {{sense of}} {{well-being}} and achieving competence <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in the maternal role have {{a tremendous impact on}} the quality of parenting behaviour and the child's psychosocial development. Little is known about the mechanisms through which learned resourcefulness, social support and stress affect postnatal depression and women's sense of competence <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in the maternal role. Objectives: To test a conceptual model that examines the relationships between learned resourcefulness, social support, stress, maternal role competence <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>and</b> postnatal depression in first-time Chinese mothers. Design: A predictive correlational study using secondary analysis of data from an intervention study. Settings: The study was conducted in two regional public hospitals in Hong Kong. Participants: A total of 181 first-time Chinese mothers were followed at six weeks post-partum. Methods: Participants completed five instruments at six weeks post-partum: the Self-Control Schedule, Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, Social Readjustment Rating Scale, Parenting Sense of Competence Scale and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Path analysis was employed. Results: The findings indicate that learned resourcefulness and social support have a direct impact on maternal role competence <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>and</b> on postnatal depression. Stress affected postnatal depression directly and maternal role competence <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> indirectly, via learned resourcefulness and social support. Both learned resourcefulness and social support mediated the effects of stress on maternal role competence <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>and</b> postnatal depression. Conclusions: This study establishes potential mechanisms through which learned resourcefulness, social support and stress contribute to maternal role competence <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>and</b> postnatal depression during early motherhood. Culturally competent healthcare should be developed to provide support and equip women with learned resourcefulness skills to combat the stress of early motherhood, thereby enhancing maternal role competence <b>and</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>and</b> minimizing the risk of postnatal depression. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
