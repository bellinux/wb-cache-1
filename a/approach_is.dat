The first <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> to identify genes based upon homology with genes that are already publicly available in sequence databases, usually by simple BLAST searches.

5|$|Another <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> possible, {{originally}} developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E

This feature enables users to search Java and Python source code files by entering Java or Python code snippets {{in the search}} bar of the search engine. In this project, a logarithmic char-gramming approach and a suffix tree <b>approach</b> <b>were</b> implemented and compared. In Yioop, the logarithmic char-gramming <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> newly implemented; whereas, an existing suffix tree <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> extended to operate on tokenized source codes.

40|$|This paper investigates {{and compares}} two {{approaches}} for generating Herbrand models of clausal first-order theories: Satchmo by R. Manthey and F. Bry and the method introduced by C.

The two approaches {{turn out to be}} able to handle similar classes of theories in principle. However, theories are typically handled efficiently by one of the approaches and inefficiently by the other. In this sense, the <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> complementary.

5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires {{the use of}} a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> twofold: {{to enable}} deeper {{inspection}} of the code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution, and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by {{eliminating the need for}} runtime scheduling circuitry.|$|E
