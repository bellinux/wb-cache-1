5|$|Bonds led a {{controversial}} career, notably as <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in baseball's steroids scandal. In 2007, he was indicted {{on charges of}} perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} for allegedly lying to the grand jury during the federal government's investigation of BALCO. The perjury charges against Bonds were dropped and an initial obstruction of justice conviction was overturned in 2015.|$|E
5|$|A semi-legendary figure, Laozi {{was usually}} {{portrayed as a}} 6th-centuryBCE {{contemporary}} of Confucius, but most modern historians consider him, assuming he existed, to have lived during the Warring States period of the 5th or 4thcenturyBCE. <b>A</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in Chinese culture, Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the Tang dynasty and modern people of the Li surname as a founder of their lineage. Laozi's work has been embraced by both various anti-authoritarian movements as well as Chinese Legalism.|$|E
5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from Pomerania and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom he describes as a sadist. Despite essentially agreeing with their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E

5|$|Edward III died in 1377 and was {{succeeded by}} his ten-year-old grandson, Richard II. At Richard's coronation, Suffolk carried the new king's sceptre, {{and he was}} later {{appointed}} to Richard's minority council. Even after the council was disbanded in January 1380, he remained <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> at court, participating in the negotiations for the king's marriage to Anne of Bohemia, and mediating in a conflict between John of Gaunt and Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|Ramza is chased {{throughout}} the story by the Shrine Knights, {{the soldiers of}} the Church who are hunting the Zodiac Stones, although he gains allies, either by saving their lives, or by showing them the truth. Some individuals {{with knowledge of the}} Zodiac Stones attempt to conspire with the Shrine Knights for its power, though most fail. Ramza also acquires proof of the Church's lies about Saint Ajora, <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the religion, and attempts to use it along with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization's plot.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{was raised}} in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. When he {{released}} his debut album Ready to Die in 1994, he became <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the East Coast hip hop scene and increased New York City's visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop was dominant in the mainstream. The following year, Wallace led his childhood friends to chart success through his protégé group, Junior M.A.F.I.A. While recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud.|$|E

50|$|New Langton Arts was a not-for-profit arts {{organization}} {{focusing on}} contemporary art founded in 1975 in San Francisco, California. Part {{of the first}} wave of alternative art spaces in the US, New Langton Arts was a leader in exhibiting new media forms in art and involving artists in the decision-making process. Its first directors were Judy Moran and Renny Pritikin, who have been <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figures</b> in the San Francisco Bay Area art scene for 30 years. Subsequent directors include Nancy Gonchar, Christiane Robbins, Susan Miller, and Sandra Percival.|$|R
5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E
5|$|Arthur is <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in {{the legends}} {{making up the}} Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur {{developed}} as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Forster was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> of the Enlightenment in Germany, and {{corresponded with}} most of its adherents, {{including}} his close friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. His ideas and personality influenced Alexander von Humboldt, {{one of the great}} scientists of the 19th century. When the French took control of Mainz in 1792, Forster became {{one of the founders of}} the city's Jacobin Club and went on to play a leading role in the Mainz Republic, the earliest republican state in Germany. During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, Prussian and Austrian coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw. Unable to return to Germany and separated from his friends and family, he died in Paris of illness in early 1794.|$|E

5|$|In America Widmerpool becomes {{something}} of a figurehead among youth protest movements; there are suggestions that his earlier problems may have resulted from a CIA plot. He returns to England in the late 1960s and is installed as Chancellor of a new university. During the ceremony he is pelted with red paint but immediately identifies with the demonstrators and becomes <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the counter-culture movement. He resigns the chancellorship after a year, to run a commune for dissident youth. By late 1969, he has been drawn into a more sinister cult, led by the young mystic Scorpio Murtlock, which gradually overwhelms his life and independence. He is last heard of late in 1971, when during a ritual dawn run through the woods he collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} fiction in Galaxy had dipped {{towards the end}} of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's {{difficult}} editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he would almost invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in Galaxy throughout the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|With her {{formidable}} physique and outspoken manner, Braddock was a pugnacious {{presence in}} parliament, and a keen {{supporter of the}} 1945–51 Attlee ministry's reform agenda, particularly {{the establishment of the}} National Health Service in 1948. She served on Labour's National Executive Committee between 1947 and 1969. Her combative style led to a brief suspension from parliament in 1952. For most of her parliamentary career she remained a member of Liverpool's council, and was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the controversy that arose in the 1950s over the city's decision to acquire and flood the Tryweryn Valley in Wales {{for the construction of a}} reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Her husband's {{early death}} in 1962 forced Stokes {{to return to}} {{painting}} as a career, resulting in a successful one-woman show in 1964, her first in thirty years. She continued to paint and exhibit through the 1970s and 1980s, and {{was the subject of}} a retrospective exhibition that toured Victorian regional galleries including Swan Hill Regional Art Gallery and Geelong Art Gallery in 1985. She died in 1991 and is little-known in comparison to some other women artists including Grace Cossington Smith and Clarice Beckett, but her fortunes were revived somewhat as <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in Anne Summers' 2009 book The Lost Mother. Her art is represented in most major Australian galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria; the Art Gallery of New South Wales is the only significant Australian collecting institution not to hold one of her works.|$|E
5|$|Standard Oil {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to New York City at 26 Broadway, and Rockefeller became <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the city's business community. He bought a residence in 1884 on 54th Street near the mansions of other magnates such as William Henry Vanderbilt. Despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity, Rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily. In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, {{but by then}} Standard depended more on pipeline transport. More threatening to Standard's power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to {{the breakup of the}} Standard Oil trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state anti-trust laws, and finally forced a separation of Standard Oil of Ohio {{from the rest of the}} company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.|$|E
5|$|Sue Elvie Bailey {{was born}} on August 26, 1903, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to Reverend Isaac and Susie (née Ford) Bailey. She {{attended}} primary school at Nannie Burroughs' School for Girls in Washington, D.C. In 1920, she graduated from the college preparatory school, Spelman Seminary (now Spelman College) in Atlanta, Georgia. She continued her education at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, graduating in 1926 with bachelor's degrees in music and liberal arts, making her the first black student to earn a music degree from Oberlin. While there, Bailey developed a friendship with Louise Thompson, who would become <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the Harlem Renaissance movement, and encouraged Langston Hughes, inventor of jazz poetry, to read poetry there. She traveled with a quintet giving concerts in Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia, as well as London and Paris.|$|E
50|$|In ancient art, confronted-animal motifs often {{involve the}} Master of Animals, <b>a</b> <b>central</b> human <b>figure</b> between two confronted animals, often {{grasping}} them, and are probably {{part of a}} unified socio-cultural motif. A related motif in ancient art {{is known as the}} Mistress of Animals.|$|R

50|$|In {{attempting}} to solve Laura's murder, Dale Cooper often {{makes use of}} the Log Lady's apparent ability to communicate, through the log, with a possibly supernatural realm. Cooper gradually loses his access to this realm as the series progresses, and the Log Lady becomes <b>a</b> less <b>central</b> <b>figure,</b> though she does provide Cooper {{with at least one}} useful tip.|$|R
5|$|Suffolk was the {{dominant}} magnate in the East Anglia region. When the region's peasants revolted in 1381, he became <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in their repression. While in Bury St Edmunds, {{he was taken}} by surprise by the rebels while eating dinner. The rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster, attempted to force Suffolk to join the rebellion, hoping to lend legitimacy to the cause. When this failed, Litster turned to other prominent men. Suffolk then fled disguised as a groom, reaching London by way of St Albans. He soon returned to Bury with a force of 500 lances, and met little resistance. Much of the work suppressing the rebellion had been undertaken by Henry Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, leaving Suffolk to apprehend the remaining rebels for trial. In the rebellion Suffolk suffered financially: the peasants plundered property worth £1,000 from his castle at Mettingham.|$|E
5|$|They were {{obliged to}} record their first album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, overseen by {{producer}} Norman Smith, <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in Pink Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones {{an hour before the}} sessions began. Bown's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of Barrett's quiet voice, he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and reverberation to give it its own unique sound. Much of the reverberation effect came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators– customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension– and the studio's tiled echo chamber built in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1936 {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of non-intervention in {{the conflict between the}} Spanish government and rebels led by General Franco. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government {{for the duration of the}} civil war. The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. Martin Tranmæl, <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper Arbeiderbladet, led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranmæl and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels. Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the International Brigades. On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.|$|E
