Mariah <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> as we felt it. We both felt very connected to the song because of our background. What can I say? (It is) Just a beautiful song. What a lyric!

500|$|The film is set {{one year}} after the events of The Avengers. Evans briefly makes a cameo {{appearance}} in the film as Captain America when Loki shapeshifts into him while mocking Thor. Hiddleston wore the Captain America costume while standing in for Evans, before Evans came to shoot the scene. Hiddleston said, [...] "I did an impression of Loki in the Captain America costume, and then they showed Chris [...] my performance on tape. It's him doing an impression of me doing an impression of him. And it's brilliant." [...] James Gunn, the director of Guardians of the Galaxy, directed the mid-credits scene which featured the Collector, played by Benicio del Toro. Asked about shooting the scene, Gunn said, [...] "I got the script that morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in two hours {{at the end of a}} day of second unit shooting [...]" ...|$|E

Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E

500|$|When he {{returned}} to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, [...] "I was in a bad mood of drinking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing. I think perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] The painting was executed in a ground-floor flat at 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington in London. A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant, artist John Everett Millais. It was Bacon's studio by day; at night, abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot, it functioned as an illicit casino.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E
500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Munro {{started the}} monthly party Vaseline (later renamed Vazaleen) in Toronto {{at a time}} when most gay clubs {{featured}} house music or other types of dance music. His hope was to draw a more diverse crowd: he said at the time, [...] "I'd like to do something that'll encompass all the freaks out there, myself included." [...] In addition to its stereotype-countering incorporation of punk and other rock music, his club night was also noted to be unusual for being located outside of the Church and Wellesley gay neighbourhood. It was atypical as well for having about 50 percent women attending the event. Munro said, [...] "I was determined to get women to attend <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in a really simple way. I put lots of images of women and dyke icons on the posters and flyers—groups like The Runaways or singers like Nina Hagen and Carole Pope. I wanted women to know instantly that this was their space as much as anybody else's." [...] It began in the downstairs space at El Mocambo in late 1999, moved to the upstairs space in January 2000, and in late 2001, when El Mocambo was threatening to close, to Lee's Palace, where it continued as a monthly event until 2006; it continues to this day as an annual event as part the city's Pride Week festivities, to raise money for the Will Munro Fund for Queer and Trans People Living with Cancer.|$|E
500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 June 2013, Chelsea {{appointed}} Mourinho {{as manager}} {{for the second time}}, on a four-year contract. Mourinho told Chelsea TV, [...] "In my career I've had two great passions – Inter and Chelsea – and Chelsea is more than important for me." [...] "It was very, very hard to play against Chelsea, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> only twice which was not so bad." [...] "Now I promise exactly the same things I promised in 2004 with this difference to add: I'm one of you." [...] On 10 June 2013, Mourinho was officially confirmed as Chelsea {{manager for the}} second time at a press conference held at Stamford Bridge.|$|E

2500|$|Blas Galindo and I went to Alvarado, one of {{the places}} where folkloric music is {{preserved}} in its most pure form; we were collecting melodies, rhythms and instrumentations during several days. The transcription of it was very difficult because the huapangueros (musicians) never sang the same melody twice in the same way. When I came back to Mexico, I showed the collected material to Candelario Huízar; Huízar gave me a piece of advice that I will always be grateful for: [...] "Expose the material first in the same way you heard it and develop it later according to your own thought." [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and the result is almost satisfactory for me.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1995, Boehner {{distributed}} {{campaign contributions}} from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies. In a 1996 documentary by PBS called The People and the Power Game, Boehner said [...] "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before {{we got to the}} end of the month and I complied. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again." [...] Boehner eventually led the effort to change House rules and prohibit {{campaign contributions from}} being distributed on the House floor.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards, when Houston's {{name was}} called {{out for a}} nomination, a few in the {{audience}} jeered. Houston defended herself against the criticism, stating, [...] "If you're gonna have a long career, there's a certain way to do it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> that way. I'm not ashamed of it." [...] Houston took a more urban direction with her third studio album, I'm Your Baby Tonight, released in November 1990. She produced and chose producers for this album and as a result, it featured production and collaborations with L.A. Reid and Babyface, Luther Vandross, and Stevie Wonder. The album showed Houston's versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance tracks. Reviews were mixed. Rolling Stone felt it was her [...] "best and most integrated album". while Entertainment Weekly, at the time thought Houston's shift towards an urban direction was [...] "superficial".|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} made {{popular in the}} 1971 movie Evel Knievel {{starring}} George Hamilton. In the movie, Hamilton (as Knievel) states, [...] "I am the last gladiator in the new Rome.

2500|$|In 2010, one of {{his friends}} {{informed}} him that Bollywood film production house Yash Raj Films (YRF) was auditioning for new faces. Saleem was interested and he gave his audition. However, it was 8–9 months before he got confirmation from the production house that he had been selected. The film for which he was selected for was Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge, a romantic comedy set against the backdrop of social networking site Facebook; it was directed by debutante Nupur Asthana. Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge is a love story which develops on Facebook where the protagonists change identities to make their partners fall in love with them. Starring newcomers Nishant Dahiya and Saba Azad, along with Saleem and Tara D’Souza, the film was released under Y-Films, a subsidiary of YRF. The role that Saleem had to play was that of a college prankster called Vishal Bhatt, who with his friend Hacky, go on playing pranks on their friends. Saleem explained that he [...] "liked the script <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> I feel the youth will relate and connect with it. I think the movie will put me in a different light and open lot of doors for me." [...] The youngsters had to undergo a month of workshops under Aditya Chopra, where they rehearsed each other's lines from the script.|$|E

[...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted {{to make sure it was}} a look that was all me, you know?." [...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!." [...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." ...|$|E
