40|$|The {{orthogonal}} turn-milling process draws increasing attention {{parallel to}} the developments in multi-tasking machine tools. However, the effects of process parameters used in orthogonal turn-milling arenot fully understood. The basic objective {{of this study is}} to describe one of the most important andunique cutting parameters which is the tool <b>axis</b> <b>offset,</b> and determine its effects on process outputs suchas cutting force, surface quality and tool wear. In order to achieve this objective, the effect of the toolaxis offset is defined based upon geometrical relationships which are used to develop a mechanistic forcemodel. Surface quality including the tool <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> effect is examined by both analytical and experimentalmethods. Additionally, tool wear experiments were conducted to obtain the tool life under differentsettings for the tool <b>axis</b> <b>offset.</b> It is found that the process outcomes such as cutting forces, surfacequality and tool life can be improved by taking into account the tool <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> in orthogonal turn-milling operation. As a valuable conclusion, the proposed models and experimental results can be usedto select a proper tool <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> value while performing orthogonal turn-milling process in order toimprove the process outcome...|$|E

40|$|A newly {{developed}} method for determining spin <b>axis</b> <b>offsets</b> of magnetic field instruments on spacecraft {{is applied to}} THEMIS. The formerly used determination method, relying on solar wind Alfvénic fluctuations, was rarely applicable due to the orbital restrictions of the mission. With the new procedure, based on magnetic field observation of mirror modes in the magnetosheath, updated spin <b>axis</b> <b>offsets</b> can be estimated approximately once per year. Retrospective calibration of all THEMIS magnetic field measurements is thereby made possible. Since, up to this point, spin <b>axis</b> <b>offsets</b> could hardly ever be calculated due to the mission's orbits, this update represents a substantial improvement to the data.

40|$|Star {{identification}} {{is the most}} critical and important process for attitude estimation, given data from any star sensor. The main purpose of the Star Identification (Star-ID) process is to identify the observed/measured stars with the corresponding cataloged stars. The precision of the observed star directions highly depend on the calibrated accuracy of the star camera parameters, mainly the focal length f, and the optical <b>axis</b> <b>offsets</b> When these pa-rameters are not accurate or when the camera is not well calibrated, the proposed Non-dimensional Star-ID method becomes very suitable, {{because it does not}} require accurate knowledge of these parameters. The Nondimensional Star-ID method represents a unique tool to identify the stars of uncalibrated or inaccurate parameters cameras. The basic idea derives the identification process from the observed focal plane angles which are, to first order, independent from both the focal length and the optical <b>axis</b> <b>offsets.</b> The adoption of the k-vector range search technique, makes this method very fast. Moreover, it is easy to im-plement, accurate, and the probability of failing Star-ID is less than 0. 1 % for typical star tracker design parameters...|$|R

The Instron load cell {{provided}} the ‘gold standard’ load measurement, which was corrected for the angle between the actuator applied load and the anatomical long-axis, {{to calculate the}} radial axis load (Fig.  4 b).

The measured transducer loads and known radial axis loads were plotted as Bland-Altman plots to assess variations in transducer and Instron loads, and to visualize systematic bias. Correlations between load transducer and radial axis loads at each net load position were calculated using Pearson Product Moment Correlations. Significance was set at p[*]<[*] 0.05.|$|E
40|$|As a metal {{machining}} process, {{end milling}} {{is the most}} widely used processes in industry. One of the most important indicators of success in finishing operation is the estetic quality of the surface that is directly connected to the maximal height of uneven surfaces, namely rougness. In process of milling the quality of the machined surface depends of many factors, for example, tool geometry, cutter parallel <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> and cutter axis tilt, tool deflection due to cutting forces, tool and work piece vibrations etc. This paper presents the development of mathematical model for the determination {{of the quality of the}} machined surface topography. The model starts from an ideal trochoid point trajectory on the cutting edge tooth end mill, and then inserts the deviations due to cutter parallel <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> and cutter axis tilt and gives instructions for the input of other factors that influence on the machined surface quality. Also it compares the values of maximal roughness height with different mill axis positions, and on different mill cross section heights, as well as the differences at up and down milling...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Turbochargers {{have become}} common in {{passenger}} cars {{as well as}} commercial vehicles. They have an excellent mechanism to effectively increase fuel efficiency and engine power, but they unfortunately cause several noise problems. Its noise are mainly classified as structure-borne noises, generated from the vibration of rotating shaft modules (cartridges), and air-borne noises, from air flow inside turbochargers or their coupling ducts. In this study an attempt to reduce the pulsation noise generated from the compressor wheels, whose frequency {{is the same as}} the whine noise is presented. This attempt is based on using the compact high frequency side branch resonators to develop low intake noise system. The design of such system, which is mainly based on the developed 1 D linear acoustic theory and theoretical investigations to use more than one resonator connected to the main duct in series and/or in parallel are introduced. An optimization strategy to choose the appropriate resonator <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> is presented. In case of complex unsymmetrical geometry in real resonators, a 3 D finite element is used. The presented models are validated via comparison with the measured results at room temperatures. The validated models are used to improve the acoustic performance of the real resonators. Based on the developed models and the optimization results, the internal design of resonators improves its acoustic performance; the serial arrangements increase the damping at the same peak frequency while the parallel arrangements make it wider. The amount of extra damping added to the intake system depends on the resonators geometry and their <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> which can be around 50 dB a...|$|E
40|$|Two gimbal-mounted GNSS antennas were {{installed}} {{on each side}} of the radome-enclosed 20 m VLBI radio telescope at the Onsala Space Observatory. GPS data with a 1 Hz sampling rate were recorded for five semi-kinematic and four kinematic observing campaigns. These GPS data were analysed together with data from the IGS station ONSA with an in-house Matlab-based GPS software package, using the double-difference analysis strategy. The coordinates of the GNSS antennas on the telescope were estimated for different observation angles of the telescope, at specific epochs, and used to calculate the geodetic reference point of the telescope. The local tie vector between the VLBI and the ONSA GNSS reference points in a geocentric reference frame was hence obtained. The two different types of observing campaigns gave consistent results of the estimated local tie vector and the <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> of the telescope. The estimated local tie vector obtained from all nine campaigns gave standard deviations of 1. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 9 mm for the geocentric X, Y, and Z components, respectively. The result of the estimated <b>axis</b> <b>offset</b> of the VLBI telescope shows a difference of 0. 3 mm, with a standard deviation of 1. 9 mm, with respect to a reference value obtained by two local surveys carried out in 2002 and 2008.

The resulting equations are valid to second order for long, straight, slender, homogeneous, isotropic beams undergoing moderate displacements.

The equations are valid for beams with mass centroid axis and area centroid (tension) <b>axis</b> <b>offsets</b> from the elastic axis, nonuniform mass and stiffness section properties, variable pretwist, and a small precone angle. The strain-displacement relations are developed from an exact transformation between the deformed and undeformed coordinate systems.

Also, the offset would render the wrist mechanism too large for laparoscopic applications.|$|E
