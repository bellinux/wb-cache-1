Unlike <b>a</b> military <b>armored</b> car, which has armor plate mounted {{on the outside of}} the vehicle, <b>a</b> civilian <b>armored</b> car typically looks no different from a standard vehicle.|$|R

5|$|In 1940 Julian {{was able}} to produce 100lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy {{stigmasterol}} was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was shipped to the buyer, Upjohn, in <b>an</b> <b>armored</b> car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.|$|E
5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino <b>an</b> <b>armored</b> appearance. The neck {{folds of the}} Javan {{rhinoceros}} are smaller {{than those of the}} Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E

5|$|The Chilean {{government}} {{purchased a}} protected cruiser, , on the stocks in 1892, while the Argentines purchased one, , being {{built for the}} British in late 1893. The Chileans sold their oldest protected cruiser, Esmeralda, in late 1894 to finance the order of <b>an</b> <b>armored</b> cruiser. This materialized in May 1895 with a new , along with four torpedo boats; a Brazilian protected cruiser, , was purchased while under construction in August 1895. The Argentines purchased an Italian armored cruiser, , on the stocks on 14 July 1895.|$|E
5|$|The M19 {{evolved from}} the 40mm Gun Motor Carriage T65 project, {{which was based on}} <b>an</b> <b>Armored</b> Force {{requirement}} for a light anti-aircraft vehicle based on the M5 light tank chassis. Although trials were successful and a production of 1,000 T65s had been requested, the project was stopped by the Ordnance Department since the M5A1 light tank chassis was being phased out of production.|$|E
5|$|The Roma {{class was}} {{designed}} by Insp. Eng. Giuseppe De Luca, who initially planned to build both ships as broadside ironclads. By this time, however, other navies had begun to build central battery ships, which concentrated {{a smaller number of}} guns in <b>an</b> <b>armored</b> casemate that had limited capability for end-on fire. This change allowed the ship to be shorter, which in turn required less armor and made the ship more maneuverable. As a result, De Luca re-designed the second ship of the class, , into a central battery ironclad while she was under construction.|$|E

On the shield of the knight, a golden Patriarchal cross is displayed. A variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} changed radically {{during the}} early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of NVA armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain. Although the NVA was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded <b>an</b> <b>armored</b> unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.|$|E
