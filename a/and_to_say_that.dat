25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E

"That is why, {{taking into}} account the strong will of the present Roman {{authorities}} to reduce Tradition to naught, to gather the world to the spirit of Vatican II and the spirit of Assisi, we have preferred to withdraw ourselves <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we could not continue. It was not possible. We would have evidently been under the authority of Cardinal Ratzinger, President of the Roman Commission, which would have directed us; we were putting ourselves into his hands, and consequently putting ourselves into the hands of those who wish to draw us into the spirit of the Council and the spirit of Assisi. This was simply not possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilera's {{new image}} was so widely {{rejected}} by the public that it began to overshadow her music. Tim Walker from The Independent wrote: [...] " [...] simulated masturbation while wearing {{little more than a}} pair of leather chaps." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera's image in the video as [...] "the world's skeeziest reptile woman," [...] and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series. Aguilera's contemporaries Shakira, Kelly Osbourne, and Jessica Simpson expressed disapproval of the video. Time magazine commented that [...] "she appeared to have arrived on the set... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention." [...] Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone dubbed the video [...] "Girls Gone Wild: Beyond Thunderdome". Writer Emma Forrest remarked: [...] "What she's depicting is subcultures within sexuality, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this is normal young woman's sexuality is just not fair. ... Even Madonna never did that to girls." [...] Aguilera told Blender in response to the criticism: ...|$|E

500|$|On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr {{testified before}} the House Judiciary Committee in {{connection}} with the Impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal. [...] Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady of complicity in the FBI files matter, saying [...] "while there are outstanding issues that we are attempting to resolve with respect to one individual [...] found no evidence that anyone higher [...] was in any way involved in ordering the files from the FBI. Second, we have found no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose." [...] (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Travelgate matter, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the 1998 Congressional elections.) ...|$|E
500|$|When asked before {{publication}} {{about the}} forthcoming book, Rowling stated {{that she could}} not change the ending even if she wanted. [...] "These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't". She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, [...] "almost as though they are two-halves of the same novel". She has said that the last chapter of the book was written [...] "in something like 1990", as part of her earliest work on the series. Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be [...] "something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar. Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Harry's mission was over.|$|E
500|$|Few female {{respondents}} reported engaging in sex {{play with their}} siblings, {{and it seemed to}} have no {{role in the development of}} sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to report having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they were growing up. These and other variables were combined into a [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity" [...] measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women were also more likely to have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a role in the development of female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality.|$|E

2500|$|With {{nowhere to}} go, the Cheyennes walked to Fort Robinson and surrendered. Due to General Crook's winter campaigning, the {{remaining}} hostiles under Sitting Bull {{were not able}} to hunt for buffalo so by the spring of 1877 they surrendered at Fort Robinson as well. Now that the war was over, the Pawnee scouts were disbanded for good on May 1, 1877 and returned to the Indian Territory. Major North retired from his military life the same year, General Crook wrote; [...] "I think it only just and appropriate to thank you for your excellent behavior during the time of your stay in the Military service under my command, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the soldier-like conduct and discipline of the Pawnee Scouts is the most eloquent testimony that could be adduced to prove your fitness for the position you have held as their Commanding Officer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stokes joined Hibernian for an {{undisclosed}} fee, reported by the Newcastle Evening Chronicle to be around £500,000, in August 2009. This meant that he linked up again with John Hughes, who had been his manager during his loan spell at Falkirk. Stokes made his Hibs debut against his former club Falkirk, and then credited Hughes as the main reason he decided to sign for Hibs. He scored his first goals for Hibs in a 3–0 win at home to St Johnstone on 19 September. At the same time, Stokes made newspaper headlines for a nightclub altercation, which prompted John Hughes to discipline him <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he felt [...] "let down" [...] by Stokes. In December, however, Stokes scored five goals in three games, which helped to extend Hibs' unbeaten run in the SPL to 12 games. On 27 December 2009, Stokes scored the fastest goal in Scottish Premier League history, after just 12.4 seconds against Rangers. It broke the previous record of 17 seconds set by Saulius Mikoliūnas in a match between Hearts and St Mirren on 2 December 2006. Stokes' goal was the only highlight for Hibs, however, as they lost 4–1 to the league leaders. His good run of form was rewarded with the SPL young player of the month award for December 2009. Stokes continued to score on a prolific basis throughout the 2009–10 season, although John Hughes {{expressed a desire to}} improve his all-round game. Stokes won the goal of the season award from the SPL for a goal against Rangers in November 2009.|$|E
