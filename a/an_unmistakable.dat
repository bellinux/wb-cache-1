5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|Tiger {{shark teeth}} are unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> sideways pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter {{than those of}} a great white shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as the great whites teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a {{favorite}} subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.|$|E

25|$|The woman's head quickly withdraws, {{the door}} to the trailer closes again, but she leaves behind her <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> sense of watchful remonstrance, as if an angel had briefly touched the surface of the world with one sandaled foot, asked if there was any trouble and, being told all was well, had resumed her place in the ether with skeptical gravity, having {{reminded}} the children of earth that they are just barely trusted to manage their own business, and that further carelessness will not go unremarked.|$|E
25|$|Partly to aid {{recognition}} of the scenes, narrative depictions of the Life of Christ focused increasingly on the events celebrated in the major feasts of the church calendar, and {{the events of the}} Passion, neglecting the miracles and other events of Jesus' public ministry, except for the raising of Lazarus, where the mummy-like wrapped body was shown standing upright, giving <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> visual signature. A cruciform halo was worn only by Jesus (and the other persons of the Trinity), while plain halos distinguished Mary, the Apostles and other saints, helping the viewer to read increasingly populated scenes.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{coherent}} light propagation on the excitation and fluorescence of thorium nuclei in {{a crystal lattice}} environment is investigated theoretically. We find that in the forward direction the fluorescence signal exhibits characteristic intensity modulations dominated by an orders of magnitude faster, sped-up initial decay signal. This feature can be exploited for the optical determination of the isomeric transition energy. In order to obtain <b>a</b> <b>unmistakable</b> signature of the isomeric nuclear fluorescence, we put forward a novel scheme for the direct measurement of the transition energy via electromagnetically modified nuclear forward scattering involving two fields that couple three nuclear states.

25|$|With a very stout {{body and}} a highly arched back, the prickly dogfish has <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> profile. Its head is {{slightly}} flattened, with a short rounded snout. The nostrils are large and closely spaced. The eyes are immediately followed by small round spiracles. The mouth is relatively small and transverse, and almost surrounded by deep furrows coming from the mouth corners. The lips are thick and bear papillae (nipple-like structures). There are 1219 upper and 1113 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are small with narrow upright cusps, while the lower teeth are large with broad knife-like triangular cusps. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
25|$|Those {{born and}} raised in Minas Gerais, also called Mineiros, bear <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> accent that sets them apart from fellow Brazilians, {{although}} people born in different regions of the state bear slightly different accents, some resembling those of neighboring states, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. They are considered reserved, prudent, relatively silent to the point of melancholy but welcoming and family-focused. It {{is one of the most}} religious states, with a large proportion of staunch Roman Catholics and a burgeoning Evangelical and neo-Pentecostal population, with pockets of African religions. The Spiritist doctrine is also professed by a significant portion of the population, partly due to the influence of Chico Xavier, the main spiritual icon of Brazil, who lived in Minas Gerais all his life.|$|E
25|$|The FCC model {{predicts the}} {{specific}} form of reverse dominance display needed by female coalitions resisting would-be dominant or philanderer males. Females needed to signal 'No' by constructing themselves as inviolable using red cosmetics. To assert ritual power, {{they needed to}} go periodically on 'sex strike'. To defend themselves physically against harassment by non-kin males, defiant females needed {{to draw on the}} support of male kin—sons and brothers—as members of their reverse dominance coalitions. In order to reverse signals of sexual availability, it was logical to sing and dance <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> message: 'Wrong species, wrong sex, wrong time!'. On this basis, FCC theory leads us to expect 'divine' or 'totemic' spiritual entities depicted in early rock art to be therianthropic ('wrong species'), gender-ambivalent ('wrong sex') and blood-red ('wrong time') (figure h).|$|E

25|$|A {{screening}} {{program a}} year later in 2012 {{found that more than}} a third (36%) of children in Fukushima Prefecture have abnormal growths in their thyroid glands. As of August 2013, there have been more than 40 children newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer and other cancers in Fukushima prefecture as a whole. In 2015, the number of thyroid cancers or detections of developing thyroid cancers numbered 137. However, whether these incidences of cancer are elevated above the rate in un-contaminated areas and therefore were due to exposure to nuclear radiation is unknown at this stage. Data from the Chernobyl accident showed that <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> rise in thyroid cancer rates following the disaster in 1986 only began after a cancer incubation period of 3–5 years; however, whether this data can be directly compared to the Fukushima nuclear disaster is yet to be determined.|$|E
25|$|Von Kluck sent von der Marwitz's II Cavalry Corps (3 cavalry divisions) {{around the}} British west flank {{to prevent a}} British retreat on the Channel ports. Sir John French sent a message (24 August), with <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> tone of pique, to Lanrezac, which Spears insisted on writing down, warning that the BEF might have to retreat {{southwest}} towards Amiens on its lines of communication, although it is unclear that this would actually have been practicable if the Germans had actually been moving in force around the British left flank. However, Sir John agreed to Joffre's request that the BEF, now numbering 5 divisions {{as it had been}} joined by the 4th Infantry Division, would instead fall back on Cambrai if it had to, so that the BEF could still protect the French left flank. Joffre also sent a further two French reserve divisions to the British left flank, the beginning of the redeployment of French forces which would see Maunoury's Sixth Army form around Amiens and then fight near Paris. French considered, but rejected, the option of sheltering the BEF in the fortified town of Maubeuge, partly out of instinct that the Germans were hoping to tempt him into allowing himself to be besieged there and partly because he remembered that Edward Hamley had likened Bazaine allowing himself to be besieged in Metz in 1870 to a shipwrecked man taking hold of the anchor. French himself issued no direct written orders between 11.15pm on 21 August and 8.25pm on 24 August; Terraine argued that this, along with his absence during the battle of Mons (although on the German side von Kluck also played little direct role in the battle), marks the point when he and GHQ began to disengage from active command of the BEF, leaving Smith-Dorrien and Haig in effective control of their corps.|$|E

500|$|The pyjama shark or striped {{catshark}} (Poroderma africanum) is {{a species}} of catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, endemic to the coastal waters of South Africa. This abundant, bottom-dwelling species can be found from the intertidal zone to a depth of around , particularly over rocky reefs and kelp beds. With a series of thick, parallel, dark stripes running along its stout body, the pyjama shark has <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> appearance. It is additionally characterized by a short head and snout with a pair of slender barbels that do not reach the mouth, and two dorsal fins that are placed far back on the body. It can grow up to a length of [...] long.|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 2016, South Africa-based {{archaeologist}} Neels Kruger found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} near Mossel Bay, South Africa that has <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> partial logo of Rolls Royce, the manufacturer of the engines of the missing aircraft. An acknowledgement of a possible part of an engine cowling {{was made by the}} Malaysian Ministry of Transport. An additional piece of possible debris, suggested to have come from the interior of the aircraft, was found on the island of Rodrigues, Mauritius, in late March and was to be examined by Australian authorities. On 11 May 2016, the authority determined that these two pieces of debris were [...] "almost certainly" [...] from Flight370.|$|E
500|$|There is {{also the}} solo piano piece Battle of Manassas, written in 1861 by [...] "Blind Tom" [...] Bethune and {{published}} in 1866. The score instructs the pianist to represent cannon fire at various points by striking [...] "with the flat of the hand, as many notes as possible, and with as much force as possible, at the bass of the piano." [...] In 1887, Giuseppe Verdi became the first notable composer in the Western tradition to write <b>an</b> <b>unmistakable</b> chromatic cluster: the storm music with which Otello opens includes an organ cluster (C, C, D) that also has the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture known. Still, it was not before the second {{decade of the twentieth}} century that tone clusters assumed a recognized place in Western classical music practice.|$|E
