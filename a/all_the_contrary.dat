60|$|His {{philosophy}} of general history is recast, {{and in many}} respects changed; we cannot but say, greatly for the worse. He gives much greater development than before to the Fetishistic, and to what he terms the Theocratic, periods. To the Fetishistic view of nature he evinces a partiality, which appears strange in a Positive philosopher. But {{the reason is that}} Fetish-worship is a religion of the feelings, and not at all of the intelligence. He regards it as cultivating universal love: as a practical fact it cultivates much rather universal fear. He looks upon Fetishism as much more akin to Positivism than any of the forms of Theology, inasmuch as these consider matter as inert, and moved only by forces, natural and supernatural, exterior to itself: while Fetishism resembles Positivism in conceiving matter as spontaneously active, and errs only by not distinguishing activity from life. As if the superstition of the Fetishist consisted only in believing that the objects which produce the phaenomena of nature involuntarily, produce them voluntarily. The Fetishist thinks not merely that his Fetish is alive, but that it can help him in war, can cure him of diseases, can grant him prosperity, or afflict him with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> evils. Therein consists the lamentable effect of Fetishism--its degrading and prostrating influence on the feelings and conduct, its conflict with all genuine experience, and antagonism to all real knowledge of nature.|$|E
60|$|Ah, what a walk it was! What {{air over}} my head; what grass under my feet! The {{sweetness}} of the inner land, and the crisp saltness of the distant sea, were mixed in that delicious breeze. The short turf, fragrant with odorous herbs, rose and fell elastic, underfoot. The mountain-piles of white cloud moved in sublime procession along the blue field of heaven, overhead. The wild growth of prickly bushes, spread in great patches over the grass, was in a glory of yellow bloom. On we went; now up, now down; now bending to the right, and now turning to the left. I looked about me. No house; no road; no paths, fences, hedges, walls; no land-marks of any sort. All round us, turn which way we might, nothing was to be seen but the majestic solitude of the hills. No living creatures appeared but the white dots of sheep scattered over the soft green distance, and the skylark singing his hymn of happiness, a speck above my head. Truly a wonderful place! Distant not more than a morning's drive from noisy and populous Brighton--a stranger to this neighborhood could only have found his way by the compass, exactly {{as if he had}} been sailing on the sea! The farther we penetrated on our land-voyage, the more wild and the more beautiful the solitary landscape grew. The boy picked his way as he chose--there were no barriers here. Plodding behind, I saw nothing, at one time, but the back of the chaise, tilted up in the air, both boy and pony being invisibly buried in the steep descent of the hill. At other times, the pitch was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> way; the whole interior of the ascending chaise was disclosed to my view, and above the chaise the pony, and above the pony the boy--and, ah, my luggage swaying and rocking in the frail embraces of the rope that held it. Twenty times did I confidently expect to see baggage, chaise, pony, boy, all rolling down into the bottom of a valley together. But no! Not the least little accident happened to spoil my enjoyment of the day. Politically contemptible, Finch's boy had his merit--he was master of his subject as guide and pony-leader among the South Down Hills.|$|E

6000|$|Thank you, {{my dearest}} cousin, for your kind little note, which I run {{the chance of}} {{answering}} by that Wednesday's post you think you may wait for. So (via your table) I set about writing to you, and the first word, of course, must be an expression of my contentment with the 'Examiner' review. Indeed, I am more than contented--delighted with it. I had some dread, vaguely fashioned, about the 'Examiner'; the very delay looked ominous. And then, I thought to myself, though I did not say, that if Mr. Forster praised the verses on Flush to you, it was just {{because he had no}} sympathy for anything else. But it is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> you see, and I am the more pleased for the want of previous expectation; and I must add that if you were so kind as to be glad of being associated with me by Mr. Forster's reference, I was so human as to be very very glad of being associated with you by the same. Also you shall criticise 'Geraldine' exactly as you like--mind, I don't think it all so rough as the extracts appear to be, and some variety is attained by that playing at ball with the pause, which causes the apparent roughness--still you shall criticise 'Geraldine' exactly as you like. I have a great fancy for writing some day a longer poem of a like class--a poem comprehending the aspect and manners of modern life, and flinching at nothing of the conventional. I think it might be done with good effect. You said once that Tennyson had done it in 'Locksley Hall,' and I half agreed with you. But looking at 'Locksley Hall' again, I find that not much has been done in that way, noble and passionate and full as the poem is in other ways. But there is no story, no manners, no modern allusion, except in the grand general adjuration to the 'Mother-age,' and no approach to the treatment of a conventionality. But Crabbe, as you say, has done it, and Campbell in his 'Theodore' in a few touches was near to do it; but Hayley clearly apprehends the species of poem in his 'Triumphs of Temper' and 'Triumphs of Music,' and so did Miss Seward, who called it the 'poetical novel.' Now I do think that a true poetical novel--modern, and on the level of the manners of the day--might be as good a poem as any other, and much more popular besides. Do you not think so? ...|$|E

40|$|Anosognosia for {{hemiplegia}} {{has seen}} a century of almost continuous research, yet a definitive understanding of its mechanism remains elusive. Essentially, anosognosic patients hold quasi-delusional beliefs about their paralysed limbs, in spite of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> evidence, repeated questioning, and logical argument. We review a range of findings suggesting that emotion and motivation {{play an important role}} in anosognosia. We conclude that anosognosia involves (amongst other things) a process of psychological defence. This conclusion stems from a wide variety of clinical and experimental investigations, including data on implicit awareness of deficit, fluctuations in awareness over time, and dramatic effects upon awareness of psychological interventions such as psychotherapy, reframing of the emotional consequences of the paralysis, and first versus third person perspectival manipulations. In addition, we review and refute the (eight) arguments historically raised against the â��defenceâ�� hypothesis, including the claim that a defence-based account cannot explain the lateralised nature of the disorder. We argue that damage to a well-established right-lateralised emotion regulation system, with links to psychological processes that appear to underpin allocentric spatial cognition, plays a key role in anosognosia (at least in some patients). We conclude with a discussion of implications for clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|La infección por Helicobacter pylori (Hp), {{principal}} etiología de la gastritis crónica, úlcera duodenal y adenocarcinoma gástrico, ha sido motivo de estudios, muy controversiales, de muchos investigadores, sobre su papel en el desarrollo de enfermedad por reflujo gastroesofágico (ERGE) que es favorecida por la infección, según algunos y que es en sí provocadora, según otros. Los hallazgos manométricos reportados incluyen desde hipertonía del EEI con relajaciones transitorias espontáneas (RTEEI) y severos trastornos motores (TM) acompañantes, hasta todo lo contrario. Con este trabajo pretendemos demostrar la existencia de trastornos manométricos específicos en pacientes Hp+ comparándolos con pacientes Hp-. Se les realizó endoscopia (esofagitis en 20 Hp+ y 12 Hp-), manometría y Phmetría esofágica (a un subgrupo) a 76 pacientes sin tratamiento, de ambos sexos, con edad X = 46, 3 años, 48 con test de ureasa positivo y 28 con test negativo. En los Hp+, la pr fue elevada significativamente, x = 41 mm (vs. 14, 5 mmHg) (p The Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection, main etiolgy {{of chronic}} gastritis, duodenal ulcer and gastric adenocarcinoma, has been object of very controversial studies conducted by many researchers on {{its role in}} the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is favored by infection according to some authors, and that provokes it according to others.

Pr was significantly elevated in the Hp+, x = 41 mm (vs. 14, 5 mmHg) (p < 0. 02); 63 % were hypetonic and 37 % normotonic, with a high incidence of STREI (75 %) (p < 0. 02) and a marked sphincteral asymmetry (77 %) (p < 0. 02). The MD were from moderate to severe in 89 % (p < 0. 05). In the Hp negative group, the EEI showed normal-low pressure: x&# 094;= 17. 3 mmHg (39. 3 % hypertonic and 61 % normotonic). The STREI just in 25 % and the normal assymetry in 75 %. It was found a predominance of the mild to moderate MD, accounting for 61. 2 %. It was concluded that the Hp positive patients presented significant manometric alterations, with hypertonic EEI, incompetent for the STREI and for being totally asymmetric, characteristics that favor the GER and with more severe motor disorders than the non-infected H. pylori patients...|$|E
