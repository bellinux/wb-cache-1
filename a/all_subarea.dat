The contact infrastructure anisotropy and variable population and development density lead to socioeconomic space discontinuities.

However, from the points corresponding to the subareas we can draw the radii of the sphere to represent the concrete connection between two subareas available in this moment by means of a segment connecting the corresponding radii at different distances from the centre of the sphere. Thus connections longer or shorter than the basic distance are to be found on an other sphere than the basic sphere. Accordingly, the degree of connectedness is characterized by the corresponding length of radius to express several alternative connections to employ a spatial or time measure and to state whether the lengthening of the distance is due to a “roundabout ” connection or to the low speed parameters etc. It is thus possible to dodge the difficulties which in such cases emerge because of the necessity to employ both types of models – the gravity and the “opportunity ” models...|$|R

Tracing the linear growth of two year classes {{through more than}} one year following set led to a validation of the ring method of age determination in the population studied. Annual ring lengths based on the means of samples from <b>all</b> <b>subareas</b> were fitted by von Bertalanffy equations. Increases in total length, wet weight, and relative width showed patterns of seasonal variation. Death rates of the Seaside Beach population were estimated from recoveries of 3, 379 serially marked razor clams.

The weight yield per 1, 000 recruits, as function of age at first capture, was examined at three hypothetical levels of wastage indicating that potential increases in yield at each level could be realized by deferring the exploitation of a year class until its second year of age, regardless of whether the fisheries are continuous or seasonal...|$|R

In the present study, fine-scale diversity patterns in relation to depth were analyzed for three major megafaunal groups (fish, cephalopods and crustaceans) in three subareas of the eastern Mediterranean (Crete, Cyclades and Dodecanese islands). The analysis was {{based on data from}} the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey conducted during 2005 - 2014 and the relationship between depth and two different diversity measures (species richness and Shannon-Weaver) was examined using Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) techniques. Species richness of fish decreased with depth in two of the three subareas (Cyclades, Dodecanese), while the opposite was true for crustaceans in <b>all</b> <b>subareas.</b> Cephalopods had higher species richness at intermediate depths, near the shelf break. Significant differences among subareas were found, with Crete showing a distinct species richness-depth pattern, which was more obvious for fish and cephalopods. The differences among subareas were also highlighted based on the occurrence of alien species of Indo-Pacific origin, which were more frequent in Crete. Our results suggested that the importance of depth-related factors in structuring communities was higher for cephalopods and less important for fish, and that Crete showed a distinct diversity-depth relationship, a fact that can be attributed to its specific geographical and oceanographic characteristics. These results support the current GFCM/FAO's characterization of Crete as a unique geographic subarea. The findings of the study contribute to understanding the causes of underlying diversity patterns and would assist various environmental management actions, particularly those related to the establishment of marine-protected areas...|$|R

We {{reproduce}} the 100 m-Effelsberg HB 3 image at 2695 MHz at large scale, and find that there exists a background emission gradient across the HB 3 area. Based on our analysis of background emission and the boundary between W 3 and HB 3, we give HB 3 's flux density as 68. 6 +/- 11. 5 Jy at 408 MHz and 44. 8 +/- 12. 0 Jy at 1420 MHz, after subtracting flux from compact sources within HB 3. The integrated flux-density-based spectral index between 408 MHz and 1420 MHz is 0. 34 +/- 0. 15. The averaged T-T plot spectral index using <b>all</b> <b>subareas</b> is 0. 36.

Group 2 comprised patients with low back pain and neck pain (n= 50, Group 2 a), osteoarthritis (n= 50, Group 2 b), fibromyalgia syndrome (n= 50, Group 2 c) and stroke (n= 44, group 2 d). The PGWBI was translated into Turkish according to standard adaptation procedure. This index consisted of 6 subscales (anxiety, depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control, general health and vitality) and 22 items. The PGWBI was administered to subjects twice a week for testing reliability. Validity was based on correlating the PGWBI scores with that of the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Results: The internal consistency and test-retest reliability were found to be good in healthy individuals and patient groups separately (Cronbach’s alpha range: 0. 93 - 0. 92; intraclass correlation coefficient range: 0. 88 - 0. 99).

40|$|Besides its "classical" {{neurotransmitter}} function, serotonin (5 -HT) {{has been}} found to also act as a neurodevelopmental signal. During development, the 5 -HT projection system, besides an external placental source, represents one of the earliest neurotransmitter systems to innervate the brain. One of the targets of the 5 -HT projection system, originating in the brainstem raphe nuclei, is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area involved in higher cognitive functions and important in the etiology of many neurodevelopmental disorders. Little is known, however, about the exact role of 5 -HT and its signaling molecules {{in the formation of the}} raphe-prefrontal network. Using explant essays, we here studied the role of the 5 -HT transporter (5 -HTT), an important modulator of the 5 -HT signal, in rostral raphe-prefrontal network formation. We found that the chemotrophic nature of the interaction between the origin (rostral raphe cluster) and a target (mPFC) of the 5 -HT projection system was affected in rats lacking the 5 -HTT (5 -HTT(-/-)). While 5 -HTT deficiency did not affect the dorsal raphe 5 -HT-positive outgrowing neurites, the median raphe 5 -HT neurites switched from a strong repulsive to an attractive interaction when co-cultured with the mPFC. Furthermore, the fasciculation of the mPFC outgrowing neurites was dependent on the amount of 5 -HTT. In the mPFC of 5 -HTT(-/-) pups, we observed clear differences in 5 -HT innervation and the identity of a class of projection neurons of the mPFC. In the absence of the 5 -HTT, the 5 -HT innervation in <b>all</b> <b>subareas</b> of the early postnatal mPFC increased dramatically and the number of Satb 2 -positive callosal projection neurons was decreased. Together, these results suggest a 5 -HTT dependency during early development of these brain areas and in the formation of the raphe-prefrontal network. The tremendous complexity of the 5 -HT projection system and its role in several neurodevelopmental disorders highlights the need for further research in this largely unexplored area...|$|R

40|$|Computational {{linguistics}} (CL) is {{an interdisciplinary}} mix of computer science and linguistics with additional insights drawn from {{areas such as}} psycholinguistics and the philosophy of language. Its primary concern is with the computational modeling of linguistic processes pursued as a theoretically oriented exercise whose purpose is either to provide models that help us gain insight {{into the nature of}} language and the human language processing mechanism or to support the development of software applications that do useful things with language (an area sometimes referred to as language technology). For some, the term “computational linguistics” is synonymous with natural language processing (NLP); however, {{from the perspective of the}} material provided here, NLP is more applications-oriented than CL. Although we provide some pointers to work that describes NLP applications, our primary focus here is on the theoretical underpinnings that CL provides to activities with a more practical focus. The first work in CL dates from the 1950 s, when initial attempts were made to automatically translate Russian into English. Until the late 1980 s most work in the field was concerned with what we might call symbolic systems, often involving large collections of handwritten rules to model some linguistic phenomenon. Since the late 1980 s there has been a significant shift toward statistical methods, where rules and generalizations are learned from data rather than being produced manually; this has become possible only as a result of the combination of, on one hand, vast amounts of data becoming available, particularly via the World Wide Web, and, on the other hand, the immense increases in computer processing power required to execute many iterations over large data sets to derive information from them. In almost <b>all</b> <b>subareas</b> of CL one can generally divide the work pursued into the periods before and after this “statistical revolution. ” The material here is organized around the conventional decomposition of linguistic study into phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Work that is primarily concerned with speech recognition and synthesis is not covered. Primarily concern is with work on the processing of English; again, much of the work in CL is applicable to other languages, but English holds a privileged position as the focus of most research. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} interest planners show in land use models, their actual use {{in supporting the}} planning practice is still limited. A frequently heard complaint about these models {{is that they are}} too difficult to use. Most planners do not have a background in modelling and the calibration required for the application of a model to their region is often seen as an obstacle. The usual modeller-centred operation of such tools, inflicting upon users the full range of calibration parameters without discriminating between those who are relevant for the planning practice and those who are mere internal parameters, distracts attention from the aim of these models to support the integrated assessment of planning alternatives. MOLAND-Light tries {{to bridge the gap between}} the MOLAND land use model and the planning practice. Its aim is to reach a large audience with a moderately complex model driven by a simple user interface. MOLAND-Light builds on the framework of the MOLAND land use model which uses a well established method known as constrained cellular automata. The total demand for each land use class is determined exogenously and the cellular automata algorithm allocates these land uses on the map. MOLAND applications are calibrated specifically for a particular region and each application therefore has its own specific parameterisation. MOLAND-Light is generic in the sense that it uses the same model with the same parameterisation for <b>all</b> <b>subareas</b> of the targeted geographical extent (EU- 27). To develop a generic rule set for all regions, MOLAND-Light was calibrated for selected case study areas, representing both urbanized and more rural areas, and independently validated for other areas over the same simulation period. To ensure an easy access to planners, the user interface is simplified to those drivers relevant for planning and the calibrated applications are accessible from a web server that contains the model as well as all data and parameters. A user who wants to do a scenario study first selects a region of interest. For this region future population developments and area demands for selected land uses are defined. Then MOLAND-Light allocates these land uses on the map for each consecutive year, leading to a time series of maps of the land use developments and a set of socio-economic and environmental indicators, under the assumptions of the defined scenario. This paper will describe the MOLAND-Light model, as well as the calibration and validation results for the generic rule set. JRC. DDG. H. 6 -Spatial data infrastructure...|$|R

We found moderate linear and quadratic correlations, indicating that the CC and <b>all</b> CC <b>subareas</b> increase with FBV both in men and women (multiple r 2 ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 28). Allometric equations revealed that these increases were less than proportional to FBV (r 2 ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 30). Absolute CC measurements, as well as CC subareas relative to total CC or FBV (the latter measures termed the CC ratios), were further analyzed with regard to possible effects of handedness, gender, or handedness by gender interaction. Contrary to previous reports, left-handers did not show larger CC measurements compared to right-handers. The only apparent influence of gender was on the CC ratios, which were larger in women. However, smaller brains had larger CC ratios which were mainly independent of gender, {{a result of the}} less than proportional increase of callosal size with FBV.

40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} {{studies of}} animal and human behavioral learning {{have focused on}} the dichotomy of the value-based strategy using action value functions to predict rewards and the model-based strategy using internal models to predict environmental states. However, animals and humans often take simple procedural behaviors, such as the "win-stay, lose-switch" strategy without explicit prediction of rewards or states. Here we consider another strategy, the finite state-based strategy, in which a subject selects an action depending on its discrete internal state and updates the state depending on the action chosen and the reward outcome. By analyzing choice behavior of rats in a free-choice task, we found that the finite state-based strategy fitted their behavioral choices more accurately than value-based and model-based strategies did. When fitted models were run autonomously with the same task, only the finite state-based strategy could reproduce the key feature of choice sequences. Analyses of neural activity recorded from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and the ventral striatum (VS) identified significant fractions of neurons in <b>all</b> three <b>subareas</b> for which activities were correlated with individual states of the finite state-based strategy. The signal of internal states at the time of choice was found in DMS, and for clusters of states was found in VS. In addition, action values and state values of the value-based strategy were encoded in DMS and VS, respectively. These results suggest that both the value-based strategy and the finite state-based strategy are implemented in the striatum...|$|R
40|$|The premotor cortex of macaque monkeys is {{currently}} subdivided into {{at least six}} different subareas {{on the basis of}} structural, hodological and physiological criteria. To determine the degree of divergence/convergence of thalamocortical projections to mesial [supplementary motor area (SMA) -proper and pre-SMA] and lateral (PMd-c, PMd-r, PMv-c and PMv-r) premotor (PM) subareas, quantitative analyses were performed on the distribution of retrograde labelling after multiple tracer injections in the same animal. The results demonstrate that all PM and SMA subareas receive common inputs from several thalamic nuclei, but the relative contribution of these nuclei to thalamocortical projections differs. The largest difference occurs between subareas of SMA, with much greater contribution from the mediodorsal (MD) and area X, and a smaller contribution from the ventral lateral anterior (VLa) and ventral part of the ventral lateral posterior (VLpv) to pre-SMA than to SMA-proper. In PM, differences between subareas are less pronounced; in particular, all receive a significant contribution from MD, the ventral anterior (VApc) and area X. However, there are clear gradients, such as increasing projections from MD to rostral, from VLa and VLpv to caudal, and from dorsal VLp (VLpd) to dorsal premotor subareas. Intralaminar nuclei provide widespread projections to <b>all</b> premotor <b>subareas.</b> The degree of overlap between thalamocortical projections varies among different PM and SMA subareas and different sectors of the thalamus. These variations, which correspond to different origin and topography of thalamocortical projections, are discussed in relation to functional organizations at thalamic and cortical levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the most {{significant}} trend in applied linguistics {{is the emergence of}} the field as a generic discipline, involving several <b>subareas,</b> <b>all</b> characterised by the aim of developing theoretical and empirical studies of language as a key element in real world problems. Various subsidiary trends are apparent including numerous methodological and theoretical developments. The paper argues that so far these trends respond only inconsistently to two major challenges in the relationship between the academy and the lay community: (1) identifying and studying issues held to be problems by those outside the academy; and (2) clarifying the nature of the contributions of research to those real world problems. Three themes are considered: the relationship between surface data and theory development; the problem of the specific and the general; and the importance of problematicity. The paper concludes that applied linguistics needs to be accountable to two communities, the academy and the lay communities it aims to work with...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of floristic research into a flat fen along a part of the Jarak stream in Žumberak-Samoborsko gorje Nature Park. This fen belongs to order Caricetalia davallianae Br. -Bl. 1949, alliance Caricio davallianae Klika 1934, association Eriophoro latifolio-Caricetum panicae Horvat ex Trinajstić 2002. The area was researched in 2007 / 2008 and it was divided into four subareas: fen and three succession stages, Phragmites subarea, transitional stage between common reed (Phragmites australis) and young forest, and young forest. During the winter period of the research the overgrowing woody vegetation on three subareas was cut, because that action should prevent further succession and help the restoration of the fen. The following year, floristic changes were monitored. Recorded plants were taxonomically analyzed and ecological indicator values according to Landolt were calculated. During this study 222 plant species were found, out of which 15 were endangered (according to IUCN categorization) and 59 protected or strictly protected in Croatia. The summarized ecological indicator values according to Landolt showed only minor differences between the subareas, out of which only the young forest subarea stood out. The removal of the plants resulted in low floristic changes, present mostly in the young forest subarea, where species of open habitats enlarged their abundance, but no characteristic fen species were recorded. It is concluded that the fen along the stream Jarak should be protected, because of its rare vegetation type, but also because of the endangered and protected species found in this area. It is also necessary to carry out regular removal of overgrowing vegetation from <b>all</b> the <b>subareas</b> and multiple mowing to protect the fen and even enlarge its surface...|$|R

In the 6 statistic years after 1976, in the study area, the distribution range of the secondary vegetation shrank greatly in 4 different subareas (northeast, southeast, northwest and northwest subarea), at 4 different altitudes (1500 - 1800 m, 1800 - 2100 m, 2100 - 2400 m and 2400 - 2700 m), on 4 different gradients (0 - 8 degrees, 8 - 15 degrees, 15 - 25 degrees, 25 - 35 degrees) and on 4 different aspects but the flat land (sunny slope, semi-sunny slope, semi-shadowy slope, and shadowy slope); by contrast, in the study area, the distribution range of artificial vegetation expanded greatly in <b>all</b> the <b>subareas,</b> at 2 different altitudes (1800 - 2100 m and 2100 - 2400 m), on 3 different gradients (0 - 8 degrees, 8 - 15 degrees, 15 - 25 degrees), and on the 4 different aspects but the flat land. (ii) The increase and decrease in distribution area of major vegetation types in the study area. During the research period, the total area of major vegetation fluctuated between 1471. 92 and 1196. 94 km(2), averaging 1255. 52 km(2) annually, with the fluctuation rate between - 4. 67 % and 17. 24 %. In the second statistic year (1989), the total area of major vegetation decreased sharply, and then remained relatively stable afterward. During the research period, the distribution area of the secondary vegetation decreased sharply in the 6 statistic years after 1976, in contrast to the sharp increase in the distribution area of artificial vegetation in such 6 years. During the research period, the total area of major vegetation decreased by 258. 73 km(2) in total, among which the total area of the secondary vegetation decreased by 342. 52 km(2) in contrast to the increase in artificial vegetation by 83. 78 km(2) in total.

40|$|Abstract Background Even minor {{abnormalities}} of early child development may have dramatic long term consequences. Accurate prevalence rates {{for a range}} of developmental impairments have been difficult to establish. Since related studies have used different methodological approaches, direct comparisons of the prevalence of developmental delays are difficult. The understanding of the key factors affecting child development, especially in preschool aged children remains limited. We used data from school entry examinations in Bavaria to measure the prevalence of developmental impairments in pre-school children beginning primary school in 1997 – 2009. Methods The developmental impairments of all school beginners in the district of Dingolfing- Landau, Bavaria were assessed using modified “Bavarian School Entry Model” examination from 1997 to 2009 (N= 13, 182). The children were assessed for motor, cognitive, language and psychosocial impairments using a standardised medical protocol. Prevalence rates of impairments in twelve domains of development were estimated. Using uni- and multivariable logistic regression models, association between selected factors and development delays were assessed. Results The highest prevalence existed for impairments of pronunciation (13. 8 %) followed by fine motor impairments (12. 2 %), and impairments of memory and concentration (11. 3 %) and the lowest for impairments of rhythm of speech (3. 1 %). Younger children displayed more developmental delays. Male gender was strongly associated with all developmental impairments (highest risk for fine motor impairments = OR 3. 22, 95 % confidence interval 2. 86 - 3. 63). Preschool children with siblings (vs. children without any siblings) were at higher risk of having impairments in pronunciation (OR 1. 31, 1. 14 - 1. 50). The influence of the non-German nationality was strong, with a maximum risk increase for the subareas of grammar and psychosocial development. Although children with non-German nationality had a reduced risk of disorders for the rhythm of speech and pronunciation, in <b>all</b> other 10 <b>subareas</b> their risk was increased. Conclusions In preschool children, most common were delays of pronunciation, memory and concentration. Age effects suggest that delays can spontaneously resolve, but providing support at school entry might be helpful. Boys and migrant children appear at high risk of developmental problems, which may warrant tailored intervention strategies. </p...|$|R
