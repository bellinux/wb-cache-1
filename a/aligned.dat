40|$|The {{response}} of shear stress to a weak ac electric field as a probe {{is measured in}} a nematic liquid crystal under shear flow and dc electric fields. Two states with different responses are clearly observed when the dc electric field is changed at a constant shear rate: the flow <b>aligning</b> and non-flow <b>aligning</b> states. The director lies in the shear plane in the flow <b>aligning</b> state {{and out of the}} plane in the non-flow <b>aligning</b> state. Through application of dc electric field, the non-flow <b>aligning</b> state can be changed to the flow <b>aligning</b> state. In the transition from the flow <b>aligning</b> state to the non-flow <b>aligning</b> state, it is found that the response increases and the relaxation time becomes longer. Here, the experimental results in the flow <b>aligning</b> state are discussed {{on the basis of the}} Ericksen-Leslie theory...|$|R

5|$|In 1924 Tang Shengzhi <b>aligned</b> {{himself with}} {{northern}} warlords against the warlord controlling Guangdong, who was <b>aligned</b> with the Kuomintang. Peng conducted skirmishes along the Hunan-Guangdong border for nine months, but reorganized his battalion along pro-Kuomintang political lines in 1925. In late 1925 Chiang Kai-shek established the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) {{and led the}} Kuomintang {{to take control of}} Guangdong. Tang then <b>aligned</b> himself with Chiang and joined him in the Northern Expedition, an effort to unify China by defeating the northern warlords. The Hunanese army was reorganized, and Peng was promoted to the rank of major. When Wu Peifu invaded Hunan and occupied Changsha, Chiang sent the NRA to Hunan, beginning the Northern Expedition. Peng's forces then joined the Kuomintang, though Peng never joined the party as a formal member. It wasn't until after Peng joined the Kuomintang, in 1925, that he first heard of the Communist Party.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} self-organized {{flocking}} in {{a swarm of}} behaviorally heterogeneous mobile robots: <b>aligning</b> and non-aligning robots. <b>Aligning</b> robots are capable of agreeing on a common heading direction with other neighboring <b>aligning</b> robots. Conversely, non-aligning robots lack this capability. Studying this type of heterogeneity in self-organized flocking is important as it can support {{the design of a}} swarm with minimal hardware requirements. Through systematic simulations, we show that a heterogeneous group of <b>aligning</b> and non- <b>aligning</b> robots can achieve good performance in flocking behavior. We further show that the performance is affected not only by the proportion of <b>aligning</b> robots, but also by the way they integrate information about their neighbors and also by heterogeneity in the way robots move...|$|R

To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis is not exactly <b>aligned</b> north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be <b>aligned</b> with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are <b>aligned</b> in random directions because of thermal equilibrium.

5|$|The outputs of a {{structural}} alignment are a superposition {{of the atomic}} coordinate sets and a minimal {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) between the structures.

5|$|After Harrison's {{preliminary}} studies, {{it became}} clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end of the main site, <b>aligned</b> east to west, with a tower at the west end; the upper quadrangle, to the immediate west of the hall and <b>aligned</b> north to south, would have the Warden's Lodging at the north end and the chapel at the south end; steps would lead down from the upper quadrangle into the lower quadrangle, again <b>aligned</b> east to west, with the main entrance at the far east end of the lower quadrangle. The proposed institute would face the main college entrance across Worcester Street. The sub-committee recommended that Harrison's plans be adopted in January 1939, and a model of the design was shown to Nuffield in June 1939 – he had been abroad for much of the intervening period.|$|E
