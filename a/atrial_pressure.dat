5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the aortic and pulmonary valves are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure is greater than the <b>atrial</b> <b>pressure</b> the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
25|$|For either event, {{cavitation}} {{occurs on}} the upstream side of valve. Clinically, cavitation is of primary {{concern in the}} mitral position. This position is especially harsh due to the sudden ventricular pressure rise which drives the valve closure against a low left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressure</b> which {{is said to be}} the worst case condition thus position for cavitation to occur. Cavitation is also suspected as a contributing factor in blood cell damage and increased risk of thromboembolic complications.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{pacemaker}} syndrome exhibit increased plasma {{levels of}} ANP. That's due {{to increase in}} left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressure</b> and left ventricular filling pressure, {{which is due to}} decreased cardiac output caused by dyssynchrony in atrial and ventricular contraction. ANP and BNP are potent arterial and venous vasodilators that can override carotid and aortic baroreceptor reflexes attempting to compensate for decreased blood pressure. Usually patients with cannon a waves have higher plasma levels of ANP than those without cannon a waves.|$|E
30|$|Core of HFpEF {{diagnosis}} is {{the demonstration of}} elevated left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures.</b> Patients may exhibit diastolic dysfunction (as detected by a reduced TDI mitral annular E’) unrelated to their respiratory symptoms, i.e. without having high left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures</b> and congestive HF. Rather than diastolic dysfunction per se, what matters in the approach to patients with suspected acute heart failure is the finding of positive echocardiographic indices of increased left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures</b> [13]. These should be indices sufficiently validated in decompensated/critical patients, (such as E/E’, pulmonary veins systolic fraction, E/A, DTE), and are usually assessed with a semi-quantitative approach [20].|$|R

2500|$|Another {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the severity of}} mitral stenosis is the simultaneous left and right heart chamber catheterization.

[...] By simultaneously taking these pressures, it is possible to determine the gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle during ventricular diastole, which is a marker for the severity of mitral stenosis.

30|$|The gold {{standard}} for determining cardiac congestion is cardiac catheterization with determination of right atrial and left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures,</b> as estimated by the pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. These tests are invasive, time consuming and carry risk, and are not typically performed in patients admitted with decompensated heart failure [8]. As a result, physicians rely on clinical assessments to diagnose elevated cardiac filling pressures.

40|$|Wedged {{catheter}} pressures (PC) {{were compared}} {{with those in the}} aorta, left atrium, and pul-monary artery before and after production of mitral stenosis, insufficiency, and pulmonary em-bolism. In general it was found that "PC " pressures follow closely changes in left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures</b> even when pulmonary artery pressure changes in an opposite direction (for example, pulmonary embolism). However, properly recorded "PC " pressure pulses did not display the large cyclic pressure variations recorded from the left atrium during mitral stenosis and insufficiency. It is concluded that pressures recorded through a properly wedged catheter represent the constant pulmonary capillary pressure but do not reflect cyclic pressure variations in the left atrium. IN A previous communication 1 experimentalevidence was presented that a catheterproperly wedged into a peripheral pulmon-ary artery records a rather constant pressure, generally a little higher than that in the left atrium. Therefore, such pressures can be fairly taken as an index of pulmonary capillary pres-sure (PCP). However, it was questioned whether phasic left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures</b> can be transmitted through capillaries to such a cath-eter, as others have believed. 2 " 5 Evidence was presented that when phasic systolic variations are recorded through a wedged catheter they are caused by transmission of pulmonary ar-terial pressure to the catheter tip. Instead of giving information regarding left atrial pres-sures they must be regarded as artefacts from improper lodgment of a catheter.

40|$|Angiotensin II (Ang II) and {{atrial natriuretic factor}} (ANF) {{appear to}} act as {{functional}} antagonists in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure. To further define the relations between these hormones in vivo, we investigated the effect of low doses of Ang II (1 - 10 ng/kg/min) on plasma ANF levels. We also evaluated the influence of ANF release on the renal and hormonal responses to ANG II. Studies were performed in anesthetized and conscious instrumented dogs during sustained saline load and converting enzyme inhibition. In the anesthetized dogs, Ang II significantly increased plasma ANF levels and ANF arteriovenous difference without changing either <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures</b> or hematocrit. In both conscious and anesthetized dogs, ANF increases {{were not correlated with}} blood pressure responses to Ang II and did not occur in control groups when Ang II was replaced by vehicle. Ang II-induced sodium retention and stimulation of aldosterone production were attenuated, and renin suppression was enhanced in dogs having the largest changes in plasma ANF in response to converting enzyme inhibition or Ang II. These results demonstrate that in volume-replete dogs Ang II can promote ANF release independently of changes in <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures</b> or systemic hemodynamics, suggesting that Ang II may exert a significant modulatory effect on ANF secretion. The results also show significant relations between ANF and renal and adrenal responses to Ang II, which may suggest that, in turn, endogenous ANF modulates the effects of Ang II...|$|R

The purpose of these experiments was to compare newborn and adult sheep with respect to transvascular filtration of fluid and microvascular permeability to plasma proteins. We prepared the lambs surgically to isolate and collect lung lymph and measure average pulmonary arterial and left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures,</b> allowing at least 2 days for the lambs to recover from surgery before studies began. Lambs had higher pulmonary arterial and left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures,</b> lower lymph and plasma protein concentrations, and 57 % more lymph flow per gram of dry bloodless lung than sheep; the difference in protein flow between lambs and sheep was not significant. Protein concentration in lymph relative to that in plasma was significantly lower in lambs than in sheep; but the ratio of albumin concentration to globulin concentration in both lymph and plasma was almost identical {{in the two groups}} of animals. Extravascular lung water per gram of dry bloodless lung was greater in lambs (4. 82 ± 0. 11 g) than in sheep (4. 45 ± 0. 08 g), but there was no histologic evidence of pulmonary edema in either group of animals. These findings suggest that lambs have more transvascular filtration of fluid per unit lung mass than sheep, but that microvascular sites for protein exchange do not differ appreciably in lambs and sheep. To test this conclusion, we measured steady-state lymph flow in three lambs before and after raising pulmonary microvascular pressure by rapid intravenous infusion of saline. Lymph flow increased {{as a function of the}} net transvascular driving pressure (hydraulic pressure gradient—protein osmotic pressure gradient). This response was almost identical to that of four sheep with pulmonary microvascular pressure augmented by inflation of a balloon in the left atrium. In eight lambs we measured the time for intravenously injected 125 I-albumin to equilibrate in lymph at half the specific activity of plasma: the protein tag equilibrated faster than in sheep. This difference could be explained partly by the higher pulmonary arterial and left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures</b> of lambs than sheep, and possibly by the presence of more microvascular sites for protein exchange relative to the volume of distribution of protein in the lung of the younger animals...|$|R

This study assesses whether pulmonary congestion occurs during ECS with the heart arrested and describes an in vivo method to assess if lungs are suitable for transplantation from DCD donors after ECS resuscitation. Cardiac arrest was induced in 30 kg pigs, followed by 10 min of warm ischemia.

Left <b>atrial</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured as a marker for pulmonary congestion. After 90 min of ECS, lung function was evaluated. Cannulae were placed into the pulmonary artery (PA) and left ventricle (LV). A second pump was included, and ECS was converted to a bi-ventricular (bi-VAD) system. The RVAD drained from the RA and pumped into the PA, and the LVAD drained the LV and pumped into the iliac. This brought the lungs back into circulation for a 1 -hr assessment period.
