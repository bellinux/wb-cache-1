5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do <b>anything.</b> <b>As</b> the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E

5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to film noir as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be no such thing. While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on <b>anything</b> <b>as</b> evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E

25|$|Macleod's party {{chairmanship}} {{coincided with}} Selwyn Lloyd’s tight economic policies, and poor by-election results, most notably Orpington in March 1962.

With the political scandals of 1962-3 (Vassall, Profumo) the Conservatives sank ever lower in the opinion polls.|$|E
25|$|The President is {{responsible}} for the implementation of the constitution, and for the exercise of executive powers in implementing the decrees and general policies as outlined by the Supreme Leader, except for matters directly related to the Supreme Leader, who has the final say in all matters. Unlike the executive in other countries, the President of Iran does not have full control over <b>anything,</b> <b>as</b> these are ultimately {{under the control of the}} Supreme Leader. Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates. The procedures for presidential election and all other elections in Iran are outlined by the Supreme Leader. The President functions as the executive of affairs such as signing treaties and other international agreements, and administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs, all as approved by the Supreme Leader. The President appoints the ministers, subject to the approval of the Parliament, as well as the approval of the Supreme Leader, who can dismiss or reinstate any of the ministers at any time, regardless of the decisions made by the President or the Parliament. The President supervises the Council of Ministers, coordinates government decisions, and selects government policies to be placed before the legislature. The current Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has fired as well as reinstated Council of Ministers members. Eight Vice Presidents serve under the President, as well as a cabinet of twenty-two ministers, who must all be approved by the legislature.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the last}} match before the First Test on the same ground and was played in {{stifling}} heat and humidity. Peter May captained again to give Hutton a rest. Ron Archer, captain of Queensland (the brother of the Australian all-rounder Ken Archer) won the toss and put the MCC in to bat on a good wicket. Reg Simpson opened with 136, but again only two batsman did <b>anything</b> <b>as</b> Denis Compton added 110 runs and everybody else 56. The tourists were 18/3 before the 234 run Simpson-Compton partnership and collapsed from 252/4 to 304 all out thereafter. Ray Lindwall took 4/66, but had to retire because of gastric trouble. Strangely every batsman in the Queensland team except the absent Lindwall got into double figures, {{but none of them}} made fifty and they were out for 288. Mick Harvey made 49 and thrashed a ball into Jim McConnon's groin, a painful injury that put the unlucky spinner out of contention for weeks. Alex Bedser still had his unexplained rash, but bowled 31 eight ball overs for 2/56 and Brian Statham and Trevor Bailey both took 3/74. The MCC made 288 as well in their second innings despite being 8/2 when the makeshift opener Colin Cowdrey and wicket-keeper Keith Andrew batting at number 3 were out for ducks. Simpson made 38, but it was May (77), Compton (69) and Bailey (51 not out) who made the runs as no bowler took more than 2 wickets. There was no time to consider a run chase, but Simpson surprised everybody when his off-spinners took 2/5 to leave Queensland on 25/2.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{the most}} {{significant}} flaw in the constitution left by Augustus concerned the matter of succession. This deadly flaw was violently exposed in the year 69. Augustus had established a standing army, where individual soldiers served under the same military governors in the same provinces {{over an extended period}} of time. The consequence was that the soldiers in the provinces developed a degree of loyalty to their commanders, which they did not have for the emperor. Thus the empire was, in a sense, a union of inchoate principalities, which could have disintegrated at any time. The first indication of a nationalist movement appeared in Gaul (modern France) in 68, but this movement ended when its leader, C. Julius Vindex, was defeated by an army under L. Verginius Rufus. Rufus was the governor of Upper Germany, and while he was declared imperator by his soldiers, he decided not to use his support to march on Rome and make himself emperor. He did not decline this opportunity because he was loyal to the emperor Nero, but rather because of his own low birth, and his belief that his low birth might make it difficult for him to accomplish <b>anything</b> <b>as</b> emperor. Shortly after Rufus had been declared imperator, Ser. Sulpicius Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, was proclaimed emperor by his troops. In Rome, the emperor Nero quickly lost his supporters and committed suicide. Galba, however, did not prove to be a wise leader. He chose to punish Rufus' troops, and to antagonize the Praetorian Guard by not fulfilling promises which had been made to them.|$|E
