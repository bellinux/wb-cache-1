After the 2008 season ended, Tennessee fired head coach Phillip Fulmer and replaced him with Lane Kiffin, who promised to turn the program around. Kiffin made an offseason splash by breaking the social norms among SEC head football coaches and violating a handful of NCAA rules. In a season-opening win over Western Kentucky, Kiffin appeared to have made <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>for</b> Tennessee, as the Volunteers had their largest margin of victory in nine years.|$|E

While the allegations were unfounded, their timing resulted in James being falsely accused of being their source. Hockey Canada officials determined that the rumours were started by a third party attempting to create controversy. They also rejected James' appeal, ending her Olympic dream. Neither her teammates nor her opponents could understand how she was left off the team. Canada and the United States met in the final, as expected, but it was the Americans who emerged victorious. [...] Having already defeated Canada 7–4 in the preliminary round, the Americans won the gold medal with a 3–1 victory.

The coconut trees, with their frivolous elegance, grew thickly on the banks, all clad with trailing plants, and they were reflected in the green water. It was just such a scene as you might see in Devonshire among the hills, and yet with <b>a</b> <b>difference,</b> <b>for</b> it had a tropical richness, a passion, a scented languor which seemed to melt the heart.

The call had had above all the immense luck that it hadn't been noisy--a confusion of underbred sounds; which was very happy, for Mr. Probert was particular in this: he could bear French noise but couldn't for the life of him bear American. As for English he maintained that there was no such thing: England was a country with the straw down in all the thoroughfares of talk. Mr. Dosson had scarcely spoken and yet had remained perfectly placid, which was exactly what Gaston would have chosen. No hauteur could have matched it--he had gone so little out of his way. Francie's lover knew moreover--though he was a little disappointed that no charmed exclamation should have been dropped as they quitted the hotel--that the girl's rare spell had worked: it was impossible the old man shouldn't have liked her.|$|E
60|$|This is an {{assumption}} {{at the back}} of the American mind which makes a great difference in many ways; and in my opinion <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>for</b> the better. I wrote merely fancifully just now about bishops being burglars; but there is a story in New York, illustrating this, which really does in a sense attribute a burglary to a bishop. The story was that an Anglican Lord Spiritual, of the pompous and now rather antiquated school, was pushing open the door of a poor American tenement with all the placid patronage of the squire and rector visiting the cottagers, when a gigantic Irish policeman came round the corner and hit him a crack over the head with a truncheon on the assumption that he was a house-breaker. I hope that those who laugh at the story see that the laugh is not altogether against the policeman; and that it is not only the policeman, but rather the bishop, who had failed to recognise some fine logical distinctions. The bishop, being a learned man, might well be called upon (when he had sufficiently recovered from the knock on the head) to define what is the exact difference between a house-breaker and a home-visitor; and why the home-visitor should not be regarded as a house-breaker when he will not behave as a guest. An impartial intelligence will be much less shocked at the policeman's disrespect for the home-visitor than by the home-visitor's disrespect for the home.|$|E
