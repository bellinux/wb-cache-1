40|$|AbstractValproic acid (VPA) is an <b>anti-convulsant</b> <b>drug</b> that is {{recently}} {{shown to}} have neuroregenerative therapeutic actions. In this study, we investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of VPA {{and its effects on}} Bdnf transcription through microRNAs (miRNAs) and their corresponding target proteins. Using in silico algorithms, we predicted from our miRNA microarray and iTRAQ data that miR- 124 is likely to target at guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha inhibitor 1 (GNAI 1), an adenylate cyclase inhibitor. With the reduction of GNAI 1 mediated by VPA, the cAMP is enhanced to increase Bdnf expression. The levels of GNAI 1 protein and Bdnf mRNA can be manipulated with either miR- 124 mimic or inhibitor. In summary, we have identified a novel molecular mechanism of VPA that induces miR- 124 to repress GNAI 1.

Crystal structure prediction calculations on the 1 : 1 CBZ : DMSO solvate revealed the generation of two similar low energy structures which differ only in the orientation of the DMSO molecules. Analysis of crystal energy landscapes generated at 0 K suggests the possibility of solvent disorder. A combined computational and experimental study of the changes in the orientation of the DMSO within the crystal structure revealed that the nature of the disorder changes with temperature. At low temperature, the DMSO disorder is static whilst at high temperature the DMSO configurations can interconvert by a 180 ° rotation of the DMSO molecules within the lattice. This 180 ° rotation of the DMSO molecules drives a phase change from a high temperature dynamically disordered phase to a low temperature phase with static disorder. Crystallisation of a DMSO solvate of the related molecule epoxycarbamazepine resulted in a different degree of DMSO disorder in the crystal structure, despite the similarity of the carbamazepine and epoxycarbamazepine molecules.

A {{decrease in the number of}} the spike-wave discharges was found after remacemide administration. At the highest dose there was near total suppression of the spike-wave discharges. There were no important effects on behaviour and on spectral content of the background EEG, suggesting that remacemide has little side effects. A decrease in the number of spike-wave discharges was also found after FPL 12495 gavage and there was a prolongation of the mean duration. Behavioural changes were only noticed after the highest dose. These were accompanied by changes in the spectral content and particularly by an increase in the amplitude of the delta and the high beta frequencies, together with a decrease in the spindle frequency range. FPL 12495 appeared to be more potent that remacemide in all its effects. The effects of mainly FPL 12495 are uncommon in the sense that so far no other investigated drug shows a decrease in the number together with an increase in the mean duration of the discharges.

30|$|The new <b>anti-convulsant</b> <b>drug</b> {{gabapentin}} (1 -(aminomethyl)cyclo-hexaneacetic acid) is a GABA analogue. It {{was originally}} {{developed for the}} treatment of epilepsy, and currently, gabapentin is widely used to relieve pain, especially neuropathic pain, it is indicated in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain, also in the treatment of bipolar disorder and may be effective in reducing pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Gabapentin is a ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue that does not bind to GABA receptors or alter GABA metabolism in the brain (Goldlust et al. 1995). Its action is attributed to the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme GABA-transaminase, thus preventing the physiological degradation of GABA in the brain (Ouellet et al. 2001). Analytical methods reported for its determination consist of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Jiang & Li 1999; Tang et al. 1999; Chollet et al. 2000; Ifa et al. 2001; Ratnaraj & Patsalos 1998; Wad & Kramer 1998), spectrofluorimetry (Belal et al. 2002; Hassan et al. 2001), gas chromatography?mass spectrometry (GC?MS) (Kushnir et al. 1999; Van Lentea & Gatautis 1998), capillary electrophoresis (Rada et al. 1998) and spectrophotometry applying Hantzsch reaction (al-Zehouri et al. 2001). So far, no traces of any attempts have been found for determination of gabapentin by colorimetric method and the literature is still starving for such analytical procedures. There are number of methods for determination of gabapentin in literature (Manera et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2004; Jia et al. 2012; Ribeiro et al. 2007; Abdulrahman & Basavaiah 2011; Abdulrahman & Basavaiah 2012; Jalali et al. 2007; Hegde et al. 2009; Patel et al. 2011; Siddiqui et al. 2010).|$|E

It is used for physical dependence to opioids as well as cocaine, nicotine, alcohol and ecstasy dependence. In the present study attempts were made to further identification of the effects of topiramate on the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced conditioned place preference and behavioural sensitisation in mice. Methods: Male Swiss-Webster mice were used. Conditioned place preference and locomotion were assessed by an un-biased place conditioning paradigm and open filed methods. In a pilot study, the effects of morphine and topiramate on place conditioning paradigm as well as locomotion were assessed in morphine-nave animals for evaluation of effective and ineffective doses of the drugs. Different doses of topiramate were injected to the animals 30 min before each morphine injections (acquisition) or 30 min before the experiments were beginning on the test day. Results: Administration of different doses of morphine (0. 5, 5 and 50 mg/kg) induced locomotor activity in the animals. In addition, morphine (1, 10 and 20 mg/kg) administration also induced place preference. On the other hand, administration of different doses of topiramate (20, 80 and 120 mg/kg) neither induced place preference nor altered animals’ activity. Topiramate administration (20 and 80 mg/kg) and (80 and 120 mg/kg) reduced the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced place preference, respectively. In addition, topiramate (20, 80 and 120 mg/kg) reduced the acquisition of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization where as the drug in dose 80 mg/kg enhanced the expression of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. Conclusion: It can be concluded that topirmate administration interacts with the euphoric and locomotor properties of morphine and this can be considered in therapeutic usage of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Epilepsy is {{a chronic}} {{neurological}} disorder which can arise following an initial insult that over time, progresses into a condition characterised by recurrent spontaneous seizures. During a latent {{period between the}} initial insult and the epilepsy condition proper, major changes occur within the brain at both a cellular and molecular level, in {{a process known as}} epileptogenesis. It is postulated that during epileptogenesis, signal transduction pathways are perturbed following the initial insult, which may bring about long term changes in gene expression profiles. For example, the expression of a host of neuropeptides is known to be modulated in response to an initial insult, including the up-regulation of the pro-convulsant tachykinins Substance P and Neurokinin B, encoded by the TAC 1 and TAC 3 genes, respectively. In this thesis I have explored the regulation of both of these genes by two distinct transcription factor (TF) families; the Neuron Restrictive Silencing Factor (NRSF) isoforms, and the Upstream Stimulatory Factor (USF) proteins. I demonstrate that both NRSF and USF variants regulate TAC 3 promoter activity, and that NRSF isoforms can modulate endogenous NKB expression in a human neuroblastoma cell line. Furthermore, these distinct TF families are shown to work in cooperation to regulate the activity of the rat TAC 1 promoter. Thus, both NRSF and USF variants are shown to be important in the regulation of pro-convulsant neuropeptides and as both NRSF and USF proteins {{have been shown to be}} induced by pro-convulsant stresses here, they are potential key TFs in epileptogenesis, responding to an initial insult, and orchestrating downstream gene expression changes. Consistent with such a model, I have also revealed that both NRSF and USF variants are modulated by <b>anti-convulsant</b> <b>drug</b> treatment. Here, three distinct anti-convulsant drugs, were found to differentially modulate the expression of both the full-length NRSF, and its truncated isoform, as well as the USF proteins USF 1 and USF 2. Furthermore, whilst the drugs had limited impact upon the localisation of these TFs in human neuroblastoma cells, they did affect the binding of these TFs to target DNA sequences, particularly NRSF binding to its recognition DNA sequence, the NRSE, in a number of genes. In addition, due to an increasingly appreciation of the role of cocaine and the dopaminergic pathways in seizure progression, I explored the impact of cocaine treatment on the expression of these TFs. Cocaine was found to modulate both NRSF and USF variant expression, and NRSF binding to target DNA sequences. These findings suggest that both NRSF and USF variants are important in epileptogenesis and are targets for modulation by the anti-convulsant drugs investigated here. To further explore the significance of NRSF expression in seizure progression, I explored the impact of over-expression of NRSF isoforms, modelling that which occurs in response to seizure in animal models, on global gene expression pathways. I reveal that NRSF isoform over-expression significantly modulates the expression of a host of genes with known associations with epilepsy, supporting a model that NRSF isoforms are key TFs which respond to the initial insult and coordinate long-term changes in gene expression. These findings may help our understanding of the molecular mechanisms at work during epileptogenesis, and may better our understanding of the progression of epilepsy.

We described a simplified procedure for assay of 5, 5 -diphenylhydantoin (DPH) in plasma (1), by using a modification of the benzophenone procedure originally developed by Wallace et al. (2). However, relatively poor sensitivity was obtained because ultraviolet absorbance was determined. When benzophenone is treated with coned H 2 S 04, a fluorescence develops {{that can be used for}} assay of DPH. In this report this sensitive modification is reported and applied.

40|$|Galvanically {{coupling}} enzymatic bioelectrodes {{with drug}} loaded conducting polymers {{to develop a}} controlled drug delivery system is investigated. The system {{is designed to be}} a novel and sophisticated approach to in vivo drug delivery for the treatment of epilepsy. There is a suite of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that are extremely effective at suppressing seizure activity however; their use is restricted due to debilitating side effects. As such, it is of interest to develop novel drug release methods to deliver the AEDs directly to the target area in the brain and in small doses to minimise, and ideally eliminate, the side effects. The significance of using an enzymatic power source lies in its ability to operate off simple sugars naturally present in the human body. Additionally, the on/off switching behaviour of the conducting polymer, polypyrrole (PPy), can be accessed to release the drug when the oxidation state of the polymer is changed. By exposing the glucose oxidase (GOx) bioelectrode to glucose in solution, the catalytic current generated can be harnessed to charge the polymer and instigate drug release on cue. Experiments were carried out to develop and characterise GOx bioelectrodes based on a direct electron transfer (DET) mechanism facilitated by carbon nanomaterials, namely multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Chapter 3 investigates the development of solvated graphene electrodes (SGE), a hydrogel-like system based on graphene, with immobilised GOx. It is proven through biological protein and kinetic assays that the GOx is stable within the graphene structures and the electrodes can be reproducibly fabricated. Through electrochemical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, impedance, amperometry and fourier transform alternating current voltammetry, it was revealed, however, that the enzyme is not electrically wired to the solvated graphene matrix, and as such, cannot directly transfer the electrons generated from the oxidation of glucose to the nanostructured electrode. As a result of its inability to access the catalytic current, no useable charge is generated and the structures cannot be used to power drug release from a conducting polymer scaffold. In Chapter 4, aqueous dispersions of rGO and MWNT are fabricated through a modified chemical reduction method. The significant advantage of the method developed is the omission of any stabilizing compound or organic solvent to obtain stable rGO-MWNT dispersions. Significantly biological entities, such as GOx, can be successfully incorporated into the dispersion. These dispersions were characterised using XPS, SEM, zeta potential and particle size measurements which showed that the dispersion stability is not sacrificed with the addition of GOx, and significantly, the electrical properties of the rGO and MWNTs are maintained. In this study, rGO acts as an effective dispersing agent for MWNTs and does not affect the solubility or electroactivity of the GOx. Bioelectrodes fabricated from these rGO-MWNT-GOx dispersions were characterised electrochemically to test their feasibility in facilitating direct electron transfer (DET) from the redox centre of the enzyme to the electrode. The DET results showed that the specific catalytic current generated at an optimized rGO-MWNT-GOx electrode was 72 μA/μg GOx, which is 3 times more efficient than other literature values for similar systems. The remarkable specific catalytic current {{can be attributed to the}} use of purified enzyme, the efficiency of charge transfer within the rGO-MWNT composite and the ability of the electrode to facilitate direct electron transfer. The optimised electrode developed and characterised in Chapter 4 is used in Chapter 5 to power the release of drug from PPy. The release of the anti-inflammatory drug, Dexamethasone- 21 -phosphate (DEX), and the <b>anti-convulsant</b> <b>drug,</b> Fosphenytoin (FOS), from PPy films are characterised in Chapter 5. This work investigates, for the first time, the controlled release of FOS from a conducting polymer and galvanically connects the optimised rGO-MWNT-GOx bioelectrode (presented in Chapter 4) to drive the release, also the first of its kind. When the two half cells are connected and the conditions are changed in the bioelectrode cell from 0 mM to 150 mM glucose, there is an increase in the charging current generated, as a result of the additional catalytic current. A corresponding increase in the rate of FOS released was measured in the release cell from 24 to 47 ng/mL. This result shows that the concept of galvanically coupling enzyme-based bioelectrodes with drug loaded conducting polymers to fabricate a controlled drug delivery device is valid...|$|E

After the internal standard, prazepam, is added, the serum is directly extracted with diethyl ether, the ex-tract is evaporated, the residue is dissolved in ethanol, and the drug is measured by gas-liquid chromatography, with use of an electron capture detector. With this procedure, 2. 5 ng of diazepam in the sample can be speedily mea-sured with specificity, accuracy, and reproducibility (CV = 4. 5 %). AdditionalKeyphrases:pediatric chemistry. drug assay monitoring therapy Diazepam is widely used as an adjuvant to anticonvulsant therapy. Information on the concentrations in blood of <b>anti-convulsant</b> <b>drugs</b> are of clinical value {{in the management of}} epilepsy. We propose here a very rapid and simple micro-method for determining diazepam. Only gas-liquid chromatographic methods involving the use ofan electron capture detector are adapted to therapeutic ranges of this drug. Methods for determining benzodiazepine without hydrolysis have already been published. Some authors (1, 2) report time-consuming methods with multiple extrac-tions with ether. Howard et al. (3) use a simple extraction technique,but the diazepam curve is nonlinear, and the pro-cedure requires 1 or 2 ml of plasma, which is too much in the case of neonates. Others (4, 5) determine this drug in a 100 -pl sample after extraction with benzene. The toxicity of the solvent, the addition of the internal standard just before the injection,and the poor linearityare the main disadvantages. Scagliola (6) describes a technique for use with a 100 -pl sample but with multiple extraction steps. The micromethod we propose involves direct determination of the compound in a 100 -pl plasma sample, with only one extraction step. Sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility are excellent, and the method is suitable for use in routine analysis...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of animal}} models has furthered our {{understanding}} of mechanisms underpinning cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP). Cancer-induced bone pain is a unique pain state with mechanisms akin to those of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. I aim to highlight the role of both neuronal and non-neuronal mechanisms in a rat model of cancer-induced bone pain (MRMT- 1). <b>Anti-convulsant</b> <b>drugs</b> are useful {{in the treatment of}} neuropathic pain and {{have been shown to be}} effective in animal models of inflammatory pain. Carbamazepine reduced neuronal excitability seen at time of peak behaviour after MRMT- 1 but not sham injection, highlighting the possible role of sodium channel activity in maintaining the neuronal excitability in cancer-induced bone pain. Furthermore carbamazepine reduced pain-like ipsilateral hypersensitivity after MRMT- 1 injection in awake animals further indicating the usefulness of sodium channel antagonism in cancer-induced bone pain. Peptidergic C fibre population, which co-express calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) and the receptor for nerve growth factor trkA, carry sensory information from bone. It is for these reasons that modulation of CGRP signalling in the MRMT- 1 model of cancer-induced bone pain has been investigated using "drug X" (donated from Pfizer UK) which interrupts CGRP signalling in nociceptive pathways. Subcutaneous administration of drug X reduced ipsilateral pain-like behaviours seen following MRMT- 1 injection, suggesting that CGRP antagonism may be a useful target in the treatment of cancer-induced bone pain. Microglia have been implicated in the pathophysiology underlying neuropathic pain and have become activated in models of cancer-induced bone pain. OX 42 labelled microglial in the lumbar dorsal horn ipsilateral to MRMT- 1 increase between days 5 and 11 post surgery. Microglial inhibition using minocycline between days 0 and 9 but not between days 5 and 9 post-MRMT- 1 injection delays pain-like behaviour in the post-operative period, indicating that early microgliosis is key in the initiation of cancer-induced bone pain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{reports the}} {{recommendations}} of the Scientific Department of Cognitive Neurology and Aging of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Brazil, with special focus on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). It constitutes a revision and broadening of the 2005 guidelines based on a consensus involving researchers (physicians and non-physicians) in the field. The authors carried out a search of articles published since 2005 on the MEDLINE, LILACS and Cochrane Library databases. The search criteria were pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of AD. Studies retrieved were categorized into four classes, and evidence into four levels, based on the 2008 recommendations of the American Academy of Neurology. The recommendations on therapy are pertinent to the dementia phase of AD. Recommendations are proposed for the treatment of BPSD encompassing both pharmacological (including acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, neuroleptics, anti-depressives, benzodiazepines, <b>anti-convulsants</b> plus other <b>drugs</b> and substances) and non-pharmacological (including education-based interventions, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, music therapy, therapy using light, massage and art therapy) approaches.
