25|$|Pteridophytes, like fern, on {{the other}} hand, do not possess a {{multicellular}} apical meristem. They possess a tetrahedral <b>apical</b> <b>cell,</b> which goes on to form the plant body. Any somatic mutation in this cell can lead to hereditary transmission of that mutation. The earliest meristem-like organization is seen in an algal organism from group Charales that has a single dividing cell at the tip, much like the pteridophytes, yet simpler.|$|E
25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} {{leads to}} acetylcholine (ACh) release onto the salivary acinar cells. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors, specifically M3, and causes an increased intracellular calcium ion concentration (through the IP3/DAG second messenger system). Increased calcium causes vesicles within the cells to fuse with the <b>apical</b> <b>cell</b> membrane leading to secretion. ACh also causes the salivary gland to release kallikrein, an enzyme that converts kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin. Lysyl-bradykinin acts upon {{blood vessels and}} capillaries of the salivary gland to generate vasodilation and increased capillary permeability respectively. The resulting increased {{blood flow to the}} acini allows production of more saliva. In addition, Substance P can bind to Tachykinin NK-1 receptors leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequently increased saliva secretion. Lastly, both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous stimulation can lead to myoepithelium contraction which causes the expulsion of secretions from the secretory acinus into the ducts and eventually to the oral cavity.|$|E
50|$|Growth in most {{brown algae}} {{occurs at the}} tips of {{structures}} {{as a result of}} divisions in a single <b>apical</b> <b>cell</b> or in a row of such cells. As this <b>apical</b> <b>cell</b> divides, the new cells that it produces develop into all the tissues of the alga. Branchings and other lateral structures appear when the <b>apical</b> <b>cell</b> divides to produce two new apical cells. However, a few groups (such as Ectocarpus) grow by a diffuse, unlocalized production of new cells that can occur anywhere on the thallus.|$|E

After 20 min of exposure to 50 μM Al (pH 4. 2) {{a slight increase in}} [Ca 2 +]cyt of root <b>apical</b> <b>cells</b> was observed, while the response of [Ca 2 +]cyt to 100 μM Al (pH 4. 2) was faster and larger ([Ca 2 +]cyt increased by 46 % in 10 min). Increases in [Ca 2 +]cyt were correlated with inhibition of root growth, generally measurable after 2 h. Addition of 400 μM malic acid (pH 4. 2) largely ameliorated the effect of 100 μM Al on [Ca 2 +]cyt in root <b>apical</b> <b>cells</b> and protected root growth from Al toxicity. These results suggest that an increase in [Ca 2 +]cyt in root <b>apical</b> <b>cells</b> in rye is an early effect of Al toxicity and is followed by the secondary effect on root elongation...|$|R

40|$|When BRK 1, {{a member}} of the Wave/SCAR complex, is deleted in Physcomitrella patens (Dbrk 1), we report a {{striking}} reduction of filament growth resulting in smaller and fewer cells with misplaced cross walls compared with the normal protonemal cells. Using an inducible green fluorescent protein–talin to detect actin in living tissue, a characteristic broad accumulation of actin is observed at the tip of wild-type <b>apical</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas in Dbrk 1, smaller, more distinct foci of actin are present. Insertion of brk 1 -yfp into Dbrk 1 rescues the mutant phenotype and results in BRK 1 being localized only in the tip of <b>apical</b> <b>cells,</b> the exclusive site of cell extension and division in the filament. Like BRK 1, ARPC 4 and At RABA 4 d are normally localized at the tip of <b>apical</b> <b>cells</b> and their localization is correlated with rapid tip growth in filaments. However, neither marker accumulates in <b>apical</b> <b>cells</b> of Dbrk 1 filaments. Although the Dbrk 1 phenotypes in protonema are severe, the leafy shoots or gametophores are normally shaped but stunted. These and other results suggest that BRK 1 functions directly or indirectly in the selective accumulation/stabilization of actin and other proteins required for polar cell growth of filaments but not for the basic structure of the gametophore...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMembrane potentials, input resistances, and {{electric}} coupling in the apical parts of N. crassa growing hyphae were recorded {{with the aid}} of intracellular microelectrodes. It was revealed that the <b>apical</b> <b>cells</b> were always depolarized by 10 to 30 mV as compared to the adjacent proximal cells. The septal pore maintained an electrical resistance of 4 to 6 MΩ. The calculated values of the endogenous electrical current passing through the septal pore varied between 0. 5 and 1 nA. Electrical isolation of the <b>apical</b> <b>cells</b> resulted in their depolarization from 120 – 150 mV to 40 – 60 mV, characteristics of the membrane potential value of N. crassa adult hyphae with completely blocked electrogenic pumps. A simultaneous increase in the input resistance value from 15 – 20 MΩ to 40 – 80 MΩ was observed. The above data can be explained assuming that H+-ATPase activity was greatly lowered in the <b>apical</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus in the intact hyphae with electrically coupled cells energy is transferred from the proximal hyphal compartments to the apical ones...|$|R

To determine whether other components become redistributed laterally or axially, the apical 35 micrometers of both vertical and horizontal <b>apical</b> <b>cells</b> were compared stereologically using transmission electron microscopy. Reorientation to the horizontal changed the longitudinal distributions of tubular ER, Golgi stacks, and vesicles but not cisternal ER, mitochondria, and plastids. Only plastids showed a statistically significant lateral redistribution after horizontal placement. Qualitative examination of the sedimentation zone showed plastids sedimented close to peripherally located ER with vacuoles displaced above plastids.
