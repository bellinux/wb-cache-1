In order to adjust an intensity {{profile of the}} X-ray beam, an X-ray <b>absorbing</b> <b>liquid</b> is transported to filter elements of the X-ray filter. Such transport is susceptible to gravitational forces which lead to an irregular hydrostatic pressure distribution in the X-ray filter.

Derivation of a simple equation for determining Γ is presented.

40|$|AbstractMicro-encapsulated Carbon Sorbents (MECS) are a {{new class}} of carbon capture {{materials}} consisting of a CO 2 - <b>absorbing</b> <b>liquid</b> solvent contained within solid, CO 2 -permeable, polymer shells. MECS enhance the rate of CO 2 absorption for solvents with slow kinetics and prevent solid precipitates from scaling and fouling equipment, two factors that have previously limited the use of sodium carbonate solution for carbon capture. Here, we examine the thermodynamics of sodium carbonate slurries for carbon capture. We model the vapour-liquid-solid equilibria of sodium carbonate and find several features that can contribute to an energy-efficient capture process: very high CO 2 pressures in stripping conditions, relatively low water vapour pressures in stripping conditions, and good swing capacity. The potential energy savings compared with an MEA system are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Stone sealing is the {{application}} of a surface treatment to products constructed of natural stone to retard staining and corrosion. All bulk natural stone is riddled with interconnected capillary channels that permit penetration by liquids and gases. This is true for igneous rock types such as granite and basalt, metamorphic rocks such as marble and slate, and sedimentary rocks such as limestone, travertine, and sandstone. These porous channels act like a sponge, and capillary action draws in liquids over time, along with any dissolved salts and other solutes. Very porous stone, such as sandstone <b>absorb</b> <b>liquids</b> relatively quickly, while denser igneous stones such as granite are significantly less porous; they absorb smaller volumes, and more slowly, especially when <b>absorbing</b> viscous <b>liquids.</b>|$|R
