5|$|The first {{astronomer}} {{to record}} {{observations of the}} comet was W. H. Finlay, the Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory in Cape Town, South Africa.

5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and <b>a</b> <b>tail</b> varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and <b>a</b> <b>tail</b> posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is <b>a</b> <b>tail</b> which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with <b>a</b> <b>tail</b> 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers {{was not able to}} start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took it to his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and <b>a</b> <b>tail</b> that might end with a snake's head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E
5|$|Each somite, or body segment {{can bear}} {{a pair of}} appendages: on the {{segments}} of the head, these include two pairs of antennae, the mandibles and maxillae; the thoracic segments bear legs, which may be specialised as pereiopods (walking legs) and maxillipeds (feeding legs). The abdomen bears pleopods, and ends in a telson, which bears the anus, and is often flanked by uropods to form <b>a</b> <b>tail</b> fan. The number and variety of appendages in different crustaceans may be {{partly responsible for the}} group's success.|$|E

Others may wear accessories such as ears or <b>a</b> <b>tail,</b> particularly outside the main convention area. Nearly all will wear one or more custom convention badges featuring a depiction of their anthropomorphic persona, some with attached ribbons providing an indicator of social status, such as a notice of affiliation, or sponsorship of the convention.

5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have <b>a</b> <b>tail</b> fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of <b>a</b> <b>tail</b> conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
40|$|Six {{new species}} of Fergusobia, from large multilocular shoot bud galls on two species of Angophora and four species of Eucalyptus from both subgenera Eucalyptus and Symphyomyrtus, are described.

Fergusobia diversifoliae Davies n. sp. has a C-shaped parthenogenetic female with <b>a</b> conoid <b>tail,</b> <b>an</b> arcuate infective female with <b>a</b> hemispherical <b>tail</b> tip, and <b>an</b> arcuate, C- or J-shaped male with angular spicule and a long peloderan bursa.

An inventory of all known Fergusobia/Fergusonina associations from terminal shoot bud galls is presented. The larval shield morphology of the associated mutualistic Fergusonina species is discussed where known. Analyses of DNA sequences of D 2 /D 3 and COI suggested that the six new species are distributed between three clades of Fergusobia.
