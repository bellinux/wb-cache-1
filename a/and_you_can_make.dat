500|$|Several {{songs on}} the album are about the themes of love & relationships. These tracks are based on reality, but {{according}} to Martin, they were written with a fictional twist: [...] "Songs are like fairy tales: they have a beginning and an end <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it all work perfectly. Real life doesn't work like that".|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] {{begins with a}} four-chord {{arpeggio}} sequence. It has [...] "catchy" [...] melody phrases during the verses and a synth trumpet {{at the end of}} the first chorus, as well as Armstrong's strings present in the background. It also contains sustained notes on the instrumental sections, a characteristic for the songs on Ray of Light. Doubled acoustic guitar chords give an organic vibe during the beginning of the second verse, following a brief coda. The song also infuses computer blips and techno effect sounds, which Orbit achieved by using a Korg MS-20 analog synthesizer. The producer explained that [...] "here's something about [...] transient peaks that are very spiky. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> that machine scream. Its two filters are very severe".|$|E
500|$|Independent Film, Holley's debut solo album, was self-released by {{the singer}} in 2008. Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{described}} the album {{as being a}} [...] "soul-satisfying project that won't pay the bills". It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops {{on the art of}} audition. He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what I want to let people know is {{that there are so many}} jobs out there. My thinking is, if you're a musician <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> music instead of digging a ditch, make it." ...|$|E

500|$|Victorin Hulot {{is later}} visited by the Prince of Wissembourg, who {{delivers}} news of economic good fortune. The Marshal, {{prior to his}} death, had made arrangements for repayment of the Baron's debts, as well as employment for Adeline in a Catholic charity. Baron Hulot has disappeared, and Adeline spends her free time searching for him in houses of ill repute. She eventually finds him living with a fifteen-year-old courtesan, and begs {{him to return to}} the family. He agrees, but as he climbs into the carriage, Hulot asks: [...] "mais pourrai-je emmener la petite?" [...] ("But can I take the girl?") The Hulot home is reunited for a time, and Bette's fury at their apparent happiness hastens her death. One evening after the funeral, Adeline overhears Hulot seducing a kitchen maid named Agathe. On her deathbed, Adeline delivers her first rebuke to her husband: [...] "ans un moment, tu seras libre, et tu pourras faire une baronne Hulot." [...] ("In a moment, you will be free, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> another Baroness Hulot.") Soon after burying his wife, Hulot marries Agathe.|$|E
500|$|IGNs Dan Stapleton liked Marcus Holloway {{more than}} Aiden Pearce {{of the first}} game, and {{similarly}} appreciated the supporting characters of DedSec. Marcus' penchant for moral integrity was a noticeable contradiction for Stapleton, though, {{in light of the}} prospect to have him kill innocent people if one so chooses. Therefore, the character's personality was observed as the only preclusion to violence and an axiomatic push toward the stealth approach, which Stapleton insisted was the most accommodating of available tools. Writing for Polygon, Philip Kollar saw that Watch Dogs 2 could appeal to those able to connect with [...] "being young, angry at the system and certain that you know what's best for the world". Its tongue-in-cheek demeanor was said to naturally coincide with the hacker culture and open world genre. San Francisco – the spaces of which were described as [...] "cleverly designed" [...] – never felt overwhelming in size to Kollar but inspired joy as he took advantage of the immediate ability to explore it entirely. His complaints concerned firearms; their use was considered [...] "a complete failure of imagination" [...] and unbelievable from the members of DedSec—"an Anonymous-esque group of peaceful hacktivists". Alice Bell of VideoGamer.com wrote in her verdict, [...] "Watch Dogs 2 is missing a bit of refinement ... but joining DedSec is still a riot and a half. It's high energy fun with engaging characters, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> an entire city your playground".|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, pro wrestling podcaster Peter Rosenberg stated, to {{agreement}} from veteran wrestler Shawn Michaels, that, [...] "You add up all {{the things}} that he was capable of, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a case that there was no one better than 'Macho Man'." [...] Also that year, Kevin Eck of The Baltimore Sun lauded Savage as an all-round performer, saying that [...] "nobody blended power, speed, agility, and technical skills like the 'Macho Man' in his prime".|$|E
