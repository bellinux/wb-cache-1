Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what {{it is like to be}} <b>a</b> certain <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> creature and find problems with them all.

Skepticism about the existence of something that it is like to be an F is recommended...|$|R
