5|$|Each species entry {{begins on}} a new page; any spaces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> entries are filled with tail-pieces, small, often humorous woodcuts of country life. British Birds remains in print, and has {{attracted}} the attention of authors such as Jenny Uglow. Critics note Bewick's skill as a naturalist as well as an engraver.|$|E
5|$|Paint {{samples were}} {{analysed}} and {{photographs from the}} time of opening consulted, and the bridge was restored to its original appearance. The main body of the bridge was painted in dark green, with the spandrels decorated in gilding. The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the bridge. A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected {{at the north end of}} the bridge in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E

5|$|The deck of {{the bridge}} was formed by pre-casting {{individual}} concrete units on the southern river shore, then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the spans. The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6,000 cars per hour in each direction, over {{a total of six}} traffic lanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{transcribed}} pre-mRNA contains untranslated regions at {{both ends}} which contain a ribosome binding site, terminator and start and stop codons. In addition, most eukaryotic open reading frames contain untranslated introns which are removed before the exons are translated. The sequences <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the introns, dictate the splice sites to generate the final mature mRNA which encodes the protein or RNA product.|$|E
5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of cracks in the piers was undertaken. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> {{the linear}} {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions {{is to allow}} the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3â€² ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Every {{window in}} the church {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single lancets, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch of an older window well above.|$|E

5|$|In hindsight, Callaghan {{was criticized}} for not putting his five ships that had the {{superior}} SG radar systems <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> his column, for not using one of them as his flagship, for directing the battle from his flagship's bridge instead of the radar plot, for not issuing his battle plans to his captains, and for issuing confusing orders during the battle. Analysis of the battle led to a rapid improvement in USN techniques for fighting in poor visibility, particularly in the adoption of combat information centers.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} born {{in mind that the}} {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections. It is usual to provide half half-sections <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the filter with m = 0.6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a resistive termination.|$|E
5|$|RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a {{specialized}} class of polymerases that copy {{the sequence of}} an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|E

5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in {{the richness of}} their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|The main portion (the center) {{contains}} the entrance, facing west. To its {{left is the}} chapel and to its right is the schoolroom. Both rooms originally were smaller, with bedrooms located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> building, but a 1910 restoration eliminated those walls to enlarge the rooms. Two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen (which was added at a later date), and the servants' dining room are in the north wing, while the south wing has three bedrooms and the family dining room. The house is topped by a cupola from which bullfights and festivals in the adjacent plaza could be seen.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the arms, each one made of 80â€“200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
