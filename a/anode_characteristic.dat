5000|$|... #Caption: Typical pentode <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic.</b> There is a {{wide range}} of anode {{voltages}} in which the characteristic has a small positive slope. In a screen-grid tube this region is restricted to a much narrower range at high anode voltages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason for}} the limited {{applicability}} of the screen-grid valve, and its rapid replacement by the RF pentode (introduced around 1930) was the peculiar <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> (i.e. variation of anode current with respect to anode voltage) of the former type of tube.In normal applications, the anode voltage was about 150V, while that of the screen-grid was about 60V (Thrower p 183). [...] As the screen grid is positive {{with respect to the}} cathode, it collects a certain fraction (perhaps a quarter) of the electrons which would otherwise pass from the grid region to the anode. This causes current to flow in the screen grid circuit. Usually, the screen current due to this cause is small, and of little interest. However, if the anode voltage should be below that of the screen, the screen grid can also collect secondary electrons ejected from the anode by the impact of the energetic primary electrons. Both effects tend to reduce the anode current. If the anode voltage is increased from a low value, with the screen grid at its normal operating voltage (60V, say) the anode current initially increases rapidly because more of those electrons which pass through the screen-grid are collected by the anode rather than passing back to the screen grid. This part of the tetrode <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> resembles the corresponding part of that of a triode or pentode. However, when the anode voltage is increased further, the electrons arriving at the anode have sufficient energy to cause copious secondary emission, and many of these secondary electrons will be captured by the screen, which is at a higher positive voltage than the anode. This causes the anode current to fall rather than increase when the anode voltage is increased. In some cases the anode current can actually become negative (current flows out of the anode); this is possible since each primary electron may produce more than one secondary. Falling positive anode current accompanied by rising anode voltage gives the <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> a region of negative slope, and this corresponds to a negative resistance which can cause instability in certain circuits. In a higher range of anode voltage, the anode voltage sufficiently exceeds that of the screen for an increasing proportion of the secondary electrons to be attracted back to the anode, so the anode current increases once more, and the slope of the <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> becomes positive again. In a yet higher range of anode voltages, the anode current becomes substantially constant, since all of the secondary electrons now return to the anode, and the main control of current through the tube is the voltage of the control grid. This is the normal operating mode of the tube.|$|E

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the <b>anode</b> current <b>characteristics</b> obtained in the famous Franck-Hertz experiment of 1914 led to the verification of Bohr's predictions of quantised atomic states. This fundamental experiment has been often repeated, and nowadays is generally {{part of the curriculum}} in modern physics education. However, the {{interpretation of}} the experiment is typically based upon significant simplifying assumptions, some quite unrealistic. This is the case especially in relation to the kinetics of the electron gas, which is in reality quite complex, due mainly to non-uniformities in the electric field, caused by a combination of accelerating and retarding components. This non-uniformity leads to a potential energy valley in which the electrons are trapped. The present state of understanding of such effects, and their influence upon the <b>anode</b> <b>characteristics,</b> is quite unsatisfactory. In this article a rigorous study of a cylindrical Franck-Hertz experiment is presented, using mercury vapour, the aim being to reveal and explain what really happens with the electrons under realistic experimental conditions. In particular, the <b>anode</b> current <b>characteristics</b> are investigated over a range of mercury vapour pressures appropriate to the experiment to clearly elaborate the effects of elastic collisions (ignored in typical discussions) on the power budget, and the trapping of electrons in the potential energy valley...|$|R
50|$|The {{overall effect}} of the {{original}} developments was to produce a highly effective power amplifier tube, whose <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{is very much like}} that of a pentode, but which has greater efficiency as a result of reduced screen current. A further bonus was that third harmonic distortion was much reduced relative to a comparable pentode (Terman pp 198-9). Beam tetrode audio power output valves were introduced in 1937, and quickly replaced conventional pentodes in this application. Later developments produced beam power tubes which were capable of high-power output at frequencies extending into the UHF region.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach to the}} problem of eliminating the tetrode kink was introduced by Hivac in 1935. It was found by J.H Owen Harries that if the separation of the anode from the screen grid were varied, a critical separation could be found (about 3 cm) where the kink in the tetrode's <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> disappeared, and the amplification of the valve became particularly distortion-free. Both fidelity and efficiency exceeded those of the available pentodes of the time. A range of tetrodes of this type were introduced, aimed at the domestic receiver market, some having 2V directly heated filaments, intended for low-power battery-operated sets, others with 4V or higher, indirectly heated cathodes for mains operation. Output powers ranged from 0.5W to 11.5W [...] Confusingly, several of these new valves bore the same type number as existing pentodes with almost identical characteristics. Examples include Y220 (0.5W, 2V filament), AC/Y (3W, 4V heater), AC/Q (11.5W, 4V heater), etc.|$|E
50|$|However, the tetrode kink {{limits the}} {{permissible}} variation of anode voltage, and restricts {{the use of}} screen-grid valves to small-signal applications. The suppressor grid of the pentode eliminates the kink in the <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> by preventing secondary electrons, which originate in the anode, from reaching the screen grid, and thus permits a wider excursion of anode voltage, as is required for power amplification. The same effect can be produced {{in the case of}} a tetrode by introducing two modifications. Firstly, the wires of the screen grid are aligned with those of the control grid so that the former lie in the electron 'shadow' created by the latter. This reduces the screen grid current, thereby giving greater efficiency, and also concentrates the electrons into dense beams in the space between the screen grid and the anode. The intense negative space charge of these beams prevents secondary electrons from the anode from reaching the screen grid, thus eliminated the tetrode kink. Secondly, in small valves whose electrode structure is supported in the conventional way with vertical wire rods and mica spacers, it was found to be necessary to introduce sheet-metal beam-forming electrodes between the screen grid and the anode. The purpose of these beam-plates is to constrain the electron beams into parts of the electrode system which are sections of a cylinder. (See sectional view, right). Successful creation of the electron beam between screen grid and anode required for a kinkless <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> depends on the details of the geometry of the electrode structure of the beam tetrode. In the cases where the electrodes have complete cylindrical symmetry, a kinkless characteristic can be achieved without the need for beam-plates, alignment of the screen grid wires with those of the control grid being sufficient. This form of construction is usually adopted in the larger tubes with an anode power rating of 100W or more. The Eimac 4CX250B (rated at 250W anode dissipation) is an example of this class of beam tetrode. Note that a radically different approach is taken to the design of the support system for the electrodes in these types (see illustration). The 4CX250B is described by its manufacturer as a 'radial beam tetrode', drawing attention to the symmetry of its electrode system.|$|E

After recalling the principle of an inductive plasma torch, different electrical variants of a COLPITTS are given. All these variants led to a unique simplified electrical scheme which is analysed with power electronic notions and also by taking in account the simplified <b>anode</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the triode. This leads to analytical explicit to expressions of all electrical values, showing two different possible working ratings of the triode, depending {{on the value of}} the electrical charge of the generator. At last, a numerical application on a given triode type shows how the application of this method, by determination of all the electrical values, gives a good knowledge of the right working conditions for a given application...|$|R
40|$|Roll-to-roll gravure {{printing}} is considered as potential leading manufacturing technology for flexible, low cost and large area optoelectronics. However, solution processed multilayer organic electronics are still challenging to be produced, {{especially in the}} case of electrodes.

The device performances were found to be similar to those of a reference device containing a spin-coated polymeric anode.

50|$|The {{design is}} today {{known as the}} beam tetrode but {{historically}} was {{also known as a}} kinkless tetrode, since it is a four-electrode device without the negative resistance kink in the anode current vs <b>anode</b> voltage <b>characteristic</b> curves of a true tetrode. Some authorities, notably outside the United Kingdom, argue that the beam plates constitute a fifth electrode.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a screen-grid valve is thus quite {{unlike that}} of a triode. It {{includes}} a range of anode voltages, where the anode voltage is {{less than that of}} the screen grid, {{in which there is a}} distinctive negative resistance characteristic, sometimes called [...] "tetrode kink". This is usually undesirable, although it can be exploited as in the dynatron oscillator (Eastman, p 431). The approximately constant-current region of low slope at high anode voltage is also a distinctive characteristic of the tetrode. This is highly desirable, since it corresponds to a high source resistance in the anode circuit, and greatly enhances the voltage gain which the device can produce. Early screen-grid valves had amplification factors (i.e. the product of transconductance and anode slope resistance) ten times that of comparable small-signal triodes. [...] The high anode resistance (i.e. low slope) in the normal operating range is a consequence of the electrostatic shielding action of the screen grid, since it prevents the electric field due to the anode from penetrating to the control grid region, where it might otherwise influence the passage of electrons, increasing the electron current when the anode voltage is high, reducing it when low.In practice the negative-resistance kink of the <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> limits the usefulness of the screen-grid valve to applications where only small signals are amplified, so that the variations in anode voltage are also correspondingly small, and the operating conditions never depart from the region of high positive impedance (low positive slope) at large anode voltage. The secondary emission can be prevented from contributing to the screen current (and thus detracting from the anode current) by adding a suppressor grid, making a pentode, or beam plates to make a beam tetrode/kinkless tetrode, which can be used in power amplifiers where the variations of anode voltage, due to the presence of a large signal voltage, are much greater. The anode characteristics of these tubes are very similar to pentodes. In both cases the anode current rises rapidly to an approximately constant value when the anode voltage rises to as little as a few tens of volts, and the region of high positive anode resistance (low slope) extends from this low value up to the maximum anode voltage which could be several hundred volts or more.|$|E
40|$|The Itrax core scanner {{provides}} rapid, high resolution, non-destructive sediment {{core analysis}} using x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry and x-radiography. The effect of varying instrument settings are explored. Effects of sample properties on XRF data are tested and the uncertainty in XRF data is considered. Existing methods of quantifying XRF data are evaluated. Comparisons {{are made with}} other XRF micro-scanners. Finally, the x-radiographic capability of the Itrax core scanner is compared to x-ray computed tomography. Itrax XRF data is generally optimised by use of a 30 kV x-ray tube voltage. Current should be set as high as possible without generation of sum peaks (30 mA is often a good value). A chromium anode tube is suitable for use with most samples. Water content has a diluting effect on detected peak areas, but it is shown that the effect can be corrected, removing an obstacle to quantification of Itrax data. Water content can be determined non-destructively from the ratio of incoherent to coherent scatter of characteristic radiation from the x-ray tube anode. Surface slope can change recorded peak areas, but a simple model is developed to correct for this effect. Surface roughness increases variability in data and, if the scale of roughness {{is similar to the}} beam size, elemental peak areas may be reduced. The presence of a mixture of grain sizes greatly reduces peak areas for elements in the larger grains. The uncertainty in Itrax data is found to be higher than suggested by the conventional estimate that uncertainty is equal to the square root of the peak area. This information is vital for researchers to decide what significance they should attach to variations in Itrax elemental profiles. Quantification methods for core scanner XRF data are compared and an approach using log-ratio transformations determined to be the best. Additionally, an improved entirely non-destructive, quantification approach is presented in which explicit corrections are made for the diluting effect of water (water content may determined from the ratio of incoherent and coherent scatter of the tube <b>anode</b> <b>characteristic</b> radiation). Compared to similar instruments, the Itrax core scanner is more tolerant of surface imperfections. Its x-radiographic scanning helps to determine the significance and extent of features revealed in XRF data. Itrax x-radiography provides no match for the level of detail that can be obtained using x-ray computed tomography and is not readily quantified. It does however provide information on features below the sample surface and, in masking small variations, can make the main core features more apparent. Users of the Itrax core scanner are provided with quantification of known effects (water content, surface slope; x-ray tube, current and voltage) and are alerted to issues that were not previously widely known (mixing of grain sizes, size of uncertainty in data). The areas of effective use and limitations of the Itrax core scanner are set out and recommendations made for optimising results. An optimal quantification method is identified. Many of the conclusions may have relevance to other XRF core scanners. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Cathodic {{protection}} of concrete structure is gaining {{more and more}} importance. Though the impressed current system is being widely used, sacrificial anode system is also gaining ground. It {{is well known that}} alloys of zinc, aluminium and magnesium are the candidate materials for use as sacrificial anodes. However, very little work has been done for evaluating their utility as compared with that done for utilizing impressed current system. In the present work cathodic {{protection of}} embedded steel reinforcement bars has been achieved by utilizing a suitable magnesium alloy anode, which is manufactured based on indigenous technology (CECRI know-how). The potential of the embedded steel and the current flowing between the anode and the embedded steel were monitored over a period of one year, in conventional M 20 (1 : 2 : 4 WIC 0. 5) concrete.

40|$|The anode {{boundary}} layer in atmospheric pressure arc discharges is studied numerically {{on the basis}} of the hydrodynamic (diffusion) equations for plasma components. The governing equations are formulated in a unified manner without the assumptions of thermal equilibrium, ionization equilibrium or quasi-neutrality. For comparison, a quasi-neutral model of the anode layer is also considered. The numerical computations are performed for an argon arc at typical values of the current density in anode layers (500 – 2000 A cm− 2). The results of numerical modelling show that the common collisionless model of the sheath fails to describe the sheath region for the problem under consideration. For this reason, a detailed analysis of the anode sheath is performed using the results of unified modelling. In addition, the distributions of plasma parameters in the anode layer are analysed and the basic characteristics of the layer (anode voltage drop, sheath voltage drop, anode layer thickness, sheath thickness, heat flux to the anode) are calculated. Our results are found to be in good agreement with the existing theoretical predictions and experimental data.

40|$|Power {{generation}} under environmentally friendlier {{and more}} efficient cycles has caused {{a great interest in}} alternative fuels and power sources. Currently, electrical power is mainly provided by traditional power generation cycles which generate air pollutant such as sulfur and noxious compounds. A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an energy conversion device that has the potential to efficiently generate electricity in an environmentally-friendly manner. The SOFCs generally operate between 600 °C and 1000 °C by oxidizing hydrogen or other fuels using air as the oxidant. A typical anode-supported SOFC is made from a dense yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, a porous lanthanum strontium manganate cathode, and a porous nickel/YSZ cermet anode. Surveying the published works on SOFCs especially during the last couple of decades shows that the main challenges for anode-supported SOFCs are in finding suitable fabrication methods and in tailoring the desired microstructural properties. The aim of this research is to investigate both fabrication and microstructural properties of SOFC anodes in order to quantify the influential processing parameters using both experimental and modeling approaches. Controlling the rheological behavior of ceramic slurries is an important step in the casting process to achieve improved micro-structural properties. The rheological behavior of ceramic slurries containing nickel oxide (NiO) /YSZ was investigated in a colloidal casting method (so-called drying-free casting method) in order to study the effects of solid loading fraction and dispersant concentration on the viscosity of anode slurries. The drying-free casting method offers more flexibility in controlling the microstructure of ceramics and eliminates defects compared with conventional casting processes. A new viscosity correlation for ceramic suspensions was proposed to predict the relative viscosity data, showing excellent agreement with the experimental data from this study and with reported data in literature for other ceramic systems. In addition, microstructural features and functional properties of the anodes significantly affect the electrochemical performance of the anode-supported SOFCs. The SOFC <b>anode</b> <b>characteristics</b> and properties including porosity and pore size distribution, sintering shrinkage, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity were investigated using an integrated experimental approach by adding carbon micro-spheres (CMSs) powders as the pore-former. The anode porosity was modeled to differentiate the impacts of processing parameters such as fabrication pressure (under uniaxial compaction condition), pore-former loading fraction, and particle size ratio. The results of this study can be used to interpret the physical basis of pore formation and also to assist in fabrication of SOFC porous ceramic substrates with desired microstructural characteristics. To evaluate the effect of anode microstructural properties on the cell electrochemical behavior, a number of anode-supported SOFCs were fabricated by depositing YSZ electrolyte thin film using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and integrating LSM/YSZ cathode layer using slurry brush-painting method. The applied EPD technique was theoretically formulated and compared with the experimental results that showed a linear deposition behavior for YSZ especially at initial deposition period. The cell polarization behavior was also investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis over the fabricated NiO/YSZ-YSZ bi-layers. The results were used to determine the ohmic, polarization, and area specific resistance (ASR) behavior of the fabricated half cells. The SOFCs fabricated by controlling anode porosity to be in the range of 35 % to 40 % showed higher electrochemical performance...|$|R

To this end, a voting-based method able to detect elliptical arcs on the image plane is used to locate accurately anodes along the pipeline. Three dimensional (3 D) geometric information about the scene, e. g., 3 D equations of the pipeline borders, is used to reduce from 5 to 2 the dimensions of the parametric space needed for ellipse detection. Then, among the instances of detected ellipses on the image plane, false elliptical arcs, which are not compatible with the 3 D scene geometry, are eliminated.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of current sheet canting in pulsed electromagnetic accelerators is {{the departure of}} the plasma sheet (that carries the current) from a plane that is perpendicular to the electrodes to one that is skewed (or tipped), which negatively impacts accelerator efciency. In the present study, it is postulated that depletion of plasma near the anode, which results from axial density gradient induced diamagnetic drift, occurs during {{the early stages of the}} discharge, creating a density gradient normal to the <b>anode,</b> with a <b>characteristic</b> length on the order of the ion skin depth. Rapid penetration of the magnetic eld through this region ensues, due to the Hall effect, leading to a canted current front ahead of the initial current con-duction channel. Once the current sheet reaches appreciable speeds, entrainment of stationary propellant replenishes plasma in the anode region, inhibiting further Hall-convective transport of the magnetic eld; however, the previously established tilted current sheet continues to drive plasma toward the cathode and accumulate it there. This proposed sequence of events has been incorporated into a phenomenological model. The model predicts that canting can be reduced by using low atomic mass propellants with high propellant loading number density; the model results are shown to give good agreement with experimen-tally measured canting angle mass dependence trends...|$|R
30|$|Electrode {{materials}} {{have a great}} impact on the performance of MFCs. Since cathodes and <b>anodes</b> have different <b>characteristics,</b> the materials and design for them also differ. In general, electrode materials are considered in terms of surface area, electronic conductivity, chemical stability, cost and accessibility. In addition, an anode material should be biocompatible to allow microorganisms to grow. Materials with cell toxicity cannot be used regardless of their other properties. Carbon-based materials are widely used because of their high conductivity, biocompatibility, chemical stability as well as low cost. Furthermore, the surface treatment of the anode leads to a better performance of the MFC. On the other hand, the cathode materials require enhanced catalytic properties due to the poor kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction. Even though platinum is the best catalyst, research is ongoing to find alternative materials due to its high cost, making it unfeasible to implement in commercial applications. Transition metal oxides such as manganese oxide, nitrogen-doped carbon-based {{materials have}} emerged as promising materials for ORR with low cost. Due to a lack of sustainable catalytic materials, microorganisms can also be used as catalysts, which is termed as a biocathode. In the future, microorganisms can be manipulated to increase their endogenous mediators for improved electron transfer. Lastly, a better understanding of microorganism interactions with electrode surfaces will be helpful to optimize the performance of the MFCs.|$|R

Large Stark shifts within 0. 5 mm of the anode indicate the LiF emits with a finite field threshold rather than with Child- Langmuir-type emission, and the small slope in the electric field indicates an unexpected build-up of electrons near the anode. In the diode gap, we aim to unfold fields to quantify the time-dependent ion and electron space-charge distributions that determine the ion beam properties. Observed electric field non-uniformities give local beam deflections that can be comparable to the total beam microdivergence. We are implementing active laser absorption and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy on low-density Na atoms injected into the diode gap prior to the power pulse. The small Doppler broadening in the Na spectra should allow simultaneous electric and magnetic field mapping with improved spatial resolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{chlorine}} {{for water and}} waste treatment is increasing because of the increase of water consump-tion, {{a large amount of}} waste water discharge, and gov-ernmental regulations. Transportat ion and handl ing of chlorine cyl inders and containers are strictly control led to avoid hazard. As a result, on-site electrolytic product ion of hypochlor ite becomes important for disinfection of drinking water, oxidation of sewage, chlorination of cool-ing water in process plants, and other uses. There are now a number of publications and patents on hypochlorite cells and the electrodes to be used (1 - 13). A hypochlor i te cell must be s imple in operation with min imum maintenance for a year or more. The energy consumption is also an important factor. In an electric power station located by the sea, saline water containing some 3 % NaC 1 is fed to the hypochlorite cell and is chlor inated prior to being sent to the heat ex-changers in the plant. Because of the low salt concentra-tion, oxygen evolut ion occurs, and this reduces chlorine current efficiency. Also, sea water contains Mg and Ca ions, which deposit at the cathode, result ing in high cell voltage. Per iodic acid cleaning removes the scale, but af-fects the electrodes, especially the anode coating, and in some cases the electrode activity is not restored. Pretreatment of sea water prior to electrolysis is prefer-able, but it is expensive and complicated. Therefore, du-rable <b>anodes</b> having such <b>characteristics</b> as low chlorine overvoltage and high oxygen overvoltage in sea water must be developed to improve the operating performance of hypochlorite cells...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis evaluates the potential of electrodynamic tether (EDT) propulsion technology to provide picosatellites (100 g– 1 kg) and femtosatellites (< 100 g) with orbital maneuvering capability. The miniaturized EDT concept considered in this dissertation is a fundamentally novel paradigm because it is much shorter than a conventional EDT, with total length of about 10 meters, and it considers {{the use of a}} semi-rigid tether. A detailed trade study is presented that explores the feasibility of using EDTs for small satellite drag make-up and propulsion. The trade study includes the development of a system concept and mission scenario. Three example small spacecraft were considered in this study: a 200 -g planar picosat, a 150 -g cubic picosat, and a 10 -g "ChipSat. " The results reveal that an insulated tether only a few meters long can provide these spacecraft with complete drag cancellation and the ability to change orbit. All of the spacecraft were able to generate a thrust force that exceeded drag at 500 km and 600 km, assuming a circular, equatorial orbit. EDT thrust estimates were made for a set of particular, but representative, cases and a few simplifying assumptions were made to facilitate estimating tether current. In order to evaluate electron current collection, ground-based plasma experiments were conducted to capture key characteristics of the satellite-low-Earth-orbit (LEO) interaction. Tests were performed to investigate current collection in a flowing plasma and observe changes in collection due to (a) probe orientation relative to plasma flow and (b) magnetic field strength. The laboratory data were analyzed to develop expressions for the current collection behavior of picosats and femtosats. The data indicated that the WLP-based collection model could be refined with small modification to the thrust estimates. It was also determined that the <b>anode's</b> current collection <b>characteristic</b> would be impacted by the orientation of the spacecraft relative to the magnetic field and the direction of motion depending on the shape of the anode...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to show that {{scattered}} radiation in the backward direction can be used as an additional source of material-specific information about a sample measured simultaneously to a primary method in the fOlWard direction, e. g. X-ray diffraction imaging. Many applications for material and structural discrimination employing X-ray scattering and absorption collimate the emitted radiation in a defined direction. Scattered radiation into other directions often remains disregarded or is shielded. The major physical effects characterising the backward-scattered spectra are, besides attenuation, Compton shift and material-specific Doppler broadening of the photon spectrum in the sample. The shape of a Compton-broadened peak can reveal information about the electron momentum of an element or, even to some extent, of a chemical compound. Since most applications utilises polychromatic X-ray sources the focus of this work was the analysis of Compton scattered <b>characteristic</b> <b>anode</b> peaks from sample materials. The multiplet structure of these characteristic peaks superimposed to a broad Bremsstrahlung spectrum is challenging for peak-shape analysis. The initial part of this work was the design and characterisation of an experimental set-up for measuring energy-resolved Compton scattered spectra of sample materials. Subsequently different calculation models were developed for describing the broadening of the characteristic lines of the anode material. These models were adapted to the specific experimental conditions. Essentially, two types of methods were considered. The first calculation procedure evaluated scattered spectra based on tabulated materialspecific Compton profiles. The second model was a phenomenological approach. It fitted a function consisting of Gaussian curves above a linearly approximated background to the curvature of the 2 nd derivative of the Compton spectrum. These models were experimentally validated on Compton profiles of a variety of sample materials containing period 2 and period 3 elements. It was proven that in principle comparing measured spectra with calculated spectra provides high material differentiation capabilities, but for most molecules tabulated Compton profiles are not available and the independent atom approximation causes deviations. The phenomenological method employed extracted Gaussian curve fit-parameters to distinguish measured materials quantitatively. Most of the samples could be distinguished from each other based on their profile structure. A principal component analysis of corrected spectra provided an alternative approach and showed capabilities to separate scatter-spectra of different materials. In principle, more sample-specific information valuable for material separation could be extracted as compared to a simple integration method of backscattered radiation.

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cells}} (PEFC) convert the chemically bound energy in a fuel, e. g. hydrogen, directly into electricity by an electrochemical process. Examples of future applications are energy conversion such as {{combined heat and power}} generation (CHP), {{zero emission vehicles}} (ZEV) and consumer electronics. One of the key components in the PEFC is the membrane / electrode assembly (MEA). Both the membrane and the electrodes consist of proton conducting polymers (ionomers). In the membrane, properties such as gas permeability, high proton conductivity and sufficient mechanical and chemical stability are of crucial importance. In the electrodes, the morphology and electrochemical characteristics are strongly affected by the ionomer content. The primary purpose of the present thesis was to develop experimental techniques and to use them to characterise proton conducting polymers and membranes for PEFC applications electrochemically at, or close to, fuel cell operating conditions. The work presented ranges from polymer synthesis to electrochemical characterisation of the MEA performance. The use of a sulfonated dendritic polymer as the acidic component in proton conducting membranes was demonstrated. Proton conducting membranes were prepared by chemical cross-linking or in conjunction with a basic functionalised polymer, PSU-pyridine, to produce acid-base blend membranes. In order to study gas permeability a new in-situ method based on cylindrical microelectrodes was developed. An advantage of this method is that the measurements can be carried out at close to real fuel cell operating conditions, at elevated temperature and a wide range of relative humidities. The durability testing of membranes for use in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) has been studied in situ by a combination of galvanostatic steady-state and electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS). Long-term experiments have been compared to fast ex situ testing in 3 % H 2 O 2 solution. For the direct assessment of membrane degradation, micro-Raman spectroscopy and determination of ion exchange capacity (IEC) have been used. PVDF-based membranes, radiation grafted with styrene and sulfonated, were used as model membranes. The influence of ionomer content on the structure and electrochemical characteristics of Nafion-based PEFC cathodes was also demonstrated. The electrodes were thoroughly investigated using various materials and electrochemical characterisation techniques. Electrodes having medium Nafion contents (35 45 wt %), the cathode becomes limited by diffusion of O 2 both in the agglomerates and throughout the cathode. Furthermore, models for the membrane coupled with kinetics for the hydrogen electrode, including water concentration dependence, were developed. The models were experimentally validated using a new reference electrode approach. The membrane, as well as the hydrogen <b>anode</b> and cathode <b>characteristics,</b> was studied experimentally using steady-state measurements, current interrupt and EIS. Data obtained with the experiments were in good agreement with the modelled results. QC 2010101...|$|R
