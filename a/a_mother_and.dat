5|$|Violet Clay (1978) and <b>A</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> Two Daughters (1982) {{are each}} about an {{unmarried}} protagonist's career in a creative profession. In <b>A</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> Two Daughters {{the main character}} resists the temptation {{to get married and}} chooses instead to focus on her work. <b>A</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> Two Daughters and A Southern Family (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic class and the cultural differences between generations. Many characters struggle to reduce the gap between the rich and poor or try to break free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|Angelou {{does not}} begin to create her own {{narrative}} until The Heart of a Woman, which depends less upon the conventions of fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. The Heart of a Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> her success as a performer.|$|E

The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729.

5|$|In {{the five}} years that take place between seasons four and five, Susan and Mike are {{involved}} in a car crash that kills <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> her daughter.

Susan feels incredibly guilty for taking the lives of Lila (Marie Caldare) and Paige Dash (Madeleine Michelle Dunn), but Mike insists it was not their fault. The argument over the topic becomes so great that it results in divorce. Giving up on love, Susan engages in a casual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold).|$|E
5|$|Lessons for Children is {{a series}} of four age-adapted reading primers written by the {{prominent}} 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential pedagogy in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.|$|E

5|$|Motherhood, a theme {{throughout}} Angelou's autobiographies, {{becomes more}} complex in The Heart of a Woman. Although Guy {{struggles with the}} developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close. Many years of experience as <b>a</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> her success as a writer, actress, and activist, enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity, professionally and as a mother. Her self-assurance becomes {{a major part of}} her personality. Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him {{at the end of her}} previous autobiography that they would never be separated again. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.|$|E

Along his path, he meets Vasilisa and Lukerya, <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> her daughter who {{have both been}} widowed.

The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
