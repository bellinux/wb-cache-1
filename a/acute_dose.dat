High <b>acute</b> <b>doses</b> of ethanol (8 or 6 g/kg b. wt.) administered by gavage significantly inhibited the breakdown of PO 1 YPhOSPhOinOSItIdeS as judged by an ele-vation in the concentration as well as the labeling of these compounds. Concomitantly, there was a significant reduction in the level of diacyiglycerols. Low <b>acute</b> <b>doses</b> of ethanol (2 g/kg b. wt.) did not seem to have any effects on the basal levels or labeling of these compounds. The changes in polyphosphoino-sitide labeling due to ethanol intoxication were reverted to near control values when animals regained their righting reflex (ap-proximately 4 hr).

50|$|Assessing {{the risk}} of {{radiation}} at low doses (<100 mSv) and low dose rates (<0.1 mSv.min−1) is highly problematic and controversial. While epidemiological studies on populations of people exposed to an <b>acute</b> <b>dose</b> of high level radiation such as Japanese Atomic Bomb Survivors (hibakusha (被爆者)) have robustly upheld the LNT (mean dose ~210 mSv), studies involving low doses and low dose rates have failed to detect any increased cancer rate. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high (~42 of 100 people will be diagnosed in their lifetime) and it fluctuates ~40% because of lifestyle and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low level radiation. Epidemiological studies maybe capable of detecting elevated cancer rates as low as 1.2 to 1.3 i.e. 20% to 30% increase. But for low doses (1-100 mSv) the predicted elevated risks are only 1.001 to 1.04 and excess cancer cases, if present, cannot be detected due to confounding factors, errors and biases.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to {{most studies}} {{focusing}} on the nucleus accumbens, Febo et al. suggested that the reward brain circuitry {{is not the only}} system involved in addictive behaviors. Previous knowledge has suggested that stimulants induce changes in gene expression in the main parts of mesolimbic circuitry (including the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex) and play a big role in development and maintenance of addicted state and chromatin remodeling. They applied this knowledge to investigate whether these gene expression changes are involved in cocaine related behavioral and molecular adaptations. They found unexpected patterns of brain activation in awake rats that were exposed to sodium butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor (or HDACi). An <b>acute</b> <b>dose</b> resulted in widespread BOLD (blood-oxygen-level dependent) activation in the forebrain and midbrain, but cocaine-induced activation was significantly attenuated after repeat exposure. Sodium butyrate co-treatment with cocaine restored pronounced BOLD activation after successive cocaine treatments. These suggest that the brain’s initial response to repeat cocaine exposure triggers a desensitization mechanism which can be overturned by pretreatment with sodium butyrate. The neural circuitry for the epigenetic modifications contributing to cocaine sensitivity was not the limited to the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system (“reward system”) as they expected. Instead, they saw corticolimbic circuitry (implicated in emotion and memory) had a bigger role in HDACi related alterations of reward behaviors. Evidence that HDACi-mediated enhancement of a stimulant’s sensitizing effects is context specific, and involves associative learning.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} chromosome exchanges induced in human cells by 7 different energies of protons (5 MeV to 2. 5 GeV) with LET values ranging from 0. 2 to 8 keV/m. Human lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro and chromosome damage {{was assessed using}} three-color {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) chromosome painting in chemically-condensed chromosomes collected during the first cell division post-irradiation.

5000|$|The {{comparison}} in {{the table}} below is only meant to give approximate indications of radioresistance for different species and should be taken with great caution. There are generally big differences in radioresistance for one species among experiments, due to the way radiation affects living tissues and to different experimental conditions. We should for example consider that because radiation impedes cell division, immature organisms are less resistant to radiations than adults, and adults are sterilized at doses much lower than that necessary to kill them. For example, for the insect parasitoid Habrobracon hebetor, the LD50 for haploid embryo during cleavage (1-3 hours of age) is 200 R, but about 4 hours later it is of 7,000 R (for X-ray intensity of 110 R/minute), and haploid (= male) embryos are more resistant than diploid (= female) embryos. The mortality of adults H. hebetor exposed to a dose of 180,250 R is the same to this of a non-irradiated control group (food was not provided to either groups) (for 6,000 R/minute). However, a lower dose of 102,000 R (for 6,000 R/minute) is sufficient to induce a state of lethargy in H. hebetor that is manifested by a complete cessation of activity, including cessation of feeding, and these individuals eventually let themselves starve to death. And an even lower dose of 4,858 R (for 2,650 R/minute) is sufficient to sterilize adult female H. hebetor (sterility arises 3 days post-exposure). Other important factors that influence the level of radioresistance include: The length of time during which a dose of radiation is delivered—with doses delivered during longer periods, or at time intervals, being associated with greatly reduced negative effects;The feeding state of individuals—with pre-fed and post-fed individuals being more resistant to radiations compared to starved individuals; The type of radiation used (e.g., tardigrades Milnesium tardigradum irradiated with heavy ions have a higher survival than when irradiated with gamma rays, for a same irradiation dose); The physiological state of individuals (e.g., the tardigrade species Richtersius coronifer and Milnesium tardigradum are more resistant to gamma-ray radiation when in the hydrated state, and Macrobiotus areolatus is more resistant to X-ray radiation when in the anhydrobiotic state). The way lethality is measured is also source of variation for the estimated radioresistance of a species. Irradiated specimens are not instantly killed, unless exposed to a very high dose (<b>acute</b> <b>dose).</b> Therefore, irradiated specimens die over {{a certain period of}} time and lower irradiation doses correspond to longer survival. This means that the radiation dose LD50 fluctuates with the time at which it is measured. For example, the β radiation dose that causes 50% mortality in the American cockroach at 25 days post-exposure is 5,700 R, but to reach 50% mortality at 3 days post-exposure, 45,610 R are needed. 25 days can represent a long survival period for short lived species, such as insects, but would represent a very short survival time for long lived species, such as mammals, so comparing survival of different species after the same amount of time post-exposure also poses some challenges of interpretation. These examples illustrate the many issues associated with comparison of radioresistance among species and the need for caution when doing so. ∗ While an LD50 has been reported for wild type C. elegans individuals, an upper lethal limit has not been established, rather [...] "nearly all animals were alive with no indication of excess lethality up to 800 Gy, the highest dose... measured." ...|$|E
