40|$|In this paper, the {{electromagnetic}} scattering solution for a grass blade with complex cross-section geometry is considered. It {{is assumed that}} the blade cross section is electrically small, but its length is large compared to the incident wavelength. In a recent study {{it has been shown}} that the scattering solution for such problems, in the form of a polarizability tensor, can be obtained using the low-frequency approximation in conjunction with the method of moments. In addition, the study shows that the relationship between the polarizability tensor of a dielectric cylinder and its dielectric constant can be approximated by a simple algebraic expression. The results of this study are used to show that this <b>algebraic</b> <b>approximation</b> is valid also for cylinders with cross sections the shape of grass blades, providing that proper values am selected for each of three constants appearing in the expression. These constants are dependent on cylinder shape, and if the relationship between the constants and the three parameters describing a grass blade shape can be determined, an <b>algebraic</b> <b>approximation</b> relating polarizability tensor to blade shape, as well as dielectric constant, can be formed. Since the elements of the polarizability tensor are dependent on only these parameters, this <b>algebraic</b> <b>approximation</b> can replace the cumbersome method of moments model. A conjugate gradient method is then implemented to correctly determine the three constants of the <b>algebraic</b> <b>approximation</b> for each blade shape. A third-order polynomial fit to the data is then determined for each constant, thus providing a complete analytic replacement to the numerical (moment method) scattering model.
