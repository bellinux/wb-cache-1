Her mother was a devout Catholic, but her father also taught the children about Voltairian rationality. The family was secluded in Pohrebyszcze, with only occasional trips away. Once a year, the family visited Kiev for a market gathering, during which Rzewuski sold grain and her mother purchased clothing and supplies for the estate.|$|E

25|$|Cultural/traditional {{practices}} do not favour girl’s education. Girls only represent 20% {{of pupils}} in {{primary and secondary}} schools (forced and early marriage plays important role). Some parents refused daughters school because they could learn <b>about</b> <b>family</b> planning and contraception and other ways of critical thinking. However girls {{are more willing to}} partake in learning because education is a means to free themselves from family oppression. There is a rule requiring boys and girls to eat together at school. This has encouraged the coeducational idea, in sharp contrast to traditional practice, particularly for the Sudanese.|$|E
25|$|In the new DuckTales, Scrooge {{is played}} by Scottish actor David Tennant, who brings both the nephews and Donald into his {{home at the end}} of the series premier. This series {{indicates}} that Scrooge previously adventured with his nephew Donald and his niece Della Duck, but an event ten years prior to the start of the series resulted in Scrooge and Donald severing ties. He seems to have a rather negative attitude <b>about</b> <b>family</b> as a result, and is initially uninterested in spending time with the boys until they assist him in a couple of adventures.|$|E
25|$|Throughout centuries, non-Visayan groups, {{most notably}} foreigners {{such as the}} Chinese, have settled in predominantly-Visayan cities in Visayas like Iloilo, Bacolod, Dumaguete and Cebu and Mindanao such as Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Davao and General Santos. These Filipino-Chinese have been assimilated to {{mainstream}} society. One factor would be {{the limited number of}} Chinese schools in the Visayas which help maintain the Chinese identity and a stronger sense of a distinct community. Many of them, particularly the younger generation, have been de-cultured from Chinese traditions, share values <b>about</b> <b>family</b> and friends with other Filipinos, and do not write or speak Chinese well.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that Facebook causes {{negative}} effects on self-esteem by triggering feelings of envy, with vacation and holiday photos proving {{to be the largest}} resentment triggers. Other prevalent causes of envy include posts by friends <b>about</b> <b>family</b> happiness and images of physical beauty—such envious feelings leave people lonely and dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook, and another study by Utah Valley University found that college students felt worse about their own lives following an increase in {{the amount of time spent}} on Facebook.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} feminists of the twentieth century, Friedan (in addition to many others) opposed equating feminism with lesbianism. As early as 1964, very early in the movement, and only a year after the publication of The Feminine Mystique, Friedan appeared on television to address the fact the media was, at that point, trying to dismiss the movement as a joke and centering argument and debate around whether or not to wear bras and other issues considered ridiculous. In 1982, during the second wave, she wrote a book for the post-feminist 1980s called The Second Stage, <b>about</b> <b>family</b> life, premised on women having conquered social and legal obstacles.|$|E
25|$|The {{societal}} {{acceptance of}} birth control required the separation of sexual activity from procreation, making birth control a highly controversial subject in some countries at some points in the 20th century. Birth control also became a major theme in feminist politics; reproduction issues were cited as examples of women's powerlessness to exercise their rights. Starting in the 1930s and intensifying in the '60s and'70s, the birth control movement advocated for the legalisation of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments. In a broader context birth control became an arena for conflict between liberal and conservative values, raising questions <b>about</b> <b>family,</b> personal freedom, state intervention, religion in politics, sexual morality and social welfare.|$|E

25|$|The Morelands {{have spoken}} to journalists, {{including}} Edward R. Murrow, <b>about</b> <b>family</b> life in a lighthouse that was still, at the time, a half-mile from the nearest land. The Coast Guard supplied them with water, so they no longer needed {{to rely on the}} cistern, although it was still kept full. It was necessary {{to go back to the}} land at least every two days for milk, and they bought groceries every two weeks. The couple could never go out together as one of them had to remain at the lighthouse at all times. During one power outage, Richard Moreland hung an emergency kerosene lamp in the lantern house and rang the fog bell himself.|$|E
25|$|Mantegna's {{most famous}} {{work is the}} {{interior}} decoration of the Camera degli Sposi for the Gonzaga family in Mantua, dated about 1470. The walls are frescoed with scenes {{of the life of}} the Gonzaga family, talking, greeting a younger son and his tutor on their return from Rome, preparing for a hunt and other such scenes that make no obvious reference to matters historic, literary, philosophic or religious. They are remarkable for simply being <b>about</b> <b>family</b> life. The one concession is the scattering of jolly winged cherubs who hold up plaques and garlands and clamber on the illusionistic pierced balustrade that surrounds a trompe l'oeil view of the sky that decks the ceiling of the chamber.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, {{the arrival}} of Channel 4, and its edgy new soap opera Brookside, {{was one of the}} biggest changes for Coronation Street. Unlike Coronation Street, which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, Brookside brought {{together}} working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in Coronation Street were largely <b>about</b> <b>family</b> affairs, Brookside concentrated on social affairs such as industrial action, unemployment, and the black market. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, EastEnders in 1985. Like Brookside, EastEnders had a more gritty premise than Coronation Street, although unlike Brookside it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.|$|E
25|$|Following the Korean Air 801 crash, it {{was brought}} to the NTSB's {{attention}} that foreign carriers flying {{in and out of the}} US were not covered by the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 and Korean Air did not have a plan to deal with the situation they encountered. As a result, US Congress passed the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act of 1997 to require those carriers to file family assistance plans and fulfill the same family support requirements as domestic airlines. Not only does the Act ensure that all victims and family members will be treated equitably, regardless of the carrier they use, it also impels many carriers that may not have thought <b>about</b> <b>family</b> assistance issues to give them due consideration in their emergency response plans.|$|E

25|$|Konkani Plays, {{known as}} Tiatr, {{a form of}} classic stage {{performance}} with live singing and acting, were written and staged in Goa. The form evolved in the 20th century with pioneer tiatrists such as Jao Agostinho Fernandes (1871–1941). Tiatr's themes include melodramas <b>about</b> <b>family</b> and domestic life, with each lyricist offering his own explanation for life's varied problems. Tiatrists include Prince Jacob and Roseferns, {{and in the past}} M. Boyer, C. Alvares, and Alfred Rose. On 17 April 1982 the first tiatr Italian Bhurgo by Lucasinho Ribeiro was staged in Mumbai. In 2007, the Government of Goa started the Tiatr Academy to facilitate the development of the Tiart. The tradition Of Voviyo, ancient folk songs that were sung by women during a Ros, began prior to 1510A.D. The tradition had to be discarded due to Portuguese prosecution, and the songs now live in the form of archives. The few which still prevail are recited to this day at weddings, expressing lofty sentiments that give vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families and invoke the blessing of God on them like machlies.|$|E
