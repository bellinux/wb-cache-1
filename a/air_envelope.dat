40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{numerical}} thermal analysis of two details of facade element Qbiss Air is performed. Qbiss Air {{is a new}} aesthetic facade element with low heat transfer coefficient and is being produced by Trimo d. d. from Trebnje. The two details are: detail panel-window and detail parapet. Numerical analysis is performed in steady state and in two dimensions. In the detail panel-window thermal analysis is performed for two different variants of the geometrical model {{and the results are}} compared. Analysis of the details is performed in computer program Ansys 13. 0 using meshes with high densities and elements such as three and six node triangles and four and eight node quadrilaterals. Meshes with high density are used to determine heat diffusion through different parts of the panel that consists of different materials. The impact of number and shape of finite elements on the results is being studied. Ansys discretization error algorithm and Ansys quality mesh metrics are presented. In special chapter the basics of steady state thermal analysis with finite element method is presented. The results of analysis are temperatures and heat fluxes for a particular mesh and are presented in graphic form with added commentary. In the end of the thesis the results of numerical analysis are being calculated to recover thermal coupling coefficient, linear thermal transmittance and temperature factor at the internal surface, as dictated by the standard ISO EN 10211. These can be used to determine heat losses for buildings with Qbiss <b>Air</b> <b>envelope...</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} thermal and energy {{performance}} of two wineries {{in the province}} of Mendoza, Argentina (32 ° 40 ’ S, 68 ° 51 ’ W, 750 m above sea level). The grape harvesting period (February–March) was selected for analysis because cooling demand at that time is higher: tons of hot raw material (at approximately 26 - 30 °C) enter the wineries to be processed at 8 °C, while outdoor temperatures are around 38 °C. The selected wineries have similar-sized buildings and the same quantity and quality of production, but different management and envelope materiality. Winery P was built with walls of traditional bricks, single pane windows and a metal roof with thermal insulation; while winery H´s walls were partially built of reinforced concrete panels with thermal insulation, insulated metal roofs and double pane windows. <b>Air,</b> <b>envelope</b> surface, relative humidity and solar radiation temperatures were measured in situ and studied in relation to the energy consumption records of each winery. Then, with the data obtained, a model was generated with Energy Plus software, which was used to simulate envelope improvement alternatives. As a result, both wineries showed improved performance. The temperatures measured in winery P reached an average of 18. 89 °C without the use of auxiliary energy. In the case of winery H, temperatures were optimized, thereby achieving an average of 21. 77 °C, once again without the use of auxiliary energy. Moreover, it is possible to integrate night ventilation strategies using outdoor temperatures that decrease 9. 78 °C in the period analyzed. The thermal and energy refurbishment proposal, which integrates building and envelope improvements, results in minimum indoor temperatures of 15. 65 °C without the use of auxiliary energy [...] optimal for wine production...|$|E

50|$|The name Cloudhopper {{is often}} used to refer to a one-person hot air balloon where the pilot sits in a harness or small seat. There is often a propane tank behind the pilot's back, and the burner is on a frame above the pilot's head.

50|$|The {{direction}} of flight {{depends on the}} wind, but the altitude of the balloon can be controlled by changing {{the temperature of the}} <b>air</b> inside the <b>envelope.</b> The pilot may open one or more burner blast valves to increase the temperature inside the envelope, thereby increasing lift, and thus ascend or slow or stop a descent. The pilot may also open a vent, if the envelope is so equipped, to let hot air escape, decreasing the temperature inside the envelope, thereby decreasing lift, and thus descend or slow or stop an ascent. Unless the pilot intervenes, the <b>air</b> inside the <b>envelope</b> will slowly cool, by seepage or by contact with cooler outside air, and slowly provide less lift.|$|R

25|$|Two of the {{passengers}} jumped from the balloon to avoid the fire, falling ten metres to their deaths below. As the fire intensified, it caused the air inside the balloon to heat and force it to rise. Eventually, the conductor wire on the power line snapped, sending the balloon shooting upwards.

40|$|A {{computer}} modeling {{process of}} three-dimensional forced convection proceeding from computation of thermodynamic parameters of pneumo basic buildings (pneumo supported structures) is presented. The mathematical model of numerical computation method of temperature and velocity fields, pressure {{profile in the}} object is developed using the package Solid works and is provided by grid methods on specified software. Special Navier–Stokes, Clapeyron–Mendeleev, continuity and thermal-conductivity equations are used to calculate parameters in the building with four supply and exhaust channels. Differential equations are presented by algebraic equation systems, initial-boundary conditions are changed by differential conditions for mesh functions and their solutions are performed by algebraic operations. In this article the following is demonstrated: in pneumo basic buildings convective and heat flows are identical structures near the surfaces in unlimited space, but in single-multiply shells (envelopes) circulation lines take place, geometrical sizes of which depend on thermal-physical characteristics of gas(air) in envelopes, radiation reaction with heated surfaces of envelopes with  sphere, earth surface, neighboring buildings.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>envelopes</b> us in sensual effect. It can warm or chill us, {{it carries}} smell and sound; breezes stimulate the skin, and wind can {{literally}} move us; sometimes {{we can even}} taste the air. ‘Aesthetics of Air’ is an investigation into sensual and perceptual atmospheric encounters and how these {{can lead to a}} new design typology of air for interior spaces. This research project questions the now widespread practice of controlling and standardizing interior climates, the consequence of which has been the construction of interior spaces that are hermetically sealed from their atmospheric geography and related phenomena, and largely neutralized in terms of any complex physiological experiences. The origins of this practice and the prevailing notion of ‘comfort’ are interrogated and alternative approaches, and relationships to climate and interior atmosphere, contemporary and from across history and cultures, are discussed. The project then proposes how we can form an alternative relationship to interior atmospheres and the design challenges and opportunities such an approach presents. A key hypothesis is that the qualities of air we experience in a ‘pleasurable’ outdoor environment hold important clues as to how we can shape interior atmospheres. Through a series of projects, atmospheric phenomena and our physiological and psychological relationship to atmosphere is explored. Revealed is a surprisingly complex and dynamic atmospheric system of phenomena, which is in constant flux. It is argued that it is precisely these transient and highly randomised phenomena carrying perceptual effect that are the key to designing interior atmospheres, which are sensuous, pleasurable and engender delight...|$|R

40|$|<b>Envelope</b> <b>air</b> sealing was {{included}} in the retrofit of a 244 unit low-rise multifamily housing complex in Durham, N. C. Pre- and post-retrofit enclosure leakage tests were conducted on 51 units and detailed diagnostics were performed on 16. On average, total leakage was reduced by nearly half, from 19. 7 ACH 50 to 9. 4 ACH 50. Costs for air sealing were $ 0. 31 per square foot of conditioned floor area, lower than estimates found in the National Residential Efficiency Measures Database (NREMD) and other sources, perhaps {{due in part to the}} large-scale production nature of the project.

40|$|Most {{dwellings}} in the United States are ventilated {{primarily through}} leaks {{in the building}} shell (i. e., infiltration) rather than by whole-house mechanical ventilation systems. Consequently, quantification of envelope air-tightness is critical to determining how much energy is being lost through infiltration and how much infiltration is contributing toward ventilation requirements. <b>Envelope</b> <b>air</b> tightness and air leakage can be determined from fan pressurization measurements with a blower door. Tens of thousands of unique fan pressurization measurements have been made of U. S. dwellings over the past decades.

This report documents the <b>envelope</b> <b>air</b> leakage section of the LBNL database, with particular emphasis on new construction. The work reported here is an update of similar efforts carried out a decade ago, which used available data largely focused on the housing stock, rather than on new construction.

These newer data come from over two dozen datasets, including over 73, 000 measurements spread throughout a majority of the U. S.
