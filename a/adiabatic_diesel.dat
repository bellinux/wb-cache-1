40|$|Cummins Engine Company {{completed}} an analytical study to identify an advanced automotive (light duty) diesel (AAD) power plant for a 3, 000 -pound passenger car. The study {{resulted in the}} definition of a revolutionary diesel engine with several novel features. A 3, 000 -pound car with this engine is predicted to give 96. 3, 72. 2, and 78. 8 MPG in highway, city, and combined highway-city driving, respectively.

5000|$|The {{diesel engine}} (also {{known as a}} {{compression-ignition}} or CI engine) is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel that has been injected into the combustion chamber {{is caused by the}} high temperature which a gas achieves (i.e. the air) when greatly compressed (<b>adiabatic</b> compression). <b>Diesel</b> engines work by compressing only the air. This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that it ignites atomised diesel fuel that is injected into the combustion chamber. This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine (gasoline engine) or gas engine (using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol), which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture. In diesel engines, glow plugs (combustion chamber pre-warmers) may be used to aid starting in cold weather, or when the engine uses a lower compression-ratio, or both. The original diesel engine operates on the [...] "constant pressure" [...] cycle of gradual combustion and produces no audible knock.|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of Bryton Bottoming Systems (BBS) as {{waste heat recovery}} devices for future <b>adiabatic</b> <b>diesel</b> engines in heavy duty trucks is presented. Parametric studies were performed to evaluate the influence of external and internal design parameters on BBS performance. Conceptual design and trade-off studies were undertaken to estimate the optimum configuration, size, and cost of major hardware components. The potential annual fuel savings of long-haul trucks equipped with BBS were estimated. The addition of a BBS to a turbocharged, nonaftercooled adiabatic engine would improve fuel economy {{by as much as}} 12 %. In comparison with an aftercooled, turbocompound engine, the BBS-equipped turbocharged engine would offer a 4. 4 % fuel economy advantage. If installed in tandem with an aftercooled turbocompound engine, the BBS could effect a 7. 2 % fuel economy improvement. The cost of a mass-produced 38 Bhp BBS is estimated at about $ 6460 or 170 /Bhp. Technical and economic barriers that hinder the commercial introduction of bottoming systems were identified.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to develop an insulating structural ceramic for application in a heavy duty <b>adiabatic</b> <b>diesel</b> engine.

A strong factor in that decision was the low thermal conductivity and high thermal shock resistance of the mullite. Results of the Phase 2 effort indicate that optimum toughening of mullite by additions of ZHSS is difficult to achieve due to apparent sensitivity to morphology.

40|$|An {{essential}} task in {{the development}} of the heavy-duty <b>adiabatic</b> <b>diesel</b> engine is identification and improvements of reliable, low-friction piston seal materials. In the present study, the sliding friction coefficients and wear rates of promising carbide, oxide, and nitride materials were measured under temperature, environmental, velocity, and loading conditions that are representative of the adiabatic engine environment. In addition, silicon nitride and partially stabilized zirconia disks were ion implanted with TiNi, Ni, Co, and Cr, and subsequently run against carbide pins, with the objective of producing reduced friction via solid lubrication at elevated temperature. In order to provide guidance needed to improve materials for this application, the program stressed fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in friction and wear. Electron microscopy was used to elucidate the micromechanisms of wear following wear testing, and Auger electron spectroscopy was used to evaluate interface/environment interactions which seemed to be important in the friction and wear process. Unmodified ceramic sliding couples were characterized at all temperatures by friction coefficients of 0. 24 and above.

40|$|Three {{alternative}} {{power cycles}} were compared in application as an exhaust-gas heat-recovery system {{for use with}} advanced <b>adiabatic</b> <b>diesel</b> engines. The power cycle alternatives considered were steam Rankine, organic Rankine with RC- 1 as the working fluid, and variations of an air Brayton cycle. The comparison was made in terms of fuel economy and economic payback potential for heavy-duty trucks operating in line-haul service. The results indicate that, in terms of engine rated specific fuel consumption, a diesel/alternative-power-cycle engine offers a significant improvement over the turbocompound diesel used as the baseline for comparison. The maximum imporvement resulted {{from the use of}} a Rankine cycle heat-recovery system in series with turbocompounding. The air Brayton cycle alternatives studied, which included both simple-cycle and compression-intercooled configurations, were less effective and provided about half the fuel consumption improvement of the Rankine cycle alternatives under the same conditions. Capital and maintenance cost estimates were also developed for each of the heat-recovery power cycle systems. These costs were integrated with the fuel savings to identify the time required for net annual savings to pay back the initial capital investment. The sensitivity of capital payback time to arbitrary increases in fuel price, not accompanied by corresponding hardware cost inflation, was also examined. The results indicate that a fuel price increase is required for the alternative power cycles to pay back capital within an acceptable time period...|$|E
