50|$|Paper {{applications}} {{span the}} supply chain from the raw pulp and paper mills, to the downstream paper converters. Mills use steam joint and siphon systems and water unions for heating and cooling. Converters use rotary unions for heating and cooling rolls, as well as winders with <b>air</b> <b>clutches</b> and brakes.|$|R
50|$|Drilling rigs (oil or gas) use <b>air</b> <b>clutches</b> and brakes {{that require}} rotary unions. Water unions {{are used to}} flush mud from the drill tip, and must {{withstand}} shock and vibration in this severe application. Oil and petrochemical refineries use batch mixers, flaking mills, blenders and drying rolls that each require rotary unions.|$|R

5000|$|I {{then got}} into a {{westerly}} current that took me out to sea, on which I determined {{to come down to}} mother earth without delay, but picture to yourself my horror when I found the escape valve would not act. I tried with all the strength of the one hand I had to spare to move it, for with the other I had to hold myself in the loop of rope, but all to no purpose, it would not budge an inch. In sheer desperation I took the valve rope in both hands, and it opened with a bang but in the effort I had lost my seat in the loop, falling about six feet, and there I was dangling in mid <b>air,</b> <b>clutching</b> the valve rope, the gas rushing out of the balloon as though she had burst... printed in Illustrated Sydney News ...|$|R
5000|$|The monitor page 1 {{displays}} battery voltage, water temperature, {{engine oil}} pressure, fuel level, vehicle speed, engine rotation speed, lock/no-lock {{condition of the}} automatic transmission torque converter, and on/off condition of the <b>air</b> conditioning <b>clutch.</b> All except the last two were incorporated with a [...] "buzzer" [...] alarm system that indicate malfunction. Another feature is the one-second-precision 24-hour clock.

50|$|The {{decision}} {{to replace the}} Tatra 111 was made in 1952 {{as part of a}} central state planning economy, where Tatra Kopřivnice was to produce 7-10 ton utility trucks. In 1956 at II. Czechoslovak Machinery Expo in Brno, Tatra exhibited 2 new models, the T137 and T138. Both vehicles had up to 70% of parts in common across the range. New design features were introduced, such as improvement in driver environment and usability e.g. hydraulic power steering, a compressed <b>air</b> assisted <b>clutch</b> and electro-pneumatic auxiliary gearbox gear selection.|$|R
50|$|Cushion clutch or “slip clutch” {{styles are}} found in both {{electric}} screwdrivers and <b>air</b> screwdrivers. This <b>clutch</b> style {{is similar to the}} “cam-over” when once the final torque is reached because the clutch continues to cam over and slip. It will continue to run until the operator releases the throttle.|$|R
5000|$|The FB was {{promoted}} as being longer, lower, more spacious {{and more powerful}} than the FC model although in reality it was only slightly so on each count. Overall length was 5.5 in greater whilst the wheelbase remained the same. The engine remained the same at 3" [...] the last model to have this bore, engine capacity remained at 132 cubic inches and the compression ratio was raised. However the resulting extra [...] of power did not compensate for the extra weight of the FB and performance was thus inferior to that of its predecessor. Changes were also made to the brakes, front coil springs, <b>air</b> cleaner and <b>clutch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Priced {{considerably}} {{higher than the}} Escort, the EXP carried an ample list of standard equipment. It included power brakes, full instrumentation, full carpeting, map lighting, electric back window defroster, power hatchback release, a digital clock, a cargo area security shade , and rims that are noticeably wider than those of Escorts'. Models with a manual transmission had a sport-tuned exhaust. Automatic models had a wide-open throttle cutout switch for the optional <b>air</b> conditioning compressor <b>clutch.</b> Other options include floor vents or air conditioning , AM/FM radio , cruise control , roof luggage rack , rear window wiper , various seat styles and fabrics , removable sunroof , right hand mirror , TRX tires and shocks , child seat , and a very wide variety of colors inside and out with many various pinstripes and other painted decals.|$|R
2500|$|The first Pontiac GTO was {{an option}} {{package for the}} Pontiac Tempest, {{available}} with the two-door coupe, hardtop, and convertible body styles.

40|$|This thesis {{contain the}} process of {{creating}} a modular and mechanical landmine clearing tool for NMBU`s agricultural robot, Thorvald 2. In this thesis, there will be information about the problem with landmines today and how a landmine work, along with the development process for the product, including concept evaluation, calculations and simulations. The basic idea of the concept is that a load is to be dropped at the landmines location. The load will create a ground pressure that will trigger any pressure sensitive landmines. The load is a 25 kg heavy bag of sand and it will be dropped from a height of 1 meter. A winch lifts the load up and keeps it in the <b>air.</b> A <b>clutch</b> disconnects the drum {{from the rest of the}} winch system and the load drops to the ground. A scaffold is placed on the robot, with a pulley wheel at the top. The scaffold and the pulley wheel are designed and placed so that the pulley wheel is directly above the landmines, which are located in the middle and at the rear of the robot. A steel wire connects the load and the winch via the pulley wheel. The clutch is custom designed from scratch to fit the winch system. A linear actuator connects and disconnects the clutch. The winch is driven by a brushless direct current motor, along with a gearbox. Simulations done by FFI gives reason for optimism for the continuation of the project. A prototype is yet to be completed...|$|R
