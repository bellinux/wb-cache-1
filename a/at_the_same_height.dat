5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height</b> above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height</b> above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height</b> independent of the weight.|$|E

5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height,</b> temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|The current Boehm {{key system}} {{consists}} of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key {{just above the}} thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb.

A key {{at the side of}} the instrument <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E

30|$|We did {{not find}} any {{relation}} of the PMWE occurrence with the strength of the horizontal wind shear observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>heights.</b> We argue that this shear, probably, is not large enough for excitation of KH instability/enhanced turbulence which can lead to PMWE. The possible trigger might be additional small-scale waves which cannot be detected by the EISCAT radar. The results obtained with this tristatic radar experiment do not allow us to completely rule out the breaking gravity wave mechanism. Another possible mechanism for the echo generation which can qualitatively account for our radar observations is the presence of patchy charged dust such as meteoric smoke particles.|$|R

5|$|According to protocol, {{the flag}} may fly from sunrise until sunset; {{businesses}} and schools {{are permitted to}} fly the flag from opening to closing. When flying the flags of Japan and another country at the same time, the Japanese flag takes the position of honor and {{the flag of the}} guest country flies to its right. Both flags must be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height</b> and of equal size. When more than one foreign flag is displayed, Japan's flag is arranged in the alphabetical order prescribed by the United Nations. When the flag becomes unsuitable to use, it is customarily burned in private. The Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem does not specify on how the flag should be used, but different prefectures came up with their own regulations to use the Hinomaru and other prefectural flags.|$|E

The statue and the inscriptions are both the work of Eric Gill, who also carved the memorial to Raymond Asquith.

40|$|Magnetic sensors {{have been}} added to a {{standard}} weather balloon radiosonde package to detect motion in turbulent air. These measure the terrestrial magnetic field and return data over the standard uhf radio telemetry. Variability in the magnetic sensor data is caused by motion of the instrument package. A series of radiosonde ascents carrying these sensors has been made near a Doppler lidar measuring atmospheric properties. Lidar-retrieved quantities include vertical velocity (w) profile and its standard deviation (w). w determined over 1 h is compared with the radiosonde motion variability <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>heights.</b> Vertical motion in the radiosonde is found to be robustly increased when w> 0. 75 m s− 1 and is linearly proportional to w. © 2009 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

25|$|Most Romanesque monasteries, parish {{churches and}} abbey churches in Portugal are aisless halls with a {{projecting}} apse at the chancel end, or sometimes, a projecting rectangular chancel with a chancel arch {{that might be}} decorated with mouldings. More ambitious churches have aisles separated from the nave by arcades. The apse is lower or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height</b> of the nave. Monasteries are usually larger with 3 aisles supported by decorated columns and piers. The walls are of massive thickness with few and comparatively small openings and almost entirely made out of granite stones.|$|E
25|$|In {{synchronized}} trampolining, two athletes perform {{exactly the}} same routine of ten skills {{at the same time}} on two adjacent trampolines.

Fewer points are deducted for lack of synchronization if the pair are bouncing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height</b> at the same time. The degree of difficulty of the routine is determined in the same way as for individual trampoline routines and the points added to the score to determine the winner.|$|E
40|$|Aerosols {{are often}} advected above cloud decks, {{and the amount}} of {{aerosols}} over cloud has been assumed to be similar to that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> in nearby clear sky. In this assumption, cloud and aerosol above cloud-top height are considered randomly located with respect to each other. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) data are analyzed here to investigate this assumption on global scales. The CALIPSO data reveal that the aerosol optical depth (AOD) above low cloud tends to be smaller than in nearby clear sky during the daytime, and the opposite is true during the nighttime. In particular, over oceanic regions with wide-spread low cloud, such as the tropical southeastern Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, the daytime AOD above low cloud is often 40  % smaller than in surrounding clear skies...|$|R

25|$|Würzburg C {{featured}} lobe {{switching to}} improve aiming accuracy. The C model was aimed by sending the signal {{out of one}} of two slightly off-centre feed horns {{in the middle of the}} antenna, the signal being switched rapidly between the two horns. Both returns were sent to an oscilloscope display, slightly delaying the signal from one of the horns. The result appeared as two closely separated blips which the operator attempted to keep <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height</b> on the display. This system offered much faster feedback on changes in target position, and changes in signal strength due to changes in reflection off the target affected both lobes equally, eliminating common reading errors. An almost identical system was used in the United States' first gun-laying radar, the SCR-268.|$|E
25|$|A drop lock can {{consist of}} two {{conventional}} lock chambers {{leading to a}} sump pound, or a single long chamber incorporating the sump - although the term properly applies only to the second case. As the pounds {{at either end of}} the structure are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>height,</b> the lock can only be emptied either by allowing water to run to waste from the sump to a lower stream or drain, or (less wastefully) by pumping water back up to the canal. Particularly in the two-chamber type, there would be a need for a bypass culvert, to allow water to move along the interrupted pound and so supply locks further down the canal. In the case of the single-chamber type, this can be achieved by keeping the lock full and leaving the gates open while not in use.|$|E
