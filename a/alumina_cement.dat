The acoustic and microscopic properties of loose and consolidated porous samples of concrete are investigated using both experimental methods and mathematical modelling. Values of porosity, flow resistivity, tortuosity and parameters of the pore size distribution are determined and used to predict closely the sound speed, acoustic attenuation and normal incidence absorption coefficient of these materials. It is shown that high <b>alumina</b> <b>cements</b> do not require additional binders for consolidation and that the structural bonds in these cements are developed quickly between individual clinkers {{in the presence of}} water. The hydration product build-up during the consolidation process is insignificant which ensures good acoustic performance of the consolidated samples resulting from a sufficient proportion of the open pores. The value of porosity in the consolidated samples was found to be around 40 %, which is close to that measured in some commercial acoustic absorbers.

Ettringite, C 6 A 3 H 32, generated by the hydration of C 4 A 3 and C is responsible for the high early strength of these cements. The hydration of the silicate phase and the presence of C 5 S 2 contribute to the ultimate strength. These ettringite-containing cements do noy expand, and in fact they have dimensional stabilities similar to portland cement. In these type of cements durability problems may arise from the poor resistance of ettringite to carbonation. Due to the higher resistance to carbonation of another calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate, monosulfate (C 4 AH 12), the investigation has been extended to a composition which included brownmillerite, C 4 AF, whose presence promotes the conversion of ettringite to monosulfate during hydration...|$|R

Therefore, the effects of high-energy ball milling and subsequent calcinations on the formation of high alumina cementing phases using mixtures of Al 2 O 3 and CaCO 3 were investigated. Nano-meter sized high <b>alumina</b> <b>cement</b> (HAC) powders were synthesized by mechanochemical treatment of Al 2 O 3 and CaCO 3 in weight ratios 7 : 3 and 8 : 2.

In unshaped refractories, High- <b>alumina</b> <b>cements</b> (HACs) {{are the main}} binder and are currently most in demand. In {{the first generation of}} unshaped refractory the HACs were the one and only binding agent used. The good corrosion resistance and refractory properties of HAC account for its wide use in refractory concretes. The major mineral phases present in HACs are Monocalcium aluminate (CA), Monocalcium dialuminate (CA 2), Dodecacalcium heptaaluminate (C 12 A 7) and á-Al 2 O 3. Depending on the prescribed setting times and mechanical properties of unshaped refractories in accordance with their application area, the quality or desired characteristics of HACs changes. All the properties of HACs depend only on its mineralogical phase composition. Just as CA phase is responsible for development of highest strength among all other Calcium Aluminate phases and relatively reduces the time during hydration. So for the achievement of desired characteristics or properties of the refractory or HACs the major concern must be taken in its phase composition. So in the present work attempt has been made to prepare HACs by varying operating parameter such as starting composition, raw materials and sintering temperature (during manufacturing) and study the effect of mineralogical composition of those cements on the properties of final product (refractory castable).
