40|$|An <b>Argentine</b> <b>boa</b> (<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> occidentalis) of 5 yr 7 mo of age was {{presented}} for respiratory problems and regurgitation. Radiographs revealed evidence of cardiomegaly and pneumonia. Blood smear examination revealed {{the presence of}} intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in peripheral lymphocytes, consistent with inclusion body disease. Cultures of a tracheal wash sample resulted in growth of Ochrobactrum intermedium and Pseudomonas putida. Echocardiographic examination revealed a large vegetative lesion on the right atrioventricular valve with valvular insufficiency, a mildly dilated right atrium, and pulmonary hypertension. Postmortem examination confirmed the presence of pneumonia and bacterial endocarditis with dystrophic mineralization of the right atrioventricular valve, associated with different bacteria than those cultured from the tracheal wash. The present case is the first report of endocarditis in a <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> and contributes to the rare reports of cardiac disease in snakes...|$|R

25|$|The <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> (<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor),</b> {{also called}} the red-tailed boa or the common boa, is a species of large, {{heavy-bodied}} snake that is frequently kept and bred in captivity. The <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> {{is a member of}} the family Boidae, found in tropical North, Central, and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. A staple of private collections and public displays, its color pattern is highly variable yet distinctive. Ten subspecies are currently recognized, although some of these are controversial. This article focuses on the species <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> as a whole, and on the nominate subspecies B. c. constrictor.|$|R
2500|$|The {{size and}} weight of a <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> depends on subspecies, locale, and the {{availability}} of suitable prey. Several populations of <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> are known as [...] "dwarf boas", such as the population of B. c. imperator on Hog Island. These smaller subspecies are generally insular populations. B. c. constrictor reaches, and occasionally tops, the averages given above, as {{it is one of the}} relatively large subspecies of <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> {{are very}} popular within the exotic pet trade, {{and have been}} both {{captured}} in the wild and bred in captivity. Today, most captive <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> are captive-bred, but between 1977 and 1983, 113,000 live <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> were imported into the United States. These huge numbers of wild-caught snakes have put considerable pressure on some wild populations. <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> have also been harvested for their meat and skins, and are a common sight at markets within their geographic range. After the reticulated python, <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> are the snake most commonly killed for snakeskin products, such as shoes, bags, and other items of clothing. In some areas, they {{have an important role}} in regulating the opossum populations, preventing the potential transmission of leishmaniasis to humans. In other areas, they are often let loose within the communities to control the rodent populations.|$|R

25|$|<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> {{generally}} live {{on their}} own, {{and do not}} interact with any other snakes unless they want to mate. They are nocturnal, but they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are too low. As semi-arboreal snakes, young <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> may climb into trees and shrubs to forage; however, they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> strike when they perceive a threat. Their bite can be painful, especially from large snakes, but is rarely dangerous to humans. Specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily. Like all snakes, <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> in a shed cycle are more unpredictable, because the substance that lubricates between the old skin and the new makes their eyes appear milky, blue, or opaque, so that the snake cannot see very well, causing it to be more defensive than it might be otherwise.|$|R
