We argue that the expected utility of accepting a judgment depends on the degree to which all those objectives are satisfied and that groups of rational agents aim at maximizing it while solving judgment aggregation problems. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1952 - 7, Peryam {{and colleagues}} {{developed}} nine ordinal phrases of liking and dislike to assess consumers’ dispositions to accept or reject a food or drink. They named their questionnaire a Food Preference Scale. Others {{called it the}} Hedonic Scale, which means assessment of pleasure, not choice. It is still widely assumed that the word “like” distinguishes felt pleasure from observed wanting to consume the sample. The present quantitative results complement an earlier qualitative finding that preference scores do not provide evidence of the experiencing of pleasure. Rather, “I like it!” simply indicates high <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the sampled variant of a product. Nevertheless, in this experiment, some assessors did also get a convulsive thrill from oral stimulation, as distinct from just enjoying the mouthful, or being pleased by it. However this sensual pleasure came only from strongly disliked levels of stimulation and is probably unique to samples sensed as intensely sweet. Practical Applications This experiment’s separation of preference from pleasure depended on overcoming practitioners’ division between sensory vocabulary and preference scores. Instead of seeking statistical patterns that bridge the supposed gap between sensory concepts and <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> sensory studies should design test samples capable of measuring the impact of specified variations in the product range, first on a fully integrative judgment such as match to the personal ideal, or to the most familiar or usual brand. Second, if analytical characterization might help to test the specification, samples can be rated on vocabulary learned in life or in the laboratory, with one anchor on the standard to be matched, such “exactly as I like it” or “just right” (not “like extremely” or “just about right”), and only one other anchor, such as “neither like nor dislike” or “just too wrong to be tolerable. ” Existing {{data collection and analysis}} software are easily adapted this way...|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis pursuits {{an answer}} to the {{question}} to the meaning of being oneself. Martin Heidegger's philosophy, as elaborated in Being and Time, underlines the importance of this anthropological question giving it a focal position in the ontological query. For Heidegger, the individuality is identified with an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> of one's own, typically human way of being, which is the ground for disclosure of Being itself. The work traces this correlation by interpreting Heidegger's concept of human in two steps: the first, meanings hidden in the definition of man as a possibility are qualified, then, the notion of "authentic" existence as a prominent way of revelation of one's own being possibility is put in the centre of interest. I find the core of authenticity, characterized by Heidegger as "resoluteness" (Entschlossenheit), in the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the burden of existence, which I bring to its consequences for selfunderstanding of the man. This point opens the discussion as I consider the understanding of one's own life aimed towards a possibility which man finds himself or herself in one of the basic ways of orientation in the world. However, this conception is not compatible with Heidegger's notion of authentic existence. In the end, consequences of the confrontation of the both concepts of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Doctoral {{dissertation}} - Lund University, 1987 In {{this thesis}} {{the function of}} the laying on of hands in some baptismal texts in the Acts of the Apostles (8, 4 - 25; 19, 1 - 7 and 9, 10 - 19) is examined. The challenging question is whether the laying on of hands in these texts is to be understood {{as a part of a}} normal rite of initiation in an early Christian setting, or whether it has a special function not related to baptism. In the first section the Old Testament and Jewish background to laying on of hands in the New Testament is investigated. The second section gives an introduction to modern Luke-Acts research, especially related to the theme of Salvation History, and a discussion of recent literature on the laying on of hands. Some of the major theological themes of Luke-Acts, which are considered to be important for the understanding of {{the function of the}} laying on of hands, are also explored. These are: the role of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of the term ‘people of God’, the nature of the early Christian mission, and the importance of prayer. A detailed examination of the laying on of hands texts is carried out in the third main section. Our conclusion is that the laying on of hands in these texts has a twofold function. It is an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> and solidarity which often follows the inclusion of groups of ‘outsiders’ into the new people of God. But it is also a fixed component in an early rite of baptism and initiation. The emphasis on the manifestations of the Spirit in relation to this act, does not, however, seem to represent ordinary events, but has to do with the special perspective of Salvation History where new groups of people are demonstrated to belong to the messianic people of God...|$|E

40|$|Is the garagir a hero’s image? Reflections {{on the act}} of {{accepting}} (pratigraha) The present communication finds its ground (and {{at the same time}} its scope) in a reading of the vrātya-phenomenon which, without questioning the Śrauta-oriented interpretation we owe to scholars such as Falk and Witzel, nevertheless considers it as a sort of second historical phase. Behind this, we posit a previous stage, testified by some late Vedic Texts, when Vrātya-expeditions might have rather been a cyclical temporary institution (cf. Harzer 2005) broadly extended to the common life of clans, aimed at attaining the prosperity for all their members by means of a competition with rivals. The supposed ‘Brahmanic Reform’ - which changed the risky sacrificial arena, targeted on the ‘ever-to-be renewed distribution of the “goods of life”’ into the exclusive concern of the single individual sacrificer - might have also changed the sense of the term pratigraha, into the orthodox label of the act of “gift-acceptance” as the well-known privilege and peculiar means of livelihood for Brāhmaṇas. Strictly linked with this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> there is in several late Vedic sources the characterization of him who accepts as a garagir, as one ‘who has swallowed poison’. Such a depiction involves severe hints of anxiety which do not sound completely consistent with the Brahmanic Reform. Interestingly, garagir is also an attribute of the vrātya consecrated men, according {{to one of the most}} quoted sources on Vrātyas, i. e. PB 17. 1. 9, in particular of their chief, as the immobile source of their aggressive action and the trustworthy warrant, keeper and dispenser of its potentially noxious outcomes, just like an ancient protagonist of the so-called “Law of Heroism” in the sense of Malinar (2007 : 38 ff.).

Izradu ciborija smješta u razdoblje koje ne prelazi vrijeme vladanja hrvatskog kneza Mislava, pa kao {{terminus}} post quem non izrade spomenika predlaže razdoblje do otprilike 830. - 840. godine. Utvrduje razloge zbog kojih promišlja da je četverostranični ciborij izvorno mogao biti postavljen nad ranijim križnim krsnim bazenom uprostoru starokršćanskog baptisterija, koji je upredromanici, tt okviru prva tri desetljeća 9. stoljeća obnovljen, dok je crkva Sv. Marte u istom sklopu izgradena na mjestu ranije, starokršćanske. Tbe author {{deals with}} the ciborium from the church complex at Bijaći, presently displayed in the Croatian Archaeological Museum (Muzej hrvatskih arheoloških spomenika u Splitu) at Split. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the inscription cut in this squareshaped ciborium. She dates the ciborium to a period that does not exceed the rule of the Croatian prince Mislav, that is, according to the preserved historic documents, about 835 - 845, wherefore, she proposes the years 830 - 840 as the terminus post quem non of making of the ciborium. She determines the reasons for which the ciborium was probably erected on top of an earlier cross-shaped piscina in the paleo-Christian baptistery, that was rearranged in the pre-Romanesque epoque, in the first three decades of the b century, whereas the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church, of the same complex, was rebuilt within the limits of the older, paleo-Christian, church. Tbe ciborium was reconstructed from the preserved fragments found during the first excavations (1902 - 1905) at the locality of Stombrate in Bijaći. The archaeological material confirms existence of a large Roman villa-mansion in Stombrate, where, in the late classical period, a Christian complex developed, in the territory of the coastal agger centuriation, {{in the vicinity of the}} diocese centre of Salona. In the church complex, there is discovered a paleo-Christian basi/ica and, linked with it, an octagonal baptistery with a cross-shaped piscine. In the early Middle Ages, when in a part of the agger ofSalona there was also established the seat of the Croatian principality headed by the princ Trpimir dynasty, the large Roman villa at Stombrate in Bijaći became part of the property (predium) of the Croatian princes, gradually to become one of the larger feuds in the royal territory (territorium regale). Induced by the missionary church interests at the time of the Carolings, who were present in the Croatian principality territory, the very first Trpimirovićs rebuilt the late-classical villa and, within the limits oft he initial, paleo-Christian church, dedicated to St. John, built the new one, to have dedicated it to St. Martha. Simultaneously with building of the church, there was also rebuilt the paleo-Christian baptistery that is now, in the Pre-Romanesque epoque, linked with the church with adequate annexes. Tbe square ciborium is deemed not to have been intended for the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church altar initially, but for the new baptistery in its southern annex, where it was placed above the previously existing crossshaped, sunk, piscine, its four pilasters standing on corners of the cross hands of the piscine. Such deductions firstly result from the composition of the inscription that was, besides the outer surfaces, also cut along the inner side of the ciborium. Moreover, the very content of the inSCription is adequate to baptisteries and their fixtures, such as baptising fonts and the ciboria above them, both in the early Middle Ages and the earlier late, Christian, Roman period. The central religious idea of the inscription, also making the linking element of the entire text, is the concept ofthe Trinitum (the Holy Trinity). Particular attention is paid to St. John the Baptist 2 ̆ 7 s allusions, the river-water as the baptising matter, and, finally, the merciful inclusion of the man in the life of the very Trinity, as a guarantee ofthe eternallife. We, therefore, remain assured that the ciborium in scription sublimed the act of the baptism as the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the Triune God, which essentially determines also the sacral area of the baptistery in which the act takes place...|$|E

Over 47 years, the average duty on industrial products imposed by developed countries has impressively decreased from about 40 per cent ad valorem to 3. 9 per cent ad valorem. A survey of the Post-Uruguay Round individual tariff structures shows, however, that tariffs are still an important barrier in international trade. Most developing countries have either bound their tariffs at relatively high rates, the average of which ranges between 25 and 50 per cent ad valorem for industrial products, or they have bound only a limited number of items. Developed countries have bound all or most of their non-agricultural tariff lines; their customs duties, which are low on average, show however significant peaks on “sensitive” products such as textiles, clothing and leather goods,which are of particular export interest to developing countries. Least developed countries (LDCs) benefit from preferences by developed countries, though a preferential treatment is similarly accorded to some developing countries and to other developed countries under the provisions of regional trade agreements. Therefore, it is not surprising that an important part of the Doha Round Agenda is still devoted to tariff negotiations. However, as in general the relevance of tariffs as trade barriers has considerably lowered, the interest of the Doha Round negotiators is largely revolving around the elimination or reduction of non-tariff measures and domestic regulatory policies. In this domain, the negotiating efforts made since the Kennedy Round have indeed produced less visible results than those reached through the tariff liberalisation process.

It follows that if the law is to be both sensitive and just it cannot always provide definitive guidance as to how the community doctor, as the designated decision-maker, should <b>act.</b> The <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> his or her judgement is therefore necessary and depends for its proper working on trust, which can only be gained through compassion and respect for the patients concerned...|$|R

Psychotherapy is important in improving the life quality of cancer patients. One of psychotherapy that can be given is the implementation <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> (<b>Acceptance</b> and Commitment Therapy). The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the application <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> in improving the life quality of cancer patients at the Puskesmas Pacarkeling Surabaya.        Method: This research method used pre-experimental with one group pre-post test design. The population of cancer patients enrolled in the Puskesmas Pacar Keling. Samples were 12 people whom are determined based on the inclusion criteria. The Independent variable is application <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> and the dependent variable is life quality. Data collection and implementation <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> were conducted in puskemas and home visits. The collected data was analyzed by Paired T test with significance level α= 0. 05. Result: Result showed that there was change in increasing life quality of cancer patients significantly after giving implementation <b>of</b> the <b>ACT.</b> The result <b>of</b> Paired t-test showed the life quality of patients had a significance level of p= 0. 000. These result demonstrate the value of p < 0. 05, so the research hypothesis is accepted. Discussion: It can be concluded that the application <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> can improve the life quality of cancer patients.

A phenomenological perspective is applied to analyze the conditioning of these experiences, and what the <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> grieving may accomplish in relation to various aspects of the self, indeed selves—that is, in relation to the surviving relative as well as the deceased...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} process of conversion to Catholicism of the Andean indigenous population through the changes that were brought upon its attitudes toward death. This perspective {{is a way of}} understanding the analysis of the cultural transformations {{that took place in the}} Peruvian Andes since the European invasion in 1532, until 1670, a time when the colonial order was firmly established. This is a comparative study of two cities of the Peruvian viceroyalty, Lima and Cuzco. Death was the most complex and controversial terrain on which the incorporation of the Andean population to Catholicism took place. Since religious conversion involves a complex set of changes that is not produced in a vacuum, but in contexts that are specific and dynamic, it is within those contexts that the study of conversion is undertaken. Conversion to Christianity was not a free and voluntary <b>act</b> <b>of</b> mere <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a faith and the way of life it called for. In the conditions of Spanish colonial domination, it meant the submission to a totalizing regime, where a number of aspects of public and private life were regulated and penalized to facilitate colonial rule and evangelization. Hence, the incorporation of Andean peoples into colonial Catholicism involved the modification of kinship ties; changes in the location and design of human settlements; the imposition of the Spanish language; the adaptation of European material culture, among other aspects of crucial importance for the formation of colonial society. This dissertation demonstrates that while State and Church agreed on the general directions to be taken on the colonial project, the policies implemented locally diverged due to the different social, political, and cultural settings of each of the cities considered in this study. The dissertation offers a close analysis of the impact that the State and Church policies had on the lives of the inhabitants of Cuzco and Lima, and explains the effects of the Christianization of death among the Andean indigenous population. ...|$|R
