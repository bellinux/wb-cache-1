5|$|Jermaine, Manuel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I {{told him}} the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
500|$|She <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{and wrote}} this song about some serious insecurities {{that we had}} {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and we both had trust issues. We were getting over it, but we wrote this song about it. And it's perfect. I couldn't be happier about that song and the way it came about and the honest way ... It is like people getting a look at {{something}} personal for the first time.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not think}} I watched them go. I only {{remember}} myself left there somehow--horribly empty <b>and</b> alone. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>and</b> {{fell into a deep}} shapeless musing.|$|R
60|$|An usher set a {{chair for}} me, <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> too, <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> {{immediately}} facing the Emperor's Lieutenant. Then another {{usher in a}} loud voice summoned Cosimo to appear and state his grievance.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} to Brooklyn several times on errands for the firm, so I knew the streets quite well. But fearful of being seen, I passed close to the wharves, and finally came to a lumber yard, <b>and</b> here <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} the duet was first {{announced}} via Stefani's Twitter account, where she posted the album notes of If I'm Honest, which revealed her name in the track listing. In an interview with People, Shelton expressed that {{the best part of}} the duet was [...] "the honest way it came about". He stated: [...] "There's not a third ghost writer, there's not five writers on it. It's just she <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and wrote this song [...] and I couldn't be happier about [...]" [...] He further explained that the song was written about [...] "some serious insecurities that we had when we first started down this road with each other"; he called the end result [...] "perfect". The concept for [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] was developed by both singers, and began with Shelton writing the first verse, followed by Stefani creating the second, which Shelton described: ...|$|E
2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting in my apartment, wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E
60|$|My friend <b>and</b> <b>I</b> now <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{in front}} of a {{comfortable}} fire, fed with logs from the roof of a neighbouring hut, but we had not chatted long before he asked me the object of my visit to headquarters.|$|R
60|$|In vain should I {{attempt to}} {{describe}} the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert, when he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> Provis <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> before the fire, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> recounted {{the whole of the}} secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert's face, and not least among them, my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me.|$|R
60|$|One day in {{the spring}} I came to the terrace which overlooks the plain, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to warm myself in the sunshine, gazing at the broad country which now I knew so well, and the distant hills, the wish came to me to write the history of my life.|$|R
2500|$|Crazy Horse spoke {{this story}} to Flying Hawk: ‘I {{was sitting on a}} hill or rise, and {{something}} touched me on the head. [...] I felt for it and found {{it was a bit of}} grass. I took it to look at. [...] There was a trail nearby and I followed it. [...] It led to water. [...] I went into the water. There the trail ended <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and when I came out I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{answered}} {{me with a}} yell, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> content, and laughed.|$|E
60|$|Well: Mrs. Norman, and Randal Linley, <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to our {{consultation}} at the cottage.|$|E
60|$|The craft was deserted. Wishing {{to observe}} the scene without being noticed, I leaped into her. There was a cushion on the stern seat, <b>and</b> on this <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|Luckily my bunk {{was close}} to the doorway, so I had the best light the place afforded. Close to me was a chest, <b>and</b> upon this <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to think.|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} {{not as bad as}} the hold had been, there being a little light and ventilation. At one end was a small bench, <b>and</b> on this <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|We {{took our}} bags into the Custom House and opened them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on mine, and {{immediately}} went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{he turned}} and left us, bearing the Rose of Paradise with him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to a dish of tea with Mistress Pamela.|$|E
60|$|The {{letters to}} the lawyer and to Mr. Fairlie were still to be written, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at once without a moment's {{hesitation}} to devote myself to them.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>and</b> Marion <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{together}} on a little seat under some trees {{at the top of}} Putney Hill, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> came to my point abruptly.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that the management, in making this order, had clearly gone beyond their legal right; and, under {{ordinary}} circumstances, I should have disputed it. Being present, however, more in the character of a guest than in that of a patron, I hardly like to make a disturbance; <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> meekly prepared to comply with the demand.|$|R
60|$|Thinking thus, desolation {{took hold}} of me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself <b>down</b> on a rock and covered my face with my hands that I might not see the tears, which I knew were {{gathering}} in my eyes, as they fell from them. Yes, there {{in the midst of}} that awful solitude, I, Hubert of Hastings, whose soul it filled, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> like a lost child and wept.|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{she became}} still. [...] "Oh, well," [...] she said, {{and wiped her}} eyes {{and sat down on}} the little sofa by the fire; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I started picking 'em up--hundreds of 'em--meaning to run {{out under}} the Indian's arm, but I came on giddy all over <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> The fat man {{went back to his}} fiddling.|$|E
6000|$|Lawford {{shut his}} mouth. 'I suppose so--a fit,' he said presently. 'My heart {{went a little}} queer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and fell {{into a kind of}} doze--a stupor, I suppose. I don't {{remember}} anything more. And then I woke; like this.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{looked up}} <b>and</b> almost {{expected}} fire from heaven. This coincidence {{was like the}} end of the world. <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> feeling that somehow or other Park-lane must be pulled down; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> beside the man who wanted to pull it down. I bowed in silence for an instant under the approaching apocalypse; and in that instant the man turned sharply and started talking like a torrent.|$|R
6000|$|At our meal {{several others}} were present, besides the serving folk, and {{the talk was}} general. After it was done I had an {{interview}} with some officers. These left, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself <b>down</b> upon a cushioned couch, and, being tired, there fell asleep, till I was awakened, or, rather, half awakened by voices talking in the garden without. They were those of Jodd and Martina, and Martina was saying, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] says I, [...] "I'll {{wait till}} you're through with this." [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> right <b>down</b> {{beside her on}} the floor, and set to smooth her hair with my hand. At first she wriggled away when I touched her; then she seemed to notice me no more; then her sobs grew {{gradually}} less, and presently stopped; and the next thing I knew, she raised her face to mine.|$|R
6000|$|So {{the artist}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and talked of various matters, while my wife got out her {{traveling}} stationery-box, {{and sat down}} to the dining-table to make out the bill. After a long, long time, as it appeared to me, I said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Countess is all right. I'm going up-stairs to see Lady Anna;--that's all. But I've hurt {{myself a}} little. I'm bad {{in my left}} shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{just to get a}} rest." [...] As he spoke he was still smiling.|$|E
60|$|I {{was shown}} {{into the room}} I already knew so well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in Giulia's chair. I rested {{my head on the}} {{cushions}} which had pressed against her beautiful hair, her cheek; and I inhaled the fragrance which they had left behind them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} the same here {{as it was when}} I was in that cell near Tunis. I wanted to get out. I {{supposed}} there must be some way out, if I could but discover it, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to think how it was to be done; and of course, after trying in my mind every possible scheme, I hit upon the right one. There certainly was nothing clever in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Frog <b>and</b> <b>I</b> now <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{to watch}} the result, {{and the time of}} waiting was long and tedious. After several weary days, however, the great fish lay over on its side and expired, and soon after there hopped from its mouth the sweetest little green frog you ever laid eyes on. Another and another followed, until twelve of them stood beside us; and then my wife exclaimed: ...|$|R
60|$|Inside my stoker's singlet, in the armpit, I sewed a gold {{sovereign}} (an emergency sum certainly {{of modest}} proportions); and inside my stoker's singlet <b>I</b> put myself. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> moralised upon the fair years and fat, which had made my skin soft {{and brought the}} nerves close to the surface; for the singlet was rough and raspy as a hair shirt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am confident that the most rigorous of ascetics suffer no more than I did in the ensuing twenty-four hours.|$|R
