25|$|For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as {{mebendazole}} and albendazole are {{the drugs}} of choice recommended by WHO. These <b>anthelminthics</b> are administered {{in a single}} dose are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. Mebendazole can be given with a single dose twice a day for three consecutive days. Albendazole is given at a single dose. WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment. In addition to these, pyrantel pamoate is also equally effective on ascaris.

25|$|Large {{strongyle}} worms, {{most commonly}} Strongylus vulgaris, are implicated in colic secondary to non-strangulating infarction of the cranial mesenteric artery supplying the intestines, most {{likely due to}} vasospasm. Usually the distal small intestine and the large colon are affected, but any segment supplied by this artery can be compromised. This type of colic has become relatively rare {{with the advent of}} modern <b>anthelminthics.</b> Clinical signs vary based on the degree of vascular compromise and the length of intestine that is affected, and include acute and severe colic seen with other forms of strangulating obstruction, so diagnosis is usually made based on anthelminthic administration history although may be definitively diagnosed during surgical exploratoration. Treatment includes typical management of colic signs and endotoxemia, and the administration of aspirin {{to reduce the risk of}} thrombosis, but surgery is usually not helpful since lesions are often patchy and may be located in areas not easily resected.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the <b>anthelminthic</b> and bactericidal activity of Flaveria trinervia. Study design: Assessment of <b>Anthelminthic</b> and bactericidal activity. Place and Duration of Study: <b>Anthelminthic</b> and bactericidal activity of extracts from Flaveria trinervia Spring C. Mohr. between August 2010 and May 2011. Methodology: The methanol and aqueous extracts of Flaveria trinervia were screened for antibacterial activity against 20 clinical strains belonging to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Echerichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from different infectious sources. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay {{of both the}} extracts was carried out against clinical isolates using two fold agar dilution method. Ciprofloxacin and piperazine citrate were used as the standard reference for bactericidal and <b>anthelminthic</b> activity respectively. Results: Evaluation of anti-bacterial activity revealed that both the extracts showed effective activity against all the six bacterial pathogens. Specifically, aqueous extract was more efficient than methanol extract but less potent than standard drug ciprofloxacin. Among the various concentrations of aqueous extract tested, 250 mg/ml showed efficient <b>anthelminthic</b> activity and among all the concentrations methanol extract tested 250 mg/ml gave significant results. This investigation revealed that methanol extract of F. trinervia showed significant <b>anthelminthic</b> activity against Pheretima posthuma {{when compared to the}} aqueous extract.

The objectives of this study were to assess the impact of <b>anthelminthic</b> treatment on the prevalence and intensity of intestinal helminth infection, haemoglobin level and prevalence of anaemia among school-age children. Methods A total of 403 children attending Tikur Wuha Elementary School in Jiga, northwestern Ethiopia were enrolled in this study between February and March 2011. Formol-ether concentration and Kato-Katz methods were used to examine stool for intestinal helminth infections at baseline and one month after <b>anthelminthic</b> treatment. Haemoglobin level was measured using Hemocue machine at baseline and one month after <b>anthelminthic</b> treatment. Results Out of 403 school children examined, 15. 4  % were anaemic and 58. 3  % were infected with intestinal helminths at baseline. Hookworms (46. 9  %), Schistosoma mansoni (24. 6  %), Ascaris lumbricoides (4. 2  %) and Trichuris trichiura (1. 7  %) infections were common. The odds of anaemia was higher among children infected with helminths (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) [*]=[*] 3. 83, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 92, 7. 62) especially in those infected with hookworm (aOR[*]=[*] 2. 42, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 34, 4. 39) or S. mansoni (aOR[*]=[*] 2. 67, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 46, 4. 88) and two or more helminth species (aOR[*]=[*] 7. 31, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 3. 27, 16. 35) than those uninfected with intestinal helminths at baseline. Significant reduction in prevalence of helminth infection (77. 0  %) and increment in mean haemoglobin level (+ 3. 65  g/l) of children infected with helminths was observed one month after <b>anthelminthic</b> treatment. The increase in haemoglobin level after <b>anthelminthic</b> treatment was significantly positively associated with the age, but negatively associated with the haemoglobin level at baseline. The change in mean haemoglobin level was significantly higher among undernourished than normal children. Percent reduction in the prevalence of anaemia among children infected with helminths was 25. 4  % after <b>anthelminthic</b> treatment. Conclusions The present study provides evidence that <b>anthelminthic</b> treatment of school-age children infected with intestinal helminth can improve haemoglobin level in addition to reducing the prevalence and intensity of helminth infections one month after treatment. This suggests that deworming of children may benefit the health of children in sub-Sharan Africa where hookworm and S. mansoni infections are prevalent...|$|R

50|$|For example, {{researchers}} have recently sought {{to understand why}} humans began using tobacco {{in spite of the}} consequences and adverse reactions commonly associated with its use. Hagen and colleagues propose that, as in other species, humans began using tobacco and other plant toxins as a way of controlling infection by parasitic diseases, including helminths. Tobacco, as well as arecoline and cannabis, two other plant neurotoxins that are widely used as recreational drugs in humans, {{have been found to be}} toxic to parasitic worms that affect humans and other mammals, as well as plants. Modern <b>anthelminthics</b> function as well by targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on somatic muscle cells of parasites, producing paralysis and expelling the parasite, the same receptors which are targeted by nicotine (Roulette et al., 2014). Moreover, it has also been found that nicotine is equally or more effective than commercial anthelmintics at killing leeches, including those that infect humans. Similarly, Roulette et al. (2014) found in a study comparing male smoking prevalence and parasite load among Aka hunter-gatherers that treatment with commercial anthelmintics was associated with a decrease in cotinine concentrations (a measure of current tobacco use), thereby supporting their theory that humans regulate the amount of tobacco used in response to current helminth infection. The study also found that men with higher initial tobacco use also had lower worm burdens one year later, suggesting that nicotine not only eliminates parasites, but also protects from reinfection.|$|E
40|$|AIM: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to screen antimicrobial activities of non antibiotic drugs. The assayed drugs involved were non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents (aspirin, ibuprofen and diclofenac) and <b>anthelminthics</b> (suramin, praziquantel and albendazole). METHODS AND RESULTS: Susceptibility tests were performed against different species of bacteria (Pseudomonas spp, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp) a 11 d fungi (Candida albicans) by disc diffusion method.
