After the hijacking of a Pakistan International Airlines aircraft in March 1981, sensing the contradictory requirements of security and facilitation, the <b>Airports</b> <b>Security</b> Force (ASF) was separated, and in December 1983, was placed under {{the folds of the}} Ministry of Defence.|$|R
5|$|According to the BCHR, {{authorities}} organized {{an anonymous}} smear campaign targeting Rajab and Maryam al-Khawaja in May 2011. Later {{in the month}} Rajab stated that his uncle, Mohammad Hassan Mohammad Jawad (65 years old), an arrested activist, was being tortured because of their relationship. He also stated that he was prevented by Muharraq <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> staff from traveling to Beirut to attend an International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX) meeting in May and an Amnesty International conference in June.|$|E
5|$|German {{politicians}} of the then government parties (Social Democrats and Liberals) {{as well as}} the opposition (the conservative Union parties) generally acclaimed the non-violent outcome of the hijacking. This reflected the public opinion that with the Munich attackers having left the country, the risk of further terrorist acts against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing sky marshals, which at that time were already common on certain flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others.|$|E

Hammerfest was the second airport to receive SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based landing system, when it was installed in 2007. SCAT-I allows aircraft with the system installed to make a safer and less fuel-consuming landings using a gliding instead of step-down approach. This was followed up with an upgrade to the runway safety area and runway lights in 2008 and 2009.|$|E

5|$|In April1995, when Parliament {{decided to}} nationalize twenty-six {{regional}} airports owned by their respective municipalities, they also debated {{a proposal to}} build a new airport in Båtsfjord. At the time Widerøe was obliged to operate routes to the airport until 31March1997. In December1995, Widerøe took delivery of their fifteenth Dash8 and thus their only need for a Twin Otter was to serve Båtsfjord. From 1994 to 1997, the cost estimates for the new airport increased from NOK95 to 125million. By June1998, Parliament approved additional funding which brought the cost to NOK178 million, including a new county road for NOK8million. The airport opened on 9 September 1999. From the opening Widerøe used the Twin Otter until 1April2000, when the route was taken over by larger Dash8 aircraft. <b>Airport</b> <b>security</b> was introduced on 1January2005.|$|E
5|$|In all, 15 hijackings {{similar to}} Cooper's—all unsuccessful—were {{attempted}} in 1972. With {{the advent of}} universal luggage searches in 1973 (see <b>Airport</b> <b>security),</b> the general incidence of hijackings dropped precipitously. There were no further notable Cooper imitators until July 11, 1980, when Glenn K. Tripp seized Northwest flight 608 at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, demanding $600,000 ($100,000 by an independent account), two parachutes, and the assassination of his boss. After a 10-hour standoff, he was apprehended, but on January 21, 1983—while still on probation—he hijacked the same Northwest flight, this time en route, and demanded to be flown to Afghanistan. When the plane landed in Portland, he {{was shot and killed}} by FBI agents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Airport</b> <b>security</b> was {{introduced}} on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood boards to allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal. Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway to have one.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airports</b> <b>Security</b> Force troops fought back, {{limited the}} terrorists attack and started taking them out one by one. Within 2 hours, {{eight of the}} ten militants were shot dead by the <b>Airports</b> <b>Security</b> Force troops and the {{remaining}} two blew themselves up when they were cornered. About 90 minutes after the attack began, hundreds of Rangers, Police and Army troops {{arrived on the scene}} but the majority of terrorists had already been eliminated by <b>Airports</b> <b>Security</b> Force. The siege officially ended after five hours; 28 people, including the ten terrorists, 12 ASF personnel, one Pakistan Rangers personnel, a Sindh Police official, and four PIA employees (including two senior aircraft engineers) were killed in the incident. At least 18 security personnel were also injured in the attack and admitted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. Seven bodies that were burnt beyond recognition were also recovered from the airport's cold storage facility after a 28-hour rescue operation.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for <b>airport</b> <b>security.</b> The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Nordreisa Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to change the}} airport's name from Sørkjosen to Nordreisa. They {{argued that it was}} necessary to use the Nordreisa name to market the region as a tourist destination. The application was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that airports were required by regulation to be named after a settlement rather than a municipality. <b>Airport</b> <b>security</b> was introduced on 1 January 2005. This required the terminal to be slightly rebuilt; while it previously had a common departure and arrivals hall, it had to be separated into two areas. The municipality therefore decided to transfer the ownership of the ground handling service to the three employees. Avinor carried out a major upgrade to the runway safety area and landing lights in 2008 and 2009. The investments cost NOK40 million. The expansion of the safety area resulted in part of the lot of Birkelund Sawmill being expropriated.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the crash}} Ana Lucia Cortez is {{an officer in the}} Los Angeles Police Department who becomes pregnant, but loses the baby after being shot by a suspect at a {{burglary}} scene. She spends several months in physical and psychological therapy, and when the suspect is arrested, she refuses to identify him. After his release, she kills him outside a bar. Ana Lucia decides to leave the force and eventually finds work as an <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> guard. She meets Christian Shephard (John Terry) at the airport bar, who asks her to accompany him to Sydney as a bodyguard, however in Sydney the two part ways. Ana Lucia buys a ticket on Oceanic Flight 815 to return to Los Angeles. In a brief flashback in the first season finale, she flirts with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) at a bar at the airport, unaware he is Christian's son. The pair arrange to continue their conversation during the flight. During the flight the plane splits in half, with the two parts crashing on different sides of an island; Ana Lucia is one of the tail section survivors.|$|E

5|$|State {{funding was}} allocated, {{allowing}} {{the airport to}} be upgraded. The regional airport opened on 1 August 1974, {{the same day as}} four other airports in Finnmark. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the subsidized regional routes in Finnmark, which included the route to Berlevåg. Widerøe was awarded the contract in 1973. Because of the steadily more regular flights to Berlevåg, Norving applied to the government for permission to operate these as taxi routes. While the airline had been forced to operate its taxi service on the time specifications of the customer, taxi routes would allow the airline to operate feeder services with timetables. No such permission was granted. Widerøe took over operations from 1 August 1974 using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. On 14 November 1980 the garage and workshop burned down; a new building was built and opened in 1982. The passenger terminal was expanded in 1988 with a new arrivals and departure hall. Widerøe introduced the Dash8 in 1994. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997, in exchange for 2.2 million Norwegian krone (NOK) being paid to Berlevåg Municipality. <b>Airport</b> <b>security</b> was introduced on 1 January 2005.|$|E
