A typical solution to correct {{for this is}} incorporating a scatter model into an iterative reconstruction algorithm. Previously, GATE (Geant 4 Application for Emission Tomography) Monte Carlo (MC) SPECT simulations were accelerated by applying convolution-based forced detection (CFD). In the present work, a reconstruction architecture is proposed that combines: (1) a dual matrix ordered subsets (DM-OS) reconstruction algorithm; (2) a CFD version of GATE as a forward projector which holds an <b>analytical</b> <b>detector</b> model and can account for nonuniform attenuation and scatter; and (3) a rotator-based backward projector that also incorporates an <b>analytical</b> <b>detector</b> model.

40|$|Key words Short dc discharge, {{electric}} wall probe, <b>analytical</b> gas <b>detector.</b> A {{new approach}} {{leading to the}} development of gas <b>analytical</b> <b>detectors</b> is reported. The approach is based on measurements in the near-cathode plasma of fine structures associated with atomic and molecular plasma processes of the high energy portion of the electron energy distribution function (EEDF). A short (without positive column) dc discharge with cold cathode and conducting walls was used. The EEDF measurements in a dc discharge are technically simpler and have dramatically better sensitivity than in the afterglow since temporal resolution is not required. Additional increased probe sensitivity is achieved by using a large-area, larger-radius-of-curvature conducting wall as the probe instead of the more common thin cylindrical Langmuir probe. The wall probe, being almost flat, also greatly reduces the ion current contribution to the measurements. The new approach allows for the development of micro-analytical, dc plasma electron spectroscopy (PLES) gas detectors that are operational up to atmospheric pressure. c ○ 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|The {{importance}} of measuring siloxanes has increased {{with the recent}} growth of the landfill-gas-to-energy (LFGTE) market. Siloxanes and other biogas impurities can form a residue upon combustion in engines that may increase maintenance and reduce engine lifetime. A siloxanes analysis can assist with either determining if a biogas purification system is needed, or if a system is already in place, determining if it is operating properly. To date, various methods have emerged to measure siloxanes involving different sampling techniques and detectors. This paper summarizes the available methods for the determination of siloxanes in air to enable members of the LFTGE industry to select the most appropriate method for their application.

Here we present the chemical data, both spectra and images, from two techniques that do not require sample preparation with a conductive coating, thus eliminating the possibility of preparation-induced textural artifacts. The FIB-SIMS instrument includes a column optimized for SEM with a quadrupole type mass spectrometer. Its spatial and spectral resolution are 20 nm and 0. 4 AMU, respectively. The spatial resolution of the ESEM for chemical analysis is about 100 nm. Limits of detection for both instruments are mass dependent. Both the ESEM and the FIB-SIMS instrument revealed contrasting surficial features; crumbled, weathered appearance of the matrix in some regions as well as a rather ubiquitous presence of euhedral halite crystals, often associated with cracks or holes in the surface of the rock.

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of spatial}} resolution {{is a critical}} consideration {{in the design of}} small-diameter positron emission tomography (PET) scanners for animal imaging, and is often addressed with Monte Carlo simulations. As a faster and simpler solution, we have developed a new analytical model of the PET detector response function, and implemented the model for a small single-slice, multilayer PET scanner. The accuracy of the model has been assessed by comparison with both Monte Carlo simulations and experimental measurements published in the literature. Results from the analytical model agreed well with the Monte Carlo method, being noise free and two to three orders of magnitude faster. The only major discrepancy was a slight underestimation of the width of the point spread function by the analytical method as inter-crystal scatter is neglected. We observed good agreement between the predictions of the model and experimental measurements. For two large-diameter scanners additional discrepancies were seen due to photon acollinearity, which is not considered in the model. We have shown that the simple and fast <b>analytical</b> <b>detector</b> response function model can provide accurate estimates of spatial resolution for small-diameter PET scanners, and could be a useful tool for several applications, complementing or cross-validating other simulation methods...|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies in which metal oxide sensors (MOS) have {{replaced}} conventional <b>analytical</b> <b>detectors</b> in gas chromatography systems. However, despite the use of these instruments in a range of applications including breath research the sensor responses (i. e. resistance changes w. r. t. concentration of VCs) remain largely unreported. This paper addresses that issue by comparing the response of a metal oxide sensor directly with a mass spectrometer (MS), whereby both detectors are interfaced to the same GC column using an s-swafer. It was demonstrated that the sensitivity of an in-house fabricated ZnO/ SnO 2 thick film MOS was superior to a modern MS for the detection of a wide range of volatile compounds (VCs) of different functionalities and masses. Better techniques for detection and quantification of these VCs is valuable, as many of these compounds are commonly reported throughout the scientific literature. This is also the first published report of a combined GC MS sensor system. These 2 different detector technologies when combined, should enhance discriminatory abilities to aid disease diagnoses using volatiles from e. g. breath, and bodily fluids. 29 chemical standards have been tested using solid phase micro-extraction; 25 of these compounds are found on human breath. In all but 2 instances the sensor exhibited the same or superior limit of detection compared to the MS. 12 stool samples from healthy participants were analysed, the sensor detected, on average 1. 6 peaks more per sample than the MS. Similarly analysing the headspace of E. coli broth cultures the sensor detected 6. 9 more peaks per sample versus the MS. This greater sensitivity is primarily a function of the superior limits of detection of the metal oxide sensor. This shows that systems based on the combination of chromatography systems with solid state sensors shows promise for a range of applications...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} is {{a technique}} that separate compounds based on charge and size. During {{the last two decades}} capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass spectrometry (MS) has gained in interest, become more robust to use and able to separate neutral analytes. The separation of neutral analytes was first achieved with packed columns, but several disadvantages can be obtained with a stationary phase and the method of packing capillaries. Therefore, pseudostationary phases became a good alternative. The risk of clogging, memory effects and lower efficiency could be minimized with pseudophases. However, since mass spectrometry has become the most important <b>analytical</b> <b>detector,</b> and {{play a key role in}} the search for biomarkers in clinical applications, it is important that CE can successfully be combined with MS. To obtain this hyphenation several types of interfaces for the vital ion source exist. In paper I an atmospheric pressure photoionization interface was investigated in order to accomplish an improved detection sensitivity. The knowledge attained with this type of interface could then be transferred to the one used in paper II, the electrospray ionization interface (ESI), where the use of a MS friendly nanoparticle based pseudostationary phase was investigated. Both studies showed that it is still possible to improve the separation technique and modify the ion source in order to improve the detection sensitivity for capillary electrophoresis hyphenated with mass spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS), {{based on}} the original design of Weber et al. (2001), is presented. The principal modification in this design is that collected liquid sample is delivered to vials held on a rotating carousel {{as opposed to an}} on-line <b>analytical</b> <b>detector.</b> A model is developed to predict aerosol mass concentrations measured by a PILS based on operating parameters and characteristics of the sampled aerosol. A backward model predicts the concentrations of the sampled aerosol based on operating parameters and concentrations measured by the PILS. Both models, which consider plumbing transmission efficiencies, droplet growth, mixing effects, and volatilization losses, predict mass concentrations that are consistent with laboratory tests for step changes in concentration. The average collection efficiency for species (Na^+, K^+, SO_ 4 ^(2 −), Cl^−, NO_ 3 ^−) from a variety of aerosols compared to simultaneous measurements with a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) exceeded 96 % except for NH_ 4 ^+ (88 %); NH_ 4 ^+ is theoretically shown to be the most vulnerable to volatilization, followed by Cl^- and then NO_ 3 ^−, with greater losses caused by increasing droplet pH and temperature. The characterization tests highlight the importance of reducing NH_ 4 ^+ volatilization by keeping a stable tip temperature of 100 °C at the point where steam and ambient air mix in the condensation chamber. Maintaining a stable tip temperature also avoids fluctuations in supersaturations that lead to increased deposition losses of larger droplets.

All components in kolliphor HS 15 and miglyol 812 were well separated on an Acquity BEH C 18 column. Mobile phase A was 0. 1 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. A gradient elution sequence was programed initially with 60 % organic solvent, slowly increased to 100 % within 8  min. The flow rate was 0. 7  mL/min. Good linearity (r> 0. 95) was obtained {{in the range of}} 27. 6 – 1381. 1  μg/mL for polyoxyl 15 hydroxystearate in kolliphor HS 15, 0. 8 – 202. 0  μg/mL for caprylic acid triglyceride and 2. 7 – 221. 9  μg/mL for capric acid triglyceride in miglyol 812. The relative standard deviations (RSD) ranged from 0. 6 % to 1. 7 % for intra-day precision and from 0. 4 % to 2. 7 % for inter-day precision. The overall recoveries (accuracy) were 99. 7 %– 101. 4 % for polyoxyl 15 hydroxystearate in kolliphor HS 15, 96. 7 %– 99. 6 % for caprylic acid triglyceride, and 94. 1 %– 103. 3 % for capric acid triglyceride in miglyol 812.

High-throughput screening (HTS) techniques have been developed to approach this through a combinatorial approach. These include using highly sensitive <b>analytical</b> <b>detectors</b> like mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR).

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) has {{during the}} last two decades become more robust and been able to separate neutral analytes without compromising the downstream detection. An interesting aspect in CE compared to more commonly used high-performance liquid chromatography is the orthogonal separation mechanism provided by CE. Compounds are separated based on charge and size with extremely high separation efficiencies. However, since mass spectrometry (MS) {{has become one of the}} most important <b>analytical</b> <b>detectors</b> and play a key role for pharmaceutical- and in clinical applications it is of major importance that the two techniques successfully can be combined without any compromises. Improvements in existing ion sources must be made in order to fully take advantage of the potential in capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. One way is to miniaturize the ion source (paper I) in order to make it more compatible with the smaller liquid volumes and lower flow rates in CE. Despite these improvements challenges such as low sample concentrations, non-separated peaks, unspecific losses, and poor ionization still remain, and are addressed in this doctoral thesis. Separation of neutral analytes has previously been achieved with packed columns but with several disadvantages. Therefore, MS-compatible pseudostationary phases in the form of nanoparticles (paper II) are an interesting alternative with its minimized risk of clogging, reduced memory effects and better separation efficiencies. Particles or beads have also shown to be of importance when reducing the dynamic range in complex samples. By creating functionalized magnetic beads (paper III), complex samples such as human plasma can be fractionated in the manner that low molecular weight proteins are selectively enriched. Despite fractionation and enrichment of analytes of interest (paper IV) the ionization suppression could lead to biased sensitivity, increased baseline, retention variations and chromatographic distortion. Therefore the separation, as well as the ionization, is of major importance. For instance, in order to separate and detect monoclonal antibodies, which are an upcoming class of biotherapeutic drugs, the choice of capillary temperature and sheath liquid composition must be considered due to its major influence on charge state, peak intensity and memory effects (paper V) ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for the one-pot synthesis of a branched polymethyl methacrylate material. Employing a cross-linking comonomer and large amount of a chain transfer agent, a fully soluble material is produced through a conventional free radical reaction.

Branched polymers are of interest for their unusual flow and viscometric properties, and this material is particularly attractive due to the relatively cheap and simple synthetic route. To better understand the mechanism of the reaction, an online monitoring system, the PL-PMC, was used to monitor the contents of the reactor at near real time during the polymerisation. A continuous stream of sample from the reactor was diluted to an appropriated level and injected into a rapid GPC analysis system comprising a differential refractive index detector, an online viscometer and a short GPC column to allow measurements in a ‘flow injection analysis’ mode. Measurements of bulk molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity parameters were made during synthesis, allowing the growth of the polymer to be closely followed. From the intrinsic viscosity measurements, the development of the branched structure was investigated as a function of reaction time.

The developed method was successfully applied to monitor the biodegradation of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin by the strain Labrys portucalensis F 11. The results proved that the low pressure chromatography method is a simpler, cheaper, and faster alternative to monitor biodegradation studies...|$|R
40|$|PN code {{tracking}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors that affect the performance of spread spectrum receivers. It is desirable to maintain PN code tracking for a long period of time and with high accuracy. This paper presents a non-coherent digital delay-locked loop (DLL) for code tracking in direct-sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) systems. The proposed technique utilizes three non-coherent correlators with time-diversity followed by a lock <b>detector.</b> <b>Analytical</b> results for the mean time to lose lock, also called mean hold-in time, are derived for both additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels using a Markov chain model. Computer simulation results are also presented to validate the analytical results. It is shown that the proposed loop can maintain lock for relatively long periods of time under practical range of signal-to-noise ratio. For instance, the loop maintains lock for more than 10 6 frames for an energy per bit-to-noise power spectral density (Eb/No) of 4 dB or better. It is also shown that the mean hold-in time performance is only slightly degraded due to fading because of the time diversity gain utilized by the loop in obtaining the timing information. Finally, the ability of the proposed technique to successfully track randomly and linearly varying delays is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new detector referred to as Geometric mean detector (GEMD) {{which is based on}} the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the Geometric mean of the eigenvalues for collaborative spectrum sensing. The decision threshold has been derived by employing Gaussian approximation approach. In this approach, the two random variables, i. e. The largest eigenvalue and the Geometric mean of the eigenvalues are considered as independent Gaussian random variables such that their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are approximated by a univariate Gaussian distribution function for any number of cooperating secondary users and received samples. The approximation approach is based on the calculation of exact analytical moments of the largest eigenvalue and the Geometric mean of the eigenvalues of the received covariance matrix. The decision threshold has been calculated by exploiting the CDF of the ratio of two Gaussian distributed random variables. In this context, we exchange the analytical moments of the two random variables with the moments of the Gaussian distribution function. The performance of the detector is compared with the performance of the energy detector and eigenvalue ratio <b>detector.</b> <b>Analytical</b> and simulation results show that our newly proposed detector yields considerable performance advantage in realistic spectrum sensing scenarios. Moreover, our results based on proposed approximation approach are in perfect agreement with the empirical results. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This {{pharmacokinetic}} study evaluated diphenhydramine in the plasma of healthy volunteers after a single 25 mg oral dose of dimenhydrinate (diphenhydramine theophyllinate), corresponding to 12. 7 mg diphenhydramine, in {{a chewing gum}} formulation. Seven volunteers (4 men, 3 women; age: 26. 3 ± 1. 2 years; body weight: 63. 1 ± 4. 1 kg; height: 172. 4 ± 4. 6 cm) chewed the gum for 1 h. Blood samples (10 ml) were collected at different time intervals up to 24 h. Blood plasma was subsequently processed and analyzed for diphenhydramine content using a GLC method and an NPD <b>detector.</b> <b>Analytical</b> data revealed the following kinetic parameters: AUC 0 - 24 h: 155. 2 h x ng x ml- 1; AUC 0 -infinite: 195. 3 h x ng x ml- 1; Mean resident time: 16 h; t 1 / 2 : 10 h; Cmax: 14. 5 ng x ml- 1; tmax: 2. 6 h; and plasma clearance: 9. 0 ml x min- 1 x kg- 1. This study indicates that the pharmaceutical formulation employed provided sustained plasma concentrations of diphenhydramine, presumably sufficient to support its clinical efficacy towards motion sickness owing to the almost complete (> 95 %) release by the formulation of the active principle. Moreover, the maximal concentrations of diphenhydramine attained in plasma were {{much lower than the}} concentration threshold needed to produce drowsiness...|$|R
40|$|Graphene is a {{two-dimensional}} sheet of carbon atoms with numerous envisaged applications owing to its exciting properties. In particular, ultrahigh-speed graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) are possible {{due to the}} unprecedented carrier velocities in ideal graphene. Thus, GFETs may potentially advance the current upper operation frequency limit of RF electronics. In this thesis, the practical viability of high-frequency GFETs based on large-area graphene from chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is investigated. Device-level GFET model parameters are extracted to identify performance bottlenecks. Passive mixer and power detector terahertz circuits operating above the present active GFET transit time limit are demonstrated. The first device-level microwave noise characterisation of a CVD GFET is presented. This allows for the de-embedding of the noise parameters and construction of noise models for the intrinsic device. The correlation of the gate and drain noise in the PRC model is {{comparable to that of}} Si MOSFETs. This indicates higher long-term GFET noise relative to HEMTs. An <b>analytical</b> power <b>detector</b> model derived using Volterra analysis on the FET large-signal model is verified at frequencies up to 67 GHz. The drain current derivatives, intrinsic capacitors and parasitic resistors of the closed-form expressions for the noise equivalent power (NEP) are extracted from DC and S-parameter measurements. The model shows that a short gate length and a bandgap in the channel are required for optimal FET sensitivity. A power detector integrated with a split bow-tie antenna on a Si substrate demonstrates an optical NEP of 500 pW/Hz^ 1 / 2 at 600 GHz. This represents a state-of-the-art result for quasi-optically coupled, rectifying direct detectors based on GFETs operating at room temperature. The subharmonic GFET mixer utilising the electron-hole symmetry in graphene is scaled to operate with a centre frequency of 200 GHz, the highest frequency reported so far for graphene integrated circuits. The down-converter circuit is implemented in a coplanar waveguide (CPW) on Si and exhibits a conversion loss (CL) of 29 ± 2 dB in the 185 - 210 GHz band. In conclusion, the CVD GFETs in this thesis are unlikely to reach the performance required for high-end RF applications. Instead, they currently appear more likely to compete in niche applications such as flexible electronics...|$|R
40|$|One {{developed}} instrumentation aiming {{its application}} in potentiometric methodologies. This instrumentation included a digital device for the commutation of the signals generated by potentiometric detectors, an automatic potentiometric titrator and an assemblage {{to perform the}} linearization of the potentiometric <b>detectors</b> <b>analytical</b> signals. It was also assembled and developed the required data acquisition and control software. In this work were also developed and evaluated ion supersensitive transducers based on {{the sum of the}} potentials generated by two sensitive membranes, assembled in such way that they could be operated similarly to conventionally shaped ion selective electrodes. They were applied in the determination of different species by potentiometric methodologies, namely in the determination of calcium and magnesium by potentiometric titration and potassium and nitrate by direct potentiometry. The research was performed simultaneously with ion selective electrodes, in order to accomplished a comparative evaluation of both types of potentiometric detectors. The instrumentation was also applied in the determination of some chemical species, which are currently analyzed in routine laboratories. In its application some situations were take into account like the existence of some difficulties restricting the utilization of potentiometric methodologies or when it was possible to automatize the procedure. The results were evaluated comparatively with those obtained with the conventional methodologies used in control laboratoriesAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
