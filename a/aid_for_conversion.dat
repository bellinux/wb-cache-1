40|$|Building {{on three}} studies {{conducted}} on the spatial diffusion of organic farming (OF) in France, {{the objective of this}} article is to provide analysis on incentives and obstacles for the development of OF. What restrains the OF adoption is represented by three types of risks (agronomic, economic and moral) which reduce the propensity to convert to organic farming. Our work is based on national data bases on certified farms in 2010 and beneficiaries of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> to organic farming between 1993 and 2010. If these data do not make it possible to analyse the motivations at the individual level, they provide original findings by their completeness and the mobilization of different spatial and temporal scales, and a set of tools for exploratory and econometric spatial analysis. The main results are commented: characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of OF, relationship between OF and markets access, territories characteristics (agronomic, socioeconomic, institutional) that increase or decrease their propensity to host organic farms. They provide a basis to discuss the implications of public policies aiming to remove the bottlenecks and stimulate the development of OF in all territories, according to the national objectives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{introduces}} novel {{techniques to}} perform analog to digital (AID) conversion, {{based on the}} quantization of the coefficients obtained by the projection of a continuous-time signal over an orthogonal space. The new AID techniques proposed here are motivated by the sampling of the input signal in domains which may lead to lower levels of signal distortion and significantly less demanding A/D conversion characteristics. As a particular case, we study A/D conversion in the frequency domain where samples of the signal spectrum are taken such that no time-aliasing occurs in the discrete-time version of the signal. We show that the frequency domain {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC) overcomes some of the dimcultiw encountered in conventional time-domain methods <b>for</b> <b>AID</b> <b>conversion</b> of signals with very large haudnidths, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) signals. The discrete frequency samples are then passed through a vector quantizer with relaxed characteristics, operating over DC levels that change with a speed that is much lower than that required <b>for</b> time-domain <b>AID</b> <b>conversion.</b> Fundamental Sgures of merit in AID conversion and important system trade-offs are discussed for the proposed frequency domain ADC. As an example of this approach, we consider a multi-camer UWB Communications s cb e m e. I...|$|R

40|$|Summary Although {{the concept}} of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade has quickly gained {{prominence}} among aid donors as well as aid recipients, relatively {{little is known about}} its impact on trade-related performance. We use data on a large subset of developing countries for recent years to examine the extent to which various types of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade have helped recipient countries' trade performance. We find that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade facilitation reduces the costs of trading. Moreover <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade has an overall positive and significant impact on exports. This effect is entirely driven by aid to economic infrastructure, while the other main category of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade, <b>aid</b> to productive capacity, has no discernible effect on exports. Its strong positive association with exports at the sectoral level is due to an allocation skewed toward already well performing sectors. <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade <b>aid</b> effectiveness trade cost of trading exports...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade in promoting trade – both exports and imports – and conditions which tend to make it most effective. The review provides abundant {{evidence to suggest that}} <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is indeed broadly correlated with increases in trade. <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade works best when it is focused on reducing the costs of trading through improvements in infrastructure, trade facilitation, trade-related public institutions (such as customs, standards administration, and export promotion), and polices (including eliminating policy barriers to competition). <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade – in varying forms – directed to low income countries is particularly helpful in promoting trade. Analysis in this chapter suggests that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade destined to low and lower-middle income countries is likely to have a high pay-off. Typically, one dollar invested in <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is associated with an increase of nearly USD 8 of exports from all developing countries – while one dollar of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade to International Development Association (IDA) -eligible poorest countries amounted to US 20 in new exports and to USD 9 for all low and lower-middle income countries...|$|R

House Bill 3646, 81 st Legislature, 2009, repealed the TEC, § 42. 2512, related to additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> professional salaries; § 42. 2514, related to additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> school employee health benefits; and § 42. 2516 (b) (2), related to the salary allotment for professional staff.

Funding related to the repealed provisions is now included in “revenue at the compressed tax rate ” (RACR), a component of the foundation funding formula known as Additional State <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> Tax Reduction (ASATR).
