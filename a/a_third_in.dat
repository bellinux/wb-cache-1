5|$|A post-war {{review by}} the Australian government's Defence Committee {{recommended}} that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947; Terrible and sister ship Majestic, for the combined cost of AU£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As Terrible was fitted out as a flagship and was the closer of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification. Although Terrible was due for completion on 24 June 1948, a skilled labour shortage affected {{the installation of the}} ship's boilers, causing the Admiralty to revise the delivery date to October 1948.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's league {{campaign}} {{started on}} 9 August 1997, with an away fixture at Leeds United. The match {{ended in a}} 1–1 draw; Ian Wright scored his first goal of the season, before a mix up in defence meant Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink equalised for the home team. Two days later, at home to Coventry City, Wright scored both goals in Arsenal's 2–0 win, leaving the striker one goal away from equalling Cliff Bastin's club goalscoring record. Two goals from Dennis Bergkamp and a debut goal by midfielder Marc Overmars, the following week helped Arsenal to win at Southampton. In spite of Bergkamp scoring a hat-trick against Leicester City, Arsenal drew the match 3–3, having conceded <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> the sixth minute of stoppage time. A further draw at home to rivals Tottenham Hotpsur, for whom defender Sol Campbell particularly impressed, meant Arsenal ended August in fifth position.|$|E

She made two round-trip voyages between California and Oahu in November and <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> late December. On 21 January 1946, Texas departed San Pedro and steamed via the Panama Canal to Norfolk where she arrived on 13 February, and soon began preparations for inactivation.

5|$|Skagen's {{first school}} was the Latinskole, a grammar school, {{which was in}} {{operation}} from 1549 until 1739. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen: one in Vesterby, another in Østerby and <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> Højen. As a result of evolving legislation, a new public primary school (Borgerskolen) designed by A. Haunstrup was completed in 1901. A gymnasium was added in 1909 but in 1924 it was converted into classrooms to accommodate the growing number of pupils. A secondary school (Realskolen) was opened in 1904 behind the former local authority building on Sct. Laurentii vej. The secondary school was later moved next to the primary school and in 1948 the buildings were extended. An additional two-storey wing was completed in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav {{minelayer}} Zmaj (Dragon) {{was built}} in Germany as a seaplane tender for the Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1928–30. She {{does not appear to}} have been much used in that role and was converted to a minelayer in 1937. Captured by the Germans in 1941, she was renamed Drache (Dragon) and redesignated as an aircraft tender and later as a troop transport, before she was rebuilt as a minelayer in 1942. She laid one minefield in 1943 that sank two Allied destroyers and badly damaged <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> the Aegean Sea. Drache was also used by the Germans to evaluate the shipboard use of helicopters for reconnaissance purposes. She was sunk by Allied aircraft in 1944 at Samos and scrapped in place after the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{published}} by Ellis and White in November 1876, although the date appeared on the imprint as 1877. They issued a second edition in 1877 and <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> 1880. The book was brought out again in 1887 by Reeves and Turner, and in 1896 by Longman. In 1898, two years after Morris's death, a revised text {{was published}} by the Kelmscott Press in an edition limited to 160 paper copies and 6 vellum copies, with wood cuts by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. In 1910 Longman issued an edition in which some passages were replaced with prose summaries by Winifred Turner and Helen Scott. In 1911 the same firm reprinted the original version as volume 12 of The Collected Works of William Morris, with an introduction by May Morris; {{in the absence of}} a critical edition this is the one generally cited by scholars. In recent years Sigurd the Volsung has been frequently reprinted, sometimes in the Turner and Scott abridged version.|$|E

In April 1961 he made his second appearance on Desert Island Discs, this time unaccompanied by Murdoch. In October that year—three weeks after the fifth series of Beyond Our Ken began recording—Horne appeared as the anchorman on a new BBC television series, Let's Imagine, a discussion programme which ran for 20 editions over 18 months. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in February 1962, hosted by Eamonn Andrews, in which guests included friends and colleagues from his connections in business and entertainment. In June 1963 he began Ken's Column, a series of 15-minute one-man programmes for Anglia Television.|$|E
5|$|Three {{possible}} excavation {{sites were}} identified: the staff car park of Leicester City Council Social Services, the disused playground {{of the former}} Alderman Newton's School and a public car park on New Street. It was decided to open two trenches in the Social Services car park, with an option for <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> the playground. Because most of the Greyfriars site had been built on, only seventeen per cent of its former area was available to excavate; the area to be investigated amounted to just one per cent of the site, owing to {{the limitations of the}} project's funding.|$|E
5|$|United {{were drawn}} against fellow Premier League side Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final. The first leg at Old Trafford was goalless {{in the first}} half, but United {{took the lead in}} the 58th minute when midfielder Paul Scholes scored. However, three minutes later Blackburn {{equalised}} when David Thompson scored. The match finished at 1–1. The second leg held at Blackburn's home ground, Ewood Park, saw them take the lead when striker Andy Cole scored early in the match. However, United responded and two goals from Scholes in the remainder of the first half gave United the lead. They scored <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> the second half when striker Ruud van Nistelrooy converted a penalty. United won the match 3–1 and progressed to the final after winning the tie 4–2.|$|E

5|$|A trip to The Dell on 3 October {{was taken}} with caution given United's return from Munich in the Champions League and winless record at the ground. The team lost to Southampton {{in each of}} their last three visits, {{including}} a 6–3 mauling in 1996. Despite dominating possession and clear-cut chances in the previous season’s fixture, United lost by a single goal leaving Ferguson to question when, not if he would eventually break the jinx. Andy Cole was paired with Yorke {{for only the second}} time this season, a tactic that paid off as both got on the score sheet. Substitute Jordi Cruyff added <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> the 75th minute to move United into second place in the table, four points behind leaders Aston Villa going into the international break. Raimond van der Gouw who deputised for injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel at Southampton featured again at home to Wimbledon, a match that Manchester United won 5–1, the biggest win of the season at Old Trafford. Ryan Giggs, Beckham, Yorke and Cole (twice) all scored; Ferguson in particular hailed the contribution of 19-year-old defender Wes Brown. United earned a point away at Derby County on 24 October, and deservedly beat Everton 4–1 at Goodison Park on Halloween to cut the gap at the top to just a point.|$|E
5|$|In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller {{was awarded}} {{the man of the}} match after earning two {{penalties}} which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig. It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game {{in the early stages of}} the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal. Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award. On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0) and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt. Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory. On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg. On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently. Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern. During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.|$|E
5|$|Liechtenstein won {{its first}} Olympic medals: two bronzes by Willi Frommelt and Hanni Wenzel in the alpine skiing slalom events. East German athletes {{achieved}} gold medal sweeps in luge and bobsleigh, {{which accounted for}} five of the country's seven Olympic titles. Alpine skier Rosi Mittermaier won the women's downhill and slalom events to give West Germany's two gold medals in these Games. She came close to winning <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>in</b> the giant slalom, which would have made her {{the first woman to}} win all three Olympic alpine skiing events. Cross-country skier Helena Takalo contributed three of Finland's seven medals by reaching podium place finishes in all of the women's events. Two Dutch speed skaters were responsible for five of their country's six medals: Piet Kleine won the men's 10,000 metres and came second in the 5,000 metres, while Hans van Helden secured bronze medals in the same events and also in the 1,500 metres. Before these Games, Great Britain's last Winter Olympic medal had been a gold at the 1964 Games, also held in Innsbruck. Twelve years later in the same city, the British team won again a single gold medal, this time by figure skater John Curry in the men's singles with a still-standing record total score. The two bronze medals won by Swedish athletes were not enough to prevent this team's performance from becoming the weakest ever in the nation's Winter Olympic history.|$|E
