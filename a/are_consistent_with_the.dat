5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago).

The most recent of these barriers was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E

Based on citations and supporting reasoning, the most reliable estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10Gy(n) + 1.14 Gy(γ) for Slotin and 2 Gy(n) + 1.1 Gy(γ) for Daghlian.

The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and a profusion of dikes within the breccia—but not in adjacent country rock—provide further evidence of the Silverthrone Caldera. Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced results that <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by degassed magma {{left behind by the}} caldera-forming eruption. The pre-caldera lava domes were generated either directly from a common magma chamber or indirectly through secondary chambers. The lead isotope ratios <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> volcano having formed at the edge of an area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age. Incapillo magmas probably formed as adakitic high-pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust, either directly by anatexis or indirectly by dragged-down crustal fragments. The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and fractional crystallization. As the subducting slab shallowed, crustal garnet-containing lherzolite and granulite-eclogite, contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab, became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas. Eventually, the Incapillo magma chamber was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust.|$|E
