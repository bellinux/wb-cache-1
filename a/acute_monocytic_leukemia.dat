In leukemia the oxygen consumption of 0. 2 cc/hr sternal bone marrow shows an increase as compared with that of normal persons, and the degree of this increase differs according to the form of diseases. The grade of such an increase is in the descending order of that in acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous <b>leukemia,</b> <b>acute</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

40|$|With the sternal {{bone marrow}} {{obtained}} from various leukemias definitely diagnosed by their bone-marrow tissue culture the author measured the glycolysis in the sternal bone marrow and obtained the following results. 1. Anaerobic glycolysis of 0. 2 cc/hr sternal bone marrow in leukemia is markedly increased {{as compared with}} that in normal persons, and the grads of such an increase differs according to the form of diseases. Pointing out the form of leukemias from the greater to the lesser acceleration in the anaerobic glycolysis, {{they are in the}} order of acute lymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> <b>acute</b> myelogenous <b>leukemia,</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 2. The acceleration of X(M) (N) (2) /K is most marked in acute myelogenous <b>leukemia</b> followed by <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and in chronic myelogenous leukemia it is close to the normal value, while in lymphocytic leukemia it is less than the normal value. In the case with a higher percentage of immature cells there is an increasing tendency in X(M) (N) (2) /K. 3. With a single exception of chronic lymphocytic leukemia Q(M) (N) (2) is accelerated in every form of leukemia, and in pointing out the ones with marked acceleration and down they are in the order of acute lymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> <b>acute</b> myelogenous <b>leukemia,</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Moreover, those with greater number of nucleated cells and a higher percentage of immature cells in bone marrow the value of Q(M) (N) (2) tends to be greater. 4. The aerobic glycolysis in leukemia does not show any marked difference from that in arachnoiditis adhaesiva, idiopathic ardiaspasmus, diabetes mellitus, hookworm disease, hypoplastic anaemia and Banti's syndrome. 5. The ratio between the oxygen consumption and anaerobic glycolysis (Q(M) (N) (2) /Qo(2)), though less than that in malignant tumor, is higher than normal.

Monocytes express the esterase isoenzyme (termed 'monocyte-specific esterase', MSE) {{that can be}} inhibited by NaF in the alpha-naphthyl acetate cytochemical staining. We examined the expression of MSE in normal cells and primary and cultured leukemia-lymphoma cells. The MSE protein was demonstrated by isoelectric focusing (IEF); MSE mRNA expression was investigated by Northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The following samples were positive for MSE protein and Northern mRNA expression: 20 / 24 monocytic, 4 / 32 myeloid, and 1 / 20 erythroid-megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines, {{but none of the}} 112 lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma cell lines; of the normal purified cell populations only the monocytes were positive whereas, T, B cells, and granulocytes were negative; of primary <b>acute</b> (myelo) <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> cells (CD 14 -positive, FAB M 4 /M 5 morphology) 14 / 20 were Northern mRNA and 11 / 14 IEF protein positive. RT-PCR revealed MSE expression in 29 / 49 Northern-negative lymphoid leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. The RT-PCR signals in monocytic cell lines were on average 50 -fold stronger than the mostly weak trace expression in lymphoid specimens. On treatment with various biomodulators, only all-trans retinoic acid significantly upregulated MSE message and protein levels but could not induce new MSE expression in several leukemia cell lines; lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma increased MSE expression in normal monocytes. Analysis of DNA methylation with sensitive restriction enzymes showed no apparent regulation of gene expression by differential methylation; the MSE gene is evolutionarily conserved among mammalian species; the half-life of the human MSE transcripts was about 5 - 6 h. The extent of MSE expression varied greatly among different <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> samples. However, the MSE overexpression in a significant number of specimens was not associated with gene amplification, gross structural rearrangements or point mutations within the cDNA region. Taken together, the results suggest that MSE expression is not absolutely specific for, but strongly associated with cells of the monocytic lineage; MSE is either not expressed at all or expressed at much lower levels in cells from other lineages. The biological significance, if any, of rare MSE messages in lymphoid cells detectable only by the hypersensitive RT-PCR remains unclear. Further studies on the regulation of this gene and on the physiological function of the enzyme will no doubt be informative with respect to its striking overexpression in some malignant cells and to a possible role in the pathobiology of <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemias...</b>|$|R

40|$|By {{performing}} {{a series of}} bone-marrow tissue culture of patients with various blood diseases by simple method the author studied the tissue growht and the wandering velocity of mature neutrophils, and arrived at the following conclusions: 1. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia the tissue growth is excellent, but the wandering velocity of mature neutrophils is somewhat decreased. In the cases of <b>acute</b> myelogenous <b>leukemia</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> the rate of relative growht is somewhat lower than {{in the case of}} normal persons: and the wandering velocity of mature neutrophils shows a markedly low value. The boundary of the growth zone is sharply demarcated, and the cell density index is high, presenting the growth pattern chareteristic to leukemia. 2. In the case of hypoplastic anemia the tissue growth is extremely poor; and the wandering velocity of mature neutrophils is markedly low, showing an increase of fat cells in the explant. 3. In the case of Banti's disease the tissue growth is rather poor, and the wandering velocity of mature meutrophils is low. 4. In the case of essential hypochromic anemia both the tissue growth rate and the wandering velocity of mature neutrophils are identical with those of normal persons. 5. In the case of agranulocytosis the tissue growth is extremely poor, and showing no increase of fat cells in the explant, the treatment with ACTH, however, improves the bone marrow function strikingly. 6. In the case of pernicious anemia the wandering velociyt of mature neutrophils is accelerted by the presence of vitamin B(12) in the medium. These findings by this method of culture coincide almost exactly with those by the conventional method, and it is believed that this method can be widely used in clinics due to its simplicity manipulation...|$|R

No guidelines exist for treatment. Case Report: We herein describe the case of a 78 -year-old Caucasian man who presented with acute myeloid leukemia M 5, leukostasis with a white count of 340 000 /ml, and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 7. 7 /dL. The patient was initially treated with leukapheresis and 3 days of idarubicin in the setting of continuous renal replacement therapy that resulted in rapid reversal of his renal failure. He then received 7 days of continuous infusion cy-tarabine and went into a complete remission. Conclusions: Renal failure may complicate the presentation of AML but can be reversible with treatment. Dose adjustment of the chemotherapy is not needed and the treatment can be greatly facilitated with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, as indicated in our case report.

RT-PCR using MORF forward and CBP reverse primers amplified a MORF-CBP fusion in which nucleotide 3103 of MORF was fused in-frame with nucleotide 284 of CBP. Nested RT-PCR with CBP forward and MORF reverse primers generated a CBP-MORF transcript in which nucleotide 283 of CBP was fused in-frame with nucleotide 3104 of MORF. Genomic analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron 16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near the breakpoints. A database search using MORF cDNA enabled us to construct an exon-intron map of the MORF gene. The MORF-CBP protein retains the zinc fingers, two nuclear localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, a portion of the acidic domain of MORF and the CBP protein downstream of codon 29. Thus, the part of CBP encoding the RARA-binding domain, the CREB-binding domain, the three Cys/His-rich regions, the bromodomain, the HAT domain and the Glu-rich domains is present. In the reciprocal CBP-MORF, part of the acidic domain and the C-terminal Ser- and Met-rich regions of MORF are likely to be driven by the CBP promoter.

Poisson regression models included terms for age, sex, family history, period, and socioeco-nomic index.

40|$|Hypoxia {{inducible}} transcription factors (HIFs) are {{the main}} regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxia and are often activated in solid tumors, but their role in leukemia is less clear. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in particular, controversial new findings indicate that HIF- 1 β can act either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene, and this may depend {{on the stage of}} leukemia development and/or the AML sub-type. In this study, we find that HIF- 1 β promotes leukemia progression in the <b>acute</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> sub-type of AML through activation of an invasive phenotype. By applying a list of validated HIF- 1 β-target genes to different AML sub-types, we identified a HIF- 1 β signature that typifies <b>acute</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> when compared with all other AML sub-types. We validated expression of this signature in cell lines and primary cells from AML patients. Interestingly, this signature is enriched for genes that control cell motility at different levels. As a consequence, inhibiting HIF- 1 β impaired leukemia cell migration, chemotaxis, invasion and transendothelial migration in vitro, and this resulted in impaired bone marrow homing and leukemia progression in vivo. Our data suggest that in <b>acute</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> an active HIF- 1 β-dependent pro-invasive pathway mediates the ability of leukemic cells to migrate and invade extramedullary sites and may be targeted to reduce leukemia dissemination...|$|E

40|$|High {{expression}} of the chemokine receptor 4, CXCR 4, associated with a negative prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia, is related to hypoxia. Because CXCR 4 expression is under the post-transcriptional control of microRNA- 146 a in normal and leukemic monocytic cells, we first investigated the impact of hypoxia on microRNA- 146 a and CXCR 4 expression during monocytopoiesis and in <b>acute</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia.</b> We then analyzed the effects of hypoxia on drug sensitivity of CXCR 4 -expressing leukemic cells. We found that microRNA- 146 a is a target of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α or - 2 α {{in relation to the}} stage of monocytopoiesis and the level of hypoxia, and demonstrated the regulation of the microRNA- 146 a/CXCR 4 pathway by hypoxia in monocytes derived from CD 34 (+) cells. Thus, in myeloid leukemic cell lines, hypoxia-mediated control of the microRNA- 146 a/CXCR 4 pathway depends only on the capacity of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α to up-regulate microRNA- 146 a, which in turn decreases CXCR 4 expression. However, at variance with normal monocytic cells and leukemic cell lines, in <b>acute</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> overexpressing CXCR 4, hypoxia up-modulates microRNA- 146 a but fails to down-modulate CXCR 4 expression. We then investigated the effect of hypoxia on the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapy alone or in combination with stromal-derived factor- 1 α. We found that hypoxia increases stromal-derived factor- 1 α-induced survival of leukemic cells by decreasing their sensitivity to anti-leukemic drugs. Altogether, our results demonstrate that hypoxia-mediated regulation of microRNA- 146 a, which controls CXCR 4 expression in monocytic cells, is lost in <b>acute</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> thus contributing to maintaining CXCR 4 overexpression and protecting the cells from anti-leukemic drugs in the hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment...|$|E
40|$|A case of {{pyruvate}} kinase deficiency anemia associated with <b>acute</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> is reported with {{a review of the}} literature. A 57 -year-old man who was treated for diabetes mellitus at a nearby hospital was admitted to our hospital for precise examination of the progression of anemia. Blood examination showed RBC 207 × 10 ⁴/μl, Hb 5. 9 g/dl, Ht 18 %, reticulocytes 134 ‰, WBC 5, 200 /μl, platelets 9. 3 × 10 ⁴/μl, indirect bilirubin 0. 6 mg/dl, serum iron 112 μg/dl, haptoglobin under 10 μg/dl. After admission to our hospital, serum indirect bilirubin level was increased to 2. 3 mg/dl, and pancytopenia was noted in the peripheral blood. the half life span of erythrocytes had shortened to 16 days. A bone marrow examination revealed prominent erythroid hyperplasia. More detailed examination of this hemolysis revealed {{pyruvate kinase}} deficiency of erythrocytes. Three months after admission, blast cells were noted in the peripheral blood and they increased progressively. The bone marrow contained 43. 6 % of blast cells. Subsequently, a diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> was made. Although intensive chemotherapy was performed, the patient achieved no remission and died 6 months after admission to our hospital...|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> by means of bone marrow tissue culture, the author has {{obtained}} the following results: 1. The rate of relative increase of the growth area fell down approximately to one third that of the control, but the cellular density in the growth area increased remarkably; and the boundary of the growth area was sharply defined from the surrounding area, indicating a marked acceleration of the cellular proliferative activity in this disease. 2. From the very characteristics of morphological findings, process of maturation, and superiority in numbers over other cellular series, in monocytic series appearing in the growth area, {{it is easy to}} make differential diagnosis of <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> from other leukemias. 3. The juvenile type of the cells in monocytic series makes it possible to differentiate from other juvenile calls by the characteristic findings in morphology, thus enabling us to distinguish <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> from other <b>leukemias.</b> 4. <b>Monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> and reticuloendotheliosis that have been commonly believed {{for a long time to}} be the same are really two entirely different diseases...|$|R
