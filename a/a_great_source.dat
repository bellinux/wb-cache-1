5|$|Although Edna Diefenbaker {{had been}} devoted to {{advancing}} her husband's career, in the mid-1940s she began to suffer mental illness, and {{was placed in a}} private mental hospital for a time. She later fell ill from leukemia, and died in 1951. In 1953, Diefenbaker married Olive Palmer (formerly Olive Freeman), whom he had courted while living in Wakaw. Olive Diefenbaker became <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>source</b> of strength to her husband. There were no children born of either marriage.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>source</b> of income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but {{can be used for}} coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>source</b> of pride for the white community, {{as well as for}} some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E
50|$|After the 15th century, the {{ironworks}} {{were moved}} further {{down into the}} valley, closer to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>source</b> of water needed for the process, and Jesenice became the main industrial and administrative centre. Iron ore was still mined close to the village in the Sava Caves (Savske jame) area until the early 20th century.|$|R

[...] High concentrations {{of lead in}} the ore from which gold was being extracted led to a lead poisoning epidemic in the state, requiring national and international intervention to remediate affected areas and provide medical care to children with severe lead poisoning.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there are}} about 78,000 gun dealers in the U.S., ATF {{suggested}} that gun shows, thefts and private sales may be <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>source</b> of trafficked Mexican guns than licensed dealers. Gun smugglers are known to coerce or pay U.S. residents or citizens to purchase semi-automatic rifles and other firearms from gun shops or gun shows and then transfer them to a cartel representative.This exchange {{is known as a}} straw purchase.|$|R

50|$|By {{differentiating}} {{itself from}} competitors, a business might have greater potential income. Because having differentiated {{goods or services}} limits the choices of consumers, which drive them to purchase goods or services from a particular company. In addition to that, the threats brought by competitors would be lowered significantly, which means, by adopting differentiation strategy, it would allow businesses to be more competitive {{and be able to}} have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>source</b> of income.|$|R

25|$|Strauss married soprano Pauline de Ahna on 10 September 1894. She {{was famous}} for being irascible, garrulous, {{eccentric}} and outspoken, but to all appearances the marriage was essentially happy, and she was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>source</b> of inspiration to him. Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final Four Last Songs of 1948, he preferred the soprano voice to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles.|$|E
25|$|Beveridge's {{arguments}} were widely accepted. He appealed to conservatives and other sceptics {{by arguing that}} welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions out of corporate ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would also serve as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>source</b> of demand for British goods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Given an {{appropriate}} imaging resolution, a common Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) model assumes that object under study {{is composed of}} piecewise constant materials, so that MRI produces piecewise constant images. The intensity inhomogeneity (IIH) is modeled by a multiplicative inhomogeneity field. It {{is due to the}} spatial inhomogeneity in the excitatory Radio Frequency (RF) signal and other effects. It has been acknowledged as <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>source</b> of error for automatic segmentation algorithms than additive noise. We propose a new non parametric IIH correction algorithm where the Self Organizing Map (SOM) is used to estimate the IIH field. ...|$|R

In 2009 he was chosen as the greatest Scot by the Scottish public in a vote run by Scottish television channel STV.|$|E
25|$|After the {{establishment}} of Hampshire County Council, following the act in 1888, Southampton became a county borough within the county of Hampshire, which meant that it had many features of a county, but governance was now shared between the Corporation in Southampton and the new county council. There is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>source</b> of confusion {{in the fact that}} the ancient shire county, along with its associated assizes, was known as the County of Southampton or Southamptonshire. This was officially changed to Hampshire in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries. Southampton became a non-metropolitan district in 1974.|$|E

Other units may attempt to steal the guidon to demoralize or antagonize the unit. Veteran soldiers know not to give up the guidon to anyone outside their unit, but new recruits may be tempted into relinquishing it by a superior, especially during a unit run.|$|E

50|$|Ubinas {{is located}} 230 km {{east of the}} Peru-Chile trench and about 150 km above the Wadati-Benioff zone, where the Nazca plate is subducting at a dip ranging from 20 - 30˚ as {{characteristic}} of the CVZ. The steep dip angle of the subducting plate can correspond to a thicker wedge of asthenosphere and therefore <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>source</b> of fertile mantle material. Some volcanologists believe that this variation in dip angle along the Nazca Lines is responsible for activity in the Andean volcanic zones and the areas of inactivity in between them. Ticsani, Ubinas and Huaynaputina sit on a volcanic lineament slightly oblique to the main volcanic front.|$|R
