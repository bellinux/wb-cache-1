50|$|In case T 307/03, which {{related to}} a pending divisional {{application}} of a granted European patent, three requests were pending. In the main request, the subject-matter of claim 1 corresponded exactly to the subject-matter of claim 3 when dependent on claim 1 of the granted European patent (that is, the patent granted on the parent application). The claim was therefore objected for double patenting and the main request was not allowed into the proceedings. The first <b>auxiliary</b> <b>request</b> was not allowed into the proceedings for essentially the same reasons. Finally, in the second <b>auxiliary</b> <b>request,</b> the subject-matter of the main claim encompassed by the subject-matter of claim 3 of the parent application as granted. This request was also not allowed into the proceedings on the ground of double patenting. The divisional application was therefore refused.|$|R
50|$|Jesse was {{a son of}} King Leon of Kakheti by {{his first}} wife Tinatin Gurieli. As a young prince, Jesse was placed by his father {{at the head of}} the Georgian <b>auxiliaries</b> <b>requested</b> by the Safavid shah Tahmasp I during his war with the Ottoman Empire (1532-55). After the {{conclusion}} of the peace, Jesse was left as a hostage in Iran, where he converted to Islam and became known as 'Isa Khan Gorji. In 1558 or 1560 he was made by Shah Tahmasp I governor of Shaki, a Muslim city close to the border of his homeland. At his investiture, he was also elevated to the rank of farzand ("son") by the Safavid king.|$|R

30|$|Other {{academic}} courses. On {{the second}} semester of 2011, a semi presencial (on site) setting was tried on an XP laboratory course given {{on a different}} Brazilian state. In this special edition, the course was given to 15 PhD students {{in the period of}} 2  months. After the initial lectures on XP practices, the professor visited the students two times during the development process and one last time {{at the end of the}} project. To overcome distance problems, some approaches were taken: an environment was set up to allow a distributed tracking of the projects, each student was responsible for reading, and possibly sharing, some agile methods related material, and all the discussions were done (or commented on in the mailing lists). The feedback provided by the students was very positive, as a student reported: “The general set up of the course was very good: a theoretical introduction on XP, <b>auxiliary</b> reading <b>requests</b> about related topics, and lots of practice (...) I learned a lot in these 2  months, but still, I learned more about my personal and team experiences”. Also another student outlined: “The discipline is very practical, which is very stimulating. I enjoyed dealing with customers and systems that would be actually used”.|$|R
25|$|As the {{defenders}} were running low on supplies, about 4,000 of starving <b>auxiliaries</b> (servants) <b>requested</b> {{to leave the}} city; they were granted permission, but soon after leaving the town walls they were taken captive by the Tatars; some were taken into jasyr while others were executed on spot. Despite that, others wanted to leave the town, but prince Wiśniowiecki promised to feed them rather than risk another massacre. The besiegers also tried to send messages to the king asking for reinforcements, and in early August a volunteer messenger, Mikołaj Skrzetuski, managed to sneak past the besiegers and reached the king around 6 or 7 August; he would later inspire the fictional character Jan Skrzetuski in Henryk Sienkiewicz's The Trilogy. In the meantime, the Cossack and Tatars would try to extend their fortifications closer to the defender's line; they launched their last large assault on 6 August, but were defeated once more. Soon afterward the Cossack and Tatar sent off {{a large chunk of}} their forces under Bohdan Khmelnytsky to intercept the nearing royal reinforcements under John II Casimir at Zboriv; the resulting battle ended in the Treaty of Zboriv of 17 August. In the meantime, at Zbarazh, the besiegers even managed to successfully dig a tunnel into the Polish-Lithuanian camp around 16 August, but it was destroyed by {{the defenders}}.|$|R
40|$|Following a brief {{description}} of multi-state insolvency theories and the different types of jurisdiction exercisable by a court, this paper examines jurisdiction in corporate insolvency within Australia. It begins with the constitutional context and then addresses geographical jurisdiction; jurisdiction to prescribe conduct, and jurisdiction to adjudicate between parties. It briefly touches upon the notion of an inherent jurisdiction to adjudicate in liquidation and on jurisdiction for proceedings during the course of, rather than on the adjudication of, a liquidation. The discussion on jurisdiction to adjudicate in a multi-state liquidation in Australia addresses winding up of a foreign company under Part 5. 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) as well as topics such as forum non conveniens; lis alibi pendens; anti-suit injunctions; and the notion of discretion to exercise jurisdiction to wind up a company. The jurisdiction to provide aid and <b>auxiliary</b> assistance upon <b>request</b> from a foreign court is also touched upon briefly...|$|R
40|$|Web {{services}} are {{the backbone of}} WISDOM system, an information and visualisation system supporting decision makers {{in the fields of}} water related management processes based on open source technologies. They enable the distributed and loosely coupled, component based architecture of the system. In cooperating OGC compliant web services for data access, visualisation and data processing the system is extendible to external data resources and other proprietary software solutions. The base idea behind the designed and prototypically implemented WISDOM techniques is the orchestration of decoupled web resources representing data sets and functionality to model more complex business processes quite easily. The system covers most aspects of administrative business processes including spatial and non-spatial data ingestion and dissemination, necessary data processing and visualisation techniques. In combination with a semantics enabled data management WISDOM system is capable of producing value added information products to water management related tasks autonomously. These compound data and processing resource chains are implemented to facilitate certain identified business processes in regional administration. Clients like data and information explorers supporting manual interaction as human machine interfaces or automated data access of value adding operations accomplish, respectively trigger these integrative chains. As an example the same data and processing infrastructure is used to visualise data in map clients as WMS or access data as WCS, resp. WFS for further processing which can furthermore trigger additional actions like feeding reports or <b>requesting</b> <b>auxiliary</b> data. 1...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{developments}} in solar technologies demonstrated that the solar central receiver configuration is the most promising application among concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. In CSPs solar-heated air {{can be used as}} the working fluid in a Brayton thermal cycle and as the heat transfer fluid for a Rankine thermal cycle as an alternative to more traditional working fluids thereby reducing maintenance operations and providing the power section with a higher degree of flexibility To supply thermal needs when the solar source is unavailable, an <b>auxiliary</b> burner is <b>requested.</b> This configuration is adopted in the Julich CSP (J-CSP) plant, operating in Germany and characterized by a nominal power of 1. 5 MW, the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is air which is heated in the solar tower and used to produce steam for the bottoming Rankine cycle. In this paper, the J-CSP plant with thermal energy storage has been compared with a hybrid CSP plant (H-CSP) using air as the working fluid. Thermodynamic and economic performances of all the simulated plants have been evaluated by applying both exergy analysis and thermoeconomic analysis (TA) to determine the yearly average operation at nominal conditions. The exergy destructions and structure as well as the exergoeconomic costs of products have been derived for all the components of the plants. Based on the obtained results, the thermoeconomic design evaluation and optimization of the plants has been performed, allowing for improvement of the thermodynamic and economic efficiency of the systems as well as decreasing the exergy and exergoeconomic cost of their products...|$|R
50|$|The {{granting}} of legal aid {{by the court}} requires that the applicant proves that the claimant is (a) economically not able to bear {{the costs of the}} procedures, and (b) that his lawsuit has reasonable prospects of success, and (c) that the cause of action is not frivolous. The application for legal aid is typically lodged together with the draft of the complaint with the bench of the competent court. This has the advantage for the legal aid applicant that he is provisionally relieved of the payment of the court costs while the bench not only reviews his economic status but also determines the merits of the case, i.e. as to whether the lawsuit appears to have reasonable prospect of success, based merely on the facts and arguments as presented in the draft complaint. Thus, a summary review of the cause of action is carried out by the court. Only if all conditions are met and legal aid thus granted will the court communicate the complaint to the other party and the judicial dispute thereby commences with the costs borne by the court. However, the legal aid seeking litigant can also lodge effectively the complaint together with <b>auxiliary</b> legal aid <b>request</b> but without making the pendency of the case dependent on the court granting legal aid; or the litigant requests legal aid support at a later stage but before completion of case procedures. In the latter scenarios, if legal aid is rejected by the court the litigant, who sought legal aid, will bear the counsel and court fees if he loses the lawsuit (or bears the costs partially if he loses partially). Defence cases are treated equivalently.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{internationalization}} trend and in order to take the opportunities that exist nowadays in the worldwide market, all kind of companies have now a global presence (Veerecke and Veerecke, 2007); in fact, the globalization could be defined as “an emerging trend of global markets for consumer goods with a significant and unexpected magnitude” (Levitt, 1983). Other authors have described it as “the reality of a global competition” (Prahalad and Doz, 1987) or (the) “new globalization era” (Dicken, 1986; Barlett y Ghoshal, 1989). Therefore, and in order to provide an answer to this homogenization of markets around the world the internationalization is a strategic business decision (Welch and Loustarinen, 1988; Root, 1994; Rialp, 1999, Villareal, 2005). The main factors driving the internationalization phenomenon a r e (Ferdows, 1997 a; Farrell, 2006) : off shoring, entering new markets, disaggregating and reengineering the value chain, and creating new products and market. Anyhow, there are other complementary reasons as risk diversification (Thompson and Strickland, 2004; Jarillo and Martinez, 1991), achieving economies of scale (Deresky, 2000), capitalizing major investments and compensating the reduced life cycle (Yip and Bink, 2007; Jarillo and Martinez, 1991) and acquiring prestige (Jarillo and Martinez, 1991). Concerning operations, its internationalization is understood as enterprise resources deployment beyond their home country, i. e. locating people and assets in order to carry out primary activities of the value chain. Thus, the internationalization of manufacturing networks means carrying out disaggregated value chain activities (i. e. engineering, purchasing, manufacturing and distribution) beyond a company’s home country, which requires greater coordination in order to get acceptable levels of quality, flexibility and cost (De Meyer et al., 1989). Therefore, it is important to take into account that increased commitment abroad does not only promise opportunities, as it is also fraught with risk. For this reason, the relocation of production, as well as <b>auxiliary</b> activities, <b>request</b> a careful balancing of risks and benefits (Lewin and Peeters, 2006). The internationalization of operations can take different forms. However, the process of starting up a facility and the supply configuration {{are some of the most}} difficult decisions to make (Barnes, 2002) because they imply a lot of risks (Schoenherr et al., 2008; Kinkel and Maloca 2009; Lampel and Bhalla, 2011). These risks do not only apply for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs), but also for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Strategic Business Units (SBUs) from Corporations, which resources are usually more limited (Kalinic and Forza, 2012). Although there is a lot of research about international process, the literature review reveals a gap regarding two common challenges of Global Operations configuration: the implementation of new production plants overseas and the development of the corresponding supply network [...] When companies are migrating to a global strategy, managers face both a variety of choices (due to a rapidly changing product and process technologies) and challenges (because of a global competitive environment, informed customers, demanding owners, and environmental and political factors). Furthermore, nowadays the market requirements are not static anymore, becoming dynamics, i. e. that the initial operations design and configuration should adopt a network perspective, that is, not only focusing on an isolated facility or plant). This point of view implies a volatile and dynamic environment, adaptability to product demand changes, flexibility to product demand variety, upgradability to process engineering, selective operability and contingency operability. In these cases, frameworks are helpful to organize the important issues into a structure that enables companies to understand and be aware those issues. Specifically, propose understandable frameworks to explain how to accomplish the design and management of global networks (Vereecke and Van Dierdonck, 2002; Shi, 2003) within an internationalization process is crucial for SMEs and SBUs because they have limited resources (Kalinic and Forza, 2012). Additionally, more research is needed to understand how to design and keep the coordination of the global supply network with different delivery times and procurement reliability (Meixell and Gargeya, 2005; Abele et al., 2008). On the other hand, it is also needed to provide frameworks of international manufacturing systems that take into account the necessary requirements for the next generation factories. These facilities will need to be modular, scalable, flexible, open, agile and capable of adapting, in real time, to the continuously changing market requirements, technology options and regulations (Vereecke and Van Dierdonck, 2002; Shi, 2003; Kinkel and Maloca, 2009, Azvedo and Almeida, 2011). Hence, this doctoral thesis identifies the most important challenges related to Global Operations configuration for industrial manufacturing companies in an internationalization process and proposes a decision-making Framework called GlobOpe (Global Operations) focused on SMEs and SBUs. This Framework bears in mind the Operations Strategy key decisions that need to be made regarding a global production and logistic network design and configuration for industrial manufacturing companies in the internationalization process. This Framework consists of new facility decision drivers, operations management principles, operations’ key decisions, and potential methods and techniques for aiding the decision process. Despite GlobOpe Framework tries to solve the three core challenges related to operations configuration such as “New Facility Implementation”, “Global Suppliers Network Development” and “Multi-site Production Network Configuration”; the goal of this thesis is to find out a solution for the first two challenges, going deeper into the most critical step: the Analysis Stage. Bearing in mind the facility life cycle (Analysis, Start up, Stability, Improvement and Excellence), GlobOpe for New Facility Implementation (GlobOpe for NFI) exposes which are the strategic decisions that should be made within each stage and proposes principles, techniques and/or tools in order to increase effectiveness and decrease ramp-up delays in time and volume. It would also support the design and configuration of the associated suppliers network. Hence, it could be a management tool for a Steering Committee that is responsible for the effectiveness and efficiency of Global Operations. As in GlobOpe for NFI, the Analysis, Start up, Stability, Improvement and Excellence Stages are considered, but in the case of GlobOpe for Global Suppliers Network Development (GlobOpe for GSND), they are related to the purchasinginternationalization degree or global purchasing maturity levels that any company can achieve. Specifically, these stages are: Domestic or Local purchasing, Close International purchasing and Worldwide/Global purchasing. GlobOpe for GSND along with the principles, techniques and/or tools proposed could be a useful tool in order to aid Steering Committee to develop and design an accurate and reliable global supply network. The usefulness of GlobOpe Framework (GlobOpe for NFI and GlobOpe for GSND) has been tested in the action research carried out in a wind generator company and a clothing company respectively. Then, the multiple case studies and the unstructured interviews have allowed ratifying the Framework validation in the academic and business world...|$|R
