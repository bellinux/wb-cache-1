The relative SPD curves provided by many manufacturers may have been produced using 10nm increments or more on their spectroradiometer.

Currently, recommended prevention measures can include type-of-exposure-based respirator protection for persons engaged in agriculture, construction and others working outdoors in endemic areas.

25|$|Somers lies on {{an area of}} land on the {{south-eastern}} {{point of}} the Mornington Peninsula, where to the south, it borders Western Port. The town of Cowes on Phillip Island {{can be seen from}} any beach in Somers in most weather conditions. There are two large sandbars between Somers and Phillip Island, and between them is a deep shipping channel. At low tide both sandbars are often visible. To the north, inland, lies extensively cleared lands used for agriculture. Further north lie the suburbs of Bittern and Hastings which host many commercial services used by Somers residents. To the east is the suburb and military base, HMAS Cerberus. Its compound bordering Somers is entirely bushland and used for training exercises. Where the base meets Somers at its coastline, beaches are closed and the land consists mainly of bushy coastal forests. To the west, separated from the Lord Somers Camp and the Coolart Wetlands, lies the locality of Balnarring. Somers' geography slopes gently down towards the water's edge, interrupting line of sight to Mt. Dandenong and as a result, television reception can be difficult when using a small antenna. Local knowledge is <b>advisable</b> <b>for</b> good reception.|$|E
