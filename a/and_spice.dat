5|$|This Croatian {{vineyard}} contained {{just nine}} Crljenak Kaštelanski vines mixed {{with thousands of}} other vines. In 2002, additional vines known locally as Pribidrag {{were found in the}} Dalmatian coastal town of Omiš. Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards, although virus infections have delayed their release. The first Croatian ZPC wine was made by Edi Maletić in 2005. Meanwhile, plantings of Primitivo have increased in California, where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling. Its wines are reputed to have more blackberry <b>and</b> <b>spice</b> flavors.|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{from the}} {{literature}} suggests that herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> <b>and</b> their components, such as cinna-mon, garlic, curcumin, and capsaicin, may have beneficial effects on health and behavioral outcomes. These outcomes characterize age-related chronic diseases, and the effects reported here may be mediated by the antioxidant actions of herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices.</b> The inclusion of herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> in protective dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean and Okinawan diets, {{may play a role}} in contributing to their effects. Conversely, a paucity of herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> may be linked to the detrimental health outcomes associated with the Western diet. The food or meal vehicle providing the herb or spice should also be considered when translating to dietary advice to preserve the beneficial role within a specific dietary pattern. Encouragement of a diet rich in herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> may also improve acceptability of protective dietary patterns, suggesting that the impact of herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> on healthy aging may be multifaceted...|$|R

5|$|On September23 Janet passed {{directly}} between Grenada and Carriacou in the Grenadines, killing 122people in {{the island}} chain. An airport on Grenada was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds. Eight {{people were killed in}} a small town adjacent to the airport. Strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses, and unroofed a hotel in St. George's, Grenada. Houses were also unroofed, and balconies of government offices in St. George's were torn off. All bridges {{in the island}}'s interior regions collapsed, <b>and</b> <b>spice</b> crops sustained heavy damage. An estimated 75% of nutmeg plantations were destroyed, along with nearly all of the island's banana and cocoa crops. Three ships were also grounded in the local harbor. In The Carenage, the waterfront region of St. George's, debris was scattered and an 820ft (250m) pier collapsed. St. Vincent was mostly destroyed, and St. Lucia suffered significant coastal damage. Over $2.8million in damages were estimated throughout the Grenadines. Farther south, in Port of Spain, a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed, killing ten people.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its {{affinity}} for oak, either during fermentation or in barrel aging. In addition to having a softening effect on the grape's naturally high tannins, the unique wood flavors of vanilla <b>and</b> <b>spice</b> complement the natural grape flavors of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 liter (59 gallon) barrique were a significant influence in making that barrel size one {{of the most}} popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of oak influence (as well as which type of oak) will have a strong impact on the resulting wine. American oak, particularly from new barrels, imparts stronger oak flavors that are less subtle than those imparted by French oak. Even within the American oak family, the location of the oak source also plays a role with oak from the state of Oregon having more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than oak from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of oak barrels from different locations and of different ages and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli are {{the most}} {{commonly}} present bacterium in the human intestine, which helps in preventing the entry of pathogenic microorganisms. E. coli are non-pathogenic in normal conditions, but if present in excess, will become causative agent of various diseases like urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, vomiting etc. With increasing resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics, there is a shift of choice from allopathic to ayurvedic and naturopathy, where herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> are very common ingredients of medicines. Herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> are used in Indian recipes as they impart aroma and flavour to it. Most of the studies performed to check sensitivity of microorganisms for various herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> involve extraction of the active component(s) with some organic solvents. However, when these plant products are used as ingredients of food, the effectiveness of extracts using organic solvents {{should not be a}} criterion. In the present study, frequently used herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> are selected, their extracts are made using distilled water and tested for its antimicrobial effect against E. coli the most common intestinal non pathogenic organism. The antibacterial effect of various herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> were evaluated using various methods.

25|$|The {{precursor}} of the Folger Coffee Company {{was founded in}} 1850 in San Francisco, California, U.S., as the Pioneer Steam Coffee <b>and</b> <b>Spice</b> Mills. The owner, William H. Bovee, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans, and roast and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired James A. Folger as a carpenter. James had arrived from Nantucket Island {{at the age of}} 15 with his two older brothers during the California Gold Rush. In the 1850s, kerosene began to offer a cheaper alternative to whale oil, which had been Nantucket's life-blood, resulting in the re-purposing of many of its ships to bring coffee from South America to San Francisco. After working at Bovee’s mill for nearly a year, James had saved enough money to stake a claim in the company and headed out to mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of The Pioneer Steam Coffee <b>and</b> <b>Spice</b> Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company to J.A. Folger & Co.|$|E
