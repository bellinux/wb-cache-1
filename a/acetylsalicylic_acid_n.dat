40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) frequently cause pseudoallergic reactions. Recognition of {{two different}} prostaglandin synthase iso-enzymes {{led to the development}} of the so-called coxibs preferentially inhibiting cyclooxygenase- 2. We studied tolerability of valdecoxib preferentially inhibitng cyclooxygenase- 2 in patients with a history of intolerance to NSAIDs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 41 patients (30 female, 11 male, age 14 - 74 years) with a history of intolerance to NSAIDs underwent scratch tests with these drugs and valdecoxib, followed by oral challenge with valdecoxib (maximum single dose: 20 mg; cumulative dose: 35 mg) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. RESULTS: The history of intolerance to NSAID comprised urticaria as the leading symptom (n = 26), followed by angioedema (n = 11) and anaphylactoid shock (n = 4). 21 patients reported reactions to only one NSAID, 15 identified 2 different triggering drugs, and 5 patients showed reactions to 3 different NSAIDs. <b>Acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>n</b> = 20) and diclofenac (n = 12) were the most frequent causative drugs. Upon oral challenge with valdecoxib, one patient developed generalized urticaria within 30 minutes following the last dose of valdecoxib; symptoms resolved after i. v. injection of 2 mg clemastine and 250 mg prednisolone. All other patients tolerated the oral challenge without adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Our results are in line with previous studies suggesting that preferential cyclooxygenase- 2 -inhibitors may safely be used by patients with known intolerance to NSAIDs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine whether acute inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme restores impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in patients with chronic heart failure. Background. Recent reports have demonstrated that endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by cholinergic stimuli is attenuated in the peripheral vascular bed of patients with chronic heart failure. Methods. We {{examined the effects of}} local intraarterial infusion of enalaprilat (0. 6 μg/min per 100 ml tissue volume) on responses inflated by acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside in the forearm vascular bed in 8 normal subjects, 12 patients with mild heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classes I and II) and 10 patients with more advanced heart failure (functional classes III and IV). Forearm blood flow was measured by means of venous occlusion plethysmography. Results. Although enalaprilat alone did not affect basal forearm blood flow, it significantly augmented the increase in forearm blood flow induced by acetylcholine in normal subjects (p < 0. 01) and in those with mild heart failure (p < 0. 05). However, the effect was not found in patients with more advanced heart failure. Coinfusion of enalaprilat did not enhance sodium nitroprussideinduced vasodilation in any of the groups. To explore the mechanism of the inhibitor's effect, an additional 20 patients with mild heart failure (functional class II) were pretreated with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>n</b> = 10) or an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (n = 10), followed by administration of acetylcholine with or without enalaprilat. Acetylsalicylic acid reduced the converting enzyme inhibitor's effect, whereas NG-monomethyl-l-arginine failed to block tie augmentation of blood flow. Conclusions. These results suggest that inhibition of angiotensinconverting enzyme potentiates endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by cholinergic stimuli, presumably through modulation of prostaglandin metabolism, in the peripheral vasculature of patients with mild chronic heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Background: Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) {{is a rare}} hematologic {{condition}} {{belonging to}} the group of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms. For the diagnosis of PMF, bone marrow histology examination and fibrosis evaluation is mandatory. No recurrent cytogenetic abnormality has been identified and JAK 2 mutation is present only in approximately half of the patients. Treatment is limited mainly to alleviation of B symptoms, splenomegaly and anemia. Only allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) can offer a cure from the disease. A new drug, JAK 2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, that has been available since recently, will change treatment options mainly for patients not eligible for HSCT. Methods: Hipokrat medical database was searched for patients diagnosed with PMF between 2008 – 2012. Data were collected retrospectively and analysed using basic statistics. Results: PMF was newly diagnosed in 28 patients (18 / 64. 3 % men). Two (7. 1 %) patients presented with systemic symptoms and ten (35. 7 %) had enlarged spleen. Their median blood counts and lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH) results were: leukocytes 11. 25 x 109 /l (3. 00 – 72. 00), hemoglobin 117 g/l (68 – 173), platelets 420 x 109 /l (111 – 1477), LDH 7. 45 μkat/l (3. 00 – 20. 71). In six (21. 4 %) patients only bone marrow cytology examination was performed without histologic examination. Cytogenetics was performed in 11 (39. 3 %) patients with three abnormalities detected: complex, + 9 and del(13 q 14). JAK 2 mutation was identified in 12 (60. 0 %) of 20 examined cases. Patients were treated with <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>n</b> = 12 / 42. 9 %), hydroxyurea (n = 12 / 42. 9 %), blood transfusions or epoetins (n = 12), anagrelide (n = 4 / 14. 3 %), methylprednisolone (n = 4 / 14. 3 %), immunomodulatory drugs (n = 3 / 10. 7 %), interferon (n = 2 / 7. 1 %), spleen irradiation (n = 2 / 7. 1 %) and venipunctures (n = 2 / 7. 1 %). At the end of 2011, first eligible patients were treated with ruxolitinib. Conclusions: PMF is a rare disorder with various presentations and treatment suited specifically to patients’ complaints. The treatment is symptomatic with HSCT being the only curable option available. Ruxolitinib will play an importatnt role in PMF treatment in the future...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Upper {{gastrointestinal}} discomfort {{decreases the}} already impaired {{health status of}} patients with cardiovascular disease. AIM: To evaluate whether acid suppressive therapy improves health-related {{quality of life in}} patients who developed upper gastrointestinal symptoms after starting low-dose <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid.</b> METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trail, cardiac patients using low-dose (80 mg) <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> with (<b>n</b> = 142) and without (n = 90) upper gastrointestinal symptoms were included. Patients with symptoms were treated with rabeprazole or placebo for 4 weeks. At baseline and 4 weeks information about gastrointestinal symptoms and health-related quality of life was assessed. RESULTS: The 73 patients assigned to rabeprazole when compared with 69 patients given placebo reported the same quality of life scores 4 weeks after randomization. The differences in quality of life scores between patients with and without symptoms at baseline remained after 4 weeks. Patients in whom treatment led to complete symptom relief or those who remained symptom-free reported significantly higher scores for Physical Component Summary (P < 0. 01) and Mental Component Summary (P < 0. 01), when compared to those with persistent symptoms or new onset symptoms.

40|$|In {{patients}} with TIA or stroke of arterial origin various antiplatelet agents, or combinations of these, {{have been found}} to be effective to reduce the risk of new vascular complications. International guidelines currently recommend three treatment strategies with antiplatelet agents after TIA or stroke: <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in combination with dipyridamole, clopidogrel monotherapy, or alternatively <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> monotherapy. In the Netherlands, current standard antiplatelet therapy after a TIA or stroke is a combination of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> and dipyridamole. Clopidogrel monotherapy is probably equally as effective as the combination of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> and dipyridamole.

The {{aim of the}} study was to {{investigate}} the incidence of peptic ulcers in a population-based cohort using bioequivalent low-dose <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (80 mg) or effervescent calcium carbasalate (100 mg). Methods: Incident <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> or effervescent calcium carbasalate users were identified from the Integrated Primary Care Information database. The study cohort comprised 19, 819 subjects: 11, 891 on <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> and 7928 on effervescent calcium carbasalate. Incidence rates for documented peptic ulcer disease confirmed by endoscopy were calculated and time-dependent adjusted Cox regression analysis was used to compare the risk of peptic ulcers for patients using <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> or effervescent calcium carbasalate. Results: During an average 1. 85 years of follow-up evaluation, 115 ulcers were found. The risk for developing a peptic ulcer during drug use was: 3. 07 per 1000 person-years for <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> and 4. 31 for effervescent calcium carbasalate. The risk of peptic ulcers was not statistically significantly higher in patients using effervescent calcium carbasalate than in <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> users (adjusted hazard ratio, 1. 39; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 92 - 2. 12). Conclusions: The incidence rate of peptic ulcer disease is similar in patients using low-dose effervescent calcium carbasalate compared with regular low-dose <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid.</b> This implicates that peptic ulcers seem to be related to systemic rather than to local effects of low-dose acetylsalicylic aci...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange after experimental acute pulmonary embolism in 12 intact anesthetized dogs. Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated by pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) /cardiac output (Q) plots before and 60 min after autologous blood clot embolization and again 30 min after cyclooxygenase inhibition, either by <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (ASA, <b>n</b> = 6) or by indomethacin (INDO, n = 6). Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique, at a constant intermediate Q, under each of these experimental conditions. Embolization increased Ppa at all levels of Q studied (p less than 0. 001), increased true shunt (p less than 0. 05), and shifted perfusion (Q) and ventilation (VA) distributions to lower and higher VA/Q (p less than 0. 05), respectively. ASA and INDO further shifted Ppa/Q plots toward higher pressures (p less than 0. 05). Concomitantly, the physiologic dead space increased after INDO (p less than 0. 001), and the proportion of lung units with a high VA/Q increased and the inert gas dead space decreased after both ASA (p less than 0. 05) and INDO (p less than 0. 05). We conclude that, in experimental pulmonary embolism, structurally different cyclooxygenase inhibitors aggravate pulmonary hypertension and deteriorate gas exchange by an altered distribution of VA/Q essentially to lung units with a higher than normal VA/Q. These findings may be explained by changes in the distributions of both VA and of Q as a consequence of cyclooxygenase inhibition-associated increases in both bronchial and vascular tone in embolized lung regions. status: publishe...|$|R

Previous sub-analysis of CURE and ACUITY studies suggested that DAPT could bring benefit even for patients treated by surgical revascularization. Sub-analysis of PLATO trial conducted on 1261 patients, who underwent surgical revascularization within 12 months, demonstrated a reduction of cardiovascular and total mortality within a group of patients treated by ticagrelor and <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> compared to patients treated by clopidogrel and <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R

Using the FTIR spectroscopy and statistical data analysis the correlation between different types of aspirin was determined. The content of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> from the analysed samples was determined by the use of UV-VIS spectroscop...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (ASA) is {{a simple}} {{chemical}} compound belonging {{to a group of}} nonsteroidal antiinflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs). The mechanism of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> is based on the inhibition of cyclooxygenase(COX). That enzyme is responsible for the biosynthesis of cyclic prostanoids, i. e. prostaglandins (D 2, E 2, F 2, I 2),thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) and prostacyclin. For this reason ASA {{is one of the most}} popular anti-inflammatorydrugs present on the pharmaceutical market. Due to its ability to inhibit the synthesis of TXA 2 (moleculescapable of platelet activation) ASA is effective in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases such as ischemicheart disease. Clinical trials confirm the efficacy of aspirin in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases inpostmenopausal women. In some cases ASA is unable to inhibit platelet activation. This phenomenon iscalled aspirin resistance. <b>Acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> can also inhibit aromatase activity, therefore it may be used inthe prevention of breast cancer. Many clinical trials confirm that <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> reduces the risk of breastcancer in postmenopausal women. Use of ASA may also increase bone mineral density (BMD). This articledescribes the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of the <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> as well as clinical trialsconducted on postmenopausal women...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the factors that}} induce floral senescence in carnation, we have investigated the effects of various chemical agents on flower senescence. The {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effect of silicon and <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> at different concentrations on carnation flower longevity, ACC-oxidase activity and bacterial population vase solution of cut flowers carnation in laboratory condition. The treatments were distilled water, silicon (0, 1. 5, 2. 5, 3. 5 mM) and <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (0, 1. 5, 3 mM). Results show that 2. 5 mM silicon followed by 3 mM <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> is more effective than 1. 5 and 3 mM silicon alone in improving the vase life of cut carnation flowers. The percent of wilting was minimized as a result of using this combined treatment. However, the percent of wilting increased with the increase in concentrations of silicon and <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid.</b> Silicon at level 2. 5 mM retarded the chlorophyll as well as carbohydrate degradation during the postharvest life. The results showed that silicon and <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in preservative mixture reduced ACC-oxidase activity number of bacterial on vase solution significantly of cut flower in compared to control...|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{determination}} of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> using two methods of flow analysis; Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) and Sequential Injection Analysis (SIA) with spectrophotometric detection. The principle of determination is based on the <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> decomposition to give salicylic ion. This ion reacts subsequently with Fe 3 + ion in acidic solution leading to colored chelating complex Fe(SAL) +. The increase of absorbance of this complex in its absorption maximum was used for analytical determination. Sodium salicylate (sodium salt of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid)</b> was used as a standard substance. In {{the first part of this}} work, experimental arrangement for flow injection analysis was setup. Continuously the optimization of experimental conditions of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> determination was performed to obtain the higher sensitivity. Under the optimal conditions the basic characteristics of determination was measured. In the second part of this work, the commercial experimental instrument FIA Lab 3500 was used for determination. Optimization of experimental conditions and basic characteristic of determination by sequential injection analysis was performed as well. Developed methods for determination of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> with selected technique were verified by analyzing [...] ...|$|R
