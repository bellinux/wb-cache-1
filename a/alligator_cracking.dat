50|$|Systems {{have been}} {{developed}} that detect fatigue cracking {{and other types of}} pavement distress automatically. They measure the severity and frequency of <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> on the road-path. One such machine is the road surface profilometer, which is mounted on a vehicle and measures the profile of the road surface while it is moving down the roadway.|$|E
50|$|Fatigue cracking, {{also called}} {{crocodile}} cracking or <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> {{is a common}} type of distress in asphalt pavement. Fatigue cracking is characterized by interconnecting or interlaced cracking in the asphalt layer resembling the hide of a crocodile. Cell sizes can vary in size up to 11.80 in across, but are typically less than 5.90 in across. Fatigue cracking is generally a loading failure, but numerous factors can contribute to it. It is often a sign of sub-base failure, poor drainage, or repeated over-loadings. It is important to prevent fatigue cracking, and repair as soon as possible, as advanced cases can be very costly to repair {{and can lead to}} formation of potholes or premature pavement failure.|$|E
30|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} {{is associated}} with traffic loading and appears along the vehicle wheel path. It {{is often associated with}} deformation along the asphalt. It is also referred to as <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> because it resembles the skin of the alligator or a chicken-wire pattern. Early signs can be detected from observations of fine parallel longitudinal cracks along the wheel-paths.|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{test environment}} {{has been carried}} out with 400 pictures. Each picture has been manually identified and classified by an expert. The experimental set consists of 100 pictures of each crack type: non-crack, transverse cracks, longitudinal <b>cracks,</b> and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{obtained}} {{results are}} in {{the average of the}} revised articles. For instance, in [9], authors provide a correlation factor of 0.91 for longitudinal cracks and 0.96 for vertical, and no analysis was provided for <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks,</b> and in [15], authors provide 87.5 % for linear (both longitudinal and vertical) cracks and 97.5 % for <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks.</b> These results will be further analyzed in Section 7.2. For the proposed method, an average of 88 % of success is achieved when detecting any type of cracks. Furthermore, the lowest value of success identifying the kind of the crack for any type is 67 %, for the transverse cracks. However, these values are much higher for other types of crack, reaching 100 % in the alligator ones. It is to be remarked that these values are obtained with a database with a large number of images, while other authors use much smaller databases.|$|R
30|$|Once the {{statistic}} classifier is applied, two {{classification models}} are released. The {{first one is}} used with horizontal projective integrals, and the second one is used with vertical projective integrals. Both models are applied on unclassified images, resulting in no crack (no model detects a crack), horizontal or vertical cracks (when only a model detects a <b>crack),</b> and <b>alligator</b> <b>crack</b> (when both models detect cracks).|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} the {{initiatives}} for implementing the new Mechanistic- Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) in Iowa, a preliminary sensitivity study was undertaken to assess the comparative effect of design input parameters pertaining to material properties, traffic and climate on performance of two existing flexible pavements in Iowa with relatively thick Asphalt Concrete (AC) layers. A total of 20 individual inputs were evaluated by studying the effect of each input on five different performance measures (longitudinal cracking, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> transverse cracking, rutting, and roughness) for each pavement structure resulting in about 200 simulations using the MEPDG software. The {{results showed that the}} predicted longitudinal cracking and total rutting were influenced by most input parameters. <b>Alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> transverse cracking, and roughness remained insensitive to most input parameters.

40|$|Abstract:- Pavements usually {{experience}} {{different types}} of distresses due to repeated traffic loads, aggressive environmental conditions, construction materials, soil condition of the underline subgrade, and the method of construction. Longitudinal and transverse cracking, potholes, rutting, and bleeding are common examples of such distresses associated with flexible pavements. As time progresses, the severity of these distresses increases and consequently, ride quality is adversely affected. Early detection and measurement {{of the extent of}} distresses coupled with prompt reactive measures are necessary to keep the pavement function at an acceptable level. Traditional methods for distress detection and measurement are laborious, time consuming, and subject the involved personnel to accidents. In contrast, image measurement methods are effortless, safe, and can be performed in a short time. This research paper performs image processing measurements to estimate areas of a pothole and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> and sets a program for plane measurements of an area that experience rutting. The image measurements are compared with the traditional measurements. The results show that image measurements are close to those obtained by using the traditional methods.

40|$|A {{database}} of dynamic modulus values for typical Superpave mixes {{widely used in}} the state of Washington was developed and used to investigate the sensitivity of the dynamic modulus to aggregate gradation. Seven JMF mixes were selected for the study. Percent passing sieve # 200 of these mixes were changed by ± 2 % to prepare additional mixes referred to as ‘modified mixes’. Statistical analysis showed that using different JMF mixes significantly affected the dynamic modulus. This was not the case when modifying the JMF by changing the percent passing # 200. A simple evaluation of the prediction accuracy of the 2002 Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) was conducted in which the measured dynamic modulus was used as a key input parameter to predict pavement distresses. Level 1 and Level 3 predictions of rutting, longitudinal cracking, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> and IRI were compared with the field performance data. The Design Guide predicted IRI and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> reasonably well. The predicted rutting of the JMF mixes agreed well with the dynamic modulus trend. It was found that the ± 2 % change in the passing # 200 aggregate gradation did not affect the predicted distress significantly. 17. KEY WORDS 18. DISTRIBUTION STATEMEN...|$|E
30|$|To repair {{transverse}} and longitudinal cracks, minor wide cracks need to {{be repaired}} to prevent moisture. On bigger cracks, the cracked pavement layer must be removed and replaced. For small-sized <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks,</b> the reparation consists on removing the cracked pavement area, digging out, and replacing the asphalt on that area. On big-sized mesh cracks, the placing of a new pavement layer is needed on the entire pavement surface.|$|R
30|$|Finally, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks</b> are a {{combination}} of fatigue causes and unstable asphalt bases. Walker [6] states that unstable asphalt bases occur when base or subbase cannot support adequately the surface layer. This instability is usually caused by a poor drainage or heavy thaws. Furthermore, Kay [11] extends the reasons that affect the unstable asphalt bases to poor trench compaction, settlement, or frost action. A series of interconnected cracks appear in these situations and make the asphalt highly unstable, and pieces of asphalt can be detached in the worst cases.|$|R

40|$|Being {{functioned as}} the main {{transportation}} line for passengers and cargo, any distress on the pavement of South Ring Road in Yogyakarta requires rehabilitation to prevent severe condition. But before the rehabilitation is carried out, it is required to evaluate the road pavement condition. The objective {{of this study is}} to appraise or to value the road pavement condition. This research implementation was visually completed by using Pavement Condition Index Method. It was started by dividing the road into several research units in 100 x 3. 5 m by size for each unit sample. Then, each of the research unit was observed and measured to identify the distress type and severity level in order to obtain PCI rating value of the pavement. Result of the study showed that the distress types included the <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> block cracking, depression, longitudinal and transverse cracking, patching, polished aggregate, shoving, slippage cracking and weathering/graveling. The prevailing ones were block cracking and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking.</b> The damages occurred only on some parts of the segment.

40|$|Pavement design {{procedures}} {{available in}} the literature do not fully take advantage of mechanistic design concepts, and as a result, heavily rely on empirical approaches. However, reliance on empirical solutions can be reduced by introducing mechanistic-empirical methods, now adopted in the newly released Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). Thermal properties like, {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE), thermal conductivity, heat capacity, surface shortwave absorptivity, ultimate shrinkage strain, mix coefficient of thermal contraction, which control the flow of heat through pavements constitute the primary inputs to MEPDG.;A study was undertaken to compare the sensitivity of thermal input parameters on the performance of concrete and flexible pavements using MEPDG Version 1. 0. Effect of climate on the pavement performance was also evaluated. Results from all the simulations showed that almost all of the cases produce reasonable values for transverse cracking, faulting, punchouts, rutting, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> IRI. The transverse cracking model in jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) is sensitive to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), thermal conductivity and climate. Faulting values are sensitive to dowels, thermal conductivity, co-efficient of thermal expansion, surface shortwave absorptivity (SSA) and climate zone. Punchouts are most sensitive to CTE. In flexible pavements airvoid content, traffic volume, and thickness of the asphalt layer, SSA and climate zone are the most sensitive parameters which affect rutting and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking.</b> However, there are cases for which model predictions disagree with prevailing knowledge in pavement engineering.

40|$|Cracks on {{the surface}} of civil {{structures}} (e. g. pavement sections, concrete structures) progress in several formations and under different deterioration mechanisms. In monitoring practice, it is often that cracking type with its worst damage level is selected as a representative condition state, while other cracking types and their damage levels are neglected in records, remaining as hidden information. Therefore, the practice in monitoring has a potential to conceal with a bias selection process, which possibly result in not optimal intervention strategies. In overcoming these problems, our paper presents a non-homogeneous Markov hazard model, with competing hazard rates. Cracking condition states are classified in three types (longitudinal crack, horizontal <b>crack,</b> and <b>alligator</b> <b>crack),</b> with three respective damage levels. The dynamic selection of cracking condition states are undergone a competing process of cracking types and damage levels.

40|$|The {{first step}} in {{establishing}} a pavement management system (PMS) is road network identification. An important feature of a PMS {{is the ability to}} determine the current condition of a road network and predict its future condition. Pavement condition evaluation may involve structure, roughness, surface distress, and safety evaluation. In this study, a pavement distress condition rating procedure was used to achieve the objectives of this study. The main objectives of this study were to identify the common types of distress that exist on the Jazan road network (JRN), either on main roads or secondary roads, and to evaluate the pavement condition based on network level inspection. The study was conducted by collecting pavement distress types from 227 sample units on main roads and 500 sample units from secondary roads. Data were examined through analysis of common types of distress identified in both main and secondary roads. Through these data, pavement condition index (PCI) for each sample unit was then calculated. Through these calculations, average PCIs for the main and secondary roads were determined. Results indicated that the most common pavement distress types on main roads were patching and utility cut patching, longitudinal and transverse cracking, polished aggregate, weathering and raveling, and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking.</b> The most common pavement distress types on secondary roads were weathering and raveling, patching and utility cut patching, longitudinal and transverse cracking, potholes, and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking.</b> The results also indicated that 65 % of Jazan's main road network has an average pavement condition rating of very good while only 30 % of Jazan's secondary roads network has an average pavement condition...|$|E
40|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) is in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} the recently introduced AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) for new pavement sections. However, the vast majority of pavement work conducted by ODOT involves rehabilitation of existing pavements. Hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlays are the preferred rehabilitation treatment for both flexible and rigid pavements in Oregon. However, like new work sections, HMA overlays are also susceptible to fatigue cracking (<b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> and longitudinal cracking), rutting, and thermal cracking. Additional work was therefore needed to calibrate the design process for rehabilitation of existing pavement structures. 38 pavement sections throughout Oregon were included in this calibration study. A detailed comparison of predictive and measured distresses was made using the MEPDG released software Darwin M-E (Version 1. 1). It was found that Darwin M-E predictive distresses did not accurately reflect measured distresses, calling for a local calibration of performance prediction models was warranted. Four distress prediction models (rutting, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> longitudinal cracking, and thermal cracking) of the HMA overlays were calibrated for Oregon conditions. A comparison was made between the results before and after the calibration to assess the improvement in accuracy of the distress prediction models provided by the local calibration. While the thermal cracking model could not be calibrated, the locally calibrated models of rutting, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> and longitudinal cracking provided better predictions with lower bias and standard error than the nationally (default) calibrated models. However, there was a high degree of variability between the predicted and measured distresses, especially for longitudinal cracking, even after the calibration. It is believed that there is a significant lack-of-fit modeling error for the occurrence of thermal cracks. The Darwin M-E calibrated models of rutting and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> can be implemented, however, it is recommended that additional sites, which would contain more detailed inputs (mostly Level 1), be established and be included in the future calibration efforts and thus, further improve the accuracy of the prediction models. Recently, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has identified hot mix asphalt concrete (HMAC) pavements that have displayed top-down cracking within three years of construction. The objective of the study was to evaluate the top-down cracked pavement sections and compare the results with the non-cracked pavement sections. Research involved evaluating six surface cracked pavements and four non-cracked pavement sections. The research included extensive field and laboratory investigations of the 10 pavement sections by conducting distress surveys, falling weight deflectometer (FWD) testing, dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) testing, and coring from the cracked and non-cracked pavement sections. Cores were then subjected to a full laboratory-testing program to evaluate the HMAC mixtures and binder rheology. The laboratory investigation included dynamic modulus, indirect tensile (IDT) strength, and specific gravity testing on the HMAC cores, binder rheological tests on asphalt binder and aggregate gradation analysis. The FWD and DCP tests indicated that top-down cracked pavement sections were structurally sound, even some of the sections with top-down cracking showed better structural capacity compared to non-cracked sections. The study also found that top-down cracking initiation and propagation were independent of pavement cross-section or the HMAC thickness. The dynamic modulus testing indicated that cores from all the top-down cracked pavement sections except one section (OR 140) possessed stiffer mixtures than that of non-cracked pavement sections. All four non-cracked pavement areas were found to be exhibiting fairly high IDT strength, and low variability in IDT strength and HMAC density when compared to top-down cracked sections as indicated by the IDT strength tests and air void analysis. Asphalt binder rheological test result indicated that asphalt binders from all the top-down cracked sections except OR 140 showed higher complex shear modulus (stiffer binder) compared to non-cracked pavement sections. The study concluded that top-down cracking could be caused by a number of contributors such as stiffer HMAC mixtures, mixture segregation, binder aging, low HMAC tensile strength, and high variability in tensile strength or by combination of any...|$|E

Effects of blending elements having different powder sizes on densification properties were analyzed. The strip thickness was proportional to the roll gap up to 0. 9 mm and the density of titanium strip was decreased with the increase in roll gap. As the roll speed increased, the strip density and thickness were decreased by using - 200 mesh Ti powder.

The development of cracks {{and the formation of}} potholes on road surface are widespread problems in road construction and maintenance. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop mathematical models to compute stresses and deflections associated with the cracks in flexible pavement and the formation of potholes. A crack on a flexible pavement surface is a prerequisite for a pothole formation and progression. Three types of cracks, namely, transverse, longitudinal and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks</b> are taken into consideration. As stated in the objective, mathematical models have been developed to compute stresses and deflections associated with cracks in flexible pavement and formation of potholes.

40|$|This study aims to {{automatically}} detect pavement cracks on urban roads by employing the 3 D point clouds acquired by a mobile laser scanning (MLS) system. Our method {{consists of four}} steps: ground point filtering, high-pass convolution, matched filtering, and noise removal. First, a voxel-based upward growing method is applied to construct Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the road surface. Then, a high-pass filter convolutes the DTM to detect local elevation changes that may embed cracking information. Next, a two-step matched filter is applied to extract crack features. Lastly, a noise removal process is conducted to refine the results. Instead of using MLS intensity, this study takes advantages of the MLS elevation information to perform automated crack detection from large-volume, mixed-density, unstructured MLS point clouds. Four types of cracks including longitudinal, transvers, random, and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks</b> are detected. Our results demonstrated that the proposed method works well with the RIEGL VMX- 450 point clouds and can detect cracks in moderate-to-severe severity (13 - 25 mm) within a 200 m by 30 m urban road segment located in Kingston, Ontario, at one time.

40|$|A {{feasible}} pavement crack {{detection system}} {{plays an important}} role in evaluating the road condition and providing the necessary road maintenance. In this paper, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) is used to recognize pavement cracks from images. To improve the recognition accuracy of the BPNN, a complete framework of image processing is proposed including image preprocessing and crack information extraction. In this framework, the redundant image information is reduced as much as possible and two sets of feature parameters are constructed to classify the crack images. Then a BPNN is adopted to distinguish pavement images between linear and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks</b> to acquire high recognition accuracy. Besides, the linear cracks can be further classified into transversal and longitudinal cracks according to the direction angle. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the data of 400 pavement images obtained by the Automatic Road Analyzer (ARAN) in Northern China and the results show that the proposed method seems to be a powerful tool for pavement crack recognition. The rates of correct classification for alligator, transversal and longitudinal cracks are 97. 5 %, 100 % and 88. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for the digital survey and acquisition of road pavement conditions, {{there is also the}} parallel growing need for the development of automated techniques for the analysis and evaluation of the actual road conditions. This {{is due in part to}} the resulting large volumes of road pavement data captured through digital surveys, and also to the requirements for rapid data processing and evaluations. In this study, the Canon 5 D Mark II RGB camera with a resolution of 21 megapixels is used for the road pavement condition mapping. Even though many imaging and mapping sensors are available, the development of automated pavement distress detection, recognition and extraction systems for pavement condition is still a challenge. In order to detect and extract pavement cracks, a comparative evaluation of kernel-based segmentation methods comprising line filtering (LF), local binary pattern (LBP) and high-pass filtering (HPF) is carried out. While the LF and LBP methods are based on the principle of rotation-invariance for pattern matching, the HPF applies the same principle for filtering, but with a rotational invariant matrix. With respect to the processing speeds, HPF is fastest due to the fact that it is based on a single kernel, as compared to LF and LBP which are based on several kernels. Experiments with 20 sample images which contain linear, block and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks</b> are carried out.

40|$|Fatigue damage can {{be defined}} by a {{decrease}} in stiffness of Asphalt Concrete (AC) under repeated traffic loading. For each cycle of traffic loading, tensile strain develops {{at the bottom of}} AC layer of an asphalt pavement. Some localized damages occur in the material at minute-scale due to this developed tensile strain. These damages cause decrease in stiffness (E) of AC. Damage caused by a single vehicle is small. However the accumulated damage is not small if a large number of vehicles are considered over the design life of an asphalt pavement. After certain level of damage accumulation, bottom-up fatigue cracking initiates and forms <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> at the surface. Like traffic loading, repeated day-night temperature cycle causes damages in AC. Damage due to a single day-night temperature fluctuation may be small. However the accumulated damage due to a large number of day-night temperature cycles may not be small. In this study, fatigue damage due to traffic loading is termed as traffic-induced fatigue damage, and fatigue damage due to temperature is termed as temperature-induced fatigue damage. The recently developed AASHTOWare Pavement Mechanistic-Empirical (ME) Design Guide predicts the fatigue performance of AC based on repeated traffic-induced tensile strain at the bottom of AC layer. Cyclic thermal strain due to day-night temperature fluctuation is not considered {{due to the fact that}} there is no closed-form solution or model available for calculating thermal fatigue damage. This study, for the first time, develops a closed-form equation for calculating the temperature-induced fatigue damage of AC. To develop the model, beam fatigue testing was conducted using different AC mixtures in the laboratory. The mechanical beam fatigue test data was correlated with the actual cyclic temperature loading test data. The model was then validated using an unknown test data. To that end, the developed model was calibrated for field conditions using the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) test data. The developed model is used to evaluate fatigue damages of 34 Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) test sections. Fatigue damage predicted by the traditional AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design approach, which considers only traffic-induced fatigue damage, is compared to the fatigue damage by the developed model which considers both traffic- and temperature-induced fatigue. Results show that the error may decrease by up to 29 % through the incorporation of temperature-induced fatigue damage in the AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design approach. This means the reliability of <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> prediction can be improved through the use of the developed thermal fatigue model. It is therefore suggested to include the temperature-induced fatigue damage model, which is developed in this study, in the AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design Software.

40|$|In {{the area}} of {{quantifying}} roadway infrastructure serviceability, pavement surface distress conditions are critical inputs. Numerous computer-aided automatic examination techniques, such as regular image processing methods and mobile LiDAR technologies, have been exploited with pavement distress condition assessments. However, the defect of information losses in 2 D image combination processes or extremely high costs in 3 D geo-referenced data collection, has impeded their effectiveness and applicability. This study proposes a cost-effective Kinect-based approach for 3 D pavement surface reconstruction and cracking recognition, in which a series of robust detection and recognition algorithms have been made advantage of to identify 3 D cloud-point-data-based pavement distress feature. Based on the measurements of depth, width, length, and area, various cracking types, such as <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> traverse cracking, longitudinal cracking, etc. are identified and recognized for their severity examination. The effectiveness of this method, which does well in reducing data collection costs and extracting reliable, accurate information on pavement cracking measurements, is indicated by the experimental test results. Moreover, the researching findings verify that the proposed approach provides a viable, applicable solution to automatic pavement surface condition detection and evaluation. Final, the proposed methodology is transferable for pavement surface reconstruction and distress condition detection based on the other 3 D cloud point data.

40|$|This paper aims {{to report}} the {{mechanical}} behaviour improvement of crushed rock base (CRB) as a granular road base material subjected to static and cyclic loads from triaxial tests with various stress paths {{in order to obtain}} more understanding of road base modified material. As is well known, pavement surface rutting, longitudinal and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks</b> are normally the main cause of damage in flexible pavements. Currently, existing and natural materials are unable to cope with the premature deterioration. Factors contributing to such damage are the excessive irreversible and reversible deformation of a base layer including the behaviour of a mechanical response of unbound granular materials (UGMs) under traffic load is not well understood. The cement modification was utilized to enhance limited use of raw crushed rock subjected to different stress conditions. Crushed rock was mixed with 2 % cement content named hydrated cement treated crushed rock base (HCTCRB) at particular 100 % optimum moisture content (OMC) and 100 % maximum dry density (MDD) then was kept in various hydration periods to investigate the hydration effect. Subsequently, each hydration of mixture was retreated and re-mixed with specific OMC and MDD of each hydration period and was kept for 28 days for curing. The retreating process is used to avoid micro-crack that usually generate by stabilised procedure. Finally, compacted samples were subjected to static triaxial tests, resilient modulus and permanent deformation in order to simulate the real condition of pavement. The study reports that HCTCRB was enhanced the static and dynamic responses. Moreover, the effects of mechanical responses were investigated and the limit uses of using HCTCRB as a pavement material were determined...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to report}} the {{mechanical}} behavior of crushed rock base (CRB) and hydrated cement treated crushed rock base (HCTCRB) as granular road base materials subjected to repeated cyclic loads from Repeated Loads Triaxial (RLT) tests with various stress paths {{in order to improve}} more understanding of such Western Australian roads based materials on mechanistic-empirical pavement design and analysis. As is well known, pavement surface rutting, longitudinal and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracks</b> are normally the main cause of damage in flexible pavements. The factors contributing to such damage are the excessive irreversible deformation of base layers and the behavior of a mechanical response of unbound granular materials (UGMs) under traffic loads which at the moment are not well understood. In this study, the shakedown concept was utilized to describe and determine limited use of CRB and HCTCRB subjected to different stress conditions. This concept is a theoretical approach used to describe the behavior under RLT tests. It utilizes macro-mechanical observations of the UGM's response and the distribution of the vertical plastic strain in the tested material. When the shakedown limit of an UGM is known, the limitations of the accumulated plastic strain in an unbound granular layer which causes rutting can be predictable. In this paper, compacted CRB and HCTCRB samples were subjected to the various stress condition defined by the stress ratio (the ratio of a vertical major stress, σ 1 and a horizontal minor stress, σ 3) in order to simulate the real condition of pavement. The study revealed that road base defined the working stress ratio of a pavement structure and that after a large number of traffic loads, deterioration will occur. Moreover, the mechanical responses were investigated and the limit ranges of using UGMs in pavements were determined...|$|R
