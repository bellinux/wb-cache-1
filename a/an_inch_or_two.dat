25|$|The storm {{moved into}} Illinois and Wisconsin in the {{afternoon}} of December 1. <b>An</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of snow fell in many areas, before a wintry mix of icy precipitation (up to a half-inch of ice accumulation) made things even more treacherous. Numerous highway accidents were reported, resulting in three deaths in Wisconsin and one in Illinois, as well as numerous injuries. In addition, a Mesa Airlines plane with 25 passengers slid off the runway at Dane County Regional Airport in Madison, but no injuries were reported. 400 flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, 28 at Midway International Airport and dozens more at Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport. At {{the height of the}} storm, 140,000 customers were without power in Illinois, due to the storm.|$|E
25|$|To Spain and the Teutonic {{countries}} of Europe {{we look for}} the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, {{of a number of}} panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being {{a good example of the}} style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.|$|E

The second piece I have on {{the table}} is <b>a</b> cluster--an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> deep--of the moss that grows everywhere, and that the birds use for nest-building, and we for packing, and the like. It is dry, since yesterday, and its fibres define {{themselves}} against the dark ground in warm green, touched with a glittering light. Note that burnished lustre of the minute leaves; they are necessarily always relieved against dark hollows, and this lustre makes them much clearer and brighter than if they were of dead green. In that lustre--and it is characteristic of them--they differ wholly from the dead, aloe-like texture of the pineapple leaf; and remind me, as I look at them closely, a little of some conditions of chaff, as on heads of wheat after being threshed. I will hunt down that clue presently; meantime there is something else to be noticed on the old brick.|$|R

Mrs. Bretton, though a commanding, and in grave matters even a {{peremptory}} woman, was often passive in trifles: she allowed the child her way. She said to me, [...] "Take no notice at present." [...] But I did take notice: I watched Polly rest her small elbow on her small knee, her head on her hand; I observed her draw <b>a</b> square <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of pocket-handkerchief from the doll-pocket of her doll-skirt, and then I heard her weep. Other children in grief or pain cry aloud, without shame or restraint; but this being wept: the tiniest occasional sniff testified to her emotion. Mrs. Bretton did not hear it: which was quite as well. Ere long, a voice, issuing from the corner, demanded--"May the bell be rung for Harriet!" ...|$|R
500|$|Frogs in the {{families}} Bufonidae, Rhinophrynidae, and Microhylidae have short back legs {{and tend to}} walk rather than jump. When they try to move rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. The Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne olivacea) {{has been described as}} having a gait that is [...] "a combination of running and short hops that are usually only <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in length". In an experiment, Fowler's toad (Bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. By measuring the toad's uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.|$|E
500|$|Like the Indian rhino, the Javan {{rhinoceros}} has {{a single}} horn (the other extant species have two horns).

Female Javan rhinos are the only extant rhinos that remain hornless into adulthood, though they may develop a tiny bump of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in height. The Javan rhinoceros {{does not appear to}} often use its horn for fighting, but instead uses it to scrape mud away in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Similar to the other browsing species of rhino (Black, Sumatran, and Indian), the Javan rhino has a long, pointed, upper lip which helps in grabbing food. Its lower incisors are long and sharp; when the Javan rhino fights, it uses these teeth. Behind the incisors, two rows of six low-crowned molars are used for chewing coarse plants. Like all rhinos, the Javan rhino smells and hears well, but has very poor vision. They are estimated to live for 30 to 45 years.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variation}} on [...] "framing" [...] is called [...] "pulling pitches".

5000|$|When first {{registered}} as a breed, {{there were four}} distinctly described types of ears cataloged as acceptable for Lamancha breed registry. These were two specific 'gopher' types; short and long, and two 'elf' types; regular Lamancha ears and Cookie ears. Short gopher ears were closest to the head, could have one fold (but no length), and gave a smooth appearance to the head. After 1960, these were the only ear-type that a registered buck could have. Long gopher ears were small and round-tipped, between one-half inch and one inch long, and accordion-folded, such that when pulled out flat and released, they would fold right back. The elf types were a little longer, but still very small compared to other breeds. [...] Cookie ears, named by Mrs. Frey after the first goat born with such ears, were pointy-tipped and turned up and back toward the head; hugging closely to the head. Regular Lamancha ears were flat, stood out from the head, bent downward, and could be <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> up to <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> long. Only Lamanchas with Swiss-type (long) ears were unregisterable.|$|R
60|$|We {{mentioned}} that the bases of the mountains bordering the Lake of Como were chiefly composed of black marble; black, at least, when polished, and very dark gray in its general effect. This is very finely stratified in beds varying in thickness from <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> to <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three feet; and these beds, taken of a medium thickness, form flat slabs, easily broken into rectangular fragments, which, being excessively compact in their grain, are admirably adapted for a building material. There is a little pale limestone[17] among the hills to the south; but this marble, or primitive limestone (for it is not highly crystalline), is not only more easy of access, but a more durable stone. Of this, consequently, almost all the buildings on the lake shore are built; and, therefore, were their material unconcealed, would be of a dark monotonous and melancholy gray tint, equally uninteresting to the eye, and depressing to the mind. To prevent this result, they are covered with different compositions, sometimes white, more frequently cream-colored, and of varying depth; the moldings and pilasters being frequently of deeper tones than the walls. The insides of the grottoes, however, when not cut in the rock itself, are left uncovered, thus forming a strong contrast with the whiteness outside; giving great depth, and permitting weeds and flowers to root themselves on the roughnesses, and rock streams to distill through the fissures of the dark stones; while {{all parts of the}} building to which the eye is drawn, by their form or details (except the capitals of the pilasters), such as the urns, the statues, the steps, or balustrades, are executed in very fine white marble, generally from the quarries of Carrara, which supply quantities of fragments of the finest quality, which nevertheless, owing to their want of size, or to the presence of conspicuous veins, are unavailable for the higher purposes of sculpture.|$|R
2500|$|Five-pin bowling is {{a popular}} {{variation}} in Canada, and pinsetters fall into two categories: [...] string and free-fall. [...] String pinsetters are more prevalent, and consist of machines attached {{to the head of}} each pin, by means of a cord. [...] Essentially, the pinsetter is triggered by the movement of any pin by more than <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> [...] With that, the machine lowers a guard, pulls up all 5 pins, and resets those that did not move. [...] There is, on average, a three-second lag from when the pins were knocked down to when the guard is lowered. [...] The pit floor is angled such that the ball is gravity-fed to a track that leads to an elevator. [...] The elevator lifts the ball to the return track.|$|E

[...] This configuration is often called a hybrid setup. The bass drum is most commonly 22" [...] in diameter, but rock kits may use 24", fusion 20", jazz 18", and in larger bands up to 26". A second crash cymbal is common, typically <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> larger or smaller than the 16", with {{the larger of the}} two to the right for a right-handed drummer, but a big band may use crashes up to 20" [...] and ride up to 24" [...] or, very rarely, 26".

2500|$|In Anglican practice, {{conformity}} {{to a given}} standard depends on the ecclesiastical province and/or the liturgical sensibilities of a given parish. [...] In the Parson's Handbook, an influential manual for priests popular in the early-to-mid-twentieth century, Percy Dearmer recommends that [...] "All altars should be 3 ft. 3 in. high, and at least deep enough to take a corporal [...] 20 in. square, with <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to spare." [...] He also recommends that the altar stand upon three steps {{for each of the}} three sacred ministers, and that it be decorated with a silk frontal in the seasonal colour. [...] In some cases, other manuals suggest that a stone be set in the top of wooden altars, in the belief that the custom be maintained of consecrating the bread and wine on a stone surface. [...] In many other Anglican parishes, the custom is considerably less rigorous, especially in those parishes which use free-standing altars. [...] Typically, these altars are made of wood, and may or may not have a solid front, which may or may not be ornamented. [...] In many Anglican parishes, the use of frontals has persisted.|$|E
