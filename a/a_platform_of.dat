He ran in the 2004 presidential election as the candidate of the Solidarity Party, on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> reducing crime and government corruption. His primary rival was Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Martín Torrijos, son of the former military dictator Omar Torrijos. Martín Torrijos ran on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> strengthening democracy and negotiating {{a free trade agreement}} with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Ruben Blades.

5|$|Four {{decades after}} its construction, Union Station was proving {{too small for}} its role as the {{principal}} railroad hub of Berkshire County. In 1908 local residents began agitating for a larger station, and William H. MacInnis made it <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> his mayoral candidacy. In 1910 MacInnis appointed a three-man committee (one {{a director of the}} B) to lobby the railroad authorities to replace Union Station. Financial constraints at first hampered their efforts. but in April 1912 the B agreed to support the project. In 1913, the NYNH acquired the former Burbank Hotel property and began constructing the second Union Station.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Frank Oliver, who had {{represented}} Edmonton in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories since 1888, {{resigned to}} pursue a career in federal politics. Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing by-election. Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature petition urging his candidacy was presented to him. His only opponent was former Edmonton mayor Matthew McCauley who, like Rutherford, ran as an independent. Rutherford campaigned on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become a theme of his political career—increased educational funding. McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Initially, this protest did not {{attract a}} great deal of attention, and even the IRA {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin had called for a boycott of the election.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a white}} bird {{adorned with}} buff plumes in the {{breeding}} season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal.|$|E
5|$|Mount ran for Congress in 2004 {{to succeed}} Chris John, who instead {{ran for the}} United States Senate but lost to Republican David Vitter. She {{positioned}} herself as a Conservative Democrat who supported balanced budgets and conservative social views, emphasizing job creation, health care and her opposition to offshoring. Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American State Senator Don Cravins, Sr., the father of another lawmaker, Don Cravins, Jr., of Opelousas. Her major Republican opponent was Charles Boustany, a retired heart surgeon from Lafayette, who ran on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill. The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount, as Cravins {{was believed to be}} a weaker contestant in a run-off. Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied, and the election was hotly contested.|$|E

5|$|Samuel {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} as mayor, leaving an open seat to be contested by the Republican nominee, Daniel A. Poling, and the Democrat, Joseph S. Clark, Jr. Clark was a lawyer and United States Army officer who had served in World War II. Raised in an upper-class Republican family, he switched his party affiliation to the Democrats in 1928. After several unsuccessful attempts at public office in Philadelphia, {{he served as a}} Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. Clark was known as a reformer, having been elected city controller two years earlier in 1949 on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> cleaning up corruption in the city. Despite being slandered as a communist for his membership in the Americans for Democratic Action, a left-wing group, Clark was victorious.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Chris Dodd was launched on January 11, 2007 and ended on January 3, 2008 after a sixth-place {{finish in the}} Iowa caucuses. Dodd, the Senior Senator from Connecticut, sought the nomination of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Centering his campaign in the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire, he tried to bring forth <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> change. Dodd's performance in the opinion polls varied, but in the financial sphere, he had secured some notable and influential endorsements who had sufficiently funded his campaign.|$|E

Herbert stood for Parliament on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> obscenity reform, the Home Office {{had a change of}} heart and introduced a new bill through Roy Jenkins in 1959, a compromise between the aims of the campaigners and the goals of the Home Office. It was introduced to the House of Lords by Lord Birkett, received the Royal Assent on 29 July 1959, and came into force on 29 August 1959 as the Obscene Publications Act 1959.|$|E

5|$|Campaigning on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> {{progressive}} reforms, McCreary defeated Republican Edward C. O'Rear in {{the general}} election. During this second term, {{he became the first}} inhabitant of the state's second (and current) governor's mansion; he is also the only governor to have inhabited both the old and new mansions. During his second term, he succeeded in convincing the legislature to make women eligible to vote in school board elections, to mandate direct primary elections, to create a state public utilities commission, and to allow the state's counties to hold local option elections {{to decide whether or not}} to adopt prohibition. He also realized substantial increases in education spending and won passage of reforms such as a mandatory school attendance law, but was unable to secure passage of laws restricting lobbying in the legislative chambers and providing for a workers' compensation program. McCreary was one of five commissioners charged with overseeing construction of the new governor's mansion and exerted considerable influence on the construction plans. His term expired in 1915, and he died three years later. McCreary County was formed during McCreary's second term in office and was named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} for black people to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E

5|$|In {{planning}} the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing {{the relocation of}} an estimated 1,500 people. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was Fort Yukon, which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye, which lobbied against the project. The Tundra Times, an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly {{in opposition to the}} project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam. Don Young, Alaska's representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected to the Alaska Legislature in 1964 from Fort Yukon on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> opposition to Rampart Dam.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the force's {{reputation}} {{suffered from}} the controversy and complaints persisted that the force was oversized, excessively funded and staffed by political appointees. By the 1890s, a political consensus had emerged in Ottawa that the western provinces should become autonomous and take up {{responsibility for their own}} policing; it was therefore time to plan for the closure of the force, which originally had only been intended to be a temporary organisation. The force was reduced to 850 men in 1893, and to 750 by 1898. The Conservative government stood for reelection in 1896 with plans to further reduce the size of the force, reportedly to 500 men, but lost to the Liberal party, led by Wilfrid Laurier. The new Prime Minister had stood for election on <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> increasing the rights of the provinces to carry out law enforcement. He produced plans to halve the size of the mounted police as a first step towards eliminating the force, and proposed to establish a new militia regiment in the North-West Territories to fulfil any legacy military requirements.|$|E
