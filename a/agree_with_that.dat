25|$|If so, it {{is unclear}} how much Tatian may have {{borrowed}} from this previous author in determining his own narrative sequence of Gospel elements. It is equally unclear whether Tatian took the Syriac Gospel texts composited into his Diatessaron from a previous translation, or whether the translation was his own. Where the Diatessaron records Gospel quotations from the Jewish Scriptures, the text appears to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> found in the Syriac Peshitta Old Testament rather than that found in the Greek Septuagint—as used by the original Gospel authors. The majority consensus is that the Peshitta Old Testament preceded the Diatessaron, and represents an independent translation from the Hebrew Bible. Resolution of these scholarly questions remained very difficult so long as no complete version of the Diatessaron in Syriac or Greek had been recovered; while the medieval translations that had survived—in Arabic and Latin—both relied on texts that had been heavily corrected to conform better with later canonical versions of the separate Gospel texts.|$|E
25|$|In Morocco, where king Mohammed VI is also Amir al-Muminin (Commander of the Faithful), the {{authorities}} {{have tried to}} organize the field by creating a scholars' council (conseil des oulémas) composed of Muslim scholars (ulama), {{which is the only}} one allowed to issue fatāwā. In this case, a national theocracy could in fact compel intra-national compliance with the fatwā, since a central authority is the source. Even then, however, the issue would not necessarily be religiously binding for the residents of that nation. For, the state may have the power to put a fatwā in effect, {{but that does not mean}} that the fatwā is to be religiously accepted by all. For instance, if a state fatwā council made abortion acceptable in the first trimester without any medical reason, that would have direct impact on official procedures in hospitals and courts in that country. Yet, this would not mean that the Muslims in that nation has to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> fatwā, or that the fatwā is religiously binding for them.|$|E

Creation Ministries International wrote [...] "Forcing the Bible to conform to a certain political agenda, no matter if one happens to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> agenda, is a perversion of the Word of God and should therefore be opposed by Christians as much as 'politically correct' Bibles." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the gravity}} on Earth's moon {{is too low}} to hold an {{atmosphere}} for geological spans of time, if given an atmosphere, it would retain the atmosphere for spans of time that are long compared to human lifespans. Landis and others have thus proposed {{that it could be}} feasible to terraform the moon, although not all <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> proposal. Landis estimates that a 1 PSI atmosphere of pure oxygen on the moon would require on the order of two hundred trillion tons of oxygen, and suggests it could be produced by reducing the oxygen from an amount of lunar rock equivalent to a cube about fifty kilometers on an edge.

A poll by the Asahi Shimbun in November 2013 found that 54% of the public supported Koizumi's anti-nuclear statements.

2500|$|Consider the {{following}} problem. [...] Suppose that a tangent vector to the sphere S is {{given at the}} north pole, and we are to define a manner of consistently moving this vector to other points of the sphere: a means for parallel transport. [...] Naïvely, this could be done using a particular coordinate system. [...] However, unless proper care is applied, the parallel transport defined in one system of coordinates will not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of another coordinate system. [...] A more appropriate parallel transportation system exploits the symmetry of the sphere under rotation. [...] Given a vector at the north pole, one can transport this vector along a curve by rotating the sphere {{in such a way}} that the north pole moves along the curve without axial rolling. [...] This latter means of parallel transport is the Levi-Civita connection on the sphere. [...] If two different curves are given with the same initial and terminal point, and a vector v is rigidly moved along the first curve by a rotation, the resulting vector at the terminal point will be different from the vector resulting from rigidly moving v along the second curve. [...] This phenomenon reflects the curvature of the sphere. A simple mechanical device that can be used to visualize parallel transport is the south-pointing chariot.|$|E
