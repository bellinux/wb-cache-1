40|$|The Arcade, Cleveland, Ohio, circa 1930 - 1944. Caption reads: "The Arcade, {{located in}} the heart of {{downtown}} Cleveland between the city's two main thoroughfares, is a nationally known Cleveland landmark. This Arcade, the largest of its type in the world, is a street under an <b>arched</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roof.</b> " Postcard number: 77687; Message included...|$|R
5000|$|Sutro Baths (1894-1964), {{a massive}} public bath house and {{freshwater}} swimming facility. It included six saltwater swimming tanks of varying sizes, shapes, and water temperatures, tiers of bleacher-like seats, providing seating {{for thousands of}} spectators, and a massive <b>arched</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> made from 100,000 square feet of stained glass and supported by 600 tons of iron girders.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, the Metropolitan line {{operated}} Inner Circle route was given its own identity {{on the tube}} map as the Circle line. By 1951 the station had been rebuilt again in a similar style to the 1930s building. The <b>arched</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> was not replaced and the current station {{does not have the}} light open atmosphere of the original. The office building above the station entrance is a later addition.|$|R
50|$|Täby Centrum {{was inaugurated}} in 1968, {{as the first}} {{shopping}} centre with a glass-vaulted ceiling in the Stockholm area. In 1991, the centre expanded with a 110 m shopping street three stories tall, covered by an <b>arching</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roof.</b> In 2002, a large-scale plan for renovating and expanding the centre was initiated by the owner, Unibail-Rodamco, {{in cooperation with the}} municipality. Carried out in multiple stages and expected to be completed in 2015, this plan would lead to an almost completely new interior, an additional 14,000 m2 of retail space, and approximately 4,000 indoor parking spaces.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Agricultural Hall {{was built}} in 1862 on the Liverpool Road site of William Dixon's Cattle Layers. The hall was 75 ft high and the <b>arched</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> spanned 125 ft. It was built for the annual Smithfield Show in December of that year but was popular for other purposes, {{including}} recitals and the Royal Tournament. It was the primary exhibition site for London until the 20th century and the largest building of its kind, holding up to 50,000 people. It was requisitioned {{for use by the}} Mount Pleasant sorting office during World War II and never re-opened. The main hall has now been incorporated into the Business Design Centre.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two island platforms, each bordered by two tracks, between {{concrete}} walls under an <b>arched</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roof.</b> A large glass-walled staircase {{in the middle}} of the platforms is used to change of platform and leads to one of the emergency exits. Escalators and lifts from the platform lead to the basement of terminal 2. The difference in height between rail and platform edge on the outer tracks is 76 cm. The central tracks are laid a little lower, so that their platforms are 96 cm high above the rail. The high S-Bahn sets stop at the low platforms, which cannot be avoided for operational reasons.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins' life-sized {{concrete}} dinosaur models created for England's Crystal Palace for the Great Exhibition of 1851, in 1868 the Commissioners of Manhattan's newly created Central Park recruited the sculptor to create replicas of America's antediluvian giants for a proposed museum in Central Park. The museum {{was to have been}} known as the Paleozoic Museum (or Palaeozoic Museum), and foundations for the structure were laid by architect Frederick Law Olmsted at Central Park West and 63rd Street. Like Hyde Park's Crystal Palace, Hawkins' display was to be housed within a great iron frame and an <b>arched</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roof.</b> Surviving sketches and photographs show that Hawkins had planned an elaborate, if anachronistic, menagerie, mixing Mesozoic dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs with extinct Cenozoic mammals.|$|R
50|$|The {{name came}} from a vast gallery between Nevsky Avenue and Italianskaya Street which {{provided}} the main passage through the mall. The gallery was covered over by an <b>arching</b> <b>glass</b> and steel <b>roof,</b> thus giving it a claim to {{being one of the}} world's first shopping malls, along with Passage du Caire in Paris (1798) Burlington Arcade in London, Galerie Vivienne in Paris (1823) and Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels.|$|R
5000|$|To {{cope with}} {{expanding}} traffic. Snow Hill station was rebuilt again {{on a much}} larger scale between 1906 and 1912. The new station building was intended to compete with New Street, {{which at the time}} was a much grander building than it is today. The rebuilt station contained lavish facilities, such as a large booking hall with an <b>arched</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roof,</b> and lavish waiting rooms with oak bars. The main platform area was covered by a large glass and steel overall roof. It consisted of two large Island platforms, containing four through platforms, and four bay platforms for terminating trains at the northern end. The through platforms were long enough to accommodate two trains at a time, and scissors crossings allowed trains to pull in front, or out from behind of other trains stood in a platform, effectively creating a 10 platform station. The line north from Snow Hill towards Hockley was quadrupled at the same time, however the cost of widening the twin track Snow Hill tunnel at the southern end was considered prohibitive. There was not enough capacity through the tunnel to accommodate all of the services, and so, as a solution, [...] was built as an [...] "overflow" [...] station {{at the opposite end of}} the tunnel to take terminating local trains towards Leamington Spa and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Great Western Hotel was closed at the same time (as guests complained of being kept awake by goods trains running underneath) and converted into railway offices, and a passenger entrance was provided on Colmore Row, which became the station's main entrance.|$|R
50|$|There {{were six}} {{platforms}} beneath the <b>arch</b> iron and <b>glass</b> <b>roof,</b> which was 504 feet (154 m) in length, 80 feet (24 m) high {{and with a}} clear span of 198 feet (60 m). The cost had risen to £1,275,000. There were 43 trains each way, six days a week. Through coaches from Edinburgh to Ayr were operated {{in association with the}} North British Railway; they were detached from trains to Queen Street at Bellgrove, and worked forward to Clyde Junction, where they were attached to trains starting from St Enoch.|$|R
50|$|In 1849 the High Level Bridge {{was built}} over the River Tyne, {{bringing}} the railway to Newcastle and north to Scotland. A suitably impressive station was required for a thriving town such as Newcastle, and Dobson provided it in his plans. His original plan of 1848 showed an ornate façade with a huge portico having double colonnades and an Italianate tower at the east end. Behind this was an enormous train shed made up of three <b>arched</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roofs</b> built in a curve on an 800 ft radius. This design won an award at the Paris Exhibition of 1858. Unfortunately, Dobson was forced to alter his plans to produce a much less substantial portico and remove the Italianate tower. The station was completed in 1850 without the planned portico {{and it was not}} until 1863 that this was added. John Dobson argued for the role of the architect in building railway stations, and his Newcastle Central is regarded by many as the finest in England. According to Gordon Biddle and O. S. Nock in The Railway Heritage of Britain: ‘Undoubtedly it would {{have been one of the}} finest 19th century classical buildings in Europe had it been completed... Even so, Newcastle Central today is magnificent inside for its spectacular combination of curves and outside for its sheer size and length.’ The train shed at Newcastle, the authors state, was the first of the great arched roofs and represented a bold step forward which was copied by others.’ It was the first use of malleable rolled iron ribs - indeed the first large glass and iron vault in England.|$|R

5000|$|The Targa {{version of}} the 993 was {{introduced}} in model year 1996 and saw the debut of the so-called [...] "greenhouse" [...] system: a retractable <b>glass</b> <b>roof,</b> a design continued on the 996 and 997 Targa. The <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> would retract underneath the rear window revealing a large opening. This system was a complete redesign, as previous Targa models had a removable roof section and a wide B-pillar functioning as a roll bar. The new <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> design allowed the 993 Targa to retain the same side-on profile as the other 911 Carrera variants and finish without the inconvenience of storing the removed top of the old system.
