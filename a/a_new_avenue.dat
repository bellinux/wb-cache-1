25|$|By invading Switzerland, the French {{government}} had unwittingly opened up <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> for the Coalition forces to invade France. Along its borders with Belgium and Germany, France was well-protected by a belt of fortresses. But in the Jura Mountains on the Swiss frontier, {{there were only}} a few places like Fort de Joux and Salins-les-Bains guarding the region of Franche-Comté. Lazare Carnot regretfully noted that when Switzerland was neutral, France could ignore their common border. However, with Switzerland a belligerent, the French must deploy 40,000 soldiers to either occupy the country or watch the frontier.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 the War Memorial Drive {{was planted}} with 75 poplars, {{each with a}} cross at the foot and a plaque honouring {{individual}} Old Newingtonians who died during World War II. The trees were replaced by <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> of trees in 1966 and the plaques were replaced by a tablet on a plinth with the inscription: Lest We Forget – This plaque was dedicated on 24September 1966, to mark the planting of trees alongside the War Memorial Drive by the Old Newingtonians' Union to restore those originally planted by the Union on 29February 1936. By this act Old Newingtonians remember those Old Boys who gave {{their lives in the}} service of God, King and Country, and whose names are recorded on the War Memorial of the School. Fifty of the original plaques remain in the archives collection. In 1979 the War Memorial Drive was realigned and replanted and the 1966 plinth was moved to the Millner Gates end of the drive.|$|E
25|$|Extremophiles, organisms able {{to survive}} in extreme environments, are a core {{research}} element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include biota which are {{able to survive}} several kilometers below the ocean's surface near hydrothermal vents and microbes that thrive in highly acidic environments. It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and {{in a range of}} other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. This opened up <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms able to withstand exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space include the lichen fungi Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, the bacterium Bacillus safensis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Bacillus subtilis, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana ('mouse-ear cress'), as well as the invertebrate animal Tardigrade.|$|E

The only maritime opportunity available {{was to take}} a cargo to Cádiz, which he was obliged to accept. [...] He left Manila on January 13, 1831, taking his captives with him. When Antarctic reached Cádiz five months later the port was under quarantine and closed. He was forced to discharge the cargo in Bordeaux, where Dako and Monday, rumored in the town to be cannibals, again attracted great curiosity. [...] Antarctic finally reached New York on August 27, 1831; [...] despite his lack of commercial success, Morrell remained upbeat about future prospects in the Pacific. [...] "I could, with only a modest share of patronage... open <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> of trade more lucrative than any that our country has ever yet enjoyed, and further, {{it would be in}} my power, and mine alone, to secure the monopoly for any term I pleased."

It led to a new Russo-Polish war that lasted from 1654 to 1667. Powerful Russian armies entered the Commonwealth and the conflict with the Cossacks became a war with the Tsardom.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} provide several therapeutic advantages. Like ESCs, they are pluripotent. They thus have great differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within the human body (if reprogramming to pluripotency was [...] "complete"). Moreover, unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem cell line for each individual patient. In fact, frozen blood samples {{can be used as a}} source of induced {{pluripotent stem cells}}, opening <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>avenue</b> for obtaining the valued cells. Patient specific stem cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection. Despite their current limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold create potential for future use in medical treatment and research.|$|E

[...] They randomized patients into two groups: [...] one being treated with CBT in a therapist guided environment, and the second receiving CBT through instruction only, with no therapist guided sessions. [...] The findings indicated that the first group had a somewhat better response rate, but that both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in reduction of panic symptomatology. [...] These findings lend credibility to the application of CBT programs to patients who are unable to access therapeutic services due to financial, or geographic inaccessibility. [...] Koszycky et al. (2011) discuss the efficacy of self-administered cognitive behavioural therapy (SCBT) in situations where patients are unable to retain the services of a therapist. [...] Their study demonstrates that it is possible for SCBT in combination with an SSRI to be as effective as therapist-guided CBT with SSRI.
