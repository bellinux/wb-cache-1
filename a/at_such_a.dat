5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it.

5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> location as to allow it to have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E

Katherine remained unaware of her sons' strip club activities for many years. Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli reflected on Jackson's early life and noted that <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> young age, the singer {{may not have been}} psychologically equipped to fully understand any sexual stimulation he may have received from such voyeuristic events. The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father.|$|E

5|$|Grande {{embarked}} {{on her first}} solo concert tour titled The Listening Sessions in support of Yours Truly. Pre-sale tickets went on sale on July 18, 2013. Regular tickets went on sale on July 19. Pre-sale tickets {{had to be taken}} down early, as they were selling <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fast rate that the tour was almost sold before regular tickets were available. Grande also was the opening act for the last three US dates of Justin Bieber's Believe Tour. The performances took place in Jacksonville, Tampa, and Atlanta on August 7, August 8, and August 10, in support of the album. It was at these Listening Sessions that Grande discovered the album reached number one on US iTunes.|$|E
5|$|In October 1965, Leeds skipper Collins {{was injured}} in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup game against Torino and Revie gave the {{captaincy}} to Bremner after initially handing the armband to Charlton {{for the remainder of}} the season; Charlton was keen to give up the captaincy as it prevented his superstitious ritual of coming out of the tunnel last on match days. Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, which was why the manager gave him the captaincy <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> young age. Leeds finished second in the league in the 1965–66 campaign to Liverpool, who had finished six points clear at the top.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> rapid pace that university newspapers questioned if the increase in the number of fraternities would ever end. Many fraternity chapters were founded during this time that no longer exist at the university, such Alpha Chi Rho, Theta Nu Epsilon, and Delta Chi. Other chapters that are still active were founded at this time as well, such as Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa.|$|E

5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them.

Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled {{the beginning of the end}} for these mystics.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{himself had}} been {{regarded}} as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled {{the headquarters of the}} NFB. Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx's 24 heures ou plus, <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> tense political time, worried about what the Canadian public would think. Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, {{the nose of the}} plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making the beams bright enough <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E

5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|Taylor Swift was {{received}} positively by contemporary critics, who praised Swift's talent <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> young age. The album enjoyed commercial success and launched Swift's career in country music. In the United States, it topped the Top Country Albums Chart for 24 non-consecutive weeks, and was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 5 million copies. Taylor Swift has logged 275 {{weeks on the}} Billboard Top 200 chart as of early 2013. The album was also successful outside of Swift's native country, especially in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The album has sold over 6 million copies worldwide as of January 2015.|$|E
5|$|Then came {{a decline}} in his career <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> young age which began soon after the arrival of new manager Alex Ferguson in November 1986, the change of manager coming after a dismal start to the season led to the {{decision}} to sack Ron Atkinson. Whiteside, still only 21, was facing trouble from his right knee which was now beginning to require serious medical procedures {{to prevent it from}} causing his retirement. Ferguson put Whiteside back up front, and in turn he scored three times in his first four games back from injury. Ferguson did though have to rebuke Whiteside after some of his numerous drinking sessions. He ended the 1986–87 season with 10 goals in 37 appearances, however United could only manage an 11th-place finish.|$|E

5|$|Thus {{while other}} European sovereigns were {{building}} luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics {{and common sense}} demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified. This unique requirement, <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco {{one of the most}} unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French and stripped of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Emmy turned {{more to the}} northwest, {{and passed}} about 135miles (220km) {{northeast}} of Barbuda on August 23. The rapid development of an unseasonable frontal low pressure system to the northeast of the storm turned Emmy sharply east-northeastward on August 25. Its eastward movement <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> low latitude for {{the time of year}} was unprecedented. The storm steadily intensified and Emmy attained hurricane status later on the 25th while located 270miles (430km) north of Barbuda. After moving eastward for about 24hours, the Westerlies retreated northward, and Emmy turned gradually to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E

5|$|At Arsenal, Fàbregas {{also often}} assumed {{responsibility}} for set pieces, taking corners, free kicks and penalties. By his own admission, scoring was a weaker {{part of his}} game in his first few seasons at Arsenal; wasteful finishing also being symptomatic of the larger problem surrounding Arsenal in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, and Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down to a mental state, and even compared the Spaniard to Michel Platini, a French midfielder renowned for scoring. There were also concerns raised over {{the large number of}} games Fàbregas was playing for club and country <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> young age, but while he initially avoided long spells on the sidelines, he played significantly fewer games due to injury in his last three seasons with Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{viewed the}} {{partially}} finished results at Kenilworth in 1572, but the complete effect of Leicester's work was only apparent during the queen's last visit in 1575. Leicester was keen to impress Elizabeth {{in a final}} attempt to convince her to marry him, and no expense was spared. Elizabeth brought an entourage of thirty-one barons and four hundred staff for the royal visit that lasted an exceptional nineteen days; twenty horsemen a day arrived at the castle to communicate royal messages. Leicester entertained the Queen {{and much of the}} neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. The cost was reputed to have amounted to many thousand pounds, almost bankrupting Leicester, though it probably did not exceed £1,700 in reality. The event was considered a huge success and formed the longest stay <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> property during any of Elizabeth's tours, yet the queen did not decide to marry Leicester.|$|E
