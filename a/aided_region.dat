40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that foreign aid has been around {{in its present form}} since World War II, foreign aid analysis, {{especially}} from the donor 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, has been and continues to be highly contested. In 1992, the United Nations claimed that 2 ̆ 2 ODA [Official Development Assistance] allocation is 2 ̆ 7 strange and arbitrary 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 ODA is determined not by the needs of developing countries, but by the fluctuating goodwill of the people and their parliaments in the rich countries. As a result, it is largely ad hoc and unpredictable 2 ̆ 2 (United Nations Development Programme, 45). This statement cannot, however, explain why Africa is consistently the world 2 ̆ 7 s most <b>aided</b> <b>region</b> (Lancaster, 487). Something about African countries continually appeals to the donor countries, meaning that ODA allocation is not as strange and arbitrary as the UN claimed. This begs the question: What motivates donor countries to give aid to countries in Africa...|$|E

40|$|SummaryTranscription through {{immunoglobulin}} switch (S) regions {{is essential}} for class switch recombination (CSR), but no molecular function of the transcripts has been described. Likewise, recruitment of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (<b>AID)</b> to S <b>regions</b> is critical for CSR; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that intronic switch RNA acts in trans to target <b>AID</b> to S <b>region</b> DNA. <b>AID</b> binds directly to switch RNA through G-quadruplexes formed by the RNA molecules. Disruption of this interaction by mutation of a key residue in the putative RNA-binding domain of AID impairs recruitment of <b>AID</b> to S <b>region</b> DNA, thereby abolishing CSR. Additionally, inhibition of RNA lariat processing leads to loss of AID localization to S regions and compromises CSR; both defects can be rescued by exogenous expression of switch transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. These studies uncover an RNA-mediated mechanism of targeting AID to DNA...|$|R
30|$|As Fig.  5 shows, given a {{level of}} output, debt determines in which of the four regions the {{sovereign}} is. First, low levels of debt correspond to region 4 in which the sovereign honors its financial obligations and does not opt for financial <b>aid.</b> In this <b>region,</b> the debt burden is manageable and the risk premium is close or equal to zero. Under such circumstances, the sovereign has sufficient incentives to borrow, {{taking advantage of the}} low interest rates. Financial aid is not sufficiently attractive since it would impose a borrowing constraint. However, as the sovereign debt increases, the risk premium and, consequently, the interest rate tend also to rise. Thus, financing public expenditure and private consumption through borrowing becomes less appealing. Thus, the borrowing constraint associated with receiving financial aid from the multilateral institution would have more slackness. At the same time, the amount of debt is not sufficiently high to trigger a default episode. Under these circumstances, the sovereign would be located in region 3 and the economic distortion would increase. If debt continues to grow, its burden would increase and defaulting would become more attractive. In this setting, financial aid would prevent a default episode (region 2). Finally, for high enough levels of debt, the sovereign would default irrespective of the presence of financial <b>aid</b> (<b>region</b> 1).|$|R

40|$|The Pacific island {{countries}} depend {{heavily on}} bilateral aid.
