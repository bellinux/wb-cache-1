(in fact in Italian accounting, Vicenza Calcio already booked the transfer revenue of €2 million instead of €1 million in 2007-08 financial year (closing on 30 June each year), as another half as special co-ownership asset. if the remaining 50 per cent sold below the <b>accounting</b> <b>price,</b> the club would have had financial cost in that financial season). Thus, Rigoni was sold under the previous <b>accounting</b> <b>price</b> of €1M; and in accounting the transfer fee for the new signing (Di Donato) was amortized proportionally to player contract (5-year), which the supposed €1 million loss in 2008-09 now extended to €200,000 a season from 2009 to 2014 and zero in 2008-09, but deducting wage (which Vicenza saved a season by lending) and VAT.

Because accounting prices must be defined subject to the allocation mechanism for the economy, the prices derived in the two papers are equally valid within their respective allocation domains.

The recent turmoil in financial markets, however, has raised questions about whether fair value accounting is exacerbating the problems.

We propose a new model to study the interaction of accounting rules with regulatory capital requirements, and show that even when market prices always reflect fundamental values, the interaction of fair value accounting rules and a simple capital requirement can create inefficiencies that are absent when capital is measured by adjusted book value. These distortions can be avoided, however, by redefining capital requirements to be procyclical rather than by abandoning fair value accounting and the other benefits that it provides.

First, a direct two-period interregional model has been presented and then that model has been used for constructing its dual. As a result of solving the dual of an interregional programming model one obtained the following dual variables (<b>accounting</b> <b>prices)</b> : regional prices for commodities, transportation services, manpower, valuations on restrictions concerning production increases, old production facilities, national investment quotas, export to and import from particular foreign markets. These <b>accounting</b> <b>prices</b> point to the directions of changes in the free terms of constraints where one could find an improvement to the objective function. Therefore they are of paramount importance to the planner.

Loft (1986 a, 1986 b, 1990) has studied the British experience in depth, concluding that UK cost accountancy 'came into the light' as a result. It might be expected that similar developments would have occurred in America with the activities of the War Industries Board. In both countries, national associations were established {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the war to promote the professional standing of cost accountants. This paper utilizes archival materials {{in an effort}} to investigate whether US cost accountancy was developing more sophisticated costing techniques as Loft has claimed for the UK, or whether practitioners in this country were left 'still cursing the darkness'. Our findings suggest that cost accountancy developed in parallel fashion in both countries.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Hartwick rule for saving {{of a nation}} necessary to sustain a constant level of private consumption for a small open economy with an exhaustible stock of natural resources. The amount by which a country saves and invests less than the marginal resource rents equals the expected capital gains on reserves of natural resources plus the expected increase in interest income on net foreign assets plus the expected fall {{in the cost of}} resource extraction due to expected improvements in extraction technology. Effectively, depletion is then postponed until better times. This suggests that it is not necessarily sub-optimal for resource-rich countries to have negative genuine saving. However, in countries with different groups with imperfectly defined property rights on natural resources political distortions induce faster resource depletion than suggested by the Hotelling rule. Fractionalised societies with imperfect property rights build up more foreign assets than their marginal resource rents, {{but in the long run}} accumulate less foreign asets than homogenous societies. Hence such societies end up with lower sustainable consumption and are worse off, especially if seepage is strong, the number of rival groups is large and the country does not enjoy much monopoly power on the resource market. Genuine saving is zero in such societies. However, World Bank genuine saving figures based on market rather than accounting prices will be negative, albeit less so in more fracionalised societies with less secure property rights.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an introduction and four papers exploring {{various aspects of the}} Namibian economy. These aspects cover shadow pricing, environmental valuation and capital market development in Namibia. Paper I estimates the shadow prices of capital, labour and foreign exchange for the Namibian economy. The results suggest that the shadow price of capital for Namibia is 7. 2 %. The economic costs of Namibian labour, as a share of financial costs, are 32 % for urban semi- and unskilled labour, and 54 % for rural semi- and unskilled labour. The economic cost of foreign labour as a share of financial costs is 59 %. The estimated shadow exchange rate factor is 4 % for the Namibian economy. Paper II derives a set of <b>accounting</b> <b>price</b> ratios (APRs) for the various economic sectors of Namibia by using the Semi-Input–Output (SIO) Technique. An APR is the ratio between the market or financial price and the efficiency or economic value of a specific commodity or sector, which is useful for the economic analysis of investment or development initiatives. This larger set of APRs, derived on the basis of information contained in a Namibian Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), should be useful in improving the effective appraisal of development projects and other major investment programmes in Namibia. Paper III analyses returns and volatility on the Namibian and South African stock markets, using the daily closing indices of the Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX) and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The sample covers the period from 4 January 1999 to 20 March 2003. The methodology has three main parts: (i) unit root tests, (ii) cointegration analysis, and (iii) volatility modelling. The results show that the two markets exhibit very low correlations, and {{there is no evidence of}} a linear relationship between the markets. Furthermore, a volatility analysis shows evidence of no spillover effects. These results suggest that the NSX could be an attractive risk diversification tool for regional portfolio diversification in southern Africa Paper IV studies the determinants of property prices in the township areas of Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. The work‟s major finding is that properties located close to an environmental bad (e. g. garbage dump) sell at considerable discounts. On the other hand, properties located near an environmental good (e. g. a recreational open space) sell at a premium. These results provide evidence of the importance of environmental quality in lower-income property markets in developing countries. It is important, therefore, for Namibian urban planners to incorporate environmental quality into the planning framework for lower-income areas...|$|E
40|$|Training {{programmes}} for start-ups to turn unemployment into self-employment measure {{effectiveness in}} terms of economic indicators (Michaelidis & Benus, 2010; Baumgarter & Caliendo, 2008). The social impact in relation to health, happiness and sustainability is often neglected. A study on the social impact of Job Yourself, a non-profit organization in Belgium that helps unemployed people towards self-employment, revealed that aspects of sustainability were included in their guiding process, but at a modest level (Molderez, et al, 2013). Coaches spent a lot of attention on the hardline of business, i. e. customers, <b>accounting,</b> <b>price</b> setting. Survival of the young start-up was more important than including goals in relation to sustainable development. This outcome urged for a follow-up: how can young entrepreneurs be trained for social entrepreneurship, what are the challenges and obstacles to start with a social enterprise. In order to do so a multiple case study was set up. Social entrepreneurs were {{selected on the basis of}} Alter’s (2003) framework. She defines social enterprises as hybrid organizations that combine social and business interests. Different from socially responsible businesses and corporations practicing social responsibility, social entrepreneurs are characterized by a mission motive, stakeholder accountability and reinvesting of their income in the organization. According to Dees (1989) they are self-sufficient, market oriented and based on fulfilling social goals. To be able to make comparisons and to disentangle challenges and obstacles, social enterprises were chosen at different stages of their life-cycle: start-ups, young and mature organizations. The data was collected through surveys and interviews. The results demonstrated that social entrepreneurs started their company because of a passion for social change. It took more than one year to actually start their business. Despite the emphasis on a social mission they did not want to communicate about it. They focused on social goals because it fitted within their own philosophy and not because of the economic benefits of their social mission. The social change they could create with their enterprise, triggered them to effectively start an enterprise. They were intrinsically motivated and not inspired by the concept of shared value. Entrepreneurs that were guided by Job Yourself were stimulated to communicate about sustainability and to work on the social cohesion. But, they lacked guidance on how to integrate sustainability aspects in their company. Often entrepreneurs perceived conflicts between economic, ecological and social interests. They did not receive guidance on how to balance these interests. Social entrepreneurs did not get enough support from the external environment. Their market share was modest and suppliers with the same mission were hard to find. This obstacle was difficult to overcome by training programmes because too often social companies operate within a niche. Starting and surviving as a social entrepreneur remained a lonely business. Because they work on their own, they could not spend a lot of time on networking. Relying on their inner circle became a dangerous vicious circle.

40|$|Similar {{to other}} European {{countries}} with high unemployment rates (Caliendo & Künn, 2010; Congregado, Golpe & Carmona, 2010; Michaelides & Benus, 2012; Christensen, Parsons & Fairbourne, 2009) the Belgian government supports active {{labour market policies}} to turn unemployment into self-employment. The preferred way of achieving this goal is rather by facilitating than organising these programs by themselves. The legal framework for this policy was published in 2007. It defined the so-called ‘activity co-operatives’, non-profit organisations supported {{by the government to}} help unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups towards self-employment. During a limited period of time unemployed individuals can test their business project without losing their benefit. One of these activity co-operatives is JobYourself, located in Brussels. Brussels is one of the regions in Belgium with the highest unemployment rate: 19 %, contrary to 8, 4 % for the country and a very high unemployment rate for youngsters, i. e. 36, 4 %. The aim of JobYourself is much broader than reducing the unemployment rate. Having a positive impact on Brussels, improving the quality of life, reducing social injustice and stimulating cooperation all belong to their social mission. Training programs for start-ups to turn unemployment into self-employment often measure effectiveness in terms of economic indicators (Michaelidis & Benus, 2012; Baumgarter & Caliendo, 2008; De Mel, McKenzie & Woodruff, 2013). This is also the case when the effectiveness of incubators, another type of instrument to support start-ups, is analysed (Mas-Verdu, Ribeiro-Soriano, Roig-Tierno, 2015; Aerts, Matthyssens & Vandenbempt, 2007; Albort-Morant & Oghazi, 2015). The social impact in relation to health, happiness and sustainability is often neglected, although business incubators have a lot of opportunities in boosting sustainable business development (Hernandez & Carrà, 2016). According to Albort-Morant and Ribeiro-Soriano there is still a lack of articles on business incubators and this is even more the case for incubators with a social mission. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the social impact of JobYourself. Drawing on an ecosystem perspective (Deog-Seong, Phillips, Park & Lee, 2016; Pilinkiene & Maciulis, 2014; Zacharakis, Shepherd & Coombs, 2003; Zahra & Nambisan, 2012; Tsvetkova & Gustafsson, 2012) the study wants to reveal that JobYourself is a small, but important node in the entire network of organisations with the aim to reduce unemployment, to improve the well-being of people they support and to contribute to the sustainable transition of the city they are working in. The study is built on quantitative and qualitative research. An online survey was set up to be able to measure the social impact of JobYourself. Almost 40 % of the population, i. e. unemployed people who were guided by JobYourself during maximum two years, responded. It became clear that their coaches spent a lot of attention on the hardline of business, i. e. customers, <b>accounting,</b> <b>price</b> setting. Lowest priority for start-ups was to employ other people; the main goal of their start-up was to employ themselves. Despite the modest income, they were very satisfied about their quality of life. During their guidance by JobYourself they saw a positive evolution in their happiness, optimism and satisfaction. The added value of JobYourself was the mix of shelter and share: keeping their unemployment benefit and at the same time getting individual coaching and having the opportunity to develop a project without external pressure. Survival of the young start-up, however, was more important than including goals in relation to sustainable development. This outcome urged for a second part of the research: how can young entrepreneurs be trained for social entrepreneurship and what are the challenges and obstacles for training programs to help unemployed people to start with a social enterprise. In order to do so a multiple case study was set up. Social entrepreneurs were selected on the basis of Alter’s (2003) framework. She defines social enterprises as hybrid organizations that combine social and business interests. Different from socially responsible businesses and corporations practicing social responsibility, social entrepreneurs are characterized by a mission motive, stakeholder accountability and reinvesting their income in the organization. According to Dees (1989) they are self-sufficient, market oriented and based on fulfilling social goals. To be able to make comparisons and to disentangle challenges and obstacles, social enterprises were chosen at different stages of their life-cycle: start-ups, young and mature organizations. The data was collected through interviews. The results demonstrate that social entrepreneurs started their company because of a passion for social change. It took more than one year to actually start their business. Despite the emphasis on a social mission they did not want to communicate about it. They focused on social goals because it fitted within their own philosophy and not because of the economic benefits of their social mission. The social change they could create with their organisation, triggered them to effectively start an enterprise. They were intrinsically motivated and not inspired by the concept of shared value. JobYourself stimulated them to communicate about sustainability and to work on the social cohesion. But, they lacked guidance on how to integrate sustainability aspects in their company. Often, entrepreneurs perceived conflicts between economic, ecological and social interests. They did not receive guidance on how to balance these interests. Social entrepreneurs did not get enough support from the external environment. Their market share was modest and suppliers with the same mission were hard to find. This obstacle was difficult to overcome by training programmes because too often social companies operate within a niche. Starting and surviving as a social entrepreneur remained a lonely business. Because they work on their own, they could not spend a lot of time on networking. Relying on their inner circle became a dangerous vicious circle. Based on the results of the survey and the interviews, the paper aims to contribute to a holistic evaluation of the projects towards self-employment to enforce activity co-operatives such as JobYourself to incorporate sustainability criteria in their decision process and to focus more on sustainability as part of their coaching. In this way money from the government will be used to move towards more sustainability instead of only to reducing unemployment. In line with Bollingtoft (2012) the paper also wants to emphasise the importance of bottom-up initiatives among nascent entrepreneurs to exchange experiences in relation to sustainability.

40|$|We {{formulate}} {{two kinds}} of sustainability criteria by using feedback and arbi- trary rules for selecting policy variables in non optimizing economies. We show that when policy variables are selected arbitrarily their <b>accounting</b> <b>prices</b> could determine sustainability {{in addition to the}} <b>accounting</b> <b>prices</b> of the economy’s assets. We use our theoretical framework to obtain es- timates of sustainability conditions in real economies. Thus, the paper’s contribution consists in developing a systematic theoretical framework for determining value functions, <b>accounting</b> <b>prices</b> and sustainability criteria, under fairly general non-optimizing behavioral rules, and then showing that this framework can be used in applied work to estimate sustainability con- ditions. Based on our theoretical model, we examined the case of the Greek economy. When there is no binding environmental policy then migration rate, growth of capital per worker and exogenous technical change are strong positive factors for sustainability. When we introduce potential environmen- tal damages due to sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions, our …ndings indicate that these damages a¤ect negatively the sustainability criterion. sustainability criteria, non-declining social welfare, accounting...|$|R

The model incorporates only the unit of account function of money and exhibits {{a version of the}} classical dichotomy in which arbitrary <b>accounting</b> <b>prices</b> are independent of the equilibrium real relative price vector. A model with these properties is incapable of providing a theory of the price level or inflation, nominal interest rate rules or justifying a role for the central bank. Nominal magnitudes are nominal in name only and Wallace's analysis is without theoretical foundations. It generates a series of conceptual and logical puzzles. cashless; Arrow-Debreu economy; <b>accounting</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R
