5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} beige wall tiles with intertwining blue and orange stripes, {{representing}} the two {{colors of the}} New York City flag, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> of the IND Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue lines which serve the station. There are two fare control areas. The full-time area at {{the east end of}} the station, between 179th and 180th Streets, has a token booth and a bank of 12 turnstiles and two high-exit-only turnstiles. The part-time exit at 178th Street contains a nine-turnstile bank, two high exit entrance turnstiles (HEETs), and two high exit turnstiles. The two ends are connected by a full-length mezzanine, which features Our Spectrum of Support artwork by Reginald Polynice, a set of plywood cutout figures appearing to hold up the ceiling of the mezzanine. The station also features a control tower. The station is ADA-accessible via an elevator installed at 179th Place {{on the north side of}} Hillside Avenue.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{original}} label for THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured {{the image of}} three horses. This was done {{in part because of}} the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ("The Pleasure of Being Together"). The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> brightened. The band around the neck of the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.|$|E

25|$|For {{traditional}} art, {{there is}} little difference between the way night and day are illustrated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> that are used. For instance in early Rajput (also called Rajasthani) paintings, {{the only way to}} read that the painting is a night scene is through the presence of torches or candles. Later in the Rajput period, both somewhat influenced by Western art, night scenes were painted dramatically with shadows and Mughal paintings used chiaroscuro for shading.|$|E

The four buildings are aligned in order from the shortest to the tallest; the company says that the design is meant to evoke progress. The design of CAL Park was intended to evoke the concept of flight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> used in the design include blue, gray, silver, and white. The nine story hotel, which opened in September 2009, was scheduled to have 360 guest rooms.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Indian {{paintings were}} the rock paintings of pre-historic times, the petroglyphs {{as found in}} places like Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, {{and some of them}} are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of Ellora, Maharashtra state present an example of Indian paintings, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors,</b> mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of Ajanta and Ellora caves appeared. India's Buddhist literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.|$|E

25|$|Military flags {{occupied}} {{an important}} position. Ottoman flags separated by divisions (such as types of fields—tripes, quarters, etc.), colors and charges (emblems, inscriptions, lettering), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> of charges and their propositions. There were many Ottoman flags. Each with specific meaning. Contrary to Latin script, Ottoman flags (in Arabic script inscriptions are always read {{from right to}} left), are described from the opposite point of view — that is, with the flag fluttering to the left. Ottoman flags come in various shapes and are of different proportions, however they are predominantly rectangular and in some triangular. The Ottoman form of the fly is substantial, and it is descate. The Ottoman (most are) rectangular flags have a triangular fly, and usually have a border.|$|E
25|$|Ziya Songülen {{was elected}} the first President of the club, Ayetullah Bey {{became the first}} General Secretary, and Enver Necip Okaner was given the post of the General Captain. The {{lighthouse}} situated on the Fenerbahçe cape was a big influence {{on the design of}} the club's first crest, which sported the yellow and white colors of daffodils around the lighthouse. The kits were also designed with yellow and white stripes. The crest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> of the club were changed in 1910 when Hikmet Topuzer redesigned the badge and Ziya Songülen changed the colors to yellow and navy, from then on the iconic colors of the club. Fenerbahçe's activities were kept in secrecy until a legislation reform in 1908, when, under a new law, all football clubs had to register to exist legally.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominantly}} blue-green iridescent {{shell of}} abalone (or paua; genus Haliotis) is one last possible imitation. Abalone shell is inexpensive and plentiful {{owing to the}} commercial mariculture of these gastropods for their meat. The shell's structure is distinctive: sinuous bands of blue, green, and rose iridescence are delineated by dark brown lines of conchiolin, a proteinaceous material that holds the shell together. The luster of abalone shell is silky rather than the near vitreous luster of polished ammolite, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> of the two materials do not closely approximate. However, some abalone shell has been dyed and given a transparent cap of synthetic quartz, forming a doublet {{in the same fashion}} as ammolite. These doublets are perhaps the most deceptive, and have also been used to imitate opal. Under magnification most abalone doublets will show dye concentrated along certain areas and air bubbles trapped at the shell-quartz interface.|$|E

25|$|Open shop {{scheduling}} is {{a problem}} of scheduling production processes, in which there are a set of objects to be manufactured, each object has a set of tasks to be performed on it (in any order), and each task must be performed on a specific machine, preventing any other task that requires the same machine from being performed at the same time. If all tasks have the same length, then this problem may be formalized as one of edge coloring a bipartite multigraph, in which the vertices {{on one side of the}} bipartition represent the objects to be manufactured, the vertices on the other side of the bipartition represent the manufacturing machines, the edges represent tasks that must be performed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> represent time steps in which each task may be performed. Since bipartite edge coloring may be performed in polynomial time, the same is true for this restricted case of open shop scheduling.|$|E

500|$|Whitney's {{name was}} a {{significant}} subject of debate, as the school's first two proposed names were associated too closely with other schools in the area.

It was then designated as Liberty High School, but the name {{was associated with the}} rival Lincoln High School. Rocklin Unified School District finally decided on [...] "Whitney" [...] in honor of Joel Parker Whitney, the man who suggested that his successful Boston businessman father, George Whitney, invest in the 1854 development of Placer County, which was then a major locale for gold-seeking Argonauts. George Whitney would later found and develop the city of Rocklin. Additional debate revolved around the school's mascot and colors; deliberation around data collected via survey from the city of Rocklin and other Rocklin Unified School District entities ultimately convinced the district administration to choose the wildcat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> of maroon and gold. Construction began in October 2003 with preliminary site work and underground utilities; construction of the buildings started on April 2004.|$|E
