50|$|The rotor {{is turned}} by an <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> <b>motor</b> and gearing, and is {{required}} to be started before starting the boiler and also {{to be kept in}} rotation for some time after the boiler is stopped, to avoid uneven expansion and contraction resulting in warping or cracking of the rotor. The station air is generally totally dry (dry air is required for the instrumentation), so the air used to drive the rotor is injected with oil to lubricate the air motor.|$|E
40|$|A low {{compression}} turbocharged {{diesel engine}} {{is provided in}} which the turbocharger can be operated independently of the engine to power auxiliary equipment. Fuel and air are burned in a catalytic combustor to drive the turbine wheel of turbine section which is initially caused to rotate by starter motor. By opening a flapper value, compressed air from the blower section is directed to catalytic combustor when it is heated and expanded, serving to drive the turbine wheel and also to heat the catalytic element. To start, engine valve is closed, combustion is terminated in catalytic combustor, and the valve is then opened to utilize air from the blower for the <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> <b>motor.</b> When the engine starts, the constituents in its exhaust gas react in the catalytic element and the heat generated provides additional energy for the turbine section...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the engine and generator, engine-generators generally include a fuel supply, a constant engine speed regulator (governor) and a generator voltage regulator, cooling and exhaust systems, and lubrication system. Units larger than about 1 kW rating often have a battery and electric starter motor; very large units may start with compressed air either to an <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> starter <b>motor</b> or introduced directly to the engine cylinders to initiate engine rotation. Standby power generating units often include an automatic starting system and a transfer switch to disconnect the load from the utility power source {{when there is a}} power failure and connect it to the generator.|$|R
50|$|The basic hoist has two {{important}} characteristics to define it: Lifting medium and power type. The lifting medium is either wire rope, {{wrapped around a}} drum, or load-chain, raised by a pulley with a special profile to engage the chain. The power can be provided by different means. Common means are hydraulics, electrical and <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> <b>motors.</b> Both the wire rope hoist and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800s, however mass production of an electric hoist did not start until the early 1900s and was first adapted by Germany. A hoist can be built as one integral-package unit, designed for cost-effective purchasing and moderate use, {{or it can be}} built as a built-up custom unit, designed for durability and performance. The built-up hoist will be much more expensive, but will also be easier to repair and more durable. Package units were once regarded as being designed for light to moderate usage, but since the 60s this has changed. Built-up units are designed for heavy to severe service, but over the years that market has decreased in size since the advent of the more durable packaged hoist. A machine shop or fabricating shop will use an integral-package hoist, while a Steel Mill or NASA would use a built-up unit to meet durability, performance, and repairability requirements. NASA has also seen a change in the use of package hoists. The NASA Astronaut training pool, for example, utilizes cranes with packaged hoists.|$|R
50|$|Angle {{grinders}} can be {{powered by}} an electric motor, petrol engine or compressed <b>air.</b> The <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> a geared head at a right-angle on which is mounted an abrasive disc or a thinner cut-off disc, either {{of which can}} be replaced when worn. Angle grinders typically have an adjustable guard and a side-handle for two-handed operation. Certain angle grinders, depending on their speed range, can be used as sanders, employing a sanding disc with a backing pad or disc. The backing system is typically made of hard plastic, phenolic resin, or medium-hard rubber depending on the amount of flexibility desired.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a procedure {{to measure the}} transient effects in a fuel cell air delivery system. These methods were applied to model the 20 kW automotive fuel cell system {{that was used in}} Animul H 2, a fuel cell-battery hybrid sedan developed by a group of engineering students at Virginia Tech. The air delivery system included the <b>air</b> compressor, the <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> for the compressor, the motor controller, and any plumbing between the fuel cell inlet and the compressor outlet. The procedure was to collect data from a series of tests of the air delivery system with no load (zero outlet pressure) and at several loads. The air compressor speed, outlet pressure, and motor controller current were measured in response to a variety of speed requests. This data was fit to transfer functions relating the compressor speed, outlet pressure, or motor controller current to the speed request. The fits were found using a least squares optimization technique. After the experimental model was developed, it was augmented with an analytical model {{of the rest of the}} fuel cell system. The mass flow of the air was determined fro...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} are relatively commonplace but the typical range under battery power alone is under 100 miles per charge. Petrol/electric hybrid vehicles have an extended range, but are relatively expensive and complex in design. <b>Air</b> <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> {{vehicles are}} used in some airport applications because of their low ignition risk. This paper reports trials {{which took place in}} New Zealand of a simplified air/electric hybrid vehicle which demonstrate the combination of power sources is both viable and advantageous in terms of the efficiency of energy recovery during braking over electro-magnetic approaches (used in the Prius car). A golf cart was modified with a compressor and standard air motors to function as a hybrid vehicle testbed., Dissemination of the work via subsequent conference papers and presentations has resulted in further work with vehicle manufacturers in southern China. In 2010 this air/electric hybrid was a unique vehicle configuration. Unconnected with the project but signifying the importance of this research, Renault has recently adopted a similar regeneration system in some hybrid vehicles. The concept, all research work, test vehicle equipment design and production, recording of results and analysis was carried out jointly by the authors...|$|R
