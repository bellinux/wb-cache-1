However, I make the case that {{something}} very much like this is essential to living <b>a</b> <b>good</b> human <b>life.</b> I get at this by borrowing Claudia Mills’ account of the value of unchosen relationships. I argue that unconditional and unchosen love is an essential component of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> human <b>life,</b> and while we can get this by having children, we can also get it in other ways...|$|R

5|$|According to British filmmaker Tony Rayns the film's {{presentation}} of the vanity of a man, neglecting his family, is a critique of historic men in feudal Japanese culture. In his relationship with Wakasa, Genjurō is insignificant and is seduced by something greater, that he can never comprehend. However, by neglecting his family, Genjurō failed to appreciate he has already been blessed with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life,</b> and in the process, loses it.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life,</b> one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is the {{administration}} of an enzyme (intravenous or directly into the affected vein through a catheter), which acts to enzymatically break up clots. This may {{reduce the risk of}} post-thrombotic syndrome by a third, and possibly reduce the risk of leg ulcers, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The ACCP currently suggests anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis, but patients may choose thrombolysis if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost of the procedure. NICE recommends that thrombolysis is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks, are normally well, have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life</b> expectancy and a low risk of bleeding.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian texts take {{different}} views {{on whether the}} gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen {{as a product of}} isfet, the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat, and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with isfet, such as Set, could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give theodicies in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of this human misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom. They emphasize humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life.</b> Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods' will.|$|E
25|$|Darin Barney {{has written}} about technology's impact on {{practices}} of citizenship and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions, including {{the question of what}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life</b> consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life</b> is one that includes the use of more and more technology.|$|E

25|$|In {{philosophy}} and (western) religion, happiness {{may be defined}} in terms of living <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life,</b> or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.|$|E
40|$|In {{engaging}} with the repugnant conclusion many contemporary philosophers, economists {{and social scientists}} make claims about what <b>a</b> minimally <b>good</b> <b>life</b> is like. For example, some claim that such <b>a</b> <b>life</b> is quite <b>good</b> by contemporary standards, and use this to defend classical utilitarianism, whereas others claim that it is not, and use this to uphold the challenge that the repugnant conclusion poses to classical utilitarianism. I argue {{that many of these}} claims—by both sides—are not well-founded. We have no sufficiently clear sense of what <b>a</b> minimally <b>good</b> <b>life</b> is like. It is a result of this that the repugnant conclusion doesn’t license us in drawing any interesting conclusions...|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, Storytelling {{is a way}} {{to teach}} younger members of {{indigenous}} communities about their culture and their identities. In Donna Eder's study, Navajos were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want to see in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life.</b> In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people in}} the world reject older {{situated}} ethics and localized religious views. However small-community-based and ecology-centric views have gained some popularity in recent years. In part, this has been attributed to the desire for ethical certainties. Such a deeply rooted definition of goodness would be valuable because it might allow one to construct <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life</b> or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration or prioritisation. Ones that relied only on local referents one could verify for oneself, creating more certainty and therefore less investment in protection, hedging and insuring against consequences of loss of the value.|$|E

25|$|Bradlee {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} from several quarters for his perjury at the 1965 {{trial of the}} man accused of murdering Mary Pinchot Meyer, who was shot to death on October 12, 1964 while walking on the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath in Georgetown. Attorneys for both the prosecution and the defense (Alfred Hantman and Dovey J. Roundtree), in addition to D.C. Police Detective Bernie Crooke, along with authors Peter Janney and Nina Burleigh, have all noted the significant difference between the limited information Bradlee divulged under oath at the 1965 trial, and what he revealed 30 years later in his 1995 memoir <b>A</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Life.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Convergence: Booster Gold #2, {{following}} on {{from this}} event somewhat, the aged pre-Flashpoint Booster encounters the Zero Hour Ted Kord {{on the planet}} Telos, where Brainiac has gathered cities from across {{the history of the}} Multiverse. Booster explains to Kord that he has led <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>life,</b> married and had a son (Rip Hunter), and begins to age rapidly from time travel radiation sickness. Rip intervenes and forces the New 52 Booster to take his father into the raw chronal field contained at Vanishing Point; pre-Flashpoint Booster's body is destroyed, but he is reborn as Waverider, the all-knowing cosmic time traveller. Waverider then emerges on Telos in the final issue of Convergence along with the New 52 Booster and Goldstar to bring back Brainiac, and they convince him to save the Multiverse from its imminent destruction. Brainiac then sends Zero Hour Parallax and pre-Flashpoint Superman back to the conclusion of the Crisis on Infinite Earths to avert the original crisis event, and this results in many of the classic worlds of the Multiverse being reborn in their modern forms.|$|E
25|$|Asimov unsuccessfully {{tried to}} end the series with Second Foundation. However, because of the {{predicted}} thousand years until {{the rise of the}} next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, Asimov gave in after a 30-year hiatus, and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: Foundation's Edge. This was followed shortly thereafter by Foundation and Earth. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding Galaxia, a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. However, this concept was never explored further. According to his widow Janet Asimov (in her biography of Isaac, It's Been <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Life),</b> {{he had no idea how}} to continue after Foundation and Earth, so he started writing the prequels.|$|E
