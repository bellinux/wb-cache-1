2500|$|While {{working in}} the [...] "Murray Franklin's" [...] nightclub in Miami Beach, Florida, early in his career, Rickles spotted Frank Sinatra and remarked to him, [...] "I just saw your movie The Pride and the Passion <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, the cannon's acting was great." [...] He added, [...] "Make {{yourself}} at home, Frank. Hit somebody!" [...] Sinatra, whose pet name for Rickles was [...] "bullet-head", enjoyed him {{so much that he}} encouraged other celebrities to see Rickles' act and be insulted by him. Sinatra's support helped Rickles become a popular headline performer in Las Vegas. During a Dean Martin Celebrity Roast special, Rickles was among those who took part in roasting Sinatra, and Rickles, too, was also roasted during another show in the series.|$|E

This wasn't just Conan saying no; it was Conan saying no, and you're wrong, and, by the way, go fuck yourselves."

This is honest. Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: You can do anything you want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too." [...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?" [...] Conversations changed as to how much O'Brien would take to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.|$|E
