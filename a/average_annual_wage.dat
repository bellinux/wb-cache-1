40|$|My {{original}} {{motivation for}} selecting this topic for my Croft thesis {{was to examine}} {{an issue that is}} of community relevance in Mississippi and could reveal how multiple global regions intersect and affect {{the quality of life in}} Mississippi. Guided by this motivation, I decided to examine whether the expected effects of Japanese FDI projects in Mississippi have been achieved in terms of job creation relative to both job quantity and job quality. My particular analytical focus has been on the job-creation effects of the Nissan plant in Canton and the Toyota plant in Blue Springs. For my analysis, I used publically-available county level data that I sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics with the objective of comparing the employment levels and <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>wages</b> in the counties where the plants are located before and after their openings. I found that direct job creation from the plants was properly estimated, while indirect job creation was overestimated. This has contributed to a lower net employment effect than projected, although the two plants have created higher paying jobs in the counties where they are located. Other research has found that investment in human and physical capital is a more effective way of increasing employment than paying incentives to attract firms. Therefore, to ensure that future foreign direct investment creates stable, quality jobs, the Mississippi state government should balance its investments in education and infrastructure with incentives designed to attract foreign investments from diverse industries...|$|R

50|$|The {{agitation}} {{was carried}} out by metal workers, displaced from their daily chores by a lock-out. The industrial trade unionists sought to create greater class consciousness amongst farm workers, as people from the country-side could easily be brought to the factories as scabs in times of industrial disputes. Furthermore, many industrial workers were themselves former farm labourers and sympathized with the plight of those toiling the lands. Local farm workers associations were formed in Västmanland, Sörmland and Östergötland. A conference held on July 29, 1906 decided that the Västmanland and Sörmland party district committees would serve as an interim leadership of the new union. The union held its founding congress on December 30, 1906. However, even prior to its official foundation the organization had achieved a level of success.

Concerning the volume index of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita in PPS (Purchasing Parity Standards) we find Greece’s GDP per capita dropped from 4 % lower than the EU- 28 average in 2004 to 29 % lower in 2015. However, GDP is a measure of a country’s economic activity, and therefore it should not be considered a measure of a country’s well-being.

40|$|The Pacific Northwest is {{naturally}} endowed with vast forest resources. Federal public lands {{are an important}} part of this forest base, providing a variety of commodities, uses, and services. Forest resources support consumptive and nonconsumptive, and commercial and noncommercial uses that also provide for a mix of employment opportunities. From the perspective of regional economic development, timber production has been one of the largest economic drivers in the Pacific Northwest over the past century, and it remains an important economic component in many parts of the Northwest Forest Plan (the Plan) area. The relative importance of forest resource-related employment and income in the Plan area’s economy has changed over time, as has the contribution of forest products from the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands to this mix. Between 1990 and 2000, employment grew by 29 percent in the 72 counties in the Plan area. During the same period, manufacturing grew by 3 percent, compared to 56 percent employment growth in the services sector. Most of the other major industries grew at rates varying between 23 and 32 percent (fig. 3 - 1). Exceptions were mining (16 percent) and agriculture (4 percent). The low growth in manufacturing meant that this sector went from providing 13 percent of total employment in 1990 to 11 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, the services industry increased from 25 to 30 percent of total employment during this same period. The employment shift from manufacturing to services was consistent with nationwide shifts. Income changes between 1990 and 2000 followed a similar pattern. Manufacturing wage income made up 20 percent of all income in 1990 and dropped to 15 percent by 2000. Wage income in the services sector was 26 percent in 1990, and grew to 29 percent by 2000.
