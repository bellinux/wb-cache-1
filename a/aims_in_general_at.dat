In particular, it addresses the current lack of macroeconomic {{and more specifically}} post-Keynesian short run theories in green economics. This new paradigm is in its essence a radical ecofeminist approach to economics. From this vantage point, the ecofeminist framework of (re) productivity developed by Biesecker and Hofmeister is indeed very congruent with green economics. Moreover, {{the goal of the}} article is to develop normative (ecofeminist) criteria for green stimulus packages. This could improve green economic policy formulation and real-world implementation [Turk, (2008), p. 267]. green stimulus; reproductivity; productivity; post-Keynesian economics; ecofeminism; green economics; economic stimulus. ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the current}} project {{phase of the}} {{disposal}} of category A waste – short-lived low and intermediate level waste – ONDRAF/NIRAS must, following the governmental decision of 23 June 2006, develop a near surface disposal facility in Dessel, {{which is based on}} the near surface facility disposal design developed by the STOLA-Dessel partnership during the previous preliminary project phase. The present report {{is an integral part of}} the discussions between ONDRAF/NIRAS and the regulatory body FANC (Federal Agency for Nuclear Control) on the methodology and tools used for the long-term radiological safety assessments. These discussions <b>aim</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>at</b> informing and asking the advice of the FANC about the long-term radiological safety assessment methodology, the general principles to be employed in the treatment of uncertainties, and the scenarios that will be considered in assessing the long-term safety of the near surface disposal system. Safety is the most important and driving requirement in planning and implementing such facilities. This report NIROND-TR 2010 - 03 describes the components of the multi-layer cover and their functioning and provides an estimate of their long-term evolution. Gradual degradation processes and major disruptive events are described. Examples of the latter are earthquakes and erosion. Long-term evolution of multi-layer cover performance is governed by two components: the earth cover - a series of natural materials including sand, gravel, clay - and (mainly) a fiber reinforced concrete slab which forms the structural basis of the earth cover. The multi-layer cover fulfills the safety function limitation of water infiltration through the prevention barriers (R 2 a). It is difficult to define an exact timing for failure of the multi-layer cover to fulfill the safety function limitation of water infiltration through the prevention barriers. Gradual degradation processes alone would not quickly deteriorate the effectiveness of the earth cover, certainly not the first few thousands of years. However, its behaviour – after release of nuclear regulatory control - will be mainly affected by arthquakes, as the earth cover is not designed to withstand design basis earthquakes (DBE). Available information on impact assessments for earthquakes indicates that disruption of top layers will happen within the next 1 000 years; performance may further deteriorate as a result of sequences of earthquakes in combination with extreme erosion events. These observations have led to the decision to conservatively put the performance of the earth cover to zero as concerns safety function R 2 a at the end of the nuclear regulatory control phase. Infiltration in the earth cover is assumed to increase to its maximum value, determined by the evapotranspiration of any remaining vegetation (i. e., net rainfall = total precipitation - evapotranspiration). Unlike the earth cover, the fiber reinforced concrete slab will resist design basis earthquakes, although it is not designed to resist beyond design basis earthquakes (BDBE). A BDBE with a return period of 20 000 years and a probability of non-exceedance of 4 % at 816 y AP was considered. It is assumed that when the BDBE happens, i. e. at 816 years AP, the fiber reinforced concrete slab will no longer be effective in reducing infiltrating water. From then onwards, the overall multi-layer cover infiltration is maximal, determined by the net rainfall. For the multi-layer cover as a whole, a gradual increase in permeability (and hence infiltration) is assumed from the end of the nuclear regulatory control phase till the time of complete failure of R 2 a. This assumption will be imposed for safety and capacity calculations. For screening calculations, a much more conservative approach is taken: complete failure 40 years after start of cover placement...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: O presente trabalho tem por objetivo analisar o estatuto da linguagem em três domínios da filosofia de juventude de Nietzsche: filosofia estética, teoria do conhecimento e moral. Para executar essa tarefa, propusemo-nos {{investigar}} fontes histórico-filosóficas utilizadas por Nietzsche como material preparatório de sua teoria da linguagem, fontes do período que antecede sua entrada na Universidade da Basiléia - denominado pelos editores de Militärzeit - até meados dos anos de 1874. Essa etapa, configurada no primeiro capítulo dessa dissertação, pode também ser entendida como introdução ao tema dessa dissertação. Nela, trabalhamos também o conceito, muitas vezes não analisado pela bibliografia secundária consultada, de influência, objetivando, assim, encontrar um fio condutor que nos permitisse discutir o significado de seu consentimento ou não a doutrinas filosóficas e científicas do século XVIII e XIX. O segundo capítulo, que marca, propriamente, nossa incursão no domínio dos textos nietzscheanos de juventude, discutimos o estatuto da linguagem na filosofia estética de Nietzsche, notadamente, naquela apresentada nos fragmento e escritos póstumos preparatórios d'O Nascimento da Tragédia. Como se poderá notar, nosso exame, respaldado nos profícuos estudos de literatura secundária, primou por uma precisa, porém não exaustiva, reconstituição paulatina do trinômio: linguagem sonora (Tonsprache), linguagem-de-gesto (Geberdensprache) e linguagem-de-palavra (Wortsprache), que margeiam sua pesquisa sobre a origem, desenvolvimento e perecimento da tragédia grega. O terceiro capítulo, que se inicia retomando temas do capítulo anterior, assenta-se em dois tópicos fundamentais: (i) sobre o novo paradigma da teoria da linguagem, projetado por Nietzsche, em especial, no enigmático e afamado aforismo 12 [1], e (ii), partindo da tese oferecida por esse novo paradigma, o qual, é válido dizer, foi dispensado por Nietzsche quando da publicação de O Nascimento da Tragédia, apresentaremos a origem e o escopo de sua crítica à teoria do conhecimento, mais precisamente, à pergunta fundamental dessa disciplina, qual seja, como é possível o conhecimento universal e necessário dos objetos. O quarto capítulo tem como escopo explicitar, em linhas gerais, o estatuto da linguagem na crítica nietzscheana à moral. Essa investigação, por sua vez, tem como pressuposto o exame lingüístico e psicológico, operado pelo jovem Nietzsche em uma série de preleções, redigidas entre 1871 e 1878, sobre a filosofia platônica, dos principais conceitos da metafísica, tais como ser, essência, coisa em si e verdade. Nessa última incursão, indicaremos como a relação entre linguagem e moral pode oferecer um fio condutor para compreensão das bases futuras de seu filosofarAbstract: The goal of {{the present}} dissertation is {{the analysis of the}} status of language in three areas of young Nietzsche's philosophy, namely aesthetic philosophy, theory of knowledge and moral philosophy. In order to fulfill this task, I intend to investigate the historical and philosophical sources that Nietzsche has used as preparatory material for his language theory. The composition period I will analyse, corresponds to the time preceding his entrance in the University of Basel - period referred to as Militärzeit by the publishers - until the middle of 1874. This stage, the first chapter of this dissertation, {{can be seen as a}} simple introduction to Nietzsche's philosophy of language. In this context, I also work with the concept of influence, largely ignored by scholars. With it I aim at finding a conducting line which would allow a discussion about the meaning of Nietzsche's assent or not concerning philosophical and scientific doctrines of the XVIII and XIX centuries. The second chapter, which properly shows our dealing with his youth texts, discusses the status of language in the aesthetic philosophy of Nietzsche, namely that which is presented in the preparatory and posthumous works and fragments of The Birth of Tragedy. As it should be noted, my analysis, endorsed by importants studies of secondary literature, aimed at a keen, and yet not exhaustive, gradual reconstruction of the tripartite: tonal language (Tonsprache), language-of-gesture (Geberdensprache) and language-of-word (Wortsprache). This, in order to elucidate the origin, development and extinction of the Greek tragedy. The third chapter, which starts off with themes from the previous chapter, bases itself on two importants topics: (i) the new paradigm of theory of language, projected by Nietzsche, especially, in the enigmatic and famous aphorism 12 [1], and (ii), from the thesis offered by this new paradigm, which was dispensed with by Nietzsche for the publication of The Birth of the Tragedy, I will present the origin and the target of his critique to the theory of knowledge, that is, to the basic question of this discipline, namely how universal and necessary knowledge of objects is possible. The fourth chapter <b>aims,</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> lines, <b>at</b> expliciting the status of language in the nitzschean critique to morals. This inquiry has a presupposition the linguistic and psychological examination, operated by Nietzsche in a series of lectures, written between 1871 and 1878, concerning platonic philosophy. In these lectures, Nietzsche has focused on the main concepts of metaphysics, such as essence, thing in itself and truth. In this last incursion, I will show how the relation between language and morals can offer a conducting line to understanding the future basis of his philosoph...|$|R
