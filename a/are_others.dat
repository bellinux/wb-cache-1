5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa (dwarf forms) – Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in Victoria has two red-styled fairly compact dwarf forms, one (all {{serrated}} – slow-growing, possibly collina) {{growing to}} 1m, the (leaf ends serrated only, faster-growing) other 1.5m – and there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> reported but not named.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> {{that are}} made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> who are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E

50|$|The most known {{coding system}} is the World Health Organization ICD-Series, but there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> {{accepted}} classifications like DOCLE, NANDA or SNOMED Historically there <b>were</b> <b>others</b> like Berkson Coding System that are not maintained anymore.|$|R
5|$|The executioner was masked and disguised, {{and there}} is debate over his identity. The commissioners {{approached}} Richard Brandon, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200. It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, but there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> who have been named as potential candidates, including George Joyce, William Hulet and Hugh Peters. The clean strike, confirmed by {{an examination of the}} king's body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.|$|E
5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him <b>are</b> <b>others</b> who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition.|$|E

25|$|In May 2012, Williams {{launched}} i <b>am</b> <b>OTHER,</b> {{a multimedia}} creative collective and record label; i <b>am</b> <b>OTHER</b> {{also serves as}} an umbrella for his additional business endeavors, including a dedicated YouTube channel and apparel/textile lines.|$|R
25|$|Although the Dykes near Dykes House Farm {{have been}} studied, there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> earthworks, {{specifically}} those that run {{next to the}} Roman road and Lane Head Farm, Bacup Old Road and Plantation View in neighbouring Weir, which {{have yet to be}} investigated. In addition there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> properties which aren't associated with the Dykes such as Dikes Barn Farm which suggest there may <b>be</b> <b>other</b> locations in Broadclough that need to be analysed.|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> <b>other</b> six-sided dice {{that are}} mono-colored called Dragonkin {{that are not}} {{considered}} units. There <b>are</b> <b>other</b> ten-sided dice that are mono-colored called artifacts that are a type of magic item. Both {{are part of the}} Advanced Rules.|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{whistles}} described generate nearly pure tones {{that can}} be heard. The mountain tones discussed above are examples of tones that are inaudible because they are below the frequency range of humans. There <b>are</b> <b>others</b> whose sound levels are below the audible range of humans. For example, the vortex street behind a stick underwater might radiate at audible frequencies but not sufficiently to be heard by a Scuba diver. There <b>are</b> <b>others</b> that are both below audible frequencies and below audible levels.|$|E
25|$|A prototypical {{example of}} an {{algorithm}} is the Euclidean algorithm to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there <b>are</b> <b>others)</b> is described by the flow chart above and as an example in a later section.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, al- may be prefixed to any ism, {{regardless}} of gender, plurality, grammatical case, etc. However, this rule has some pathological caveats. That is, {{there are some}} nouns that al- may never be prefixed to, and there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> that al- must always be prefixed to.|$|E

25|$|Outdoor {{facilities}} are mainly {{based in the}} Riverside Sporting Ground, within a reasonable walking distance and bordering the Tay, although there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> - such as tennis courts - spread throughout the main campus. The ISE's 25m swimming pool is located within the Students' Association building on Airlie Place.|$|E
25|$|The Gwichʼin {{people of}} Old Crow are {{dependent}} on the Porcupine caribou herd for food and clothing, as <b>are</b> <b>others</b> in the Yukon. The Porcupine caribou herd migrates to the coastal plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska to give birth. That herd may be seriously threatened by oil-drilling in the ANWR.|$|E
25|$|Huxley {{was always}} able to write well, and was ever willing to address the public on {{scientific}} topics. Well over half his books are addressed to an educated general audience, and he wrote often in periodicals and newspapers. The most extensive bibliography of Huxley lists some of these ephemeral articles, though there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> unrecorded.|$|E

25|$|Euler angles are {{one way to}} {{represent}} orientations. There <b>are</b> <b>others,</b> {{and it is possible}} to change to and from other conventions. Three parameters are always required to describe orientations in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. They can be given in several ways, Euler angles being one of them; see charts on SO(3) for others.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} campgrounds on Fraser Island with varying {{amenities}} and access. The main camping areas are: Dundubara Campground, , Waddy Point campground, Central Station Tent Sites, Waddy Beach (tent only campsites), Cornwells Break (large group site), One Tree Rocks camp zone (Eurong-One Tree Rocks), however there <b>are</b> <b>others.</b> Permits {{are required for}} camping and also for vehicle access.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} types of mass analyzers, using either static or dynamic fields, and {{magnetic}} or electric fields, but all operate {{according to the above}} differential equation. Each analyzer type has its strengths and weaknesses. Many mass spectrometers use two or more mass analyzers for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). In addition to the more common mass analyzers listed below, there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> designed for special situations.|$|E

25|$|As usual Preah Khan is {{oriented}} toward the east, {{so this was}} the main entrance, but there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> {{at each of the}} cardinal points. Each entrance has a causeway over the moat with nāga-carrying devas and asuras similar to those at Angkor Thom; Glaize considered this an indication that the city element of Preah Khan was more significant than those of Ta Prohm or Banteay Kdei.|$|E
25|$|Huygens {{investigated}} {{the use of}} lenses in projectors. He is credited as {{the inventor of the}} magic lantern, described in correspondence of 1659. There <b>are</b> <b>others</b> to whom such a lantern device has been attributed, such as Giambattista della Porta, and Cornelis Drebbel: the point at issue is the use of a lens for better projection. Athanasius Kircher has also been credited for that.|$|E
25|$|The tour {{itself was}} {{recorded}} for posterity {{in a series}} of photographs that are now in the National Library of Australia. These photographs show the cricketers playing the game on a long tour, which took in many matches apart from the international series. However, there <b>are</b> <b>others</b> showing the players relaxing on their vessel, the SS Rotorua, and on trips, such as to Melbourne Zoo or up New Zealand glaciers.|$|E
