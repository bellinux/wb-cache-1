5|$|Malvern {{water is}} a natural spring water from the Malvern Hills {{on the border of}} the {{counties}} of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England. The Hills consist of very hard granite and limestone rock. Fissures in the rock retain rain water, which slowly permeates through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres a minute <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> has never been known to cease.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} {{respiratory}} tract <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of air also protect the lungs from larger particles. Smaller particles deposit in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are trapped in nasal hair after inhalation.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge's {{first act}} as {{secretary}} {{was to meet}} with assistant secretary John Archibald Campbell, who had opposed Breckinridge's nomination, believing he would focus on a select few of the department's bureaus and ignore the rest. During their conference, Campbell expressed his desire to retain his post, and Breckinridge agreed, delegating many of the day-to-day details of the department's operation to him. Breckinridge recommended that Davis appoint Isaac M. St. John, head of the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau, as permanent commissary general. Davis made the appointment on February 15, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of supplies to Confederate armies improved under St. John. With Confederate ranks plagued by desertion, Breckinridge instituted a draft; when this proved ineffective, he negotiated the resumption of prisoner exchanges with the Union in order to replenish the Confederates' depleted manpower.|$|E

5|$|In the {{simplest}} type of circulatory system, two lateral vessels are {{joined at the}} ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping vessels, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of fluid depends on contraction of both the vessels and the body wall's muscles. In some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but {{the function of the}} other pigments is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{a ring of}} four ganglia, {{positioned}} around the rhynchocoel near its front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli. These ocelli can detect light but can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is no heart, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves.|$|E

5|$|While Shigeru Miyamoto {{had been}} the {{principal}} director of Super Mario 64, he was {{now in charge of}} several directors as a producer and supervisor of Ocarina of Time. During its development, individual parts of Ocarina of Time were handled by multiple directors—a new strategy for Nintendo EAD. Four or five initial teams grew in number as needed over time, each working on different basic experiments of game design including scenario and planning, Link's actions and transforming classic 2D items into improved 3D form, camera experiments, motion capture, sound, special effects, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of time. However, when progress was slower than expected, Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more hands-on directorial role.|$|E
25|$|For a flow with an {{upstream}} Mach number {{greater than}} 1.0 in a sufficiently long enough duct, deceleration occurs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> can become choked. On the other hand, for a flow with an upstream Mach number less than 1.0, acceleration occurs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> can become choked in a sufficiently long duct.

25|$|When pumping {{water from}} an {{unconfined}} aquifer, {{where the water}} table is inside a soil layer with a significant transmissivity, the water table may be drawn down whereby the transmissivity reduces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of water to the well diminishes.|$|E

25|$|The other {{stationary}} hydraulic jump {{occurs when a}} rapid flow encounters a submerged object which throws the water upwards.

25|$|The {{redistribution}} of ice-water {{on the surface}} of the Earth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of mantle rocks causes changes in the gravitational field as well as changes to the distribution of the moment of inertia of the Earth.

25|$|Strong tones {{can occur}} in both {{rectangular}} and circular jets when the pressure ratio {{is greater than the}} critical <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> becomes supersonic on exit, resulting in a sequence of repetitive shock cells.

25|$|In modern times, {{the waters}} are 70% to 90% used for human {{purposes}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> is greatly reduced.

25|$|These storms {{are known}} as Nor'easters and often bring widespread, heavy {{snowfall}} to New England. The uninterrupted flat grasslands of the Great Plains also lead {{to some of the}} most extreme climate swings in the world.

25|$|Ice, {{water and}} mantle rocks have mass, {{and as they}} move around, they exert a {{gravitational}} pull on other masses towards them.

25|$|When {{shock waves}} are present, in a {{reference}} frame {{in which the}} shock is stationary <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> is steady, many of the parameters in the Bernoulli equation suffer abrupt changes in passing through the shock.
