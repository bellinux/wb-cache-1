40|$|Abstract- Grounding {{forms an}} inseparable {{part of all}} {{electronic}} and electrical designs, from circuit through system up to installation design. All the ground pins of the system should be tied to the <b>analog</b> <b>ground</b> plane, separated from the system’s digital logic ground, to achieve optimum performance in a mixed mode circuit. The ESD indirect discharge test is carried out to predict the effect of ESD on data in a mixed mode circuit when the analog and digital grounds are common and separate. The Indirect discharge is done for different voltages and distances. The susceptibility of a circuit to ESD can be greatly reduced by properly grounding it which is observed in the mixed mode circuit. In the mixed mode circuit the data is affected more by the ESD transients based on the discharge voltage given when the analog and digital grounds are common than {{when compared with the}} grounds being separate...|$|E
40|$|Substrate {{noise is}} one of the key {{problems}} in mixed analog/digital ICs. Although measures are known to reduce substrate noise, the noise will never be completely eliminated since this requires larger chip area or exotic packages and thus higher cost. Analog circuits on digital ICs simply have to be resistant to substrate noise. A general strategy is given which can be summarized as: the supply of the analog circuits must be referred to the substrate and the analog signals must be referred to a clean <b>analog</b> <b>ground.</b> Furthermore several design constraints are given to minimize the effect of substrate noise on analog. Two bandgap circuits are discussed and it is shown that apparently minor design issues, such as the connection of an n-well of a PMOS differential pair, can have large impact on the substrate sensitivity of this circuit. This has been verified by measurements...|$|E
50|$|More {{advanced}} circuits {{will often}} have pins carrying voltage levels for more specialized functions {{and these are}} generally labeled with some abbreviation of their purpose. For example, VUSB for the supply delivered to a USB device (nominally 5 V), VBAT for a battery, or Vref for the reference voltage for an analog-to-digital converter. Systems combining both digital and analog circuits often distinguish digital and <b>analog</b> <b>grounds</b> (GND and AGND), helping isolate digital noise from sensitive analog circuits. High-security cryptographic devices and other secure systems sometimes require separate power supplies for their unencrypted and encrypted (red/black) subsystems to prevent leakage of sensitive plaintext.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{these are}} caused by poor design. Where there is mixed signal {{technology}} on a printed circuit board, e.g. analogue, digital and possibly RF, it is usually necessary for a highly skilled engineer to specify the layout of where the grounds are to be interconnected. Typically the digital section will have its own ground plane to obtain the necessary low inductance grounding and avoid ground bounce which can cause severe digital malfunction. But digital ground current must not pass through the <b>analog</b> <b>grounding</b> system, where voltage drop due to the finite ground impedance would cause noise to be injected into the analogue circuits. Phase lock loop circuits are particularly vulnerable because the VCO loop filter circuit is working with sub-microvolt signals when the loop is locked, and any disturbance will cause frequency jitter and possible loss of lock.|$|R

40|$|The AD 677 is a {{multipurpose}} 16 -bit {{serial output}} analog-todigital converter which utilizes a switched-capacitor/charge redistribution architecture {{to achieve a}} 100 kSPS conversion rate (10 µs total conversion time). Overall performance is optimized by digitally correcting internal nonlinearities through on-chip autocalibration. The AD 677 circuitry is segmented onto two monolithic chips— a digital control chip fabricated on Analog Devices DSP CMOS process and an analog ADC chip fabricated on our BiMOS II process. Both chips are contained in a single package. The AD 677 is specified for ac (or “dynamic”) parameters such as S/(N+D) Ratio, THD and IMD which are important in signal processing applications. In addition, dc parameters are specified which are important in measurement applications. The AD 677 operates from + 5 V and ± 12 V supplies and typically consumes 450 mW using a 10 V reference (360 mW with 5 V reference) during conversion.

40|$|There {{is ongoing}} concern {{for human health}} during spaceflights. Of {{particular}} interest is the uncoupling of bone remodeling and its resultant effect on calcium metabolism and bone loss. The calculated average loss of bone mineral density (BMD) is approximately 1 - 1. 5 % per month of spaceflight. The effect of decreased BMD on associated fractures in astronauts is not known. Currently on the International Space Station (ISS), bone loss is managed through dietary supplements and modifications and resistance exercise regimen. As the duration of space flights increases, {{a review of the}} current methods available for the prevention of bone loss is warranted. The goal of this project is to review and summarize recent studies that have focused on maintaining BMD during exposure to microgravity. Interventions were divided into physical (Table 1), nutritional (Table 2), or pharmacologic (Table 3) categories. Physical modalities included resistance exercise, low level vibration, and low intensity pulsed ultrasound. Nutritional interventions included altering protein, salt, and fat intake; and vitamin D supplementation. Pharmacologic interventions included the use of bisphosphonates and beta blockers. Studies reported outcomes based on bone density determined by DXA bone scan, micro-architecture of histology and microCT, and serum and urine markers of bone turnover.

30|$|Figure  5 {{shows an}} optical {{micrograph}} of the manufactured ASIC preamplifier. Four sets of preamplifiers and temperature-compensated BGR circuits are {{built in a}} 5 × 5  mm bare chip. (The fourth circuits are the spares for the 3 -axis loop antenna.) The differential amplifier, gain adjustment amplifier, and BGR circuit for each axis occupy 1500 × 970 m, 630 × 630 m, and 160 × 280 m, respectively. To suppress the crosstalk between the loop antennas, all circuit components are isolated from each other with an <b>analog</b> <b>ground.</b> The gain measurement and simulation (SPICE) results for the ASIC preamplifier combined with a 0.01 -m^ 2 loop antenna (100 turns) are plotted in Fig.  6. The measurements were taken with a Helmholtz coil in a magnetically shielded room. The gain was designed to take a resonance frequency of 60  kHz {{for the detection of}} an LF standard electromagnetic wave by a virtual sounding rocket experiment, which will be discussed later. The gain measurement results agreed well with the simulation results. The measurements and simulation results for the NEMI of the ASIC preamplifier are plotted in Fig.  7. The NEMI measurement result is almost the same as that obtained by simulation, with the difference being caused by the error in the SPICE parameters and by neglecting the effect of noise due to the drain resistances R_d in the simulation. The NEMI for a previous preamplifier (assembled with discrete electronic components by Yagitani et al. 2011) combined with the 0.01 -m^ 2 loop (15  turns) is also plotted in Fig.  7. The power consumption of the ASIC preamplifier for a 1 -axis loop antenna was 5.0  mW with a 3.3 -V supply, which is half that of the previously reported preamplifier. The NEMI curve of the ASIC preamplifier was designed to be {{similar to that of the}} previous preamplifier. The number of coil turns (100  turns) was modified from the previous prototype (15  turns) in order to satisfy the mechanical requirements for the loop antenna in a sounding rocket experiment. The equivalent input noise voltage of the ASIC preamplifier is acceptable even though it is 6.7 (= 100 / 15) times worse. The noise characteristics of the ASIC preamplifier can be improved by using larger differential gate inputs (e.g., Rhouni et al. 2013; Ozaki et al. 2014). The NEMI for the ASIC preamplifier is sufficiently low for the detection of whistler-mode emissions excited by an electron beam from the Space Shuttle (Gurnett et al. 1986) shown on the same graph as a reference. Also, this MSEE sensor probe will be able to detect large amplitude whistler waves (up to several nT) in the radiation belts with a sufficient NEMI (Cattell et al. 2008). The formation and evolution of coherent whistler waves play an important role in understanding nonlinear wave–particle interactions. The validity of the gain and NEMI for the ASIC preamplifier will be discussed below, on the basis of a virtual sounding rocket experiment.|$|E
40|$|Historical studies {{performed}} by the JSC Pharmacotherapeutics Discipline suggest that exposure to spaceflight conditions may compromise the safety and efficacy of some medications. Follow-on studies have revealed that affected medications demonstrate reductions in active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) concentrations and altered release characteristics. It was hypothesized that the changes in API potency and release were from the medication's exposure to the harsh environmental conditions of spaceflight. Subsequent review of the spaceflight environmental control records {{from the time of}} these studies indicated that temperature and humidity levels aboard all spacecraft remained within United States Pharmacopeia (USP) recommended ranges to maintain optimal pharmaceutical stability. Therefore, space radiation was presumed to be the source of observed drug degradation.

40|$|Excitation {{energies}} to isobaric states, that are <b>analogs</b> of <b>ground</b> states, {{are dominated by}} contributions from the symmetry energy. This opens up a possibility of investigating the symmetry energy on nucleus-by-nucleus basis. Upon correcting energies of measured nuclear levels for shell and pairing effects, {{we find that the}} lowest energies for a given isospin rise in proportion to the square of isospin, allowing for an interpretation of the coefficient of proportionality in terms of a symmetry coefficient for a given nucleus. In the (A, Z) regions where there are enough data, we demonstrate a Z-independence of that coefficient. We further concentrate on the A-dependence of the coefficient, in order to learn about the density dependence of symmetry energy in uniform matter, given the changes of the density in the surface region. In parallel to the analysis of data, we carry out an analysis of the coefficient for nuclei calculated within the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) approach, with known symmetry energy for uniform matter. While the data from isobaric analog states suggest a simple interpretation for the A-dependent symmetry coefficient, in terms of the surface and volume symmetry coefficients, the SHF results point to a more complicated situation within the isovector sector than in the isoscalar, with much stronger curvature effects in the first. We exploit the SHF results in estimating the curvature contributions to the symmetry coefficient.

We believe that this competition produces a substantial percentage of aromatic product, with the concomitant lowering of the relative amount of crosslinking and is responsible for improving both thermal oxidative stability of tetrahydrophthalic end capped polyimides and their substantial frangibility.

The second approach employs a single parameter to scale only the opposite-spin direct term of CIS(D), starting from the one-parameter scaled opposite spin (SOS) MP 2 ground state, and is called SOS-CIS(D). By utilizing auxiliary basis expansions and a Laplace transform, a fourth order algorithm for SOS-CIS(D) is described and implemented. The parameters describing SCS-CIS(D) and SOS-CIS(D) are optimized based on a training set including valence excitations of various organic molecules and Rydberg transitions of water and ammonia, and they significantly improve upon CIS(D) itself. The accuracy of the two methods is found to be comparable. This arises from a strong correlation between the same-spin and opposite-spin portions of the excitation energy terms. The methods are successfully applied to the zincbacteriochlorin-bacteriochlorin charge transfer transition, for which time-dependent density functional theory, with presently available exchange-correlation functionals, is known to fail. The methods are also successfully applied to describe various electronic transitions outside of the training set.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Maxillary sinus floor augmentation was performed on 3 patients by grafting with 5 to 10 mL of a paste consisting of autologous powder from calvarial bone (diameter < 1 mm), 50 % v/v anorganic bovine bone mineral xenograft (PepGen P- 15, a new tissue-engineered bone replacement graft material), PRP (1. 8 x 10 (6) platelets/mm 3 plasma), and about 1 microg rhTF. Six and 10 months after grafting, bone cores were extracted for implant fixation and analyzed. RESULTS: Histology demonstrated a high degree of inorganic xenograft integration and natural bone regeneration. Both the xenograft and newly synthesized bone were colonized with osteocytes and surrounded by osteoblasts. Six-month-old bone cores demonstrated a ratio of synthesized bone to xenograft particles ratio of 0. 5, whereas 10 -month-old cores demonstrated a ratio of 2. A low degree of inflammation could also be observed using S 100 A 8 immunohistochemistry. DISCUSSION: Autologous grafting in edentulous patients is a complex procedure; the successful substitution of synthetic <b>analogs</b> for <b>ground</b> bone is a major challenge. CONCLUSION: In this investigation, it was shown that inorganic xenograft in the harvested bone paste could be safe for patients and had high bone regeneration capacity over time.

40|$|Determining {{the effect}} of space travel on the human immune system {{has proven to be}} {{extremely}} challenging. Limited opportunities for in-flight studies, varying mission durations, technical and logistical obstacles, small subject numbers, and a broad range of potential assays have contributed to this problem. Additionally, the inherent complexity of the immune system, with its vast array of cell populations, sub-populations, diverse regulatory molecules, and broad interactions with other physiological systems, makes determining precise variables to measure very difficult. There is also the challenge of determining the clinical significance of any observed immune alterations. Will such a change lead to disease, or is it a transient subclinical observation related to short-term stress? The effect of this problem may be observed by scanning publications associated with immunity and spaceflight, which began to appear during the 1970 s. Although individually they are each valid studies, the comprehensive literature to date suffers from widely varying sampling methods and assay techniques, low subject counts, and sometimes a disparate focus on narrow aspects of immunity. The most clinically relevant data are derived from in-flight human studies, which have demonstrated altered cell-mediated immunity and reactivation of latent herpes viruses. Much more data are available from post-flight testing of humans, with clear evidence of altered cytokine production patterns, altered leukocyte distribution, continued latent viral reactivation, and evidence of dramatically altered virus-specific immunity. It is unknown if post-flight assessments relate to the in-flight condition or are a response to landing stress and readaptation. In-flight culture of cells has clearly demonstrated that immune cells are gravity-sensitive and display altered functional characteristics. It is unknown if these data are related to in vivo immune cell function or are an artifact of microgravity culture. <b>Ground</b> <b>analog</b> testing of humans and animals, as well as microgravity-analog cell culture, has demonstrated utility. However, in all cases, it is not known with certainty if these data would reflect similar testing during space travel. Given their ready availability, <b>ground</b> <b>analogs</b> may be extremely useful for assay development and the evaluation of potential countermeasures. In general, the evidence base suffers from widely disparate studies on small numbers of subjects that do not directly correlate well with each other or spaceflight itself. Also lacking are investigations of {{the effect of}} gender on adaption to spaceflight. This results in significant knowledge 'gaps' that must be filled by future studies to completely determine any clinical risk related to immunity for human exploration-class space missions. These gaps include a significant lack of in-flight data, particularly during long-duration space missions. The International Space Station represents an excellent science platform with which to address this knowledge gap. Other knowledge gaps include lack of a single validated <b>ground</b> <b>analog</b> for the phenomenon and a lack of flight-compatible laboratory equipment capable of monitoring astronauts (for either clinical or research purposes). However, enough significant data exist, as described in this manuscript, to warrant addressing this phenomenon during the utilization phase of the ISS. A recent Space Shuttle investigation has confirmed the 31 in-flight nature of immune dysregulation, demonstrating that it is not merely a post-flight phenomenon. Several current studies are ongoing onboard the ISS that should thoroughly characterize the phenomenon. NASA recognizes that if spaceflight-associated immune dysregulation persists during exploration flights in conjunction with other dangers, such as high-energy radiation, the result may be a significant clinical risk. This emphasizes the need for a continued integrated comprehensive approach to determining the effect of prolonged spaceflight, separated from transient launch and landing stresses, on human immunity. After such studies, the phenomenon will be understood, and, hopefully, a monitoring strategy will have been developed {{that could be used to}} monitor the effectiveness of countermeasur...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{semester}} project was to implement a USB interface for Alan Stocker’s neuromorphic Optical Flow Chip (Motion 18). For this, a PCB with the necessary components was designed. Then, firmware for the onboard microcontroller was written. Finally, the setup was tested with custom host-side visualization software and optimized for framerate. Key components used on the PCB were a USB microcontroller from Silicon Labs, a 16 channel DAC from Analog Devices and two level shifters from Fairchild. These were used to set the bias voltages for the Optical Flow Chip, to clock it, to read out its data and to transmit the data via USB to the host. The device is powered entirely by the USB hub. As the Optical Flow Chip is noise-sensitive, steps were taken to minimize the noise on the PCB. The USB supply voltage was filtered using a ferrite bead and a 10 µF tantalum capacitor. For the routing, <b>analog</b> and digital <b>ground</b> separation and the high-noise USB data channels were taken into account. For the firmware, high transmission rate was the goal. Different steps to optimize speed were taken: USB transmission uses double buffering; the AD conversion is done in parallel to other tasks when possible; the transmitted 10 -bit values are packet into a bit stream to avoid waste of bandwidth; the loop control is done with efficiency as objective. i iiContent...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium is an {{essential}} nutrient for muscle, cardiovascular, and bone health on Earth, and during space flight. We sought to evaluate magnesium status in 43 astronauts (34 male, 9 female; 47 ± 5 years old, mean ± SD) before, during, and after 4 – 6 -month space missions. We also studied individuals participating in a <b>ground</b> <b>analog</b> of space flight (head-down-tilt bed rest; n = 27 (17 male, 10 female), 35 ± 7 years old). We evaluated serum concentration and 24 -h urinary excretion of magnesium, along with estimates of tissue magnesium status from sublingual cells. Serum magnesium increased late in flight, while urinary magnesium excretion was higher {{over the course of}} 180 -day space missions. Urinary magnesium increased during flight but decreased significantly at landing. Neither serum nor urinary magnesium changed during bed rest. For flight and bed rest, significant correlations existed between the area under the curve of serum and urinary magnesium and the change in total body bone mineral content. Tissue magnesium concentration was unchanged after flight and bed rest. Increased excretion of magnesium is likely partially from bone and partially from diet, but importantly, it does not {{come at the expense of}} muscle tissue stores. While further study is needed to better understand the implications of these findings for longer space exploration missions, magnesium homeostasis and tissue status seem well maintained during 4 – 6 -month space missions...|$|R
40|$|The ROBEX (Robotic Exploration under Extreme Conditions) {{alliance}} {{formed by}} the German Helmholtz Association has the aim to find and use areas of overlapping competencies between institutions involved with the exploration of deep sea and space environment. To demonstrate the developed systems and technologies two test campaigns are conducted, one for the deep sea {{in the area of}} Svalbard, Norway and one on the volcano Mt. Etna in Sicily, Italy as an Moon environment <b>analog</b> test <b>ground.</b> The objective of the volcano mission is to demonstrate seismic experiments built-up and conducted autonomously by robotic elements. It shall serve as scientific benchmark to validate concepts reproducing and extending experiments from the Apollo program {{and at the same time}} demonstrate robotic capabilities to do so without direct human interaction. The overall test infrastructure consisting of a stationary lander, a mobile element and instrument carriers has been developed within the ROBEX alliance. The modular instrument carrier, referred to as Remote Unit (RU), is deployed and positioned by a robotic system and supplies the payload, in this case the seismometer, with power, data-handling and communication. It also provides mechanical interfaces to the lander and a grapple interface for robotic handling. The RU’s primary structure is a differential carbon-fiber-reinforced-plastic (CFRP) framework with a dedicated payload and bus compartment. Two types of RUs have been developed: one basic version that complies with a mass limitation of 3 kg (RU 3) and one extended version of 10 kg (RU 10). While the basic version has a fixed seismometer as well as limited lifetime due to the lack of photovoltaics, the extended version is equipped with a self-levelling seismometer, photovoltaics and an inductive power/data interface for unit charging and telemetry/telecommand (TT&C). Both designs use the identical main structure to meet the envisaged modularity approach. Even though the hardware was never meant to enter the space environment, the design approach for the units was always driven by principles which could be functional under space conditions while respecting the peculiarities and the financial framework of this terrestrial demonstration. This paper presents the functionalities of the RU with a special focus on the overall configuration, structural concept as well as included mechanisms. Moreover, starting with the baseline design for the terrestrial application, it analyses the differences and derives necessary changes and modifications to further develop the system towards a usage in an actual Moon mission...|$|R
40|$|Concerning {{ground-based}} space physiological research, {{the choice}} of analog must carefully match the system of interest. For spaceflight-associated immune dysregulation (SAID), Antarctica winter-over has emerged as potentially the best terrestrial analog. The prolonged mission durations, extreme/dangerous environment, station-based lifestyle, isolation from outside world, disrupted circadian rhythms, and other psychological aspects make this analog extremely high fidelity for exploration-class space missions (long duration lunar, Mars). NASA, ESA and RSA are currently investigating SAID, with NASA currently operating the Integrated Immune flight study. It is desirable to have a <b>ground</b> <b>analog</b> for SAID validated, so that potential countermeasures might be validated terrestrially prior to during flight. For this presentation, NASA data collected on the winterover 2009 crewmembers, baseline through early deployment will be presented. Through early deployment (approximately 2 - 3 weeks at Concordia), phenotypic alterations included increased levels of memory T cells, shifts among the CD 8 + T cell compartment to a more mature phenotype, and increases in constitutively activated T cells. CD 8 +/IFNg+ T cell percentages, and T cell blastogenesis functional responses were depressed early deployment as compared to healthy controls. In four compatible subjects, secreted T cell Th 1 /Th 2 cytokines were measured following culture stimulation, and a Th 2 shift was observed as compared to controls. Post-winter over frozen sample return {{will be required to}} determine if this shift persisted during the winter over period. Additionally, circadian rhythms remained altered compared to baseline, as determined through 5 x daily cortisol measurements. Latent viral reactivation will not be determined until frozen sample return occurs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Adequate crew {{recovery}} on long-haul flights {{is critically}} important. Previous data {{of our group}} suggests that sleep in a crew rest compartment mock-up (CRC) under conditions equivalent to an airliner cabin at cruising altitude is impaired and leads to a reduction of blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2). To identify possible causes for this interaction of sleep and SpO 2 under hypobaric conditions we conducted a set of experiments altering overall ambient pressure (pA) and partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2) independently by oxygen enrichment of the atmosphere inside the CRC. Methods: We used a specially furnished pressure chamber to realistically simulate the atmospheric conditions, confinement and noise inside an airliner. 12 healthy volunteers (6 females, age 26. 2 years ± 5. 1 SD) slept 3 nights in the CRC with different compositions of the atmosphere: 1. flight condition (pA and pO 2 equivalent to a cabin altitude of 8. 000 ft), 2. ground condition (pA and pO 2 <b>analog</b> to local <b>ground</b> level) and 3. oxygen enrichment (pA corresponding to flight condition and pO 2 to ground condition). Participants were blind to the test condition and given a 4 -h sleep opportunity each night (0 : 00 - 4 : 00 am). Polysomnographic data and SpO 2 were recorded. Results: Sleep parameters improved significantly between flight condition and oxygen enrichment. Sleep onset latency was reduced from (mean±SE) 17 ± 5 to 13 ± 2 Minutes (p< 0. 0001), sleep period time (SPT) prolonged from 218 ± 3 as compared to 227 ± 3 Minutes (p< 0. 01), and sleep efficiency increased from 83. 9...|$|R
40|$|Management {{of medical}} and {{research}} data at NASA's Johnson Space Center has been addressed with two separate, independent systems: the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (formerly, The Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health) (LSAH) and the Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Project management for these has been autonomous {{with little or no}} cross-over of goals, objectives or strategy. The result has been limited debate and discussion regarding how contents from one repository might impact or guide the direction of the other. It is decidedly more efficient to use existing data and information than to re-generate them. Ensuring that both clinical and research data / information are accessible for review is a central concept to the decision to unify these repositories. In the past, research data from flight and <b>ground</b> <b>analogs</b> has been held in the LSDA and medical data held in the Electronic Medical Record or in console flight surgeon logs and records. There was little cross-pollination between medical and research findings and, as a result, applicable research was not being fully incorporated into clinical, in-flight practice. Conversely, findings by the console surgeon were not being picked up by the research community. The desired life cycle for risk mitigation was not being fully realized. The goal of unifying these repositories and processes is to provide a closely knit approach to handling medical and research data, which will not only engender discussion and debate but will also ensure that both categories of data and information are used to enhance the use {{of medical and}} research data to reduce risk and promote the understanding of space physiology, countermeasures and other mitigation strategie...|$|R
40|$|The IMAG Pilot Study, {{recently}} completed at the University of Texas Medical Branch, {{filled in the}} second major gap in knowledge {{standing in the way}} of development of a practical Short Radius Centrifuge (SRC) and the use of Artificial Gravity (AG) as a multi-system countermeasure to combat the deconditioning associated with extended weightlessness. (The first challenge, to adapt rapidly rotating subjects to permit unlimited head movements without excessive motion sickness, was achieved in a series of studies at MIT involving incremental increases in head and centrifuge velocity.) It remained to be demonstrated that intermittent exposure to AG, at only one hour per day for 21 days, would have any positive effect on slowing or eliminating of deconditioning. Bed-rested normal subjects were used as a <b>ground</b> <b>analog</b> for astronauts in weightlessness. The results are clearly positive for the key physiological systems of interest: cardiovascular, muscle, and bone. No functionally relevant changes were observed in immune, cognitive, or sensory-motor function. Furthermore, we found that our initial concerns about the inability of deconditioned subjects to withstand daily centrifugation without syncope were misplaced. These encouraging initial results clearly support the further development of AG protocols. We recommend, as the next steps, the integration of a controlled exercise device on the SRC to determine the synergy between AG and exercise. Coupled with appropriate exercise device(s) the AG protocol will be tuned to-ward an optimal prescription for minimum exposure duration and frequency, maximum AG level and SRC speed [...] Performance of these next steps will require extensive use of bed-rest/centrifuge facilities and eventually validation using an SRC in space. A space SRC could be placed in the ISS or on a planetary surface...|$|R
