5|$|The 1707 Acts of Union had merged the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland {{into one}} {{national}} entity, but they retained separate legal systems. However, the House of Lords became {{the highest court}} of appeal in both English and Scottish law, and as a result, from 1707 Scottish cases on appeal from the Court of Session were sent there. To deal with these cases, a barrister had {{to be familiar with}} both Scottish and English law, and Murray found his niche, acting in Scottish cases in the House of Lords as early as 1733. His work in Moncrieff v Moncrieff in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords Cowper and Parker. After Moncrieff, Murray was involved in almost every case in the House of Lords, whether it had been <b>appealed</b> <b>from</b> a Scottish court or not.|$|E
25|$|The District Court ruled for the plaintiffs, {{holding that}} the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional. Because the Act {{established}} an expedited appeal process for challenges, {{the case was}} directly <b>appealed</b> <b>from</b> the District Court to the Supreme Court.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the cases}} of HIH, Cambridge Gas and Rubin are all treated as stating {{principles}} of English law, curiously {{each one of the}} decisions is a decision of the Privy Council on <b>appeal</b> <b>from</b> another common law jurisdiction (HIH was on <b>appeal</b> <b>from</b> Bermuda, Cambridge Gas was on <b>appeal</b> <b>from</b> the Isle of Man, and Rubin was on <b>appeal</b> <b>from</b> the Cayman Islands).|$|R
25|$|The Federal Court is {{the highest}} court in Malaysia. The Federal Court may hear appeals of civil {{decisions}} of the Court of Appeal where the Federal Court grants leave to do so.

25|$|Only Near <b>appealed</b> <b>from</b> this {{decision}} to the U.S. Supreme Court, thanks to last-minute financial help from Col. Robert R. McCormick, the legendary {{publisher of the}} Chicago Tribune. This time, the Court, by a narrow 5-4 margin reversed {{the decision of the}} Minnesota Supreme Court and ruled that the Public Nuisance Law of 1925 was unconstitutional. The reversal was based largely on changes to the makeup of the Supreme Court between the two arguments. A quotation from the decision written by Hughes is engraved {{in the lobby of the}} Tribune today.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{may call}} for {{and examine the}} record of any civil {{proceedings}} before any subordinate court to satisfy itself that any decision made was correct, legal and proper, and that the proceedings were not irregular. Having called for the records, the Court may give orders, including directing that a new trial be held, as seem necessary to secure that substantial justice is done. Although the Court can either act on its own motion or at the instance of a party, it will not entertain a request by a party to exercise its power of revision if the party could have <b>appealed</b> <b>from</b> the subordinate court decision but failed to do so.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Court has appellate {{jurisdiction}} over direct <b>appeals</b> <b>from</b> the Superior Court, Family Court, and Court of Chancery. Because {{it is the}} only appellate court in the state, its jurisdiction over <b>appeals</b> <b>from</b> final orders is mandatory.

50|$|<b>Appeals</b> <b>from</b> Australian {{courts to}} the Privy Council were {{initially}} possible, however the Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968 closed off all {{appeals to the}} Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation, and the Privy Council (<b>Appeals</b> <b>from</b> the High Court) Act 1975 closed almost all routes of <b>appeal</b> <b>from</b> the High Court. The Australia Act 1986 eliminated <b>appeals</b> <b>from</b> state Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. <b>Appeals</b> <b>from</b> the High Court to the Privy Council are now only theoretically possible in inter se matters with leave of the High Court under section 74 of the Constitution; however, the High Court has indicated it will not grant such leave in the future.|$|R

25|$|During {{much of the}} 20th century, {{the court}} system in Puerto Rico had {{consisted}} of Municipal Courts, District Courts, and the Supreme Court. Cases could be <b>appealed</b> <b>from</b> Municipal Courts to commonwealth District Courts. From the commonwealth District Courts cases were then appealed to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Supreme Court. Municipal and District courts have existed in Puerto Rico {{since at least the}} 19th century. When the United States invaded the island, it set to reorganize the judicial system. The U.S. military regime in Puerto Rico promulgated Order 118 of 1899, by which the system of Criminal Courts and Courts of First Instance and Investigation were replaced by five district courts in San Juan, Ponce, Mayaguez, Arecibo and Humacao.|$|E
