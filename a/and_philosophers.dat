5|$|A related {{problem is}} how someone's propositional attitudes (e.g. beliefs and desires) cause that individual's neurons to fire and muscles to contract. These {{comprise}} {{some of the}} puzzles that have confronted epistemologists <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> of mind from at least the time of René Descartes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a {{conception}} of history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the Thucydidean history). While poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> were beginning to criticize them.|$|E
5|$|Culture in German {{states has}} been shaped by major {{intellectual}} and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. Historically Germany has been called Das Land der Dichter und Denker ("the land of poets and thinkers"), because of the major role its writers <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> have played {{in the development of}} Western thought.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{competing}} hypotheses about the ultimate {{fate of the}} Universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.|$|E
5|$|Born as Vasudeva in Pajaka {{village near}} Udupi in 1238, he learnt the Vedas and Upanishads under his guru Achyutapreksha. He was {{initiated}} into sanyasa (asceticism) {{after which he}} earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha). Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with many scholars <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple. Unlike Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) who preached Advaita philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded Vishishtadvaita philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Daoism and Buddhism {{were the}} {{dominant}} religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply impacting many beliefs {{and principles of}} Neo-Confucianism throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> of the time. Older beliefs in ancient Chinese mythology, folk religion, and ancestor worship also played a large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Vijayanagara Empire, poets, {{scholars}} <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> wrote primarily in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit, and also in other regional languages such as Tamil and covered such subjects as religion, biography, Prabandha (fiction), music, grammar, poetry, medicine and mathematics. The administrative and court languages of the Empire were Kannada and Telugu—the latter was the court language and gained even more cultural prominence during the reign of the last Vijayanagara kings. Telugu was a popular literary medium, reaching its peak under the patronage of Krishnadevaraya.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played {{a large role}} in the {{transformation}} of Church sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen, into the prominent universities of Europe. Scholastic theologians <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers <b>and</b> <b>philosophers.</b>|$|E

Anthony Epstein, co-discoverer of the Epstein-Barr virus, was Professor of Pathology at the university from 1968–1982., Sir John Lennard-Jones, discoverer of the Lennard-Jones potential in physics and Alfred Marshall, one of the University College's principals and influential economist {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century. Mathematicians <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> Rohit Parikh and Brian Rotman lectured in the mathematics department, and philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend taught in the Department of Philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The Deshastha {{community}} has produced several saints <b>and</b> <b>philosophers.</b> Most {{important of these}} were Dnyaneshwar, Eknath and Ramdas. The most revered of all Bhakti saints, Dnyaneshwar was universally acclaimed for his commentary on the Bhagvad Gita. He lived in the 13th century. Eknath was yet another Bhakti saint who published an extensive poem called the Eknathi Bhagwat in the 16th century. Other works of Eknath include the Bhavartha Ramayana, the Rukmini Swayamwara and the Swatma Sukha. The 17th century saw the Dasbodh of the saint Samarth Ramdas, who was also the spiritual adviser to Shivaji.|$|E

5|$|The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for Greek {{anatomy and}} physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and {{books of the}} liberal arts in the world {{during the time of}} the Greeks, but was also home to many medical {{practitioners}} <b>and</b> <b>philosophers.</b> Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemy rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.|$|E
5|$|There were {{repeated}} attempts by some Polish academics <b>and</b> <b>philosophers,</b> many {{related to the}} prewar Lwów–Warsaw school – such as Leszek Kołakowski, Stanisław Ossowski and Adam Schaff – to develop a specific form of Polish Marxism. Their attempts to create a bridge between Poland's history and Marxist ideology were mildly successful, although stifled due to the regime's unwillingness to risk {{the wrath of the}} Soviet Union for deviating too far from the Soviet party line. Kołakowski, a leading revisionist, was verbally attacked by Gomułka in 1957, expelled from the party in 1966 and in 1968 had to emigrate.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an {{intellectual}} environment in her court, which {{was open to}} scholars <b>and</b> <b>philosophers.</b> She was tolerant toward her subjects, and protected religious minorities.

5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, <b>and</b> <b>philosophers</b> through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E
