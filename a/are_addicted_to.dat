25|$|For {{individuals}} {{addicted to}} prescription drugs, treatments {{tend to be}} similar to those who <b>are</b> <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> drugs affecting the same brain systems.

25|$|Approximately half of {{patients}} attending {{mental health services}} for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia {{are the result of}} alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. Sometimes anxiety pre-existed alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence but the alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence act to keep the anxiety disorders going and often progressively making them worse. Many people who <b>are</b> <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> alcohol or prescribed benzodiazepines when it is explained to them they have a choice between ongoing ill mental health or quitting and recovering from their symptoms decide on quitting alcohol or their benzodiazepines. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol or benzodiazepines will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms. Symptoms may temporarily worsen however, during alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal.|$|E

Baird denied that the message was partisan and initially refused to apologize. The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate and it was removed by the government, with an apology.|$|E

He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me.

2500|$|The first group, wanton addicts, have no second-order {{desire not to}} {{take the}} drug. The second group, [...] "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire {{not to take the}} drug, while the third group, [...] "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and {{therefore}} are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they <b>are</b> <b>addicted</b> <b>to.</b> Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference. Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} levels of {{decision}} {{is presented in}} a different manner by Frankfurt. Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the [...] "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) {{to the effect that}} one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are [...] "wanton addicts", [...] "unwilling addicts" [...] and [...] "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they <b>are</b> <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> and to not want to take it.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking {{of opium}} {{came on the}} heels of tobacco smoking and may have been {{encouraged}} by a brief ban on the smoking of tobacco by the Ming emperor. The prohibition ended in 1644 with the coming of the Qing dynasty, which encouraged smokers to mix in increasing amounts of opium. In 1705, Wang Shizhen wrote, [...] "nowadays, from nobility and gentlemen down to slaves and women, all <b>are</b> <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> tobacco." [...] Tobacco in that time was frequently mixed with other herbs (this continues with clove cigarettes to the modern day), and opium was one component in the mixture. Tobacco mixed with opium was called madak (or madat) and became popular throughout China and its seafaring trade partners (such as Taiwan, Java, and the Philippines) in the 17th century. In 1712, Engelbert Kaempfer described addiction to madak: [...] "No commodity throughout the Indies is retailed with greater profit by the Batavians than opium, which [...] users cannot do without, nor can they come by it except it be brought by the ships of the Batavians from Bengal and Coromandel." ...|$|E
