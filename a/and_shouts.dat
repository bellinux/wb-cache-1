5|$|Blues is a {{combination}} of African work songs, field hollers, <b>and</b> <b>shouts.</b> It developed in the rural South {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale, with a flatted or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.|$|E

Jamal appears to shout something {{in the direction of}} the cameraman, then waves <b>and</b> <b>shouts</b> {{in the direction of the}} Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry.

5|$|The player {{needs to}} make moral {{decisions}} at certain points during the game, including making choices that can determine the fate of both soldiers and civilians. These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squadmates, and will cause them to react differently. The game has several subtle effects as the team starts being broken mentally and physically, including the degradation of their combat uniforms. Walker has visual and auditory hallucinations later into the game, and his executions of enemies become more violent. The orders <b>and</b> <b>shouts</b> to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice. His kill confirmations of enemies corrupts from professional in the beginning to psychotic. Similarly, loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player, but as the game progresses, the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker's actions, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall by addressing the player directly. The game features collectibles known as Intel, which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players.|$|E
