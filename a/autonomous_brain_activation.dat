40|$|Human {{computer}} interface (HCI) {{has become}} more and more important in the last few years. This is mainly due to the increase in the technology and in the new possibilities in yielding a help to disabled people. Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) represent a subset of the HCI systems which use measurements of the voluntary brain activity for driving a communication system mainly useful for severely disabled people. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been intensively used for the measurement of electrical signals related to the brain activity. The BCI usage requires the activation of mental tasks that could be derived by external stimulations (often audio-visual) or by autonomous activations (for example by thinking to move an arm for signaling a binary command). In the last few years, a new paradigm of activation has been used, consisting in the <b>autonomous</b> <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> through self-induced emotions, remembered on autobiographical basis. In the present paper, we describe {{the state of the art}} of a BCI system based on self-induced emotions, from the activation paradigm to the used signal classification strategies and the final graphic interface.

40|$|Nowadays, {{children}} are frequently diagnosed with attention problems. Past {{research suggests that}} these problems are a manifestation of different underlying neurobiological causes. Therefore, {{the present study investigated}} whether subgroups could be identified based on <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> in a sample of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and a group of children with autism in combination with attention problems. Thereby, we looked at attention problems in a broader sense. Based on the multiple pathway theory we hypothesized that subgroups within the attention problem group would display distinct deficits in brain systems underlying response inhibition and reward anticipation. In the current study (N = 42), we used latent class analysis to identify homogenous neurobiological subgroups based on <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> as measured by fMRI during a reward anticipation task (Monetary Incentive Delay task) and a response inhibition task (go/no-go task). Three subgroups were found: one low in anticipatory <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> and low in inhibitory <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> (low-reward/low-inhibition), one low in anticipatory <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> and high in inhibitory <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> (low-reward/high-inhibition), and a third high in anticipatory <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> and average in inhibitory <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> (high-reward/medium-inhibition), relative to between-subgroup differences. These three subgroups were subsequently compared on cognitive and behavioral measures of reward sensitivity and response inhibition. Results indicated that the subgroup low in anticipatory and inhibitory <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> (low-reward/low-inhibition) evidenced more reward sensitive behavior, compared to the group high in anticipatory and average inhibitory <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> (high-reward/medium-inhibition). The identification of three separable subgroups supports the theory of multiple pathways leading to attention problems and stresses the need to address neurobiological heterogeneity in attention problems in order to identify more homogenous subgroups...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Changes in <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> as a {{function}} of continuous multiparametric word recognition have not been studied before by using functional MR imaging (fMRI), to our knowledge. Our aim was to identify linear changes in <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> and, what is more interesting, nonlinear changes in <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> as {{a function}} of extended word repetition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen healthy young right-handed individuals participated in this study. An event-related extended continuous word-recognition task with 30 target words was used to study the parametric effect of word recognition on <b>brain</b> <b>activation.</b> Word-recognition–related <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> was studied {{as a function}} of 9 word repetitions. fMRI data were analyzed with a general linear model with regressors for linearly changing signal intensity and nonlinearly changing signal intensity, accord-ing to group average reaction time (RT) and individual RTs.

Still limited by the low-resolution visual percepts provided by visual cortical prostheses, implant wearers can currently only "see" pixelized images, and how to obtain the specific brain responses to different pixelized images in the primary visual cortex (the implant area) is still unknown. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment on normal human participants to investigate the <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> patterns in response to 18 different pixelized images. There were 100 voxels in the <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> pattern that were selected from the primary visual cortex, and voxel size was 4 mm × 4 mm × 4 mm. Multi-voxel pattern analysis was used to test if these 18 different <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> patterns were specific. We chose a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) as the classifier in this study. The results showed that the classification accuracies of different <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> patterns were significantly above chance level, which suggests that the classifier can successfully distinguish the <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> patterns.

This aberrant <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> in migraine can be noninvasively detected with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the differences in motor cortical activation between attacks (ictal) and pain free intervals (interictal) in children and adolescents with migraine using both low- and high-frequency neuromagnetic signals. Thirty subjects with an acute migraine and 30 subjects with a history of migraine, while pain free, were compared to age- and gender-matched controls using MEG. Motor cortical activation was elicited by a standardized, validated finger-tapping task. Low-frequency <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> (1 ~ 50 Hz) was analyzed with waveform measurements and high-frequency oscillations (65 - 150 Hz) were analyzed with wavelet-based beamforming. MEG waveforms showed that the ictal latency of low-frequency <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> was significantly delayed as compared with controls, while the interictal latency of <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> was similar to that of controls. The ictal amplitude of low-frequency <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> was significantly increased as compared with controls, while the interictal amplitude of <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> was similar to that of controls. The ictal source power of high-frequency oscillations was significantly stronger than that of the controls, while the interictal source power of high-frequency oscillations was significantly weaker than that of controls. The results suggest that aberrant low-frequency <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> in migraine during a headache attack returned to normal interictally. However, high-frequency oscillations changed from ictal hyper-activation to interictal hypo-activation.

40|$|Background Although {{auditory}} verbal hallucinations (AVH) or 'voices' {{present a}} debilitating symptom of schizophrenia, {{they can also}} be observed in healthy individuals in the general population. As the origin of AVH remains largely unknown, the aim of the present thesis was to shed more light on the neurobiological basis of this symptom. With this aim, the studies presented in this thesis investigated <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> in relation to AVH. The first part of this thesis consists of state studies which investigated <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> during the experience of AVH. The second part describes trait studies which focussed at comparing <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> between individuals with and without AVH. These trait studies may reveal specific mechanisms predisposing a person to experience AVH. Methods To identify <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> related to the state of AVH, participants were instructed to indicate the presence of AVH while functional MRI scans were acquired continuously. Using this set-up, the first study investigated <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> during AVH and compared the resulting pattern of <b>activation</b> to <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> during inner speech, in a group of psychotic patients. Subsequently, the second study investigated <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> preceding AVH and the third study focussed on calculating the reliability of AVH-related <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> in psychotic patients. In the fourth state study, <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> during AVH was compared between psychotic patients and a group of healthy control subjects. In addition to these state studies, two trait studies were conducted in which language lateralization and resting state connectivity were compared between individuals who presented with AVH and a group of healthy control subjects. Results These studies showed that the state of AVH is related to activation in language regions. However, in contrast to normal inner speech, AVH primarily involved activation of right hemisphere instead of left hemisphere language regions. In addition, it was shown that shortly before patients experienced AVH, changes in <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> could be observed in the left parahippocampal gyrus which fulfils an important role in memory retrieval. Moreover, it was found that <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> during AVH could be considered reliable. Furthermore, the last state study showed that pyschotic patients and healthy individuals showed similar activation during the experience of AVH. The first trait study revealed that although psychotic patients display decreased language lateralization, this could not be observed in healthy individuals with AVH. Finally, the second trait study showed that healthy individuals with AVH display dysfunctional resting state connectivity within the language network and between language and memory regions. Conclusion From these studies it can be concluded that AVH may be initiated by spontaneous memory retrieval. This may lead to activation of language areas, as observed during the experience of AVH, which is likely {{to be related to the}} re-experience of the retrieved memory. The observation of dysfunctional connectivity of language and memory regions during resting state provides further support for the hypothesis that dysfunction of these regions underlies AVH. In addition, the finding of common areas of activation in psychotic patients and healthy individuals suggest that AVH represent a similar phenomenon in both groups...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{patients}} with schizophrenia, altered <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> and motor activity levels are central features, reflecting cognitive impairments and negative symptoms, respectively. Newer studies using nonlinear methods {{have addressed the}} severe disturbances in neurocognitive functioning that is {{regarded as one of}} the core features of schizophrenia. Our aim was to compare <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> and motor activity in a patient during pharmacological treatment that was switched from a first- to a second-generation antipsychotic drug. We hypothesised that this change of medication would increase level of responding in both measures. Case presentation: We present the case of a 53 -year-old male with onset of severe mental illness in adolescence, ICD- 10 diagnosed as schizophrenia of paranoid type, chronic form. We compared <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> and motor activity in this patient during pharmacological treatment with a first-generation (perphenazin), and later switched to a second-generation (risperidone) antipsychotic drug. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> and wrist worn actigraphy to measure motor activity. Conclusion: Our study showed that <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> decreased in areas critical for cognitive functioning in this patient, when changing from a first to a second generation antipsychotic drug. However the mean motor activity level was unchanged, although risperidone reduced variability, particularly short-term variability from minute to minute.

In functional neuroimaging studies, this dysfunction has been linked to signal changes in prefrontal and medial temporal areas. Therefore, it is of interest whether genes associated with the disorder, such as NRG 1, modulate episodic memory performance and its neural correlates. Ninety-four healthy individuals performed an episodic memory encoding and a retrieval task while <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> was measured with functional MRI. All subjects were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs 35753505 in the NRG 1 gene. The effect of genotype on <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> was assessed with fMRI during the two tasks. While there were no differences in performance, <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> in the cingulate gyrus (BA 24), the left middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), the bilateral fusiform gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus (BA 19) was positively correlated with the number of risk alleles in NRG 1 during encoding.

Finally, we tested if the classifier's predictions (predictive probabilities) for emotional and neutral face classification were different for healthy controls and depressed patients. Results: Predictive probabilities to patterns of <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> to neutral faces in both groups of patients were significantly lower {{in comparison to the}} healthy controls. This difference was specific to neutral faces. There {{were no significant differences in}} predictive probabilities to patterns of <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> to sad faces (sample 1) and happy faces (samples 2) between depressed patients and healthy controls. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the pattern of <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> to neutral faces in depressed patients is not consistent with the pattern observed in healthy controls subject to the same stimuli. This difference in <b>brain</b> <b>activation</b> might underlie the behavioural misinterpretation of the neutral faces content by the depressed patients. © 2013 Oliveira et al...|$|R
