5|$|The central {{character}} in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his <b>aunt,</b> <b>uncle,</b> and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, {{at the age of}} eleven, that he is a wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.|$|E

2500|$|Pronouns (ສັບພະນາມ, sap pha nam [...] ) {{are often}} dropped in {{informal}} contexts {{and replaced with}} nicknames or kinship terms, depending on {{the relation of the}} speaker spoken to (sometimes even spoken about).

Younger children's names are often prefixed with ບັກ (bak [...] ) and ອີ (i [...] ), respectively.
