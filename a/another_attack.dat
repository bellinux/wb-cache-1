5|$|On May 22, villagers {{returned}} to Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, {{which had been}} largely destroyed. Expecting <b>another</b> <b>attack,</b> reinforcements from the Carmeli Brigade took up positions in the two villages. Many of the participants of the battles were sent to Tiberias to rest and recuperate, and the units that lost soldiers were reorganized.|$|E
5|$|When the British paratroopers had withdrawn, two of {{the guns}} were put back into action by the Germans. <b>Another</b> <b>attack</b> the next day by British Commandos failed to {{recapture}} the battery, which remained under German control until 17August, when the German Army started {{to withdraw from the}} area.|$|E

5|$|After {{securing}} {{the area around}} Arleux {{at the end of}} April, the British determined to launch <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> east from Monchy to try to break through the Boiry Riegel and reach the Wotanstellung, a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle was a failure, the British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>attack</b> {{was made}} in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, because in Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common readings of the Vulgate. He informed Erasmus that in the Vatican Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include Comma).|$|E
5|$|As a result, Maslama {{launched}} <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> {{aimed at}} Tyana, with his nephew al-Abbas ibn al-Walid as co-commander. The chronology {{of the expedition}} is again unclear: the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor puts it in A.M. 6201 (708/709 AD, and possibly even 709/710), but Arab sources date it to A.H. 88 and 89 (706/707 AD and 707/708 AD respectively). As a result, the siege has been variously dated to 707–708 AD and 708–709 AD.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{winter and}} summer {{appear to have}} passed in comparative quiet the garrison being sufficiently occupied in repairing {{the damage caused by}} the enemy's artillery and in the accumulation of provisions against the arrival of <b>another</b> <b>attacking</b> party.|$|R
5000|$|A {{portion of}} the main force is left in contact {{position}} {{while the rest of}} the unit maneuvers to <b>another</b> <b>attacking</b> position. [...] "Detachment left in contact" [...] maintains the appearance of a full unit in contact until ordered otherwise.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>attacking</b> ploy is {{to pitch}} a ball very short, making it bounce up around head height {{as it passes}} the batsman. Such a bouncer {{requires}} the batsman to avoid being hit, and may intimidate him into uncertainty about the next few balls.|$|R
5|$|At {{first light}} on 13 September, Cactus Air Force {{aircraft}} and Marine artillery fired {{into the area}} {{just south of the}} ridge, forcing any Japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle. The Japanese suffered several casualties, including two officers from Watanabe's battalion. At 05:50, Kawaguchi decided to regroup his forces for <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> that night.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{the fresh}} troops, the Spartans and their Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench. The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the futility of persevering with the siege {{and he decided to}} lift it and withdraw.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, C Company {{moved to}} capture Hill 543 {{near the village}} of Chipo-ri. The hill was {{protected}} by heavily entrenched Chinese infantry as well as mortars {{at the top of the}} hill. During their first attempt to advance up the hill, the company took heavy casualties, and the 3rd Platoon leader was mortally wounded. Charlton took command of the platoon and reorganized it for <b>another</b> <b>attack.</b> Heavy fire eventually forced the company back down the hill.|$|E
50|$|On 20 January 2017 {{he signed}} a loan {{until the end of}} the season with Accrington Stanley. Accrington Manager John Coleman was happy to add <b>another</b> <b>attacking</b> option to the squad. His first {{appearance}} for Accrington was part of a 1-1 draw against Carlisle United.|$|R

5|$|One B-26, {{after being}} seriously damaged by {{anti-aircraft}} fire, made a suicide run on Akagi. Making {{no attempt to}} pull out of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.|$|E
5|$|Philip then ordered <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> on Athens; {{his army}} {{failed to take}} either Athens or Eleusis, but {{subjected}} Attica to the worst ravaging the Atticans had seen since the Persian Wars. In response, the Romans declared war on Philip and invaded his territories in Illyria. Philip was forced to abandon his Rhodian and Pergamese campaign {{in order to deal}} with the Romans and the situation in Greece. Thus began the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|Salah {{planned to}} attempt <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> against Budapest on October 8, and al-Mezahi, whose {{battalion}} would {{carry out the}} second attempt, took the necessary preparations. The attack was canceled however, due to heavy Israeli aerial attacks against Port Said throughout the night of October 7/8. The Sa'iqa company continued to hold its positions east of Budapest for four days, until Salah decided to withdraw it due to the casualties it had sustained.|$|E

50|$|On 3 February 2017, amidst {{clashes between}} the KDP-S-affiliated Peshmerga {{group and the}} Sinjar Resistance Units in Sinjar, a KNC office was burned in Qamishli and <b>another</b> <b>attacked</b> in Dirbêsiyê. The KNC accused the pro-PYD youth group the Ciwanen Soresger of perpetrating the attacks. However, the {{perpetrators}} were reportedly arrested by the Asayish.|$|R
5|$|The second Egyptian {{attempt was}} the last; the Port Said Sector did not launch <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> {{to capture the}} fort. Thus Budapest {{remained}} the only Israeli fortification of the Bar Lev Line to remain under Israeli control. Four months after the Yom Kippur War, Captain Motti Ashkenazi, the commander of Fort Budapest, led the protests against the Israeli government's handling of the war.|$|E
5|$|Van Avermaet and Thomas {{were caught}} {{soon after the}} summit of the Poggio, with one reduced group coming into the finish. Thomas {{continued}} {{at the front of the}} group, bringing back <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> from Van Avermaet and attempting to lead out Ben Swift, but he was exhausted from his earlier efforts in several breakaways.|$|E
5|$|We {{took off}} from the {{concrete}} runway in Leck, Kirchner (Fhj.Fw Günther Kirchner) stayed 30 metres behind me on my right side as usual;... We climbed up to about 200 metres, when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. I was very lucky that the Thunderbolts did not press on with <b>another</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Cheyenne, anticipating pursuit, {{prepared}} {{an ambush}} at Turkey Springs. While one band prepared rifle pits at the springs, other bands fanned {{out over the}} country looking for supplies. In one case, attacking and killing two cowboys, they obtained two mules, in <b>another,</b> <b>attacking</b> some cowboys during breakfast, obtained both breakfast and a Sharps carbine.|$|R
50|$|On Sunday, October 5, 2014, at 12:55PM, in Black River Wildlife Management Area in Chester Township, NJ, {{a hunter}} was {{bitten by a}} rabid coyote. The hunter killed the animal before police and Fish and Wildlife {{officers}} could arrive. The coyote tested positive for rabies. Two days before the attack, a cyclist had been bitten and <b>another</b> <b>attacked.</b>|$|R
5|$|Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who {{had succeeded}} Admirals von Ingenohl and Hugo von Pohl as the fleet commander, {{immediately}} planned <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> on the British coast. However, {{the damage to}} Seydlitz and condenser trouble on several of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts delayed the plan {{until the end of}} May 1916. The German battlefleet departed the Jade at 03:30 on 31 May. Westfalen was assigned to the II Division of the I Battle Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral W. Engelhardt. Westfalen was the last ship in the division, astern of her three sisters. The II Division was the last unit of dreadnoughts in the fleet; they were followed by only the elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of 1449, Branković imprisoned Hungarian regent John Hunyadi in the dungeons of the fortress until he was ransomed by his countrymen. In 1453, Sultan Mehmed II and Isak-bey Arbanazović led <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> on Smederevo {{as part of a}} devastating raid on Serbia. The Turks took 50,000 men, women and children during that raid, but Smederevo was well-led by Thomas Kantakouzenos. Despite having only 6,000 men, compared to the Ottomans' 20,000, the city withstood. Mehmed the Conqueror besieged Smederevo for the second time and the fortress was besieged by the Ottomans {{for the third time in}} 1456, being defended by Serbian forces. In 1459, Smederevo was captured by the Ottomans, leading to the end of the medieval Serbian state.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns still on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for <b>another</b> <b>attack</b> on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 Kaga recovered three of her CAP.|$|E
40|$|Bark beetles {{belong to}} a group of small, but {{destructive}} in-sects that kill or damage trees by tunneling under the bark to reproduce. Much of the damage is caused by the developing offspring. Trees stressed by unfavorable environmental condi-tions, disease, defoliation, age, or poor tree care are most sus-ceptible. Bark beetles commonly attack conifers, however some prefer hardwoods, e. g., oak, elm or Prunus species. Most are fairly specific as to their preferred host tree(s), and each species favors a particular part of the tree. For instance, it is not unusual to find one species of beetle attacking the top and large branches, (Tree Note # 8) <b>another</b> <b>attacking</b> the main trunk, (Tree Note # 13), and yet <b>another</b> <b>attacking</b> the tree base (Tree Note # 9). Natural resistance to bark beetle attack in pines and other co-nifers involves sustained pitch flow from their entry wounds...|$|R
