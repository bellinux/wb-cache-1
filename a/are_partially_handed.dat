One of the reasons was a gradual and lasting extension of infrastructure which began in the 1970s.

Then it underwent several conquests first by France, then Prussia, then France again, whose ruler Napoléon Bonaparte allowed his brother Jérôme Bonaparte to annex it for his Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807.|$|R

50|$|To {{back its}} {{image as a}} {{technically}} advanced car for the 1980s, the Mark VII was equipped with {{a long list of}} standard equipment. A fully digital dashboard featured an onboard trip computer and message center; automatic climate control was also standard. Other standard features included four-wheel air suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, power seats, an AM/FM stereo, and power windows, locks, and mirrors. All Mark VIIs featured a power deck-lid release (through an interior mounted button) and electric pull-down, in which the trunk lid <b>was</b> <b>partially</b> lowered by <b>hand,</b> and then automatically pulled down about an inch by a motor mounted inside the trunk latch. All models were now installed with Ford's Keyless Entry System, and an automatic dimming high-beam module. This worked via a sensor located adjacent to the rear-view mirror, and sensitivity could be adjusted by a dial located on the dashboard.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a method for}} automatically labelling edges of word co-occurrence graphs with semantic relations. Therefore we only make use of training data already contained within the graph. Starting point of this work is a graph based on word co-occurrence of the German language, which is created by applying iterated co-occurrence analysis. The edges of the graph have <b>been</b> <b>partially</b> annotated by <b>hand</b> with semantic relationships. In our approach we {{make use of the}} commonly appearing network motif of three words forming a triangular pattern. We assume that the fully annotated occurrences of these structures contain information useful for our purpose. Based on these patterns rules for reasoning are learned. The obtained rules are then combined using Dempster-Shafer theory to infer new semantic relations between words. Iteration of the annotation process is possible {{to increase the number of}} obtained relations. By applying the described process the graph can be enriched with semantic information at a high precision. 1...|$|R

40|$|A magnetostratigraphy for ∼ 60 m of Koobi Fora Formation {{sediment}} in Area 104 {{was derived}} from 46 oriented samples that produced well-resolved characteristic magnetizations from progressive thermal demagnetization. Approximately 59 m below the Morte Tuff, previously dated to ∼ 1. 51 Ma (millions of years ago), the Olduvai-Matuyama boundary (∼ 1. 78 Ma) {{was found to be}} at the level of marker bed A 2 —inconsistent with the Area 102 type section and thus contrary to fossil dating schemes that utilize temporal equivalence between A 2 [104] and A 2 [102]. The magnetostratigraphic data, coupled with the Morte Tuff, provide a means to interpolate new ages for marker beds A 2 [104] and the White Tuff, as well as multiple Area 104 hominin fossils. Noteworthy is the new date of ∼ 1. 63 Ma for KNM-ER 3733, which now implicates KNM-ER 2598 as the sole early African Homo erectus fossil demonstrably older than Dmanisi and Java Homo specimens. Re-dating KNM-ER 3733 creates a ∼ 300 -kyr gap at 1. 9 to 1. 6 Ma in the African fossil record of H. erectus, which might <b>be</b> <b>partially</b> spanned by <b>hand</b> axes recently dated at ∼ 1. 76 Ma, if the Acheulian is indeed proprietary to this species...|$|R

40|$|Summary To {{test whether}} trees with {{different}} leaf life spans respond differently to defoliation, {{eastern white pine}} (Pinus strobus L.) and European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) trees (9 years old in 1991) <b>were</b> <b>partially</b> defoliated by <b>hand</b> between July 1 and 10 in 1989, 1990 and 1991. At the end of 1991, trees of both species had received either 0, 1, 2 or 3 years of defolia-tion. Trees that received only 1 year of defoliation were defoli-ated in 1989. Variables measured included photosynthesis, twig water potential, leaf mass per area and leaf nitrogen con-centration. There were few significant responses to defoliation {{in any of the}} three years of treatment in either species, and only the current-year defoliation treatments caused significant re-sponses. Both species had reduced photosynthetic rates and less negative twig water potentials in response to defoliation in 1989. In 1990 and 1991, the defoliation treatments had no sig-nificant effect on any of the parameters measured in European larch. In 1990, there was a significant reduction in foliar nitro-gen concentration in eastern white pine in response to defolia-tion in 1990. In 1991, eastern white pine had significantly less negative twig water potentials in response to defoliation in 1991. Leaf mass per area was not affected by defoliation in ei-ther species. We conclude that, for European larch and eastern white pine, differences in leaf life span have no effect on leaf-and twig-level responses to defoliation...|$|R
