40|$|Among {{many types}} of fertilizers, most widely used ones are {{chemical}} and organic fertilizers. Chemical fertilizers are specialized fertilizers that their nutrient level {{is controlled by the}} production process. On the other hand, nutrient levels (nitrogen-potassium-phosphorus) of organic fertilizers are determined by their type such as vermicompost, poultry manure, farmyard manure, bat guano, and compost. These types differ from one another by nutrient levels. Although nutrient levels of those have literature values and researches about it, there is no data about application of organic fertilizers on <b>a</b> <b>specified</b> <b>plant.</b> The objective of this investigation is to find out how much a plant, in this case Zea mays (corn plant), can transfer the nutrients into its system via roots with respect to the fertilizer type. 5 types of organic fertilizers are used to grow Zea mays and NPK calculations are made by using different measurements, resulting in finding out the percentages of nutrients {{in the body of the}} plants. 	It was revealed that poultry manure had the largest impact on plant growth, resulting in having a greater dry and fresh weight, higher potassium and phosphorus percentage. Vermicompost was the least effective among the organic fertilizers, at the same time, other fertilizers were moderately effective such as farmyard manure, compost, and bat guano. On the whole, the hypothesis is proved to be wrong, as vermicompost did not match the expectations of being the most effective. The reasoning can be made from the point that the nutrient release effect is slower as a result of worm activity, while other type of organic fertilizers have more nutrients available for the plant in the same time period...|$|R

The need of interpreting primary measured plant variables within the framework of different system representations organized into an abstraction hierarchy is identified from an analysis of the problem of diagnosing complex systems.

40|$|Optimal minimax rate {{feedback}} controller design problems was proposed and partially solved by R. S. Bucy et al in 1990. The {{application of the}} prob-lem have found in the oscillation suppressor de-sign of large space structure with multiple oscilla-tory/resonance modes. By employing Gröbner basis technique, the complete symbolic solution for the case when the cardinality of the plant oscillatory mode is three or fewer was later found by N. K. Bose and the author. In this paper, the case when the cardinality is four is considered based {{on the use of}} Gröbner bases. In general, the higher order (four or more) problem is analytically intractable and suboptimal solutions based on numerical techniques are then the only re-course. In addition, it is also shown that, for <b>a</b> <b>specified</b> generic <b>plant,</b> by incorporating in rate feedback con-troller the additional parameter available in the ba-sic design procedure, significant improvement in feed-back system performance over what was believed to be possible can be realized.

40|$|Coherent {{feedback}} control of quantum systems has demonstrable advantages over measurement-based control, {{but so far}} {{there has been little}} work done on coherent estimators and more specifically coherent observers. Coherent observers are input the coherent output of <b>a</b> <b>specified</b> quantum <b>plant,</b> and are designed such that some subset of the observer and plant's expectation values converge in the asymptotic limit. We previously developed a class of mean tracking (MT) observers for open harmonic oscillators that only converged in mean position and momentum; Here we develop a class of covariance matrix tracking (CMT) coherent observers that track both the mean and covariance matrix of a quantum plant. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a CMT observer, and find there are more restrictions on a CMT observer than there are on a MT observer. We give examples where we demonstrate how to design a CMT observer and show {{it can be used to}} track properties like the entanglement of a plant. As the CMT observer provides more quantum information than a MT observer, we expect it will have greater application in future coherent feedback schemes mediated by coherent observers. Investigation of coherent quantum estimators and observers is important in the ongoing discussion of quantum measurement; As they provide estimation of a system's quantum state without explicit use of the measurement postulate in their derivation.

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} a robust control system for <b>a</b> <b>specified</b> second order <b>plant</b> is {{considered}} using three different approaches. Initially, a control system evolved by a genetic programming algorithm is reproduced and analysed {{in order to identify}} its advantages and drawbacks. The automatic design technique is compared to a traditional one through the analysis of the constraints and performance indices obtained by simulation. A set of unspecified control constraints explored by the GP search process is found to be the cause of a better performance. Hence, giving a better constraints specification, a genetic algorithm is used to evolve an alternative controller. A PID structure is used by the GA to produce and tune the controller. Simulations show a significant gain in performance thanks to a more aggressive and complete exploration of the search space within the constraints. The effectiveness of the two methods compared to the traditional approach is discussed with regard to performance, complexity of design and computational viability. ...|$|R

The seed is dried after <b>a</b> <b>specified</b> time and <b>planted</b> with conventional equipment. Seed priming generally accelerates germination, particularly during adverse temperature or moisture conditions. The treatment has also increased the vigor and uniformity of numerous crops in the field. Inoculating seed with bacteria during solid matrix seed priming has increased the efficacy of the bacteria. Solid matrix priming techniques were developed for field and sweet corn seed (Zea mays L.) which were compatible with bacterial growth during seed priming and were practical for large scale application. ^ Germination characteristics of solid matrix primed field and sweet corn were tested under a range of temperatures in the laboratory. Solid matrix priming expanded the temperature range over which germination was allowed to proceed. At 5. 6 ∘C on plates, 93...|$|R
