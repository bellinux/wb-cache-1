30|$|In {{the last}} section two {{scenarios}} (low and high consumption) illustrate the possible development of the German gas supply until 2030, given an overall share of 8 – 12  % of bio methane. Considering the dynamic emission factors calculated in the former sections, the overall gas emissions and <b>average</b> <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> of German gas supply can be given. The current emissions of 215.4 million t CO 2 -eq. are reduced by 25  % in the low-consumption scenario (162 million t CO 2 -eq.), where consumption is reduced by 17  %. Assuming a consumption which is increased by 17  % in 2030, emissions are around 7  % higher (230.9 million t CO 2 -eq.) than today.|$|E
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} future carbon dioxide {{emissions}} in the global material flow of primary aluminium. The model of the global aluminium industry (GlobAl model) is used for scenario calculations. It simulates a market economy and allows an integrated analysis of the material flow and the corresponding {{carbon dioxide emissions}}. 1995 is the base year and the future horizon of the scenario calculations is 2010. The critical parameter 'global demand for primary aluminium' is varied. According to the scenario calculations, the absolute carbon dioxide emissions in the global material flow of primary energy will not increase until {{the growth rate of}} demand reaches 2 % per year. World <b>average</b> <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> will decrease remarkably, especially due to the reduced energy-related emissions for smelting. There are three reasons for this. In the first place, the lower CO 2 -emission factor of electricity generated from fossil fuels leads to reduced emissions. Secondly, modem point-feeder pre-baked plants need less electricity than the Soderberg plants they replace. And, thirdly, the production of primary aluminium is being shifted to regions in which the production of electricity is mainly based on hydropower. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impacts of a {{targeted}} policy designed to influence car purchasing trends towards lower CO 2 emitting vehicles. Vehicle registration tax and annual motor tax rates in Ireland changed in July 2008 from being based on engine size to emissions performance of cars. This paper provides a one year ex-post analysis {{of the first year}} of the tax change, tracking the change in purchasing trends arising from the measure related to specific CO 2 emissions, engine size and fuel, and the implications for car prices, CO 2 emissions abatement, and revenue gathered. While engine efficiency improvements had been offset by purchasing trends towards larger and generally less efficient cars in the past, with the average MJ/km remaining constant from 2000 to 2007, this analysis shows that in {{the first year of the}} new taxation system the <b>average</b> <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> of new cars fell by 13 % to 145 Â g/km. This was brought about, not by a reduction in engine size, but rather through a significant shift to diesel cars. Despite an unexpected reduction in car sales due to a recession in 2008, the policy measure has had a larger than anticipated impact on CO 2 emissions, calculated to be 5. 9 Â ktCO 2 in the first year of the measure. The strong price signal did however result in a 33 % reduction in tax revenue from VRT, in financial terms amounting to a drop of [euro] 166 million compared to a baseline situation.

This thesis is therefore aimed on measuring of ammonia, microclimate and ammonia emissions of cattle excluding market cattle sucklers while both pasture and winter stabling. As a suitable place for measuring, a farm of Radomir Sedlacek was chosen. To verify proposed method in practice, measuring took place also in other pasturing areas. Total average of ammonia concentration in pasture measuring was 0, 5123 mg. m- 3. Total <b>average</b> of <b>specific</b> producing <b>emissions</b> from the pasture was 25, 45825, 458 kg. ks- 1. rok- 1.

40|$|Biogenic {{emission}} algorithms {{predict that}} oak forests account for ~ 70 % {{of the total}} European isoprene budget. Yet the isoprene emission potentials that underpin these model estimates are calculated from a very limited number of leaf-level observations and hence are highly uncertain. Increasingly, micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance are used to measure whole-canopy fluxes directly, from which isoprene emission potentials can be calculated. Here, we review five observational datasets of isoprene fluxes {{from a range of}} oak forests in the UK, Italy and France. We outline procedures to correct the measured net fluxes for losses from deposition and chemical flux divergence, which were found to be on the order of 5 – 8 % and 4 – 5 %, respectively. The corrected observational data were used to derive isoprene emission potentials at each site in a two-step process. Firstly, six commonly used emission algorithms were inverted to back out time series of isoprene emission potential, and then an average isoprene emission potential was calculated for each site with an associated uncertainty. We used these data to assess how the derived emission potentials change depending upon the <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> algorithm used and importantly, on the particular approach adopted to derive an <b>average</b> site <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> potential. Our results show that isoprene emission potentials can vary by up to a factor of four depending on the specific algorithm used and {{whether or not it is}} used in a big-leaf or canopy environment model format. When using the same algorithm, the calculated average isoprene emission potential was found to vary by as much as 34 % depending on how the average was derived. In order to best replicate the observed fluxes we propose a new weighted average method whereby the isoprene emission potential is calculated as the average of all flux observations divided by the average activity factor (γ) of the emission algorithm. This approach ensures that modelled fluxes always have the same average as the measurements. Using this new approach, with version 2. 1 of the Model for Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN), we derive new ecosystem-scale isoprene emission potentials for the five measurement sites, Alice Holt, UK (10 500 ± 2500 µg m− 2 h− 1), Bosco Fontana, Italy (1610 ± 420 µg m− 2 h− 1), Castelporziano, Italy (43 ± 10 µg m− 2 h− 1), Ispra, Italy (7590 ± 1070 µg m− 2 h− 1) and the Observatoire de Haute Provence, France (7990 ± 1010 µg m− 2 h− 1). Ecosystem-scale isoprene emission potentials were then extrapolated to the leaf-level and compared to previous leaf-level measurements for Quercus robur and Quercus pubescens, two species thought to account for 50 % of the total European isoprene budget. The literature values agreed closely with emission potentials calculated using the G 93 algorithm, which were 85 ± 75 µg g− 1 h− 1 and 78 ± 25 µg g− 1 h− 1 for Q. robur and Q. pubescens respectively. By contrast, emission potentials calculated using the G 06 algorithm, the same algorithm used in a previous study to derive the European budget, were significantly lower, which we attribute to the influence of past light and temperature conditions. Adopting these new G 06 <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> potentials for Q. robur (55 ± 24 µg g− 1 h− 1) and Q. pubescens (47 ± 16 µg g− 1 h− 1) reduced the projected European budget by ~ 17 %. Our findings demonstrate that calculated isoprene emission potentials vary considerably depending upon the specific approach used in their calculation. Therefore, it is our recommendation that the community now adopt a standardised approach to the way in which micrometeorological flux measurements are corrected and used to derive isoprene, and other biogenic VOC, emission potentials. Modellers who use derived emission potentials should pay particular attention to the way in which an emission potential was derived and ensure that the algorithm they are using, and the implementation thereof, is consistent with that used to derive the emission potential. Our results show that, in the worst cases, failure to account for this may result in modelled fluxes that differ from observations by up to a factor of four...|$|R
