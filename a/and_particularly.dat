5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} Carboniferous period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area <b>and,</b> <b>particularly</b> in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes.

5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade.
