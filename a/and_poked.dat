5|$|Less than 30seconds {{after the}} {{subsequent}} kick-off, United forced another corner, but Schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time under instruction from Ferguson. Beckham again swung the corner in, finding {{the head of}} Sheringham, who nodded the ball down {{across the face of}} goal. Solskjær reacted fastest, shot out a foot <b>and</b> <b>poked</b> the ball into the roof of the Bayern goal for United to take the lead. The goal was timed at 90+2:17'. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.|$|E

The film had a limited release, and was critically and commercially unsuccessful. She then starred in the comedy film So Undercover, appearing as an FBI agent who is required to go undercover at a college sorority.

Another SNL parody of The Real World came in a 1996 episode hosted by John Goodman in which Bob Dole (Norm Macdonald) is thrown out of the house.|$|E
25|$|After {{a failed}} event in February 1901, the society became barely active and a {{liquidation}} meeting {{was called for}} December 1903. However, the meeting instead elected new chairman Jonas Vanagaitis who revived the organization. However, until 1908 the society was not very active as Vanagaitis and other members were more involved and focused on activities of the Lithuanian Union in Prussia (Lietuvininkų susivienijimas Prūsuose). In 1905, Birutė assisted the Lithuanian Literary Society with building the Lithuanian House in the Jakobsruh Park in Tilsit. In 1905, the society celebrated its 20th anniversary. The celebration included two plays written and staged by Vydūnas and his Lithuanian Choir. The plays were specifically written for the occasion <b>and</b> <b>poked</b> fun at Birutė's weaknesses and strengths.|$|E
25|$|Dallas scored {{first on}} a 14-play, 88-yard drive in which Troy Aikman {{completed}} four passes to Michael Irvin for 65 yards {{and finished the}} drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Perhaps the key point of the game occurred on the next series when Minnesota running back Amp Lee caught a short pass from quarterback Brad Johnson {{and appeared to be}} on his way for a 43-yard touchdown. But Cowboys safety George Teague caught up with Lee at the 1-yard line <b>and</b> <b>poked</b> the ball out of his hands, knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. Dallas then drove 70 yards, including a 22-yard carry by Herschel Walker, to go up 10-0 on Chris Boniol's 28-yard field goal. Five plays after the ensuing kickoff, Teague stripped the ball from Vikings running back Leroy Hoard. Defensive back Deion Sanders recovered the fumble and lateraled it to Shante Carver, who was tackled on the Minnesota 37, and Emmitt Smith took off for a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then during Minnesota's next possession, Teague intercepted a pass from Johnson and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 24-0 lead with 8:36 left in the second quarter.|$|E

500|$|The {{influential}} distortion {{sound of}} the guitar track was created after guitarist Dave Davies sliced the speaker cone of his guitar amplifier with a razor blade <b>and</b> <b>poked</b> it with a pin. The amplifier was affectionately called [...] "little green", after {{the name of the}} amplifier made by the Elpico company, and purchased in Davies' neighbourhood music shop, linked to a Vox AC-30. In 2014, Dave Davies accused brother Ray of lying about participating in Dave's guitar distortion sound. Dave wrote on his Facebook page, [...] "My brother is lying. I don't know why he [...] does this but it was my Elpico amp that I bought and out of frustration I cut the speaker cone up with a razor blade and I was so shocked and [...] surprised and excited that it worked that I demonstrated the sound to Ray and [...] Pete [...] … Ray liked the sound and he had written a riff on the piano which formed the basis of the song 'You Really Got Me' and I played the riff on my guitar with my new sound. I alone created this sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Bailey, in {{his study}} [...] "White Collars, Gray Lives" [...] (1999), traces the {{beginnings}} of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the [...] "disquieting irruption of {{a new breed of}} petty bourgeois shop and office workers" [...] that faced Victorian writers {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century. The Grossmiths' Diary was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters <b>and</b> <b>poked</b> fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the Diary [...] "a sharp analysis of social insecurity". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: [...] "putting the boot in on the lower middle classes", says Bailey, [...] "has long been the intellectual's blood sport". However, the quarter-century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. [...] Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as [...] "Denry Machin", [...] "Mr Polly" [...] or [...] "Mr Lewisham", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. [...] In cases such as these, writes Bailey, [...] "disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis." ...|$|E
500|$|American actress Ana Isabelle {{performed}} [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] live during Univision's V.E.S. Show in 2009. American entertainer Selena Gomez {{performed the}} song during a 2010 Reliant Stadium concert. Guerra called her performance [...] "spirited" [...] and she later recorded the song as {{a duet with}} Selena for the 2012 remix album Enamorada de Ti. The Belfast Telegraph wrote that Gomez had done an [...] "amazing job". At the Billboard Latin Music Awards in Miami, A.B. told E! that Gomez gave a [...] "fantastic vocal performance on the record". Guerra, however, wrote that the new version of [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] was: [...] "virtually the same arrangement as the original. It {{would have been more}} effective reshaped as a poppy club track." [...] He found Gomez' vocals [...] "curiously lackluster", as if she was [...] "scared of the song" [...] and [...] "intimidated by her idol". Lovelace commented that it was [...] "obvious that Spanish isn't Gomez' first language, and comes in a distant second", and that [...] "Gomez' odd voice" [...] came across as sometimes [...] "much higher and very squeaky when speaking Spanish", concluding that it: [...] "doesn’t match the rest of the song and momentarily brings everything to a halt". Gomez later released the track on her first greatest hits album For You (2014). American singer-songwriter Jay Brannan recorded his version of the track for his 2013 extended play Around the World in 80 Jays. On America's Got Talent, mariachi singer Alondra Santos performed [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] to rave reviews. Radio personality host, Howard Stern, who had mocked Selena's mourners <b>and</b> <b>poked</b> fun at the singer's death in April 1995, praised Santos' performance. On May 1, 2015, Jennifer Lopez performed [...] "A Selena Tribute" [...] which included [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom". Lopez' performance was praised by music critics who enjoyed the singer's Selena-esque costumes she wore onstage. Tattoo artist and reality television personality Kat Von D covered the song as a tribute to the singer in January 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Rajneesh is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} most controversial spiritual leaders to have emerged from India in the twentieth century. His message of sexual, emotional, spiritual, and institutional liberation, as well as the pleasure he took in causing offense, ensured that his life was surrounded by controversy. Rajneesh became known as the [...] "sex guru" [...] in India, and as the [...] "Rolls-Royce guru" [...] in the United States. He attacked traditional concepts of nationalism, openly expressed contempt for politicians, <b>and</b> <b>poked</b> fun at the leading figures of various religions, who in turn found his arrogance unbearable. His teachings on sex, marriage, family, and relationships contradicted traditional values and aroused a great deal of anger and opposition around the world. His movement was widely feared and loathed as a cult.

Finishing the Hat was published in October 2010.
