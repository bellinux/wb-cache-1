5|$|In Luigi's Mansion, {{the main}} story is played out over four stages, with players able to also access a {{training}} {{room and a}} gallery at the laboratory of Professor E. Gadd between stages. In each stage, players control Luigi as he explores the mansion's rooms and hunts down the ghosts that lay within them, acquiring keys to get through locked doors and eventually dealing with a boss ghost hidden {{at the end of}} the stage, with more rooms becoming accessible as each stage is completed. To assist him in his task, Luigi uses <b>a</b> <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> two inventions supplied by E. Gadd - the Poltergust 3000, a specially modified, high powered vacuum cleaner; and the Game Boy Horror, a parody of Nintendo's Game Boy Color.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both <b>a</b> <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed <b>a</b> <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether {{he had been to}} the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing. Cram stated these trenches were two feet (60cm) wide, six feet (200cm) long and two feet (60cm) deep—the size of graves.|$|E

Eben and Billy make it to the utilidor but are attacked by Arvin (Andrew Stehlin), who bites Billy; Billy knocks Arvin into the heavy-duty shredder, and in doing so, painfully grinds his own hand to a stump by accident, before being killed by Eben because he is starting to turn.|$|E

25|$|From its mistakes, and the Australians' discoveries, U.S. command {{realized}} that they needed {{a new way to}} approach the dilemma of the tunnels. A general order was issued by General Williamson, the Allied Forces Commander in South Vietnam, to all Allied forces that tunnels had to be properly searched whenever they were discovered. They began training an elite group of volunteers in the art of tunnel warfare, armed only with a gun, a knife, <b>a</b> <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> a piece of string. These specialists, commonly known as “tunnel rats”, would enter a tunnel by themselves and travel inch-by-inch cautiously looking ahead for booby traps or cornered PLAF. There was no real doctrine for this approach and despite some very hard work in some sectors of the Army and MACV (Military Assistance Command, Vietnam) to provide some sort of training and resources, this was primarily a new approach that the units trained, equipped and planned for themselves.|$|E

He soon gets out, but finds out that the apparition is watching him.

500|$|The {{objective}} of Silent Hill: Origins is to guide player character Travis Grady as he searches the monster-filled town of Silent Hill {{for information about}} a girl he rescues from a burning house. The game uses a third-person perspective which it alternates with fixed camera angles. Following the gameplay formula of previous Silent Hill games, Origins primarily revolves around combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Typical gameplay of Origins consists of alternating between reality and its darker and dilapidated counterpart, the [...] "Other World", to obtain keys and objects needed to solve a riddle. Travis carries <b>a</b> <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> indicates {{the direction of a}} nearby usable item, while his [...] portable radio alerts the player to the presence of nearby monsters by emitting static. Often, actions performed in one dimension will affect the other; for example, raising a prop on the stage in the theater results in a similar reaction in the Other World. Once solved, the riddle leads to an encounter with a boss, whose defeat unlocks a new area. Completion of the game results in unlocking special items or alternative outfits for Travis depending on various accomplishments.|$|E
