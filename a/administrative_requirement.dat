40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of whether or not reducing the costs of voting by conducting elections entirely through the mail rather than at the traditional polling place increases participation. Using election data from Oregon, we examine whether or not elections conducted through the mail increase turnout in both local and statewide elections. Using precinct-level data merged with census data we also examine how postal voting may alter the composition of the electorate. We find that, while all-mail elections tend to produce higher turnout, themost significant increases occur in low stimulus elections, such as local elections or primaries where turnout is usually low. The increase in turnout, however, is not uniform across demographic groups. Voting only by mail is likely to increase turnout among those who are already predisposed to vote, such as those with higher socioeconomic status. Like other administrative reforms designed to make voting easier, postal voting has the potential to increase turnout. However, the expanded pool of voters will be limited most likely to those already inclined to vote but find it inconvenient to go to the polling place. This conclusion is consistent with the growing body of research that suggests that relaxing <b>administrative</b> <b>requirement...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundEvaluation is a {{means for}} {{significant}} and rigorous improvement of the educational process. Therefore, competence evaluation should allow assessing the complex activity of medical care, as well as improving the training process. This {{is the case in}} the evaluation process of clinical–surgical competences. Materials and methodsA cross-sectional study was designed to measure knowledge about the evaluation of clinical–surgical competences for the General Surgery residency programme at the Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua (UACH). A 55 -item questionnaire divided into six sections was used (perception, planning, practice, function, instruments and strategies, and overall evaluation), with a six level Likert scale, performing a descriptive, correlation and comparative analysis, with a significance level of 0. 001. ResultsIn both groups perception of evaluation was considered as a further qualification. As regards tools, the best known was the written examination. As regards function, evaluation was considered as a further <b>administrative</b> <b>requirement.</b> In the correlation analysis, evaluation was perceived as qualification and was significantly associated with measurement, assessment and accreditation. In the comparative analysis between residents and staff surgeons, a significant difference was found as regards the perception of the evaluation as a measurement of knowledge (Student's t test: p= 0. 04). ConclusionThe results provide information about the concept we have about the evaluation of clinical–surgical competences, considering it as a measure of learning achievement for a socially required certification.

This study utilized a qualitative case study which was conducted in a senior high school in Aceh and involved one English teacher with {{more than ten years}} of teaching experience. The data required were obtained from document analysis in which five lesson plans were analyzed based on basic principles and its elements, four meetings of classroom observation, and semi-structured interview. There are three findings gained from this study. Firstly, the documentary data revealed that the teacher missed to fulfill some indicators of basic principles of lesson plan’s development such as he did not relate English subject with another subject and explain the function of ICT used in a particular activity. On the other hands, the teacher fulfilled all elements of the lesson plan as suggested by Regulation of Ministry of Education No. 65 / 2013. Secondly, observational data showed that even though the teacher did not use any lesson plan as the teaching guidance, he was successful enough in carrying out instructional activities by doing ‘mental-plan’. Furthermore, the teacher mentioned that he followed the textbook in teaching and revealed that the lesson plans were prepared for fulfilling <b>administrative</b> <b>requirement.</b> Lastly, interview data indicated that the teacher encountered problems in designing lesson plans including the difficulties to distinguish between learning indicators and learning objectives, to determine material and method, to construct main activity, and to provide assessment and evaluation.

40|$|The {{issue of}} fixed anchors in {{wilderness}} challenges modern {{interpretations of the}} Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act can be interpreted to allow or preclude the placement of fixed anchors in designated wilderness areas {{depending on whether the}} interpreter chooses a literal or general interpretation of the law's meaning. Place-based management options, supported by descriptive and evaluative study results, may be more closely aligned to Wilderness Act directives than nationwide, blanket policy. This research is focused on understanding the role of fixed anchors in designated wilderness in order to develop management options that protect wilderness values without hindering wilderness users. The unique nature of each wilderness area and climbing resource, in combination with distinct preferences and motivations of different climber populations, lends itself to managing fixed anchors through place-based policy that considers the landscape and the preferences of individual visitors. Joshua Tree National Park [JTNP] was chosen as the location for this case study because it has committed to establishing fixed anchor management that accommodates rock climbing and protects wilderness resources. JTNP has prohibited the placement of fixed anchors in wilderness since February 1993. By combining resource inventories, spatial modeling, and wilderness climber profiles, study results reveal that wilderness visitor destination choice is not dependent on the location of fixed anchors, but the quality, difficulty, and distance to destinations. These results can be used as the basis for a wilderness fixed anchor permit system and demonstrate that fixed anchors can fit {{within the confines of the}} Wilderness Act. Place-based management options, relative to national policies, can minimize administrative burdens and limit the geographic extent of unintended regulatory effects. The Wilderness Act's minimum <b>administrative</b> <b>requirement</b> mandate promotes this type of management style. This study of the benign fixed anchor at JTNP illustrates the power of the scientific method to neutralize wilderness recreation conflict and support streamlined wilderness management, while at the same time highlighting the shortcomings, and strengths, of the Wilderness Act as it is applied to a new era of wilderness recreation management...|$|E
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{low-level waste}} disposal {{operations at the}} Idaho Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Disposal Facility (ICDF) landfill {{from the start of}} operations in Fiscal Year 2003 through Fiscal Year 2008. The ICDF was authorized in the Operable Unit 3 - 13 Record of Decision for disposal of waste from the Idaho National Laboratory Site CERCLA environmental restoration activities. The ICDF has been operating since 2003 in compliance with the CERCLA requirements and the waste acceptance criteria developed in the CERCLA process. In developing the Operable Unit 3 - 13 Record of Decision, U. S. Department of Energy Order (DOE) 435. 1, 'Radioactive Waste Management', was identified as a 'to be considered' requirement for the ICDF. The annual review requirement under DOE Order 435. 1 was determined to be an <b>administrative</b> <b>requirement</b> and, therefore, annual reviews were not prepared on an annual basis. However, the landfill has been operating for 5 years and, since the waste forms and inventories disposed of have changed from what was originally envisioned for the ICDF landfill, the ICDF project team has decided that this annual review is necessary to document the changes and provide a basis for any updates in analyses that may be necessary to continue to meet the substantive requirements of DOE Order 435. 1. For facilities regulated under DOE Order 435. 1 - 1, U. S. DOE Manual 435. 1 - 1, 'Radioactive Waste Management', IV. P. (4) (c) stipulates that annual summaries of low-level waste disposal operations shall be prepared with respect to the conclusions and recommendations of the performance assessment and composite analysis. Important factors considered in this review include facility operations, waste receipts, and results from monitoring and research and development programs. There have been no significant changes in operations at the landfill in respect to the disposal geometry, the verification of waste characteristics, and the tracking of inventories against total limits that would affect the results and conclusions of the performance assessment. Waste receipts to date and projected waste receipts through Fiscal Year 2012 are both greater than the inventory assessed in the performance assessment and composite analysis. The waste forms disposed of to the landfill are different from the waste form (compacted soil) assessed in the performance assessment. The leak detection system and groundwater monitoring results indicate the landfill has not leaked. The results of the performance assessment/composite analysis are valid (i. e., there is still a reasonable expectation of meeting performance objectives) but the new information indicates less conservatism in the results than previously believed...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of recent {{legislative}} changes, Boards of Trustees and, through them, the principal, are now responsible for the appraisal and professional development of their staff. This research aimed to contribute towards an evaluation of current teacher appraisal programmes by: 1. Providing an overview of teacher appraisal programmes which currently exist in Auckland secondary schools, in particular {{to find out what}} percentage of secondary schools in the Auckland region have current ongoing teacher appraisal programmes and, where these schools, which have a current teacher appraisal programme rank on summative - formative dimensions. The answers to these questions were obtained from a questionnaire which was sent to all Auckland Secondary Schools 2. Providing an in-depth study of six schools which have an on-going teacher appraisal programme with elements of both summative and formative appraisal. A focused interview with selected staff from each of the six schools was used to enable the writer to ascertain why and how each appraisal programme was developed. The interview was also used to identify any problems which had been encountered in developing the programme and to ascertain how the school had attempted to meet both legislative requirements and teacher development needs. 3. Providing as an action component, a description of the appraisal programme which the writer is currently trialling in his school and, which {{is a direct result of}} the research undertaken for this thesis. The major findings of this research were: Section One Seventy three percent of secondary schools in the Auckland region were trialling or using appraisal programmes and, while there was a huge diversity of appraisal systems in operation, the majority involved more formative than summative dimensions. In particular, all schools saw appraisal in terms of helping to improve teacher standards through increased professional development Section Two The common reason given by the six schools for developing a teacher appraisal programme was to give staff an opportunity for professional development. Four of the six schools which participated in the second part of the research had experienced problems in attempting to introduce teacher appraisal programmes, while other problems which the six schools experienced centred around lack of time and staff resentment about "yet another" <b>administrative</b> <b>requirement.</b> Teacher suspicion about the 'real' nature of appraisal, although mentioned, was not a major factor. Self appraisal was the dominant method of teacher assessment as it was seen to be a crucial factor in four schools and desirable in the other two. Only one school produced any evidence of staff training in appraisal techniques. All six schools had developed two appraisal systems; one in which all staff participated and which was largely formative; another which was used when necessary and which involved competency procedures. The teachers interviewed were adamant that the two systems were and had to be kept completely separate. Section Three While a teacher appraisal programme has been operating in the writer's school since 1990, the results of this research have caused the programme to be modified to include: a focus on self rather than external appraisal; the inclusion of senior management and non-teaching staff in the appraisal process and; an emphasis on training in appraisal procedures and techniques for all staff...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{construct}} and test a theoretical subjective authority continuum model for institutions of higher education. The model designed consisted of two major parts:(1) a model for the classification of subordinates according to one of 16 subordinate types and (2) a subjective authority continuum presented as a horizontal line along which three interrelated zones expand and contract. The three zones on the subjective authority continuum are: (1) zone of indifference, (2) zone of analysis, and (3) zone of rejection. The zone of indifference is characterized as when subordinates carry out administrative requirements without resistance, or thought. The zone of analysis means the subordinate will analyze administrative requirements before complying or not complying. The zone of rejection means the subordinate will not willingly comply with an <b>administrative</b> <b>requirement.</b> Testing of the model was accomplished through the use ofquestionnaire type instrument. Thirty nine potential respondents were sent packets. Each packet included a test instrument. Twenty one of the selectees responded by returning the test instruments. The respondents were selected according to predetermined criteria. No individual identification of respondents was sought or received. The analysis of the responses was accomplished as follows:(1) The respondent was identified according to subordinate type. Subordinate type was determined by specific responses to four questions in part one of the test instrument. The four questions were relevant to three conditions: (a) superior-subordinate relationships, (b) personal professional values, and (c) attitudinal uniformity. There were three levels of combinations which resulted in 16 possible subordinate types. A respondent was identified as one subordinate type only. (2) Four specific situations were then given to respondents. That is, the four questions in part two of the instrument were designed to relate to four situations involving conflict, or a lack of conflict, of the three conditions determined as representative of subjective authority. That is, superior-subordinate relationships, personal professional values, and attitudinal uniformity. (3) Three responses were given for selection and a comments section was provided. The three given responses related directly to the three zones along the subjective authority continuum. The three responses and corrollary zones were:(1) I would ordinarily comply [...] representative of zone of indifference. (2) I would ordinarily take under advisement-representative of the zone of analysis. (3) I would ordinarily reject [...] representative of the zone of rejection. Analysis of the data supported the notion that subordinates can be identified according to type, and that subjective authority does exist within the academic department of the institution of higher education where the study was conducted. Further, operating professionals are sensitive to the three conditions given as necessary for subjective authority to exist. The majority o the respondents indicated a strong preference for superiors to demonstrate a high consideration for subordinates, while preferences for task involvement by superiors in tasks performed by subordinates was mixed. A majority of the respondents also indicated strong influence from personal professional values while all of the respondents which were identified by type, indicated strong influence from colleague attitudinal uniformity. The model is not intended to be a panacea. Other models, theories, and concepts should be considered when using the subjective authority continuum mode. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
