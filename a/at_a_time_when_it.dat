In 1948, U.S. {{president}} Harry S. Truman ordered desegregation of the U.S. military with Executive Order 9981. However, many units remained de facto segregated, with African Americans mostly being pooled into service units and non-combat duties. It would be several years before troops were fully integrated.|$|E
5|$|Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a U.S. {{hedge fund}} used for trading {{strategies}} such as fixed income arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, and pairs trading, combined with high leverage. Its collapse in 1998 led to a bailout by major banks and investment houses, and resulted in massive losses for UBS <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> had merged with Swiss Bank Corporation. However, UBS involvement with LTCM pre-dated the merger.|$|E
5|$|Martin Peerson (or Pearson, Pierson) (born between 1571 and 1573; died December 1650 or January 1651 {{and buried}} 16 January 1651) was an English composer, organist and virginalist. Despite Roman Catholic leanings <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was illegal not to {{subscribe}} to Church of England beliefs and practices, he was highly esteemed for his musical abilities and held posts at St Paul's Cathedral and, it is believed, Westminster Abbey. His output included both sacred and secular music in forms such as consort music, keyboard pieces, madrigals and motets.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Chadwick {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's {{assistant director of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, scutes {{which were}} found in the Kayenta Formation (Glen Canyon Group) of {{northern}} Arizona, were by Kevin Padian referred to a Scelidosaurus sp., and used to determine that the age of the strata was around 199.6-196.5 million years ago, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was still thought that Scelidosaurus harrisonii dated to the early Sinemurian. These scutes established a geographic tie-in between Arizona's Glen Canyon and Europe, where fossils of Scelidosaurus had previously been discovered. Later scientists have rejected the assignment to Scelidosaurus, as the scutes are different in form. In 2014, Roman Ulansky named a new species, S. arizonenesis, based off these specimens. In 2016, Peter Malcolm Galton and Kenneth Carpenter identified it as a nomen dubium, instead once again placing the specimens as Thyreophora indet.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on September 6, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan {{in order to}} travel to Japan and merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated {{disagreement}} between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker {{said he could not}} hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was unclear if it would hold.|$|E

5|$|Walker had protested in vain against {{releasing}} the brigade, believing {{he needed it}} and all the troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. The order prompted a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning two newly arrived units of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 17th Infantry Regiment and the 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves. Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective, and believed the transition endangered the Pusan Perimeter <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was unclear if it could hold back the North Koreans. The brigade moved to Japan and merged with the 1st Marine Division. It was deactivated as an independent unit for the last time on 13 September 1950.|$|E
5|$|Within weeks Jan {{was sent}} from the {{familiar}} surroundings of Klipfontein to a boarding house at Riebeek West, {{to take his}} brother's place {{at the school of}} Mr TC Stoffberg. As had been the case with his brother, his parents had already mapped out his future; like his brother Jan was destined for a future in the Dutch Reformed Church, to be ordained as a predikant at the conclusion of his studies. This vocation, though imposed upon him by his parents, was by no means regarded as an imposition by Jan, growing up as he had in an environment where adherence to the Church and piety of deeds counted for a good deal. This upbringing had turned twelve-year-old Jan into a deeply religious, serious-minded boy. Now, attending school for the first time, he faced a number of obstacles. Foremost amongst these was his rudimentary grasp of English, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was the main medium of instruction and crucial for any Afrikaner who wished {{to play a role in}} wider Cape society. Thanks to his mother's efforts. in this as well as in other subjects, he was better prepared than most children in similar circumstances, but nevertheless he was to start his schooling alongside children many years younger than himself with many years of study separating him from his contemporaries.|$|E
