60|$|I was {{too young}} myself to take much part {{in the war of}} the revolution, though {{accident}} made me an eye-witness of some of its most important events, and that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> fifteen. At twelve--the American intellect ever was and continues to be singularly precocious--I was sent to Nassau Hall, Princeton, to be educated, and I remained there until I finally got a degree, though it was not without several long and rude interruptions of my studies. Although so early sent to college, I did not actually graduate until I was nineteen, the troubled times requiring nearly twice as long a servitude to make a Bachelor of Arts of me as would have been necessary in the more halcyon days of peace. Thus I made a fragment of a campaign when only a sophomore, and another the first year I was junior. I say the first year, because I was obliged to pass two years in each of the two higher classes of the institution, in order {{to make up for lost}} time. A youth cannot very well be campaigning and studying Euclid in the academic bowers, at the same moment. Then I was so young, that a year, more or less, was of no great moment.|$|E

6000|$|Mr Frederic Harrison, however, {{thinks that}} neither [...] "the {{theology}} nor {{the philosophy of}} In Memoriam are new, original, with an independent force and depth of their own." [...] "They are exquisitely graceful re- statements of {{the theology of the}} Broad Churchman of the school of F. D. Maurice and Jowett--a combination of Maurice's somewhat illogical piety with Jowett's philosophy of mystification." [...] The piety of Maurice may be as illogical as that of Positivism is logical, and the philosophy of the Master of Balliol may be whatever Mr Harrison pleases to call it. But as Jowett's earliest work (except an essay on Etruscan religion) is of 1855, one does not see how it could influence Tennyson before 1844. And what had the Duke of Argyll written on these themes some years before 1844? The late Duke, to whom Mr Harrison refers in this connection, was born in 1823. His philosophic ideas, if they were to influence Tennyson's In Memoriam, must have been set forth by him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> seventeen, or thereabouts. Mr Harrison's sentence is, [...] "But does In Memoriam teach anything, or transfigure any idea which was not about that time" [...] (the time of writing was mainly 1833-1840) [...] "common form with F. D. Maurice, with Jowett, C. Kingsley, F. Robertson, Stopford Brooke, Mr Ruskin, and the Duke of Argyll, Bishops Westcott and Boyd Carpenter?" ...|$|E

60|$|You will be eager, I know, to hear {{something}} further of Frederica, and perhaps may think me negligent for not writing before. She arrived with her uncle last Thursday fortnight, when, of course, I lost no time in demanding the cause of her behaviour; and soon found myself to have been perfectly right in attributing it to my own letter. The prospect of it frightened her so thoroughly, that, {{with a mixture of}} true girlish perverseness and folly, she resolved on getting {{out of the house and}} proceeding directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes; and had really got as far as the length of two streets in her journey when she was fortunately missed, pursued, and overtaken. Such was the first distinguished exploit of Miss Frederica Vernon; and, if we consider that it was achieved <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> sixteen, we shall have room for the most flattering prognostics of her future renown. I am excessively provoked, however, at the parade of propriety which prevented Miss Summers from keeping the girl; and it seems so extraordinary a piece of nicety, considering my daughter's family connections, that I can only suppose the lady to be governed by the fear of never getting her money. Be that as it may, however, Frederica is returned on my hands; and, having nothing else to employ her, is busy in pursuing the plan of romance begun at Langford. She is actually falling in love with Reginald De Courcy! To disobey her mother by refusing an unexceptionable offer is not enough; her affections must also be given without her mother's approbation. I never saw a girl of her age bid fairer to be the sport of mankind. Her feelings are tolerably acute, and she is so charmingly artless in their display as to afford the most reasonable hope of her being ridiculous, and despised by every man who sees her.|$|E
60|$|McC----'s story runs thus. About {{sixty years}} ago, a {{something}} Macdermot, true Milesian, pious Catholic, and descendant of king somebody, died somewhere, having {{managed to keep}} a comfortable little portion of his ancestors' royalties to console him {{for the loss of}} their sceptre. He having two sons, and disdaining to make anything but estated gentlemen of them, made over in some fictitious manner (for in those righteous days a Roman Catholic could make no legal will) to his eldest, the estate on which he lived, and to the youngest, that of Ballycloran--about six hundred as bad acres as a gentleman might wish to call his own. But Thaddeus, otherwise Thady Macdermot, being an estated gentleman, must have a gentleman's residence on his estate, and the house of Ballycloran was accordingly built. Had Thady Macdermot had ready money, it might have been well built; but though an estated gentleman, he had none. He had debts even when his father died; and though he planned, ordered, and agreed for a house, such as he thought the descendant of a Connaught Prince might inhabit without disgrace, it was ill built, half finished, and paid for by long bills. This, however, is so customary in poor Ireland that it but little harassed Thady. He had a fine, showy house, with stables, &c., gardens, an avenue, and a walk round his demesne; and his neighbours had no more. It was little he cared for comfort, but he would not be the first of the Macdermots that would not be respectable. When his house was finished, Thady went into County Galway, and got himself a wife with two thousand pounds fortune, for which {{he had to go to}} law with his brother-in-law. The lawsuit, the continual necessity of renewing the bills with which the builder in Carrick on Shannon every quarter attacked him, the fruitless endeavour to make his tenants pay thirty shillings an acre for half-reclaimed bog, and a somewhat strongly developed aptitude for potheen, sent poor Thady to another world rather prematurely, and his son and heir, Lawrence, came to the throne <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> twelve. The Galway brother-in-law compromised the lawsuit; the builder took a mortgage on the property from the boy's guardian; the mother gave new leases to the tenants; Larry went to school at Longford; and Mrs. Mac kept up the glory of Ballycloran.|$|E

60|$|Among {{the many}} {{fatalities}} attending the bloom of young desire, that of blindly {{taking to the}} confectionery line has not, perhaps, been sufficiently considered. How {{is the son of}} a British yeoman, who has been fed principally on salt pork and yeast dumplings, to know that there is satiety for the human stomach even in a paradise of glass jars full of sugared almonds and pink lozenges, and that the tedium of life can reach a pitch where plum-buns at discretion cease to offer the slightest excitement? Or how, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> when a confectioner seems to him a very prince whom all the world must envy--who breakfasts on macaroons, dines on meringues, sups on twelfth-cake, and fills up the intermediate hours with sugar-candy or peppermint--how is he to foresee the day of sad wisdom, when he will discern that the confectioner's calling is not socially influential, or favourable to a soaring ambition? I have known a man who turned out to have a metaphysical genius, incautiously, in the period of youthful buoyancy, commence his career as a dancing-master; and you may imagine the use that was made of this initial mistake by opponents who felt themselves bound to warn the public against his doctrine of the Inconceivable. He could not give up his dancing-lessons, because he made his bread by them, and metaphysics would not have found him in so much as salt to his bread. It was really the same with Mr. David Faux and the confectionery business. His uncle, <b>the</b> butler <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great house close by Brigford, had made a pet of him in his early boyhood, and it was on a visit to this uncle that the confectioners' shops in that brilliant town had, on a single day, fired his tender imagination. He carried home the pleasing illusion that a confectioner must be <b>at</b> once <b>the</b> happiest and the foremost of men, since the things he made were not only the most beautiful to behold, but the very best eating, and such as the Lord Mayor must always order largely for his private recreation; so that when his father declared he must be put to a trade, David chose his line without a moment's hesitation; and, with a rashness inspired by a sweet tooth, wedded himself irrevocably to confectionery. Soon, however, the tooth lost its relish and fell into blank indifference; and all the while, his mind expanded, his ambition took new shapes, which could hardly be satisfied within the sphere his youthful ardour had chosen. But what was he to do? He was a young man of much mental activity, and, above all, gifted with a spirit of contrivance; but then, his faculties would not tell with great effect in any other medium than that of candied sugars, conserves, and pastry. Say what you will about the identity of the reasoning process in all branches of thought, or about the advantage of coming to subjects with a fresh mind, the adjustment of butter to flour, and of heat to pastry, is not the best preparation for the office of prime minister; besides, in the present imperfectly-organized state of society, there are social barriers. David could invent delightful things in the way of drop-cakes, and he had the widest views of the sugar department; but in other directions he certainly felt hampered by the want of knowledge and practical skill; and the world is so inconveniently constituted, that the vague consciousness of being a fine fellow is no guarantee of success in any line of business.|$|R
60|$|His greatness {{was not of}} his own making. It {{was largely}} the {{creation}} of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519). Some families have fought, others have intrigued their way to world power; the Habsburgs married their way. Maximilian began his career with Austria, Styria, part of Alsace and other districts, the original Habsburg patrimony; he married--the lady's name scarcely matters to us--the Netherlands and Burgundy. Most of Burgundy slipped from him after his first wife's death, but the Netherlands he held. Then he tried unsuccessfully to marry Brittany. He became Emperor in succession to his father, Frederick III, in 1493, and married the duchy of Milan. Finally he married his son to the weak-minded daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Ferdinand and Isabella of Columbus, who not only reigned over a freshly united Spain and over Sardinia and {{the kingdom of the}} two Sicilies, but over all America west of Brazil. So it was that this Charles V, his grandson, inherited most of the American continent and between a third and a half of what the Turks had left of Europe. He succeeded to the Netherlands in 1506. When his grandfather Ferdinand died in 1516, he became practically king of the Spanish dominions, his mother being imbecile; and his grandfather Maximilian dying in 1519, he was in 1520 elected Emperor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> still comparatively <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> of twenty.|$|R

40|$|A violÃncia Ã um fenÃmeno dominante na histÃria da humanidade desde tempos remotos. Ao enfatizarmos a violÃncia interpessoal, destacamos a mulher como um das principais vÃtimas, e a violÃncia {{conjugal}} como a modalidade mais praticada. Esse fenÃmeno se entrecruza com gÃnero, subjetividade, assimetria social, dimensÃes culturais e polÃticas. Dessa forma, sob o pressuposto de existir um hiato entre as propostas da polÃtica de abrigamento e a forma como ela estÃ sendo executada. Defendemos a tese: o Estado, representado pelo dispositivo casa-abrigo, assiste a mulher submetida Ã violÃncia conjugal por meio de aÃÃes de proteÃÃo fÃsica e jurÃdica, mas com pouco impacto no processo de reinserÃÃo social das abrigadas. Portanto, tivemos como objetivo geral: compreender a vivÃncia da mulher relacionada com o violÃncia domÃstica e com o abrigamento institucional. Objetivos especÃficos: apreender o modo como vivencia a violÃncia e a passagem pela casa-abrigo; identificar aÃÃes desenvolvidas pela instituiÃÃo durante o abrigamento na perspectiva das diretrizes e objetivos da polÃtica de abrigamento. Estudo descrito, com abordagem qualitativa, pautado nos princÃpios da hermenÃutica filosÃfica, por percebemos que o fenÃmeno da violÃncia, suas vÃtimas e seu entorno fazem parte de um universo subjetivo e complexo. O cenÃrio da pesquisa foi uma OrganizaÃÃo Governamental (casa-abrigo), mantida pelo governo do Estado do CearÃ. Como participantes contamos com 10 mulheres abrigadas no perÃodo da coleta de dados, ocorrida nos meses de setembro de 2009 e fevereiro de 2010. Os dados foram produzidos por meio de entrevista semiestruturada e oficinas temÃticas. Conforme os resultados mostram, o fenÃmeno da violÃncia sempre esteve presente de forma intensa na vida das abrigadas. Na tenra idade, os agressores eram pais, mÃes, irmÃos, padrastos e madrastas, com justificativas que variam de âeducarâ a punir. JÃ na fase adulta, a modalidade mais frequente Ã a violÃncia conjugal, exercida de forma fÃsica, psicolÃgica e sexual. SÃo mulheres de baixa renda, baixa escolaridade, a maioria Ã domÃstica/dona de casa. Relatam histÃrico de ideia suicida, queixas somÃticas, revolta, depressÃo e temor. Romperam a relaÃÃo violenta por medo de serem assassinadas por seus companheiros. Esse rompimento deu-se apÃs inÃmeras manifestaÃÃes de aÃÃes de extrema violÃncia por parte do agressor. A passagem pela casa-abrigo representa um perÃodo de isolamento agravado pelo Ãcio diÃrio. Gostariam de aproveitar o tempo na casa-abrigo para fazerem cursos, capacitaÃÃes, se alfabetizarem, terem momentos de lazer, entre os quais ir Ã igreja, vivenciarem oportunidades antes inexistentes. Para elas a Ãnica diversÃo Ã ver a programaÃÃo nos canais de TV. Ao nos aproximarmos da realidade de mulheres vitimadas pela violÃncia conjugal, usuÃrias da casa-abrigo, evidenciamos a lacuna entre diretrizes, objetivos e aÃÃes programÃticas da polÃtica de abrigamento, e como ela Ã aplicada na prÃtica das suas abrigadas. A exequibilidade das nossas polÃticas tem se tornado conhecida e aclamada atÃ mesmo pelos pouco politizados. NÃo podemos permitir que esse modelo polÃtico continue comprometendo vidas, sonhos, esperanÃas. Urge uma reflexÃo coletiva acerca do que queremos e o que temos em nosso panorama polÃtico. Essas mulheres, assim como muitos brasileiros atingidos por polÃticas limitadas e ineficientes, merecem a oportunidade de uma vida melhor, alimentada pelo sonho de ter sua cidadania respeitada e a satisfaÃÃo de realizÃ-lo. Violence is {{a dominant}} phenomenon {{in human history}} since ancient times. When emphasizing interpersonal violence we highlight the woman {{as one of the}} main victims, and the marital violence as the most practiced. This phenomenon intersects with gender, subjectivity, social asymmetry, cultural and political dimensions. Thus, under the assumption of a gap between the policy proposals of sheltering and how it is being executed. We defend the argument that the State, represented by the device safe house, assists the women subjected to domestic violence primarily through actions of physical and legal protection, but with little impact on the process of social reintegration of the sheltered. Therefore, we had as a general objective: to understand the experience of women related to domestic violence and the institutional sheltering. Specific objectives: learning how to experience the violence and the passage by the shelter home, identify actions taken by the institution for sheltering in anticipation of the guidelines and objectives of the policy of sheltering. Described study with a qualitative approach, based on the principles of philosophical hermeneutics, for realizing that the phenomenon of violence, its victims and its surroundings are part of a subjective and complex universe. The study setting was a Governmental Organization (shelter home), maintained by the state government of CearÃ. We had, as participants, 10 housed women in the data collection period, which occurred in September 2009 and February 2010. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and workshops. As the results show, the phenomenon of violence was always present intensely in <b>the</b> sheltered life. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> <b>age,</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators were fathers, mothers, brothers, stepfathers and stepmothers, with explanations ranging from "educating" to punish. In the adult stage, the most frequent modality is marital violence, exercised physically, psychologically and sexually. They are women of low income, low education, most are domestic / housekeeper. They report a history of suicidal idea, somatic complaints, anger, depression and fear. They broke the violent relationship for fear of being murdered by their companions. This rupture occurred immediately after countless manifestations of shares of extreme violence by the aggressor. The passage by the shelter home represents a period of isolation compounded by the daily lack of entertainment or occupation. According to reports, people would like to spend time <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shelter home to do courses, training, become literate, have leisure time, including going to church, experiencing opportunities which did not exist before. The only fun for them is to see programs on TV channels. As we approached the reality of women victimized by domestic violence, users of the shelter home, we noted the gap between guidelines, objectives and programmatic actions of the policy of sheltering, and how it is applied in practice to their sheltered. The feasibility of our policies has been known and praised even by the less politicized. We can not allow this model to continue committing political lives, dreams, hopes. Its necessary a collective reflection on what we want and what we have in our political landscape. These women, like many Brazilians assisted by limited and inefficient political actions, deserve the opportunity for a better life, fueled by the dream of having their citizenship respected and the satisfaction of making this dream became true...|$|R
