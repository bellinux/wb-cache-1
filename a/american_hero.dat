5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real <b>American</b> <b>Hero</b> spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I. Joe: Yearbook {{differed from the}} typical comic book annual publication {{in that it was}} more like a magazine. Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, a summary of the comic book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I. Joe: Yearbook ran until 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and his neighbors, and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of his face. In the episode, while being launched off a ramp and flying through the air, Peter wears the costume from The Greatest <b>American</b> <b>Hero</b> and sings the series' theme song.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{the success}} of A Real <b>American</b> <b>Hero</b> lead Marvel to produce a second title: G.I. Joe: Special Missions which lasted 28 issues. Herb Trimpe was the artist {{for most of the}} run, with Dave Cockrum {{providing}} pencils on several issues. Spinning out of G.I. Joe #50 and set in the same continuity, the series presented more intense violence and a more ambiguous morality than the main title, and the Joes faced enemies who were not related to Cobra. Each issue usually featured a stand-alone mission focusing on a small group of Joes.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, IDW Publishing {{began to}} re-publish the {{original}} series again as Classic G.I. Joe, and like Marvel before it, collects ten issues in each volume; {{the last few}} collections have slightly more issues in order to conclude with the 15th paperback volume, {{which was published in}} August, 2012. Other collections for the spin-off Special Missions and assorted Annuals also appeared. In November 2012, IDW restarted their reprint series with the hardcover G.I. JOE: The Complete Collection, Vol. 1, intending to reprint all the stories in reading order. IDW also revived the original G.I. Joe: A Real <b>American</b> <b>Hero</b> as an ongoing series in 2010, with a special #155½ issue released on Free Comic Book Day, followed by issue #156 onwards in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|On the February 1, 2013, {{episode of}} SmackDown, Swagger returned, {{and demanded that}} SmackDown General Manager Booker T {{put him in the}} Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. Later on that night, Swagger made his in-ring return by {{defeating}} Kofi Kingston. On the February 11 episode of Raw, Swagger debuted a new manager, Zeb Colter, a self-proclaimed great <b>American</b> <b>hero</b> who strongly advocated anti-immigration beliefs; Swagger's character was influenced by Colter to display similar traits. That same episode, Swagger defeated Zack Ryder to qualify for the Elimination Chamber match that would determine the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship which he also won after last eliminating Randy Orton.|$|E
5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front {{and his ability to}} inspire troops with vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His strong emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an <b>American</b> <b>hero.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor {{known for}} his natural, authentic, and {{understated}} acting style and screen performances. His career spanned thirty-five years, from 1925 to 1960, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films. He was a major movie star {{from the end of}} the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and authentic on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal <b>American</b> <b>hero.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1816 Galveston Island was {{claimed by}} the pirate Louis-Michel Aury as a base of {{operations}} to support Mexico's rebellion against Spain. Aury was succeeded as leader by Jean Lafitte, the famed Louisiana pirate and <b>American</b> <b>hero</b> of the War of 1812. Lafitte, at the time serving as a privateer for the Spanish Empire, transformed Galveston Island and the bay into a pirate kingdom he called Campeche. He established bases for smuggling and ship repair on the Trinity River near the bay and at Eagle Point (modern San Leon). His gang also created a hide-out {{on the shores of}} Clear Lake. As late as 1965, treasure from this era was discovered at Kemah.Kearney (2008), p. 177 In response to the piracy, the United States Navy ousted Lafitte from the island in 1821 and the colony was abandoned. Some settlers in the region remained such as Anson Taylor who had supplied produce and game from the Clear Lake area for Campeche.|$|E
5|$|Schyman {{graduated}} from the University of Southern California in 1978 {{with a degree in}} music composition. He intended to compose music for film and television, {{going so far as to}} present two student film scores at his senior recital, which was an unconventional move at the time. Upon graduation, through one of his friend's father, the actor Dennis Weaver, he was invited to watch a recording session for the music of a television show Weaver was working in. There, he met a ghost composer for the show, who in turn told him about a job composing for Lutheran television which he applied for and was hired. He also met the composers Pete Carpenter and Mike Post, the titled composers for the show Weaver had been acting in. They were working on four to five shows each week, and brought him on board as a ghost composer to help them create music for several shows, such as Magnum, P.I. and The Greatest <b>American</b> <b>Hero,</b> for which he is credited for starting in 1980.|$|E

25|$|Word of {{the actions}} in Obligado spread around the continent. Most of the press, that so far had {{repeated}} the Montevidean libels, turned instead to support Rosas.

The president of Bolivia José Ballivián, who was so far against Rosas, instructed his diplomat Manuel Rodríguez to congratulate Rosas for the action of Obligado and protest with reason of the disloyal and unjust Anglo-French intervention in the Río de la Plata against the rights and interests of the Americas. José de San Martín wrote a supporting letter to Rosas and, despite his old age, offered his military assistance. He also {{wrote a letter to the}} British Morning Chronicle, explaining that a military occupation of Buenos Aires by Anglo-French forces would be nearly impossible.|$|E
