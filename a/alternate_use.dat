25|$|By far {{the most}} common <b>alternate</b> <b>use</b> for the TCA ground has been Australian Rules Football. The ground hosted {{numerous}} TFL Grand Finals up until 1921. It hosted a number of neutral fixtures in TANFL football until Hobart Football Club moved into the ground in 1945 and began playing home matches there in 1946 until the club and the TANFL fell into a dispute with the TCA and HGRC over high rent costs at the venue and subsequently Hobart Football Club moved its home fixtures to North Hobart Oval from 1954–1959, ultimately returning to the ground from 1960 and playing there each winter until 1982, when, {{as part of the}} TANFL's ground rationalisation plans, the Tigers were forced to play their home fixtures at more modern stadiums. After a tumultuous era from 1983 to 1997 which saw them play at both North Hobart Oval and KGV Football Park the club dropped out of the TFL Statewide League in 1997 and joined the SFL the following year, returning to their spiritual home, the TCA Ground.|$|E

500|$|The Great Depression and World War II {{combined}} to sink {{the study of}} dinosaurs into a decades-long lull. Scientists considered dinosaurs a group of unrelated animals that left no descendants, and dinosaurs were presented as stupid, slow, stuck in swamps, and doomed to extinction. Scientific dinosaur artwork, primarily from Rudolph F. Zallinger and Zdeněk Burian, reflected and reinforced the conception of dinosaurs as slow and static (one artistic quirk that became commonplace in representations of Mesozoic landscapes, {{the presence of a}} volcano, was a hallmark of Zallinger's). From such ideas came the <b>alternate</b> <b>use</b> of [...] "dinosaur" [...] as something out of date.|$|E
2500|$|The freight {{and work}} {{equipment}} was {{a hodgepodge of}} mainly homebuilt designs, outdated passenger cars converted for <b>alternate</b> <b>use,</b> and secondhand equipment. [...] Most of this equipment was quite old, but even some equipment dating to before 1905 remained in IR's employ for years.

2500|$|The early {{instruction}} books make frequent {{reference to}} the <b>alternate</b> <b>use</b> of 'ivory, bone, or wooden hooks' and 'steel needles in a handle', as appropriate to the stitch being made. Taken with the synonymous labeling of shepherd's- and single crochet, and the similar equivalence of French- and double crochet, {{there is a strong}} suggestion that crochet is rooted both in tambour embroidery and shepherd's knitting, leading to thread and yarn crochet respectively; a distinction that is still made. The locus of the fusion of all these elements — the [...] "invention" [...] noted above — has yet to be determined, as does the origin of shepherd's knitting.|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, ZR-2 was {{completed}} and undertook {{a number of}} test flights from its construction site at Cardington, before travelling for further testing over the North Sea, being based at Howden. During a test flight in August, ZR-2 experienced a catastrophic structural failure and crashed into the Humber Estuary, killing all but five aboard. Despite this setback, the US Navy continued with its rigid airship programme, starting construction of ZR-1 in June 1922. As a safety measure, {{it was decided that}} rather than use hydrogen as the lifting gas, which had been used on ZR-2, and which caused the fires following its crash, ZR-1 would be filled with helium. The scarcity of helium, and the expense of producing it, meant that the airship utilised most of the world's reserve of the gas. ZR-1 was commissioned into the US Navy as USS Shenandoah in October 1923. At this time, another new rigid airship was under construction at the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin works in Germany - intended to compensate for the ships intended for reparations after the war, the ship was also used as a means of keeping zeppelin construction alive in Germany. Known initially by its construction number as LZ 126, it was appropriated by the US Navy as [...] and commissioned as USS Los Angeles in November 1924. Owing to the scarity of helium, upon its commissioning, Los Angeles utilised gas obtained from Shenandoah; the intention was to <b>alternate</b> <b>use</b> of the two airships until more of the gas could be procured.|$|E
50|$|In policy debate, {{preparation}} time (prep time) {{is the amount}} of time given to each team to prepare for their speeches. Prep time may be taken at any time in any interval. Another form of prep time is known as alternate-use time. <b>Alternate</b> <b>use</b> time replaces {{preparation time}} and cross-examination. <b>Alternate</b> <b>use</b> time can be used for cross-examination or preparation in any amount the team desires {{at any time during the}} speech. Generally tournaments using <b>alternate</b> <b>use</b> time will have more time than tournaments using preparation time because it is used for both cross examination and preparation.|$|E

40|$|While an ever-growing body of {{research}} is concerned with user behavior on individual social network sites (SNSs) —mostly Facebook—studies addressing an <b>alternating</b> <b>use</b> {{of two or more}} SNS are rare. Here, we investigate the relationship between <b>alternating</b> SNS <b>use</b> and social capital in the context of migration. <b>Alternating</b> SNS <b>use</b> avoids some of the problems associated with large networks located on one site; in particular the management of different social or cultural spheres. Not only does this strategy hold potential for increased social capital, it also provides a particular incentive for migrants faced with the challenge of staying in touch with back home and managing a new social environment. Two survey studies are presented that focus on the relationship between <b>alternating</b> SNS <b>use</b> and online ties in a migrant context involving Indian nationals. Study 1 looked at migration within India, whereas Study 2 compared international with domestic SNS users. In both studies, <b>alternating</b> SNS <b>use</b> added to the prediction of online network size and accounted for differences in network size found for migrant and non-migrant users. Differences were due to the number of peripheral ties, rather than core ties. Findings suggest that <b>alternating</b> SNS <b>use</b> may constitute a compensatory strategy that helps to overcome lower levels of socializing represented through a single SNS...|$|R

Participants can also be prompted to select their best responses to the <b>Alternate</b> <b>Uses</b> task (Silvia et al., 2008). Minimal programming knowledge is required. The program runs on any server, and responses are recorded in a standard MySQL database. Responses can be scored using the Consensual Assessment Technique (Amabile, 1996) or according to Torrance’s (1974) traditional scoring method. Adoption of this web-based tool should facilitate creativity research across cultures and access to eminent creators...|$|R

Results indicated that males performed best in the C/G condition and females did so in the C/NG condition; standard instructions were least beneficial in eliciting maximal creative performance.
