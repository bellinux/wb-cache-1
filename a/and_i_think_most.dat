2500|$|Laudrup's {{departure}} from Barcelona {{was a huge}} blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, he commented, [...] "I think we played some very good football, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten {{best players in the}} world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe {{the best team in the}} world, together with AC Milan in that period." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, Santorum said {{he would}} {{continue}} to [...] "fight very strongly against libertarian influence within the Republican Party and the conservative movement." [...] In an interview with NPR in the summer of 2005, Santorum discussed what he called the [...] "libertarianish right", saying [...] "they have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever they want to do. Government should keep our taxes down and keep our regulation low and that we shouldn't get involved in the bedroom, we shouldn't get involved in cultural issues, you know, people should do whatever they want.

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of us {{will agree}} when we look back that the most real thing in our college life was not the lecturing and the lessons--very much of that stuff could very well {{have been done in}} the {{schooling}} stage--but the arguments of the debating society, the discussions that broke out in the classroom or laboratory, the talks in one's rooms about God and religion, about the state and freedom, about art, about every possible and impossible social relationship.|$|E

"Well," [...] drawled Carroll, [...] "there must be, I think, {{a certain}} {{distinctive}} stamp upon those {{who belong to}} the leader type--I mean {{the people who are}} capable of doing striking and heroic things. Apart from this, I've been studying you English--I've been over here before--and it has struck me that there's occasionally something imperious, or rather imperial, in the faces of your women in the most northern counties. I can't define the thing, but it's there--in the line of nose, in the mouth, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>most</b> marked in the brows.

"They {{are poor}} creatures," [...] Solomon Ben Manasseh said, scornfully; [...] "but {{we need not}} talk of them now, for they affect us in no way, save {{that it may be}} that Josephus has learned {{somewhat}} of their doctrines, from Banus; and that he is thus unduly <b>and,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>most</b> unfortunately for the country, inclined too much to mercy, instead of punishing the evildoers as they deserve." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{there was}} another side to my {{residence}} at Our Lady of the Snows. At this late season there were not many boarders; and yet I {{was not alone in}} the public part of the monastery. This itself is hard by the gate, with a small dining-room on the ground floor and a whole corridor of cells similar to mine upstairs. I have stupidly forgotten the board for a regular retraitant; but it was somewhere between three and five francs a day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> probably the first. Chance visitors like myself might give what they chose as a free-will offering, but nothing was demanded. I may mention that when I was going away Father Michael refused twenty francs as excessive. I explained the reasoning which led me to offer him so much; but even then, from a curious point of honour, he would not accept it with his own hand. [...] "I have no right to refuse for the monastery," [...] he explained, [...] "but I should prefer if you would give it to one of the brothers." ...|$|E
60|$|December 3.--A day of petty business, {{which killed}} a holiday. Finished my {{tale of the}} Mirror;[85] went with Tom Allan to see his {{building}} at Lauriston, where he has displayed good taste--supporting instead of tearing down or destroying the old chateau, which once belonged to the famous Mississippi Law. The additions are in very good taste, and will make a most comfortable house. Mr. Burn, architect, would fain have had the old house pulled down, which I wonder at in him,[86] though {{it would have been}} the practice of most of his brethren. When I came up to town I was just in time for the Bannatyne Club, where things are going on reasonably well. I hope we may get out some good historical documents in the course of the winter. Dined at the Royal Society Club. At the society had some essays upon the specific weight of the ore of manganese, which was caviare to the President, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of the members. But it seemed extremely accurate, and I have little doubt was intelligible to those who had the requisite key. We supped at Mr. Russell's, where the conversation was as gay as usual. Lieut-Col. Ferguson was my guest at the dinner.|$|E
60|$|But {{during that}} one day she kept her promise to John Eames by going to Lily Dale. Mrs. Arabin had become very fond of Johnny, and felt that he {{deserved}} the prize {{which he had been}} so long trying to win. The reader, perhaps, may not agree with Mrs. Arabin. The reader, who may have caught a closer insight into Johnny's character than Mrs. Arabin had obtained, may, perhaps, think that a young man who could amuse himself with Miss Demolines was unworthy of Lily Dale. If so, I may declare for myself that I and the reader are not in accord about John Eames. It is hard to measure worth and worthlessness in such matters, as there is no standard for such measurement. My old friend John was certainly no hero,--was very unheroic in many phases of his life; but then, if all the girls are to wait for heroes, I fear that the difficulties in the way of matrimonial arrangements, great as they are at present, will be very seriously enhanced. Johnny was not ecstatic, nor heroic, nor transcendental, nor very beautiful in his manliness; he was not a man to break his heart for love, or to have his story written in an epic; but he was an affectionate, kindly, honest young man; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> girls might have done worse than take him. Whether he was wise to ask assistance in his love-making so often as he had done, that may be another question.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2015, {{prosecutors}} {{dropped the}} investigation into Gray's campaign citing lack of evidence. Asked about the prosecutor's decision, Bowser was quoted as saying, [...] "I think it was appropriate {{to ask questions about}} the fairness of the 2010 mayoral campaign. The U.S. Attorney secured seven convictions related to that campaign.

40|$|This paper {{represents}} an extraordinary {{review of literature}} on the association between SES <b>and</b> mental illness. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> social scientists would find it impressive.

6000|$|... § XI. Supposing the {{materials}} are in each case {{to be of the}} same kind, the choice is in great part at the architect's discretion, only there is a limit on the one hand to the multiplication of the slender shaft, in the inconvenience of the narrowed interval, and on the other, to the enlargement of the massy shaft, in the loss of breadth to the building.[38] That will be commonly the best proportion which is a natural mean between the two limits; leaning to the side of grace or of grandeur according to the expressional intention of the work. I say, commonly the best, because, in some cases, this expressional invention may prevail over all other considerations, and a column of unnecessary bulk or fantastic slightness be adopted in order to strike the spectator with awe or with surprise.[39] The architect is, however, rarely in practice compelled to use one kind of material only; and his choice lies frequently between the employment of a larger number of solid and perfect small shafts, or a less number of pieced and cemented large ones. It is often possible to obtain from quarries near at hand, blocks which might be cut into shafts eight or twelve feet long and four or five feet round, when larger shafts can only be obtained in distant localities; and the question then is between the perfection of smaller features and the imperfection of larger. We shall find numberless instances in Italy in which the first choice has been boldly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> wisely made; and magnificent buildings have been composed of systems of small but perfect shafts, multiplied and superimposed. So long as the idea of the symmetry of a perfect shaft remained in the builder's mind, his choice could hardly be directed otherwise, and the adoption of the built and tower-like shaft appears to have been the result of a loss of this sense of symmetry consequent on the employment of intractable materials.|$|E
