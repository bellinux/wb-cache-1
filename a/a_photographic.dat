5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy.

5|$|He was {{commissioned}} second lieutenant in The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) {{at the start}} of the First World War and departed for the Western Front a few weeks later. In February 1915, he was attached to the Royal Flying Corps and soon became No. 2 Squadron's senior observer. In August 1915, while on <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> reconnaissance mission, his aircraft was shot down in northern France, near Lille. At the time of his death, it was suggested that he might have been the first undergraduate to see action in the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1868–1881 C. Vercellone, Giuseppe Cozza-Luzi, and G. Sergio {{published}} an {{edition of the}} entire codex in 6 volumes (New Testament in volume V; Prolegomena in volume VI). A typographical facsimile appeared between 1868 and 1872. In 1889–1890 <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> facsimile of the entire manuscript was made and published by Cozza-Luzi, in three volumes. Another facsimile of the New Testament text was published in 1904–1907 in Milan. As a result, the Codex became widely available.|$|E

5|$|That same year, J.J.

The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E

On 22 August 1915, Wallace was on <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> reconnaissance mission in a B.E.2c piloted by his friend 2Lt Charles Gallie.

5|$|Woide's errors were {{corrected}} in 1860 by B. H. Cowper, and E. H. Hansell, {{with three}} other manuscripts, in 1860. The Old Testament portion was also published in 1816-1828 by Baber, in three folio volumes. The entire manuscript was issued in photographic facsimile by the British Museum, {{under the supervision of}} E. M. Thompson in 1879 and 1880. Frederic G.

5|$|Explorer and {{archaeologist}} Alfred Maudslay visited Quiriguá {{for three}} days in 1881; {{they were the first}} pre-Columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology. He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor excavations, made paper and plaster molds of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures; these molds were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum, with casts being transferred to the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as customers in the early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E
5|$|Gordon {{is written}} {{as having a}} genius-level intellect and {{naturally}} possessing <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> memory. She is described by Gail Simone as the most intelligent member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City. Prior to the character's career as a vigilante, Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills, including vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a hacker, and graduate training in library sciences. Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used {{a wide variety of}} computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle. According to Gail Simone, Oracle maintains control over the twelve technologically advanced satellites that were created by Lex Luthor during his tenure as President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858 Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Calcutta and began {{travelling}} throughout Northern India {{to document the}} aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> studio in Thebes in 1862.|$|E
