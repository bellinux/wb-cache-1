Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains {{a family of four}} mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song.

Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko.

25|$|The {{speaking}} tower warns her {{to maintain}} silence <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passes</b> by several ominous figures: a lame man driving a mule loaded with sticks, {{a dead man}} swimming in the river that separates {{the world of the}} living from the world of the dead, and old women weaving. These, the tower warns, will seek to divert her by pleading for her help: she must ignore them. The cakes are treats for distracting Cerberus, the three-headed watchdog of Orcus, and the two coins for Charon the ferryman, so she can make a return trip.|$|E

500|$|The music video's storyline depicts Azalea's biographical {{journey from}} {{life on the}} streets to Hollywood. According to Natasha Stagg of American {{magazine}} V, the plot involves Azalea rising from [...] "trailer park standby to high-class Hollywood-ite {{in a matter of}} minutes". The music video opens with Azalea confidently walking on a deserted highway situated in a desert environment. Azalea's costume includes dark red lipstick, red-soled vertiginous Louboutins, a powder blue Givenchy bag, a tropical print brassiere and shorts. The scene is intercepted with visuals of burning shoes and wheels. Azalea then walks through a trailer park community where several locals stare at her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passes</b> by. Upon the beginning of the song's chorus, the video transcends into a playground scene where Azalea dances in an evening setting, with a fire-lit swing as her backdrop. In this segment, she wears a grey crop top and red slim-fit pants, with her hair styled in a bun. The next scene involves Azalea performing in a dance-off with her two female friends in front of a Freightliner Truck. Azalea sports a plum-coloured fur coat over a white mesh swimsuit. In the segment, the three engage in twerking and hair flicking actions.|$|E
2500|$|Example: Terence and Stella {{are at an}} Earth-to-Mars space race. Terence is an {{official}} at the starting line, [...] while Stella is a participant. At time , Stella's spaceship accelerates instantaneously to a speed of 0.5c. The distance from Earth to Mars is 300 light-seconds (about [...] ). Terence observes Stella crossing the finish-line clock at t=600.00s. But Stella observes the time on her ship chronometer to be [...] = 519.62s <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passes</b> the finish line, and she calculates the distance between the starting and finish lines, as measured in her frame, to be 259.81 light-seconds (about [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to four deleted scenes, the DVD release includes an alternate ending, showing all {{the main characters}} (including Benny, who was not present in the other ending) except Angel standing in the positions where they were during the [...] "Seasons of Love" [...] opening, all standing {{in a line of}} spotlights, with Angel's spot empty. Later in the scene, she enters from the side and walks down the line to take her place, stopping <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passes</b> Collins to take his hand for a moment. Although this tableau is used in the finale of the musical, it was dropped from the film for fear that audiences may have wondered why Angel had returned or why the characters were lined up on stage again. In the commentary, Chris Columbus adds that he [...] "didn't want audiences to think that everything was okay and Angel was alive again." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the video, Lee plays Little Red Riding Hood while actor Oliver Goodwill {{plays the}} Big Bad Wolf, {{who tries to}} seduce her. The clip begins with Lee at a vanity wearing a red satin cape, lip-syncing to the lyrics while sitting at {{opposite}} ends of a dining table with her lover played by Goodwill. She is then shown {{standing in front of a}} mirror while her lover comes behind her; he starts caressing her shoulders and prepares to kiss her, but Lee refuses, saying that he is [...] "too late". Shots of the band playing the song together and Lee sitting among wolves are interspersed among other scenes of the video. During the song's bridge, Lee appears descending a staircase, backed by four back-up dancers dressed in black clothing; upon reaching the bottom, both Lee and the dancers start levitating in the air. At the end of the song, Lee is seen walking atop the length of the dining table, while chairs and tabletop items are flung aside <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passes.</b> She reaches her lover at the other end of the table, places her finger on his lips, and sings [...] "I've made up your mind", indicating that he should start packing his things and leave. The video ends with Lee giggling behind the piano.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] (2009), he {{is present}} after the Torchwood Hub is blown up. He is ordered by Agent Johnson (Liz May Brice) {{to lead a}} team of {{government}} hit men to Gwen and Rhys' house. However, Davidson {{does not believe that}} Gwen is really a terrorist and subsequently delays Johnson, giving Gwen time to escape. Two days later he assists Gwen in securing the paperwork to bail Clem McDonald (Paul Copley) from police custody. After the death of Ianto (Gareth David Lloyd), Gwen's Torchwood colleague, Andy drives Gwen and Rhys to the council estate where Ianto's sister Rhiannon (Katy Wix) lives with her family. He struggles with his duty as he watches the police and the army forcefully seizing children in order to appease the 456 and ultimately discards his uniform to fight alongside rioting civilians against the authorities. In [...] "The New World" [...] (2011) Andy, now a police sergeant, gets in touch with Gwen and Rhys who are in hiding, and informs them that Gwen's father Geraint (William Thomas) is in hospital following two heart attacks and should have died, but has not. Andy explains that this is due to Miracle Day, a phenomenon whereby death ceases to occur across the world and the gravely-wounded continue to remain alive. Along with other South Wales police officers he assists with CIA agent Rex Matheson's (Mekhi Phifer) extradition of Jack and Gwen to the United States. After the Torchwood team have relocated to Washington Jack learns that Andy has had Rhys and daughter Anwen moved to a safe house. In [...] "The Categories of Life", he attempts to use his sergeant status to extract Gwen's father from an [...] "overflow camp", later regarded as a form of concentration camp, but is unsuccessful. In [...] "Immortal Sins" [...] Andy is called upon by Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins) to rescue Gwen's family from a hostage situation, shooting one of the captors in the process. He is visibly shaken at his actions, stating that he'd never shot anyone before.
