25|$|I don't {{know why}} {{people call me}} a jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> all kinds of music.|$|E

500|$|The {{album is}} also called Loose {{because it is}} [...] "the {{opposite}} of calculated" [...] and came naturally to Furtado and Timbaland; she called him her [...] "distant musical cousin because he was always pushing boundaries and always carving out his own path", which she believed she was doing with Loose.

500|$|When {{asked by}} Rolling Stone editor, David Wild {{why he was}} {{performing}} the album again live after forty years, Morrison replied: [...] "It received no promotion, from Warner Bros.—that's why I never got to play the songs live. [...] I {{had always wanted to}} play the record live and fully orchestrated—that is what this is all about. [...] I always like live recording <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> listening to live records too. [...] I'm not too fond of being in a studio—it's too contrived and too confining. I like the freedom of live, in-the-moment sound." ...|$|E

500|$|MIT {{students}} counterpranked the Lobby 7 dome to read [...] "The Only Institute of Technology", and had {{to resort}} to pulling the blimp down using helium balloons covered in sticky tape. One student unsuccessfully attempted to DDOS the Caltech students' website documenting the pranks. The pranks were seen as a way to merge Caltech and MIT's independent but similar pranking cultures. Campus Preview Weekend was chosen because the Caltech students would blend in with the unfamiliar prospective freshmen, and to increase the pranks' visibility. MIT Dean of Admissions Marilee Jones said, [...] "I think it's hilarious. I consider hacks a performance art, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the concept of inter-institute rivalry." ...|$|E

At this stage in his career, his comments on his tastes in composition and performance were: [...] "Even though I like avant garde jazz and classical music, I like to swing. I like to work with harmony and melody in my own music, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> acoustical instruments. But I can be quite dictatorial about the composed section, and lay down in great detail what everyone is supposed to do and how they should do it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)" [...] {{became one}} of Harrison's most popular songs, both from his years with the Beatles and from his {{subsequent}} solo career. On release, McCartney described it as [...] "very nice", adding: [...] "The guitar solo is ace <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the time changes." [...] Billboard magazine's reviewer wrote: [...] "Harrison's voice and sweet, country tinged guitar work within a rippling but controlled rhythm base, lends itself to this plea for human understanding.

[...] In Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden lauded the song for its [...] "strong, short-phrased melody whose lyrics are sheer exhortation", {{and said that the}} single was [...] "every bit as good as 'My Sweet Lord'".|$|E
