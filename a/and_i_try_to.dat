Jacqui deals with the sisters in a different way and can get different responses from the sisters. Cooper describes her as always being there to pick up the pieces for her family. She also states that Jacqui is very loyal and the most loyal character out of the McQueen family. Speaking of Jacqui's time away from forefront plots Cooper has said: [...] "I think that Jacqui's one of those characters who, if she isn't on screen for a while, it takes the audience time to warm to her again. But when they do, they find her funny, they find her interesting <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> give them as much as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we really see George as the character we know and love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E

500|$|When writing lyrics for {{previous}} releases, Moore would [...] "start mumbling <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{figure out}} what I'm saying {{and then try to}} make it make sense". With Blood, he [...] "really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent. I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables. And if you can write some words and lyrics that match that, sometimes it flows really well." [...] He described all the songs as based on [...] "personal experiences". [...] "I'll start writing a song that has {{a little bit of a}} world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." ...|$|E

Filmed in five days, {{this is the last}} mainstream film Wood directed, although it has grindhouse elements. The movie contains an [...] "eerily prescient" [...] scene, in which Carl Anthony's character states, [...] "I look at this slush, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> remember, at one time, I made good movies." [...] Ironically, Wood's own career would soon spiral downward into a blur of [...] "smut racket" [...] nudie flicks, softcore pornography and end with X-rated novels and films.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{his writing}} style, Abbey states: [...] "I {{write in a}} {{deliberately}} provocative and outrageous manner because I like to startle people. I hope to wake up people. I {{have no desire to}} simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write in a style that's entertaining as well as provocative. It's hard for me to stay serious {{for more than half a}} page at a time." [...] Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to [...] "speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic".|$|E

Among his statements, {{he also said that}} he looked upon his past steroid use with regret, noting that he had suffered mentally and physically as a direct result. While still working as a coach, he had used these experiences in order to warn the next generation of athletes of the dangers of drug use: [...] "I give people the examples of individuals that I have known that have gotten sick from the use of steroids <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> come across and give the kids the message, 'Look, you're going to pay the price at some point in time.|$|E

Mangan and Ashfield had previously worked together early in their careers, providing voices for an animated series of Watership Down. Ashfield claimed that on set, she [...] "struggled to keep a straight face most of the time." [...] She also said that her part made her more aware of her health.

Some people listen to a song for years and don't know what the lyric is." [...] In 1965 while listening to “Violets For Your Furs” by Billie Holiday, Alexandria said:"There’s not too much left to say about Billie Holiday, {{how is it possible}} for a woman to be this great? This comes from a period when she wasn’t supposed to be singing too well but I’ve never heard anything by her that I didn’t realize what she was feeling which is very important regardless of the shape of the pipes or what may be happening [...] She always got the message across. She never failed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Queensrÿche is {{the first}} album by the band to feature a vocalist other than Tate, {{sparking}} concerns with some fans that the sound will be too drastically {{different from what they}} were used to. New vocalist La Torre said in a late March 2013 interview that Tate always was [...] "a huge inspiration" [...] to him as a fan of the band, and he always tries to honor what Tate did vocally: [...] "I try to represent [...] {{to the best of my}} ability, but I also do put [...] a little bit of my flavor, which is a little edgier and a little grittier at times, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be authentic but me at the same time." [...] La Torre especially sought to provide a [...] "common thread" [...] in the vocals, that he felt was missing from the previous few records released by Queensrÿche.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, Shakira {{said about}} her tenth album: [...] "I {{already started to}} write new material. I've begun to explore in the {{recording}} studio whenever I have time in Barcelona and here in Miami. I'm working with different producers and DJs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> feed off from that and find new sources of inspiration and new musical motivation.

In February 2012, Shakira revealed a picture of herself, LMFAO and Akon working in the studio together, it was also revealed she was working with other producers such as Benny Blanco, Tiësto, RedOne, Max Martin, Dr. Luke.

2500|$|The ADE 651 {{consists}} of a swivelling antenna mounted via a hinge to a plastic handgrip. It requires no battery or other power source; its manufacturer claimed that it is powered solely by the user's static electricity. To use the device, the operator must walk {{for a few moments}} to [...] "charge" [...] it before holding it at right angles to the body. After a substance-specific [...] "programmed substance detection card" [...] is inserted, the device is supposed to swivel in the user's hand to point its antenna {{in the direction of the}} target substance. The cards are claimed to be designed to [...] "tune into" [...] the [...] "frequency" [...] of a particular explosive or other substance named on the card. According to Husam Muhammad, an Iraqi police officer and user of the ADE 651, using the device properly is more of an art than a science: [...] "If we are tense, the device doesn't work correctly. I start slow, and relax my body, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> clear my mind." [...] The cards were supposedly [...] "programmed" [...] or [...] "activated" [...] by being placed in a jar for a week along with a sample of the target substance to absorb the substance's [...] "vapours". Initially, McCormick reportedly used his own blood to [...] "program" [...] the cards for detecting human tissue, but eventually gave up even the pretense of [...] "programming" [...] them when demand for the devices was at its peak.|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
