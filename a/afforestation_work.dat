Above all, it stirred up the existing civil society in India, which began to address the issues of tribal and marginalized people. Today, beyond the eco-socialism hue, it is being seen increasingly as an ecofeminism movement. Although many of its leaders were men, women were not only its backbone, but also its mainstay, because they were the ones most affected by the rampant deforestation, which led to a lack of firewood and fodder as well as water for drinking and irrigation. Over the years they also became primary stakeholders in a majority of the <b>afforestation</b> <b>work</b> that happened under the Chipko movement.In 1987, the Chipko movement was awarded the Right Livelihood Award.

In order to achieve the final purpose, were used large scale cartographic materials covering a period of over two centuries (1788 – 2006), which were processed and interpreted into GIS environment. The results showed a continuous reduction of forest area, which in the first period occupied nearly half of the total study area. The main causes of these changes are of anthropogenic order, gradually replacing forests with pastures, agricultural land or built-up perimeter.

The data set included 250 trees collected from 25 plantations between 1 and 12 years old, located in the Eastern Carpathians of Romania. The study shows that BCEFs decreased with increasing tree dimensions, following an exponential trend. In all proposed models the highest prediction was reached when both variables considered (i. e. root-collar diameter and height) were used together. However, used separately, height produced a slightly higher prediction compared to root-collar diameter. Stem volume was well predicted by both root-collar diameter and height. Anyway, a significant improvement in prediction resulted when both variables were used together. Stem wood density decreased sharply with the increase of the two tree dimensions used as variables...|$|R

The diversity of landscape units was used as the measure of landscape attractiveness. Landscape diversity analysis allows to establish the details related to specific parts of the road and the options for configuring the road environment. These options relate to the way the forest is managed and mainly involve aspects of infrastructure and cultivation. They include activities such as <b>afforestation</b> <b>work</b> and rebuilding the species composition of forest stands. According to the research, the lower the technical class of a road, the greater is the need to take action to adapt the structural-tree stand system to meet the safety requirements of road users.

40|$|Goieşti commune is attested from 1577 on 28 July in a {{document}} issued {{by a big}} ban of Craiova and includes 13 villages. Name of the village comes from the name given its first inhabitant, namely "Goieşteanu" name which today {{does not appear to}} any inhabitant of the village, however is the most inhabitants from the neighboring village Simnicu de Sus. Goieşti village is situated in the hilly Getic Plateau, is crossed from south to north the hills of Oltenia. The climate is specific to the hills and plains of Romania, with harsh winters and dry summers with high temperatures. The average annual temperature in the area is between 10 ˚ C and 11 ˚ C. The average January temperature is between - 2 and - 3 ˚ C and average July temperature is between 20 ˚ C and 21 ˚ C. The value of mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 - 600 mm. Vegetation consists of oak forests, acacia and meadow coppices Amaradiei prevail. The soil in the area is predominantly by brown-red. The population of Goieşti 3118 inhabitants is dispersed in 13 villages: Adâncata, Goieşti, Gruita, Malaiesti Mogoşeşti, Muiereni, Pioreşti, Pometeşti, Popeasa, Ţăndărei, Vladimir, Zlătaru. The population consists of 1814 inhabitant female and male residents 1304, children and adolescents under 18 years representing 718 inhabitants. There are no industry in the area, most people of working age is employed in Craiova, in various areas: industry, services, other areas. Agriculture is the main occupation of the inhabitants, usually the first-past youth. Young people are not really interested in this branch, because the land is less productive to the lowlands and hence is not as pleased. However agricultural land is cultivated at a rate of approx. 80 - 90 % due to Romanian and foreign investors mostly leased land and their works. Forestry occupies an important place locality surrounded by forests of oak and locust, and on the river Amaradia there are riverside coppices.

The works included building-technical works (check dams) and biological <b>works</b> (<b>afforestation</b> and grassing of bare lands and other erosion risk areas).

40|$|Weed {{control is}} {{essential}} for a successful establishment and growth of tree seedlings in former agricultural land. Weed control methods are effective but can be costly in terms of time, damage to nontarget vegetation, or increased soil erosion. Alternatively, some living mulches can exclude undesirable vegetation, protect the soil, compete minimally with associated trees, and supplement soil nitrogen, {{but there is a}} lack of knowledge on living mulch systems in Mediterranean afforestation. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects on Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus L.), wild olive (Olea europaea L. var. sylvestris Brot.) and terebinth (Pistacia terebinthus L.) seedlings of wrinkled medick (Medicago rugosa Desr.) mulch. Survival, growth, photosynthesis, foliar nutrient and soil parameters were measured during the first year. 36 months after planting, seedlings in the living mulch had survival rates of between 60 % for mastic tree and 8. 3 % for Holm oak, compared with survival rates of 70 % in the mechanical treatment for mastic tree and 2 % for Holm oak. Photosynthesis and foliar nutrient concentrations were improved by the living mulch treatment. The soil under the living mulch had higher CEC, soil organic matter levels and nitrogen content in comparison to the cultivated soil. The response of living mulch differs between species and environmental conditions but our study suggests a positive effect due to soil protection. Living mulch may be a promise alternative for use in Mediterranean <b>afforestation</b> programs.

40|$|My thesis {{research}} concerns Thomas Charles George Weston (1866 - 1935). Its principal {{focus is}} his landscape vision for Australia's national capital in its founding days and his innovative horticultural and arboricultural {{work in that}} vision's execution. Between 1913 and 1926 his work involved reversing, by afforestation planting and conservation measures, the existing process of degradation of the site's landscape. He also achieved for the new city a densely planted landscape using indigenous and exotic trees and shrubs. Weston's pioneering work made {{a significant contribution to}} Canberra's contemporary 'city in the landscape' image. Part of my research is about understanding the context of Weston's earlier professional experiences in Britain and New South Wales in the period 1878 to 1912. A brief insight into his personal life and career shows how the people he worked for, the skills he acquired, and the type of landscapes he worked in shaped his approach to his landscape activity at Canberra. Of particular note are the valuable influences of David Thomson and Joseph Maiden, respected figures in botany and horticulture in Britain and Australia respectively. My research on Weston's achievements in Canberra demonstrates his technical and professional thoroughness. I have documented all his work on a project-by-project basis to provide accurate reference material for on-going professional practice and research. His <b>afforestation</b> and conservation <b>work</b> from 1913 onwards and his urban planting in the crucial 1921 to 1926 period reflects the depth of his training and skills and understanding of landscape. Analyses of disputes between Weston and others including Walter Burley Griffin demonstrate the soundness of his professional judgment. I have concluded that Charles Weston had a clear vision of what he wanted to achieve, the necessary skills and experience to achieve that vision and a thorough understanding of the national capital site. He also possessed the necessary personal qualities to achieve his vision which responded sensitively to the aspirations of Australians for their national capital. Largely because of Weston Canberra will remain a highly significant step in the development of Australian landscape architecture...|$|R
