5|$|After the storm, the Government of Queensland {{declared}} the Cairns {{area as a}} natural disaster <b>area.</b> <b>About</b> week later, the Cabinet supported a measure by Minister for Primary Industries, Vic Sullivan, to offer low-interest loans to farmer who lost significant amounts of crops and livestock. Later, Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen requested aid from the national government. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser approved low-interest loans up to $25,000 (1979AUD) for small businesses and the implementation of other measures for recovery.|$|E
5|$|Farther {{north in}} Rhode Island, 10,000people fled from the coast. Despite {{evacuation}} orders, {{nearly half of}} the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave their homes and as a result martial law was implemented to get people to leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the <b>area.</b> <b>About</b> 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the extreme intensity of the cyclone, relatively little structural damage resulted from it. No injuries {{were reported to have}} occurred during the storm's existence and losses were estimated to be A$6.6 million (US$5.1million). However, severe environmental damage took place. In the Northern Territory, an <b>area</b> <b>about</b> 7,000km2 (4,300mi2) was defoliated by Monica's high wind gusts. In response to the large loss of forested area, it was stated that it would take several hundred years for the area to reflourish.|$|E

5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy any remaining U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still {{did not know where}} Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the <b>area</b> <b>about</b> 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E

5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the <b>area.</b> <b>About</b> a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
5|$|Due to Paula's small size, {{impact in}} Mexico was minor, mainly limited to light {{rainfall}} and winds. However, an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel. After Paula attained its peak intensity on October13, wind shear began to increase, causing the storm to weaken. The storm turned north-northeastward {{and fell to}} tropical storm intensity on October14. Shortly thereafter, Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río. Early on October15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure <b>area</b> <b>about</b> six hours later. In Cuba, rainfall was mostly beneficial. Strong winds, with gusts reaching 68mph (109km/h), left power outages in Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. In the Havana area, a few homes were deroofed, while falling trees blocked many roads. Impact in the Florida Keys was minimal, limited to light rainfall and increased tides.|$|E

5|$|In June 1988 the {{producer}} Tim Taylor invited Aston {{to work on}} a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called Time Signs, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the <b>area</b> <b>about</b> to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries in the Landscape but his publisher, Batsford, had insisted on the shorter title.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the disaster, Luis A. Ferré, the Governor of Puerto Rico, {{declared a state of emergency}} over the whole island, asking for $10 million (1970 USD) in federal aid. On October12, two days after the rains subsided, President Richard Nixon declared the territory as a disaster area. Ferre also appeared in a telethon to raise funds for the homeless. The National Guard, the Red Cross, and other volunteer groups helped the displaced persons. In all, the disaster was described as one of the worst in Puerto Rico history. The Governor of the Virgin Islands, Melvin Evans, requested aid similar to Puerto Rico, and that territory was also declared a federal disaster <b>area</b> <b>about</b> a week after the rains ended. The heavy rainfall in the Virgin Islands caused a marked dinoflagellate algal bloom in the days after the rains ended.|$|E
5|$|Paleo-Indians {{visited the}} <b>area</b> <b>about</b> 12,000 {{years ago but}} did not leave much archaeological {{evidence}}. Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie, west of the lava field. Stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel were used to protect campsites from the dry summer wind. No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group. A hunting and gathering culture, the Northern Shoshone pursued elk, bears, American bison, cougars, and bighorn sheep— all large game who no longer range the area. The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2,100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the Shoshone people. Shoshone legend speaks of a serpent on a mountain who, angered by lightning, coiled around and squeezed the mountain until liquid rock flowed, fire shot from cracks, and the mountain exploded.|$|E

5|$|Passing roughly 345mi (555km) {{northeast}} of the Leeward Islands on September17, Igor gradually weakened as it experienced increased wind shear and dry air intrusion. Over the following several days, the storm became exceedingly large, with tropical storm-force winds covering an <b>area</b> <b>about</b> 865mi (1,390km) wide. Due to an overestimated bias in Igor's intensity, forecasts from the NHC showed that the storm would strike Bermuda as a major hurricane. However, weakening was more marked than anticipated {{and by the time}} its center neared the territory on September20, winds decreased to 75mph (120km/h). Igor made its closest approach to Bermuda around 0230UTC, passing roughly 40mi (65km) to the west-northwest.|$|E

5|$|The next day, troops {{pulled back}} away from Tikrit to {{the nearby town of}} Dijla, south of the city, in an attempt to regroup after meeting stiff resistance. Fighting also {{continued}} near the university and around the air base, which had reportedly come under army control. During the day's battles, another Iraqi army helicopter was shot down over the city and crashed near a market, while the army sent tanks to join the fighting at the university. An Iraqi army spokesman claimed 70militants had been killed in Tikrit in the previous 24 hours and that the government forces were in control of the university.
