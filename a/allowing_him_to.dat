5|$|The game {{offers a}} number of {{traditional}} Mario items, such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Starman, along with new power-ups that bestow special suits onto Mario and grant him new abilities. Returning from Super Mario Bros. 3 is the Super Leaf power-up, which gives Mario the Tanooki suit, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> float {{in the air and}} attack with his tail, with a later variant also <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> transform into a statue upon performing a ground pound. The player is able to reserve an extra power-up, which can be retrieved by tapping the item visible on the touchscreen.|$|E
5|$|The {{law does}} not leave the {{claimant}} without remedy by <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> recover the economic losses that are directly consequential upon physical damage.|$|E
5000|$|Erik now has turbo boots which <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> jump {{much higher}} than before and can smash certain {{overhead}} walls with his turbo jump. The helmet also <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> swim.|$|R
50|$|<b>To</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{get some}} first-team {{experience}} {{before heading to}} the United States for a scholarship, Lewis Hawke was released <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sign on amateur terms at Annan Athletic.|$|R
50|$|Overthrow's armored battlesuit's primary {{weapon was}} its cybernetic cesta, which <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hurl {{explosive}} spheres with superhuman accuracy and velocity. The suit also gave Beck {{a degree of}} protection and <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly.|$|R
5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> move into the society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after {{he was hired by}} Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E

50|$|While {{conceding that}} Marinol can be {{effective}} for treatment of hypertension and would <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> travel briefly without medical marijuana, it does not <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have an acceptable quality of life, Kubby said.|$|R
50|$|Jonathan Drew {{has limited}} powers of telepathy, which <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sense emotions, read minds (only surface thoughts), and telekinesis, which <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly, {{generate}} force fields, and lift heavy objects through force of mind alone.|$|R
50|$|Zen's {{other mental}} {{abilities}} <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> dematerialize food with his mind {{so that he}} can eat—allows <b>him</b> <b>to</b> communicate with his mentors on distant planets—and even <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> move objects through the air, including making himself hover while he meditates.|$|R
5|$|Hugh {{obtained}} {{an exemption}} <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> keep his castle at Northallerton in Yorkshire when Henry was ordering {{the destruction of}} most of the illegal castles that had been built during King Stephen's reign.

50|$|Red Nine has no superpowers but wears {{a costume}} that <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly {{and gives him}} superhuman strength. The costume also <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{generate}} a force field that protects him from harm, and shoot energy bolts.|$|R
5000|$|The Nth {{metal in}} Hawkman's wings, belt, harness, and boots is {{controlled}} mentally and <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> defy gravity. His wings <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> control flight, though {{they can be}} [...] "flapped" [...] through use of shoulder motions.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to his spacecraft the Pax Romana, Marcus' advanced suit of alien armor <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly, grants <b>him</b> superhuman strength and speed, and <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> generate an energy blade, similar to a lightsaber, and an energy shield.|$|R
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the extent to which the Renaissance {{improved}} on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance towards the modern age. Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> see clearly.|$|E
5|$|After Ottawa {{lost the}} Stanley Cup to the Montreal Wanderers in 1906, McGee retired at just 23years old. His {{retirement}} {{is attributed to}} his government position not <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> travel. He had briefly retired after his brother Jim's death in 1904. McGee retired after scoring 135 goals in only 45games (both league and challenge). Only Russell Bowie rivals his average of 3 goals per game.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
50|$|Pulisic is {{a modern-day}} number 10. His low {{center of gravity}} <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> dribble at high speeds. Recently, he has played more of a winger role for Dortmund. His adept weak foot skills <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play {{on either side of}} the field.|$|R
5000|$|Grey: Grey's passive {{abilities}} <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> walk farther in one turn {{than most}} other characters, and his spear <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> strike two enemies at the same time.

50|$|He was {{released}} by Richmond in August 2013 <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to England.|$|R
5|$|An {{analogy is}} also made between Gawain's {{trial and the}} Biblical test that Adam {{encounters}} in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become a better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.|$|E
5|$|At SummerSlam in 1999 Jarrett faced D'Lo Brown. During the match, Debra and Brown's former tag-team partner Mark Henry {{interfered}} on Jarrett's behalf, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> win {{both the}} European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship. The following night, Jarrett awarded Henry the European title and gave Debra an assistant, Miss Kitty. At Unforgiven on September 26, Debra turned on Jarrett {{and hit him}} {{over the head with}} a guitar {{in the middle of his}} match against Chyna for the Intercontinental Championship. Chyna pinned Jarrett, but referee Tom Prichard overturned the decision due to Debra's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Briggs {{uses his}} CIA {{credentials}} to have Fisher {{sent to the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> continue interrogating Nouri. Nouri confirms that Sadiq {{is head of the}} Engineers, and says that Sadiq knows the identities of the Fourth Echelon leaders. Escaping from the prison, Briggs and Fisher reach the Paladin in Yucatán and escape when the plane is attacked by a Mexican drug cartel. Fourth Echelon restarts the plane with Kobin's help, and Sadiq executes a Blacklist attack on the largest U.S. gas reserve in Louisiana.|$|E
50|$|In World Heroes Perfect, every {{character}} has an ABC Special Move {{that can be}} activated by pressing the A, B, and C buttons at the same time. Moves vary by character, though they all require strategic use and are easy to activate, allowing for more tactical battles. For example, the character Fuuma's ABC Special <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fake a special move; J. Max's ABC Special <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> catch, hold onto, and throw back projectiles; and Kim Dragon's ABC Special <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> perform counters while blocking.|$|R
50|$|His {{knowledge}} of chemistry, learnt during his university studies, <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> undertake research on photographic toning {{in the late}} 1970s. This <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be amongst the first photographers in Italy {{to become involved in}} the study of colour, freeing himself from the predominance of black-and-white photography.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{he moved}} to Pandharpur. The {{traditional}} story is that the upper castes here did not <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> enter the temple, nor did they <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stand {{in the door of}} the temple. So he built a hut {{on the other side of}} the river Chandrabhaga.|$|R
5|$|Clippard {{was drafted}} in the ninth round of the 2003 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, with the 274th overall selection, by the New York Yankees. Though he had signed a National Letter of Intent {{in the fall of}} 2002 to attend the University of South Florida on a {{baseball}} scholarship, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play college baseball for the South Florida Bulls, he chose to turn professional due to his draft position and the opportunity to play for the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Cody {{signed a}} four-year, $3.385 million maximum value {{contract}} with the Ravens on July 26, 2010. In training camp at McDaniel College, Cody—along with veteran cornerback Walt Harris—failed their conditioning test for the Ravens, and were thus placed on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. He eventually passed the conditioning test on his third try, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go to training camp for the Ravens.|$|E
5|$|Gelimer {{was given}} an ample estate in Galatia, {{and would have been}} raised to patrician rank if he had not steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith. Belisarius was also named consul ordinarius for the year 535, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{celebrate}} a second triumphal procession, being carried through the streets seated on his consular curule chair, held aloft by Vandal warriors, distributing largesse to the populace from his share of the war booty.|$|E
2500|$|Lavoisier {{gained a}} vast {{majority}} of his income through buying stock in the General Farm, which <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work on science full-time, live comfortably, and <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> contribute financially to better the community.
