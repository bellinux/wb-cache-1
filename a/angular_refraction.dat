Based on the theory of diffractive scintillation, the composite structure function of phase fluctuations covering a large range of turbulence scales was constructed. We found that the spectrum is well described by a power law with n = 3. 5 for scales from 10 (6) to 10 (9) m, which differs from the value known for a Kolmogorov spectrum. We can, however, within the accuracy of our data not exclude a Kolmogorov spectrum. It became also clear that <b>angular</b> <b>refraction</b> of emission {{must be taken into account}} to fit the data points at all observing frequencies.

40|$|Much {{work has}} been done over the past 10 years on the {{concentration}} of solar radiation using a variety of devices. To concentrate the light, photons from a larger area are collected and directed to a smaller area. Some devices use geometrical optics, or a change in index of refraction to increase the illumination on a surface above the incident solar level. Other systems use a frequency or Stokes shift to increase the illumination of light at one photon energy at the expense of another. There is often confusion as to the concentration limit imposed by basic physical laws on these different ypes of systems. Presented is a unification of the ideas and principles developed for the various classifications of concentrators. Equations are developed that describe the limits of concentration i geometrical and fluorescent systems. Concentration is shown to be a function of the index of <b>refraction,</b> <b>angular</b> collection range, as well as the frequency shift. Applications of the ideas involve the understanding of diffuse radiation concentrators and the solar powered laser. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractApplications {{involving}} {{non-destructive testing}} or acoustical imaging {{are more and}} more sophisticated. In this context, a model based on the angular spectrum approach is tackled in view to calculate the focused impulse field radiated by a linear transducer through a plane fluid-solid interface. It is well known that electronic focusing, based on a cylindrical delay law, like for the classical cases (lenses, curved transducer), leads to an inaccurate focusing in the solid due to geometric aberrations errors affecting refraction. Generally, there is {{a significant difference between the}} acoustic focal distance and the geometrical focal due to refraction. In our work, an optimized delay law, based on the Fermat's principle is established, particularly at an oblique incidence where the geometrical considerations, relatively simple in normal incidence, become quickly laborious. Numerical simulations of impulse field are judiciously carried out. Subsequently, the input parameters are optimally selected in order to achieve good computation accuracy and a high focusing. The overall results, involving compression and shear waves, have highlighted the focusing improvement in the solid when compared to the currently available approaches. Indeed, the acoustic focal distance is very close to geometrical focal distance and then, allows better control of the refracted <b>angular</b> beam profile (<b>refraction</b> angle, focusing depth and focal size) ...|$|R

40|$|A short {{description}} is given of each ionospheric {{total electron content}} (TEC) effect upon radio waves, along with a representative value {{of the magnitude of}} each of these effects under normal ionospheric conditions. A discussion is given of the important characteristics of average ionospheric TEC behavior and the temporal and spatial variability of TEC. Radio waves undergo several effects when they pass through the Earth's ionosphere. One of {{the most important of these}} effects is a retardation, or group delay, on the modulation or information carried on the radio wave that is due to its encounter with the free, thermal electrons in the Earth's ionosphere. Other effects the ionosphere has on radio waves include: radio frequency (RF) carrier phase advance; Doppler shift of the RF carrier of the radio wave; Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization of linearly polarized waves; <b>angular</b> <b>refraction</b> or bending of the radio wave path as it travels through the ionosphere; and amplitude and phase scintillations...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals that are reflected off the surface, {{along with the}} reception of direct GNSS signals, offers {{a unique opportunity to}} monitor water level variations over land and ocean. The time delay between the reception of the direct and reflected signals gives access to the altitude of the receiver over the reflecting surface. The field of view of the receiver is highly dependent on both the orbits of the GNSS satellites and the configuration of the study site geometries. A simulator has been developed to determine the location of the reflection points on the surface accurately by modeling the trajectories of GNSS electromagnetic waves that are reflected by the surface of the Earth. Only the geometric problem was considered using a specular reflection assumption. The orbit of the GNSS constellation satellites (mainly GPS, GLONASS and Galileo), and the position of a fixed receiver, are used as inputs. Four different simulation modes are proposed, depending on the choice of the Earth surface model (local plane, osculating sphere or ellipsoid) and the consideration of topography likely to cause masking effects. <b>Angular</b> <b>refraction</b> effects derived from adaptive mapping functions are also taken into account. This simulator was developed to determine where the GNSS-R receivers should be located to monitor a given study area efficiently. In this study, two test sites were considered: the first one {{at the top of the}} 65 m Cordouan lighthouse in the Gironde estuary, France, and the second one on the shore of Lake Geneva (50 m above the reflecting surface), at the border between France and Switzerland. This site is hidden by mountains in the south (orthometric altitude up to 2000 m), and overlooking the lake in the north (orthometric altitude of 370 m). For this second test site configuration, reflections occur until 560 m from the receiver. The planimetric (arc length) differences (or altimetric difference as WGS 84 ellipsoid height) between the positions of the specular reflection points obtained considering the Earth's surface as an osculating sphere or as an ellipsoid were found to be on average 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles greater than 10 °, and 13. 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles between 5 and 10 °. The altimetric and planimetric differences between the plane and sphere approximations are on average below 1. 4 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles greater than 10 ° and below 6. 2 cm (or 2. 4 mm) for satellite elevation angles between 5 and 10 °. These results are the means of the differences obtained during a 24 h simulation with a complete GPS and GLONASS constellation, and thus depend on how the satellite elevation angle is sampled over the day of simulation. The simulations highlight the importance of the digital elevation model (DEM) integration: average planimetric differences (or altimetric) with and without integrating the DEM (with respect to the ellipsoid approximation) were found to be about 6. 3 m (or 1. 74 m), with the minimum elevation angle equal to 5 °. The correction of the <b>angular</b> <b>refraction</b> due to troposphere on the signal leads to planimetric (or altimetric) differences of an approximately 18 m (or 6 cm) maximum for a 50 m receiver height above the reflecting surface, whereas the maximum is 2. 9 m (or 7 mm) for a 5 m receiver height above the reflecting surface. These errors increase deeply with the receiver height above the reflecting surface. By setting it to 300 m, the planimetric errors reach 116 m, and the altimetric errors reach 32 cm for satellite elevation angles lower than 10 °. The tests performed with the simulator presented in this paper highlight the importance of the choice of the Earth's representation and also the non-negligible effect of <b>angular</b> <b>refraction</b> due to the troposphere on the specular reflection point positions.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{variability}} of peripheral refraction in a population of 43 subjects with low foveal refractive errors. METHODS: A scan of the refractive error in the vertical pupil meridian of the right eye of 43 subjects (age range, 18 to 80 years, foveal spherical equivalent, < ± 2. 5 diopter) over the central ± 45 ° of the visual field was performed using a recently developed <b>angular</b> scanning photorefractor. <b>Refraction</b> profiles across the visual field were fitted with four different models: (1) "flat model" (refractions about constant across the visual field), (2) "parabolic model" (refractions follow about a parabolic function), (3) "bi-linear model" (linear change of refractions with eccentricity from the fovea to the periphery), and (4) "box model" ("flat" central area with a linear change in refraction from a certain peripheral angle). Based on the minimal residuals of each fit, the subjects were classified {{into one of the}} four models. RESULTS: The "box model" accurately described the peripheral refractions in about 50 % of the subjects. Peripheral refractions in six subjects were better characterized by a "linear model," in eight subjects by a "flat model," and in eight by the "parabolic model. " Even after assignment to one of the models, the variability remained strikingly large, ranging from - 0. 75 to 6 diopter in the temporal retina at 45 ° eccentricity. CONCLUSIONS: The most common peripheral refraction profile (observed in nearly 50 % of our population) was best described by the "box model. " The high variability among subjects may limit attempts to reduce myopia progression with a uniform lens design and may rather call for a customized approach...|$|R
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is {{the general}} process of creating cross-sectional or tomographic image from projections (line integrals) of the object at multiple angles and using a computer for image reconstruction. If unmodified, the term CT generally implies images made from projections measured by transmission of X rays (X-ray computed tomography). The mathematical foundation of computed tomography was initially derived by Radon and published in 1917. However, {{it was not until}} the development of modern computers that the technique was at all viable. The first commercial CT scanner based on the prototype developed by Godfrey Hounsfield consisted of an X-ray source and two detectors, with a third, reference, detector near the X-ray source. In the last years alternative x-ray imaging techniques, other than the conventional absorption contrast were rapidly developing by various group of scientists in many working laboratories all over the world. Growing availability of the synchrotron light sources for wide range of users accelerated the development of the x-ray imaging techniques abruptly. Besides attenuation, x-ray refraction and shift of the electromagnetic wave phase occurs in an x-ray beam passing through an object. The widely used imaging techniques is based on the <b>angular</b> resolved (or <b>refraction)</b> contrast on which we concentrate in this work. As it follows from the definition it arises when an x-ray penetrated through an object deflects certain angle. In other words this contrast is proportional to the deviation angle which x-ray beam accumulates when it penetrates through an object and refracts on its boundaries. The emerging x-rays present characteristic angular deflections, which are on the microradian scale. Different refraction directions can be resolved by using an angular analyzer, for instance a perfect crystal, which can then be revealed by a detector placed behind it. By varying the alignment of the analyzer with regard to the incoming x-ray beam, the unrefracted x-rays can either be recorded on a detector or rejected thus, either contributing or not contributing to the image contrast. The x-ray refraction contrast can greatly exceed the absorption contrast for instance in imaging low Z materials, where the potentialities of the technique have been exploited from the beginning. An analyzer-based imaging technique has been presented in various versions also assuming different names. An important variation based on an algorithm that differentiates the separation of the refraction contrast from the absorption contrast in an image, has been introduced with the name 2 ̆ 7 diffraction enhanced imaging 2 ̆ 7 (DEI). The interest in the potential medical application of the diffraction imaging technique has given origin to many projects utilizing analyzer-based refraction imaging. Initiated with conventional x-ray generators, it has been rapidly developed in synchrotron radiation sites thanks to the highly intense collimated beams available that permit fast projection and tomographic imaging. Thus this work is the attempt to accumulate the information on the different implementations of the refraction contrast and prepare the CT-reconstruction of the refraction index field inside an object. Due to the success in this field I can state that it is the first known presentation of the complete solution of the problem. The CT-reconstruction performed from the refraction contrast promises the same advantages over the one based on the absorption contrast that the refraction contrast provides in comparison to other contrasts. The main of these advantages are i) possibility to observe the materials with low Z in higher energies, for example the soft tissue of the human body and ii) visualization of a tiny inclusions which are unobservable in the conventional absorption or phase-shift contracts, for example the cracks and defects in materials. The advantages automatically suggest to the ranges of applicability of this new method varying from medical applications of the synchrotron radiation up to material structure science. Once this work trying to cover all aspects of the problem of the 3 D reconstruction of the object inner structure from the refraction contrast it consists of three main parts: the theoretical consideration of the question, experimental implementation and finally the discussion of the results acquired in the experiment and processed in accordance with the theory. All three parts are structured trough and logically connected to each other in order to make the understanding easier and smoother to the reader. We can state that the goal was achieved. The model of penetration of the x-ray was assumed and the theory for the computed tomography reconstruction was built on the base of the model. The algorithm for the reconstruction was implemented in the accordance with the theoretical model. The software which utilizes the algorithm was written and debugged. The problem of the information about the deflection angle distribution from the distribution of the intensity at the detector was considered from different points of view. Several types of the analyzing devices that can provide the intensity distribution were considered. The devices were tested in experiment in order to judge about their applicability for the particular problem. After the test the judgment was done and the chosen device was studied in deep details which resulted into development of new method of extraction the information about the deflection of the x-ray. Actually, the method is modernization and generalization of the previously used one. However it allows to overcome the limits of the present method and makes the limitations on the sensitivity approximately 4 times wider. This great advantage allows us to state that the method developed is principally new. The theoretical base for the new method was built. It was tested in the experiment ad proved its usability. Then the experiment on the data acquisition for the CT-reconstruction which utilized the newly developed method of the refraction angle extraction was performed. The resulted of the experiment were processed by the software prepared for the CT-reconstruction from the refraction contrast. The results of the reconstruction are presented and discussed. The result allows us to conclude that the physical model chosen for the theoretical calculation is applicable and fits the problem. The proves of great advantage of the CT-reconstruction from the refraction contrast over the other types of contrasts developed by the current moment were provided and presented...|$|R
