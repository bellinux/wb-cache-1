The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above the upper deck and 2 inches thick below it.

Nine spars tested to 1 ton of load each. Like encountering a Junkers F.13, Bill Stout abandoned wood construction for metal corrugated skinning over a metal frame.|$|E
25|$|In 1790, Robert Cox started {{manufacturing}} fusee chains from {{workshops in}} the High Street, {{for use in}} the gearing mechanism of watches. The work was extremely intricate; the chains were only fourteen-hundredths of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick,</b> therefore children as young as nine, from the local workhouse (now the Red House Museum) were employed in their manufacture. The children were paid 1s 6d for a 70-hour week and from 1802 were being taught to read for 10 minutes each morning and afternoon.|$|E

25|$|Preparation for the patrols {{began in}} November, {{with all the}} ship's equipment, {{including}} masts, sails, rigging, boats, tackle, steering gear, pumps etc. being carefully inspected and repaired or renewed where necessary. New towing hawsers and heaving lines would also be procured. The ship would additionally be fitted over the cutwater with an iron, V-shaped icebreaker 3/8 of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> and extending 18inches {{above and below the}} waterline, secured by a number of heavy chains. Officers would discard their normal uniforms in preference for reefer jackets, fur cap and gloves.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} soft {{conversion}} {{was within the}} construction products industry (metricated 1969 and 1972) where certain products continue to be produced to with reference to Imperial trade names but made using metric dimensions in the factory; for example, a 13mm thick plasterboard is still often called 'half-inch', even though the measurement is rounded to a convenient metric size and so is now only approximately half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick.</b> The construction industry itself (which included civil engineering projects) {{was one of the}} leaders in the metrication programme, having drawn up a detailed plan in 1967 and completing the phase-over by the end 1972.|$|E

50|$|Tadeusz Kościuszko {{along with}} Thomas Machin {{designed}} a capstan for reeling in the chain. Kosciuszko also added the Lanthorn Battery at Gee's Point and the Knox Battery {{to cover the}} South Dock. The original iron chain, with one and <b>a</b> half <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> links, was replaced in 1778 with links two and <b>a</b> quarter <b>inches</b> <b>thick,</b> which were two feet long and weighed 140 pounds. Made by Peter Townsend's Stirling Iron Works in Warwick, New York, the 1500 foot long chain weighed 186 tons. Kept afloat on huge logs, forty men removed the chain in winter.|$|R

25|$|The MacAdam shield-shovel {{resembled the}} {{standard}} portable infantry spade of its day in both size and shape. In {{order to stop}} or deflect enemy fire, thicker steel {{was used in the}} construction of the blade; it measured at three-sixteenths of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick.</b> Heavy steel was also used to make the shovel's detachable handle which measured four feet in length. Unique to the shield-shovel was the inclusion of a 3.5 by 2 inch sight-hole in the blade. The shovel was intended to be used as a shield by folding the handle to ~90° toward the concave side of the blade, exposing the spike that ran along the handle opposite the blade. The spike would then be driven into the ground, resulting in the blade standing vertically and the handle resting on the ground behind it as a brace.|$|E
500|$|Brunel, {{anxious to}} ensure the {{avoidance}} of hogging in a vessel of such unprecedented size, designed the hull to be massively redundant in strength. Ten longitudinal iron girders were installed along the keel, running from beneath the engines and boiler to the forward section. The iron ribs were [...] in size. The iron keel plates were <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick,</b> and the hull seams were lapped and double riveted in many places. Safety features, which {{also contributed to the}} structural strength of the vessel, included a double bottom and five watertight iron bulkheads. The total amount of iron, including the engines and machinery, was 1,500tons.|$|E
500|$|With overall {{dimensions}} for {{the object of}} [...] high and [...] long, the man at least is close to life-size. The painted wooden shell forming both figures likely draws upon South Indian traditions of Hindu religious sculpture. It is typically about half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick,</b> and now much reinforced on the inside following bomb damage in World War II. There are many openings at the head end, formed to match {{the pattern of the}} inner part of the painted tiger stripes, which allow the sounds from the pipes within to be heard better, and the tiger is [...] "obviously male". The top part of the tiger's body can be lifted off to inspect the mechanics by removing four screws. The construction of the human figure is similar but the wood is much thicker. Examination and analysis by the V conservation department has determined that much of the current paint has been restored or overpainted.|$|E

2500|$|The Metrodome's {{air-supported roof}} was {{designed}} by the inventor of air-supported structures, David H. Geiger, through his New York-based Geiger Berger Associates, and manufactured and installed by Birdair Structures. An air-supported structure supported by positive air pressure, it required 250,000ft³/min (120 m³/s) of air to keep it inflated. The air pressure was supplied by twenty 90-horsepower fans. The roof was made of two layers: the outer layers were Teflon-coated fiberglass and the inner was a proprietary acoustical fabric. By design, the dead air space between the layers insulated the roof; in winter, warm air was blown into the space between layers to help melt snow that had accumulated on top. At {{the time it was}} built, the [...] of fabric made the roof the largest expanse ever done in that manner. The outside Teflon membrane was 1/32 of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> and the inner liner of woven fiberglass was 1/64 of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick.</b> The entire roof weighed roughly 580,000 pounds. It reached , or about 16 stories, at its highest point.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{recipe for}} potato chips is in William Kitchiner's cookbook The Cook's Oracle, {{first published in}} 1817, which was a bestseller in England and the United States. The 1822 edition's version of recipe 104 is called [...] "Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings" [...] and reads [...] "peel large potatoes, slice them {{about a quarter of}} <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick,</b> or cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping". Early recipes for potato chips in the United States are found in Mary Randolph's Virginia House-Wife (1824), and in N.K.M. Lee's Cook's Own Book (1832), both of which explicitly cite Kitchiner.|$|E
2500|$|The gang's armour {{was made}} of iron a quarter of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick,</b> each {{consisting}} of a long breast-plate, shoulder-plates, back-guard, apron and helmet. The helmet resembled a tin can without a crown, and included a long slit for the eyes. The suits' separate parts were strapped together on the body while the helmet was separate {{and sat on the}} shoulders, allowing it to be removed easily. Ned Kelly's armour weighed [...] His suit was the only one to have an apron at the back, but all four had front aprons. Padding is only known from Ned's armour and it is not clear if the other suits were similarly padded. Ned wore a padded skull cap and his helmet also had internal strapping so that his head could take some of the weight. After the shootout there were five bullet marks on the helmet, three on the breast-plate, nine on the back-plate, and one on the shoulder-plate. All four men wore oilskin coats over the armour.|$|E
2500|$|The goal of WALTA {{is to set}} up {{detectors}} {{at least}} 32 sites in the Seattle area, covering an area of 200 square kilometers. [...] This area would be large enough to detect events above the GZK cutoff. [...] The program hopes to fill in gaps in this area as the project matures. [...] Each location has four scintillation detectors which emit light when hit by charged particles. [...] Each paddle detectors is about <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> and covers approximately one square meter. [...] Each site would ideally put the detectors in a star formation with one detector in the middle and three surrounding it on a circle of 10m2 radius. [...] With this geometry, each site could detect 1015eV events. [...] Each site will attempt this layout as best possible given the site's own geography. [...] Each detector has a photomultiplier tube which multiplies the emitted light into a large electrical signal. [...] The signal from each detector paddle goes into a data acquisition card (DAQ) which is set to record an event based on a certain coincidence. [...] The DAQ card also has a GPS input. [...] The output of this card connects to a computer using a serial port and software counts the data with a GPS location and time stamp. [...] A site can upload the data to the WALTA server and data can be compared to see if events happen from the same shower. [...] The timing of events and the area covered tells the energy and location where the cosmic ray hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
