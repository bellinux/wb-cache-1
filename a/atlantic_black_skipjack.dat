40|$|Early life {{stages of}} tuna species were {{investigated}} {{along the northern}} coasts of Tunisia {{in the summer of}} 2010, from 7 to 14 July. A total of 74 stations, distributed on a regular grid, were sampled. Larvae of five tuna species were identified: the Atlantic bluefin tuna, the bullet tuna, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>black</b> <b>skipjack,</b> the Atlantic bonito and the albacore tuna. Larval distribution patterns show that Atlantic bluefin tuna and albacore tuna usually spawn in offshore oligotrophic waters and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> larvae on the continental shelf. The widespread distribution of bullet tuna larvae, suggests that it spawns on the entire continental shelf and over the shelf break. The results from the quotient analysis carried out to characterize the spawning habitat of each species, show that the input of recent surface Atlantic water (AW) masses {{play a key role in}} the spawning strategy of tuna species, particularly in the case of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, whose larvae were mainly caught in the mixed waters resulting from the interaction between recent AW and resident AW, as demonstrated by their preference for salinity values between 36. 9 and 37. 4...|$|E
40|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> (Euthynnus alletteratus Raf., 1810) {{caught in}} Turkish and North Cypriot waters {{is one of}} the members of the Scombridae, having a wide {{distribution}} in the world, especially in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and adjacent seas. It is a fish with commercial value for the Turkish and North Cypriot fisheries. E. alletteratus are mostly caught by purse-seiners in Turkish waters. In North Cypriot waters, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> are caught by trolling. In this study, the length frequency distribution and length-weight relationship of 63 specimens between 58 cm (2808 g) and 82. 5 cm (7192 g) caught in Turkish waters in 2003 - 2004 was determined. In addition, total of 41 specimens caught in North Cypriot waters in 2001 were sampled. The fishing methods, the areas of catch, the seasons of catch, and the legislative measures in Turkish and North Cypriot waters were also investigated. RÉSUMÉ La thonine (Euthynnus alletteratus Raf. 1810) est capturée dans les eaux turques et au Nord de Chypre; cette espèce appartient à la famille des Scombridés et se trouve largement répartie dans le monde, notamment dans l’océan Atlantique, la Méditerranée et ses mers adjacentes.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on the swordfish fishery in the Turkish Aegean Sea are presented. A total of 65 boats (6 - 14 m {{in length and}} 11. 5 - 135 hp in engine power) participated in this fishery from two main fishing ports, Sivrice and Fethiye, and the Datça-Bozburun Peninsula. This fishery is also carried out off Antalya Bay. The total annual swordfish catch was 425 t in 2005. The fishing period for swordfish normally takes place during eight months. However, the main activity is concentrated {{in the spring and}} summer seasons on moonless nights, because of the closed season (between October 1 and January 31) and adverse meteorological conditions. Although, there are various fishing gears and techniques for swordfish, the two main fishing gears used in the Aegean Sea are longline and driftnet. About ten non-target species, bluefin tuna, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>black</b> <b>skipjack,</b> albacore, Mediterranean spearfish, bullet tuna, dolphinfish, manta ray, sunfish, sharks and dolphins were determined from both longlining and drift-netting.

50|$|The little tunny's {{markings}} {{allow it}} to easily be distinguished from similar species. It is often confused with the skipjack tuna, the frigate tuna, the Atlantic bonito, and the bullet tuna. Close relatives also include the kawakawa and the <b>black</b> <b>skipjack.</b> The scattering of dark, fingerprint-like spots between the pectoral and pelvic fins cannot be found on any related Atlantic species. The first dorsal fin of the Atlantic bonito is also lower and sloping. Its lack of teeth on the vomer can set it apart from its close Pacific relatives, the kawakawa and the <b>black</b> <b>skipjack.</b> The dorsal fins of the bullet and frigate mackerel are set apart. Unlike the little tunny, the skipjack tuna lacks markings {{on the back and}} has broad, straight stripes on the underside.|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{distribution}} and {{ecology of the}} larvae of three tuna species (Thunnus thynnus, Auxis rochei and Euthynnus alletteratus) were studied during an ichthyoplankton survey {{carried out in the}} Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia) in June and July 2009. A total of 80 stations, distributed on a regular sampling grid, were sampled. The main objectives of this survey were to provide information on tuna larvae distribution in the Gulf of Gabes in relation to the environmental parameters. Regarding small tunas, larvae of A. rochei (bullet tuna) showed the more widespread distribution, being found at both inshore and offshore stations. E. alletteratus (<b>Atlantic</b> <b>black</b> <b>skipjack)</b> larvae were mainly found at the inshore stations covering the wide continental shelf of this region. On the other hand, larvae of the large migratory tuna T. Thynnus (Atlantic bluefin tuna), were mainly recorded at offshore stations, suggesting that spawning possibly takes place mainly near the shelf break. Regarding the biological and physical parameters examined, our results indicate that tuna larvae were mainly collected in oligotrophic and mixed waters resulting from the confluence of surface water of recent Atlantic origin and resident surface Mediterranean waters, as shown by their preference for lower chlorophyll a concentrations (from 1. 4 to 2. 5 mg m- 3) and moderate salinity values (between 37. 35 and 37. 75). Significantly, tuna larvae seemed to avoid the more eutrophic and saltier waters of the gulf situated very close to the coast and around Kerkennah and Djerba islands...|$|E
40|$|An {{oceanographic survey}} {{was carried out}} {{during the summer of}} 2009, from June 25 to July 3 in the Gulf of Gabes. The study area is {{characterized}} by a wide continental shelf. A plankton sampling scheme was carried out to study the structure of the larval fish assemblages that characterizes the surface mixed layer, and to assess the influence of the environmental parameters on their spatial distribution. A total of 36 taxa were identified, 3 classified to the level of genus, 5 to family and 28 to species. The majority of identified fish larvae belonged to demersal species, mainly picarel Spicara smaris (23. 76 % of the total larval fish abundance), followed by red mullet Mullus barbatus (14. 92 %) and several species of the Sparidae family (9. 15 %). Small pelagic species as Sardinella Sardinella aurita and European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus were also abundant (27. 75 %) and dominated the fish larvae community in offshore stations. Five large pelagic species were found among the larvae, including bullet tuna Auxis rochei, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> Euthynnus alletteratus, albacore Thunnus alalunga, swordfish Xiphias gladius and the highly migratory Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus. All these apex predator species appear in 38. 5 % of the sampling stations and contribute about 7. 9 % of the total larval catches. The larval fish assemblage of the Gulf of Gabes is predominantly composed of neritic species in correspondence with the shallow depths of the study area. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that larval distributions were mainly conditioned by depth. However, other factors, like hydrographic processes, play also a very important role in shaping the spatial pattern of larval fish distribution...|$|E

50|$|Today, the {{productive}} reef areas in Piñas Bay, fished by boats from the famous Tropic Star Lodge, {{and the many}} other reefs and islands along the Pacific coast of Panama, particularly Coiba Island in the Gulf of Chiriqui, still have probably the best fishing for black marlin in the Western Hemisphere. Black marlin averaging 200 to 500 lb hunt schools of rainbow runners, <b>black</b> <b>skipjack,</b> and other prey over these structures along with large Pacific sailfish and dorado. Occasional specimens will reach well over 600 lb. Slow trolling with bridle-rigged live skipjack is the predominant technique used to target black marlin by the Tropic Star fleet. At Coiba Island, the Hannibal Banks is among most productive areas where trolling lures is employed successfully.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{will engage}} in a historical-critical encounter with a peculiar subset of lived Christian traditions in the <b>black</b> <b>Atlantic</b> world, {{and the ways in}} which black theology as a disciplinary formation has only partly included these competing constructions of Christianity in their account of marginalized and marooned peoples. This project will do three things. First it will explore theoretically the construction of a <b>black</b> <b>Atlantic</b> world and re-establish a genealogy of lived Christian traditions in the <b>black</b> <b>Atlantic</b> world that takes seriously a set of movements emerging at the beginning of the twentieth century (primarily 1915 - 1955). These movements unsettled the monolithic depiction of the black church as western and primarily connected to a European or Euro-American theological tradition. The movements also help us to rethink the <b>black</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sphere as not simply the dispersion of African bodies to regions predominately bordering the Atlantic Ocean and the resulting demographic transformation of these new world spaces, but more appropriately as the collection of spaces (often exceeding the regions bordering the <b>Atlantic)</b> in which <b>black</b> cultures have been contested, shaped, and informed by the legacies of enslavement, colonialism, and capitalism/modernity. It is my contention that by using the lenses of the <b>black</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and scripturalizing to return to this important archive of <b>black</b> <b>Atlantic</b> religious traditions we not only have access to the variety of black Christian experiences in a transnational frame, but we are able to redefine the scope of black theology and more fully engage the complex performances of black religious traditions in the public sphere.
