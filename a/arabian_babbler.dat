50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler</b> (Turdoides squamiceps) is a {{passerine}} bird {{belonging to}} the genus Turdoides. It is a communally nesting resident bird of arid scrub in the Middle East which lives together in relatively stable groups with strict orders of rank.|$|E
5000|$|This {{selection}} for cooperation is even stronger if an individual's action in an interaction is observed by third-party individuals, {{for the possibility}} of forming a reputation arises. Amotz Zahavi, famous for his work with the altruistic <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler,</b> suggests that this level of [...] "social prestige" [...] will affect which individuals interact with one another and how they behave.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler</b> {{is one of}} the 26 {{species of}} the genus Turdoides that {{constitutes}} together with several other genera the family Leiothrichidae. The Leiothrichidae primarily occur in the Ethiopian and Oriental ecozones, but a few species of the genus Turdoides have penetrated into the Palearctic zone north of the tropics where they live in arid areas of North and East Africa, India and the Middle East.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1970s, Amotz Zahavi {{observed}} the babbler at length, {{giving rise to}} his theory of signal and its correlative, the handicap principle. Although babblers were considered particularly altruistic animals, Zahavi reinterpreted their behaviours according to his theory. Thus, Zahavi (1974) theorized that chick feeding by <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler</b> helpers acts as a signal by the helper to gain social prestige within the group.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler</b> {{prefers to}} settle along dry river beds with few trees and bushes. It {{is found in}} eastern, {{southern}} and western Arabia, occurring in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen and western Saudi Arabia but absent from the central and north-eastern parts of the peninsula. Its range extends north to Jordan, Israel and eastern Sinai. It inhabits arid scrubland and savanna, occurring up to 2800 metres above sea-level in Yemen.|$|E
50|$|Amotz Zahavi {{studied in}} {{particular}} the <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler,</b> a very social bird, with a life-length of 30 years, which was considered to have altruist behaviours. The helping-at-the-nest behavior often occurs among unrelated individuals, and therefore cannot be explained by kin selection. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviours according to his signal theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve its attractiveness to potential mates. The evolution of this condition {{may be explained by}} competitive altruism.|$|E
50|$|Zahavi is {{best known}} for his work on the {{handicap}} principle, which explains the evolution of characteristics, behaviors or structures that appear contrary to the principles of Darwinian evolution in that they appear to reduce fitness and endanger individual organisms. Evolved by sexual selection, these act as signals of the status of the organism, functioning to e. g. attract mates. He expanded it with theories on honest signalling and the idea that selection would favour signals that impose a higher cost, those that are not easily cheated on. He worked in particular on the <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler,</b> a long-lived and social bird with altruistic behaviour among unrelated individuals, not explainable by kin selection. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviours according to his signal theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve attractiveness to potential mates, a form of competitive altruism.|$|E
40|$|In {{many social}} birds there are sex {{differences}} in dispersal patterns, with males commonly remaining in their natal group whereas females typically disperse at adolescence. Group members may therefore increase their fitness by preferentially caring for offspring of a particular sex according to social circumstances. Although previous studies have focussed on intragroup social factors that may affect preferential care, we propose that the relative size of neighbouring groups is of primary importance. Here we show that in the cooperatively breeding <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler</b> (Turdoides squamiceps), parents preferentially feed male offspring when relative group size is small, and female offspring when group size is large. Unlike parents, helpers consistently favour young {{of the opposite sex}} to themselves, suggesting the risk of competition with members of the same sex for future breeding opportunities may override other considerations. These results emphasize the complexity of investment strategies in relation to social circumstances and the variable benefits of raising males vs. females in a species with sex-biased philopatry. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Dispersal {{attempts}} can {{be costly}} and may often end in failure. Individuals should therefore only disperse when the benefits of dispersal outweigh the costs. While previous research has focussed on aspects of the individual that may affect dispersal success, social factors may also influence dispersal outcomes. One way of achieving successful dispersal could be through cooperative, or coalition dispersal. I investigated this possibility in the cooperatively breeding <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler</b> Turdoides squamiceps. I found that coalition dispersal {{appears to be an}} effective strategy to ensure the success of dispersal attempts, with coalitions more successful than lone individuals at taking over the breeding position in a new group. Lone dispersal was more costly than coalition dispersal, with lone individuals suffering a greater loss of body mass during dispersal attempts. These results suggest a substantial short-term benefit for this type of cooperative behaviour. There was no evidence for dispersal polymorphism in the population, with no detectable phenotypic difference between dispersers and non-dispersers or those that dispersed as part of a coalition compared with those that dispersed alone. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Biparental {{investment}} in birds is implemented through parents making adaptive compensatory adjustments {{according to the}} work rate of their collaborator. Predictions for such evolutionarily stable cooperation in parental nestling feeding, and the behavioural mechanisms involved, can also be applied to systems with helpers-at-the-nest. Using the cooperatively breeding <b>Arabian</b> <b>babbler,</b> Turdoides squamiceps, we experimentally increased the provisioning rate {{of one or two}} subordinate birds in each group by giving these individuals extra food. Compared with control days before and after, the experimental treatment caused 'fed' birds to increase and 'unfed' birds to decrease their nest visit rates significantly, with no significant changes in load size. Thus, both parents and helpers in this system showed individual compensatory adjustments in their nestling-feeding effort according to the work rates of collaborators. There were no significant increases in total group visits during experimental treatments; therefore this study did not provide evidence for the predicted incomplete compensatory response. These results for helping-at-the-nest are consistent with empirical studies on parental care, and further suggest a central. role for nestling begging in any cooperative provisioning of young in the nest.
