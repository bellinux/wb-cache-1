5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) {{was founded}} on 28 December 1924, when about 75 {{linguists}} met to select officers, ratify a constitution, and present papers {{in order to facilitate}} communication within the field of linguistics. The foundational members included 31 women, most of whom worked <b>as</b> <b>educators</b> rather than as scholars at research institutions. By 1935, half of the female foundational members had left the society—a rate similar to that of male members—largely due to the professionalization of the field of linguistics that disproportionately affected women as most worked outside of academia.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working <b>as</b> <b>educators).</b> They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. Everyone and everything was monitored in Nazi Germany. Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is {{a chronic}} disease that requires continuous self-care. Education by nurses can support self-care behavior {{of patients with}} type 2 DM. Good knowledge affects self-care of type 2 diabetes patients so that metabolic control can be achieved. This study aimed to identify {{the correlation between the}} role of nurse <b>as</b> <b>educator</b> and self-care behaviour in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This research applied a descriptive analytic design with cross sectional approach. A total of 63 respondents were enrolled in this study by using consecutive sampling technique. Data collection was conducted by administering questionnaires of nurse role <b>as</b> <b>educator</b> and Summary of Diabetes Self Care Activities (SDSCA). Data were analyzed by using Spearman correlation test with significance level of 0. 05. The result showed that the mean value of nurse role and self-care behaviour was 59. 84 and 3. 79 respectively. The p value was 0. 000 (p< 0. 05) with the correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 851. It indicates that there was a significant correlation between nurse role <b>as</b> <b>educator</b> and self-care behaviour in patients with type 2 DM. The correlation was strong and positive which means the better the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s role <b>as</b> <b>educator</b> the better the patient 2 ̆ 7 s self-care behaviour.

It was an exceptional situation inspired by exceptional circumstance: the need to build a bridge between an all-white naval administration and a predominantly black population. Adams used his authority as bandleader and Chief Petty Officer with the navy as a source of power, wealth, and influence. Their induction not only helped to defuse the racial tension that plagued the navy’s presence on the island during World War I, but the band, and Adams in particular, functioned <b>as</b> <b>educators</b> to naval administrators about the needs and attitudes of Virgin Islanders. Further, Adams continued to grow into his role as a social leader on the islands, serving as an officer of the local chapter of the Red Cross, helping to found the public library in Charlotte Amalie, and developing the islands’ public school music education program.|$|E

[...] The team advised the show's writers and producers how to handle the topic, in what they called [...] "a curriculum bath"; Bernstein described it in this way: [...] "We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise. [...] We in Research bring in people to provide the information, and then the artistry of the writer takes over, as they integrate what they've heard". [...] The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children's fears about death. [...] They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: [...] "Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all".
