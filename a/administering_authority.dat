5000|$|Gio {{villages are}} divided into quarters, each housing an {{extended}} family or lineage.

Honorary chief titles can be given to non-tribe members who have assisted the tribe in charitable means. For example, U.S. Diplomat, John F.

He was reported as saying that he was a [...] "schoolmaster by choice and a politician by accident". He resigned from teaching and travelled throughout the country speaking to common people and tribal chiefs, trying to garner support for movement towards independence. He also spoke on behalf of TANU to the Trusteeship Council and Fourth Committee of the United Nations in New York. His oratory skills and integrity helped Nyerere achieve TANU's goal for an independent country without war or bloodshed.|$|E

40|$|Conclusion It {{is fair to}} {{say that}} there is no ideal method of {{anonymous}} ovum donation: there are medical and/or ethical pros and cons (Table I) in all the strategies discussed above. Nonetheless, one cannot dispute the fact that the demand for such donations outstrips the supply, so a diversity of policies for gamete donation has been advocated (Pennings, 1995). Medical practi-tioners are in a position to help. It. is in no-one's interests if they adopt a paternalistic stance by denying patients the right to know that IVF methods are available and that they can be applied in an ethically sound and dignified manner. It is therefore the responsibility of the profession to examine the arguments presented here and to offer needy patients considered recommendations. Only in this way can one expect constructive assistance from both the media and the <b>administering</b> <b>authorities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Anti-dumping {{administration}} is a {{is a complex}} task requiring the application of economic, legal and accounting principles {{in the evaluation of}} petitions by industry for anti-dumping measures to be taken against allegedly injurious dumped imports. In particular there are complex competition issues involved in a decision on the imposition of dumping duties. Competition in the domestic market should be the first issue investigated. This will reduce the possibility of finding a false positive of injurious dumping at the initiation stage, and any unnecessary inhibitory effect on trade. The accuracy of the authority’s decisions can be enhanced by improving the transparency of the investigation process. This can be achieved by providing counsel for each party with access to the commercial in confidence information. It is then easier though a process of facilitated mediation for there to be a convergence on agreed issues needing resolution. This is likely to improve parties’ acceptance of the <b>administering</b> <b>authority’s</b> decisions based on sound economic principles from initiation to a final determination...|$|R

50|$|In 1947, the Northern Mariana Islands {{became part}} of the post-World War II United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). The United States became the TTPI's <b>administering</b> <b>authority</b> under the terms of a {{trusteeship}} agreement. In 1976, Congress approved the mutually negotiated Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) government adopted its own constitution in 1977, and the constitutional government took office in January 1978. The Covenant was fully implemented on November 3, 1986, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation no. 5564, which conferred United States citizenship on legally qualified CNMI residents. This led to CNMI being represented in the United States (and especially Washington, D.C.) by a Resident Representative who was elected at-large by CNMI voters and whose office was paid for by the CNMI government. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 ("CNRA"), approved by the U.S. Congress on May 8, 2008, established a CNMI delegate's seat; Democrat Gregorio Sablan was elected in November 2008 as the first CNMI delegate and took office in the 111th Congress.|$|E
