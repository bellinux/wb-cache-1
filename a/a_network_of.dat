40|$|Abstract — For army, the {{mobility}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entire communi-cation <b>network</b> is desirable. <b>A</b> large mobile communication <b>network</b> inevitably involves <b>a</b> large <b>network</b> <b>of</b> wireless routers. The throughput <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large <b>network</b> <b>of</b> wireless routers critically depends on distributed {{medium access control}} (MAC). In this paper, we present a MAC scheme to be called opportunistic synchronous array method (O-SAM). The O-SAM is distributed, locally executable and exploits channel fading opportunistically. We illustrate the throughput <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large <b>network</b> <b>of</b> wireless routers based on the O-SAM in comparison to other variations. I...|$|R
