40|$|Daylight {{responsive}} dimming {{systems have}} been used in few buildings to date because they require improvements to improve reliability. The key underlying factor contributing to poor performance is the variability of the ratio of the photosensor signal to daylight workplane illuminance in accordance with sun position, sky condition, and fenestration condition. Therefore, this paper describes the integrated <b>systems</b> between <b>automated</b> roller <b>shade</b> <b>systems</b> and daylight responsive dimming systems with an improved closed-loop proportional control algorithm, and the relative performance of the integrated systems and single systems. The concept of the improved closed-loop proportional control algorithm for the integrated systems is to predict the varying correlation of photosensor signal to daylight workplane illuminance according to roller shade height and sky conditions for improvement of the system accuracy. In this study, the performance of the integrated systems with two improved closed-loop proportional control algorithms was compared with that of the current (modified) closed-loop proportional control algorithm.

40|$|There is {{significant}} {{evidence that the}} combustion of fossil fuels for energy has contributed {{to an increase in}} CO 2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution; there is also evidence of a parallel increase in global temperatures, all of which have contributed to climate change and detrimental environmental impacts. The built environment has made a notable contribution to these issues and in 2011 for example it accounted for 62 % of global energy consumption. Up to 85 % of this energy was operational (as opposed to embodied) 1 and in the EU 50 % was used to operate heating and cooling systems in buildings 2. Consequently, several strategies have been developed to reduce energy consumption and associated environmental impact from the built environment including improved insulation. Although this has proved environmentally beneficial by reducing energy demand for heating, in conjunction with changing climate and weather patterns however, it has also contributed to a rise in the overheating incidents in buildings. This in turn has increased the demand for electro-mechanical cooling (e. g. air-conditioning and fans), the use of which negates some of the benefits of reducing energy for heating. There are many examples of contemporary buildings that have been designed to minimise thermal gain in summer and/or warm locations; this can be achieved through appropriate building orientation and/or technical design features such as those in Jean Nouvel’s Arab World Institute in Paris, France (which includes an intelligent <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> on the south façade to manage light and solar gain) 3 and Alejandro Aravena’s Siamese Towers in Santiago, Chile (which incorporate a double skin to remove heat from the building) 4. Many buildings do not include this type of feature or good insulation however as a result of which interior temperatures are high in summer and low in winter, and although appropriate design and correct orientation of new buildings could mitigate these issues, there is a considerable quantity of new and old building stock in the UK that does not address one or both factors successfully. Blinds, shutters and other shading products can be both retrofitted in existing buildings and incorporated into new building designs. In addition to creating privacy and security for building occupants, they can address some of the above problems in that, if correctly used, they attenuate daylight and help to reduce energy use and associated impact by limiting thermal gain in the summer and thermal loss in the winter. In the UK use of motorised and <b>automated</b> <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> is increasingly popular in commercial buildings with <b>shading</b> <b>systems.</b> However the emphasis of this study is domestic buildings, where interior space, user behaviour and levels of energy consumption often dramatically differ from that in commercial buildings; for example, air conditioning is installed in very few domestic buildings and manual shading products are the most widely used. This could change as use of motorised blinds has been shown to encourage user interaction and thus improve thermal comfort, well-being and energy savings. While component materials and manufacturing processes for this type of blind system differ from those in manual blinds, they also consume electrical energy for operation and therefore overall environmental impact is higher than that of manual blinds. This paper briefly considers thermal and visual comfort, health and well-being of building occupants; it then compares the embodied and operational environmental impact of motorised blinds and associated energy savings to determine their overall environmental impact and concludes by discussing a major challenge to the construction industry that is also limiting the potential benefits of blind use...|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{with highly}} glazed facades and well insulated, {{air-tight}} envelopes result in interior spaces {{that are highly}} sensitive to solar gain. Solar gain through glazing is {{the largest and most}} variable gain in buildings and has major implications on energy consumption and peak cooling loads. The peak electricity demand in Ontario, for example, is dominated by space cooling of residential and commercial buildings. The appropriate use of window shading devices can reduce cooling energy consumption and substantially lower the peak cooling load. The potential for reducing the electricity demand on peak summer days is especially significant as the cost to construct and maintain the power distribution grid and generating capacity {{is directly related to the}} peak demand. Recently, new capabilities for modeling windows with shading devices were incorporated into ESP-r. The work is based on a set of shading models, designated the ASHWAT (ASHRAE Window Attachment) models, which were developed with emphasis on generality and computational efficiency. Measurements performed at the National Solar Test Facility (NSTF) on a full scale window with various shading attachments were compared to calculated values predicted by the ASHWAT models. The predicted results aligned well with measured data, giving confidence to the applicability of the models. To demonstrate the new modeling capability within ESP-r, simulation examples illustrating the impact of different shading configurations on cooling energy, peak load and thermal comfort are presented. In particular, a simulation of an <b>automated</b> external <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> highlights the role of shading on the energy performance of a solar house design entered into the Solar Decathlon 2009 competition. The external shading design is compared with other options including a solar protective coating on the outside glass as well as indoor shades. Simulations were also carried out to illustrate the impact of shading devices on winter nighttime heat loss and thermal comfort. Finally, a general procedure for using the shading models within ESP-r is outlined, highlighting straightforward user input by means of a user-friendly graphical interface.

40|$|Building facades {{directly}} influence {{heating and}} cooling loads and indirectly influence lighting loads when daylighting is considered, {{and are therefore a}} major determinant of annual energy use and peak electric demand. Facades also significantly influence occupant comfort and satisfaction, making the design optimization challenge more complex than many other building systems. This work focused on addressing significant near-term opportunities to reduce energy use in California commercial building stock by a) targeting voluntary, design-based opportunities derived from the use of better design guidelines and tools, and b) developing and deploying more efficient glazings, <b>shading</b> <b>systems,</b> daylighting systems, facade systems and integrated controls. This two-year project, supported by the California Energy Commission PIER program and the US Department of Energy, initiated a collaborative effort between The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and major stakeholders in the facades industry to develop, evaluate, and accelerate market deployment of emerging, high-performance, integrated facade solutions. The LBNL Windows Testbed Facility acted as the primary catalyst and mediator {{on both sides of the}} building industry supply-user business transaction by a) aiding component suppliers to create and optimize cost effective, integrated systems that work, and b) demonstrating and verifying to the owner, designer, and specifier community that these integrated systems reliably deliver required energy performance. An industry consortium was initiated amongst approximately seventy disparate stakeholders, who unlike the HVAC or lighting industry, has no single representative, multi-disciplinary body or organized means of communicating and collaborating. The consortium provided guidance on the project and more importantly, began to mutually work out and agree on the goals, criteria, and pathways needed to attain the ambitious net zero energy goals defined by California and the US. A collaborative test, monitoring, and reporting protocol was also formulated via the Windows Testbed Facility in collaboration with industry partners, transitioning industry to focus on the importance of expecting measured performance to consistently achieve design performance expectations. The facility enables accurate quantification of energy use, peak demand, and occupant comfort impacts of synergistic facade-lighting-HVAC systems on an apples-to-apples comparative basis and its data can be used to verify results from simulations. Emerging interior and exterior shading technologies were investigated as potential near-term, low-cost solutions with potential broad applicability in both new and retrofit construction. Commercially-available and prototype technologies were developed, tested, and evaluated. Full-scale, monitored field tests were conducted over solstice-to-solstice periods to thoroughly evaluate the technologies, uncover potential risks associated with an unknown, and quantify performance benefits. Exterior <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> were found to yield net zero energy levels of performance in a sunny climate and significant reductions in summer peak demand. <b>Automated</b> interior <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> were found to yield significant daylighting and comfort-related benefits. In support of an integrated design process, a PC-based commercial fenestration (COMFEN) software package, based on EnergyPlus, was developed that enables architects and engineers to quickly assess and compare the performance of innovative facade technologies in the early sketch or schematic design phase. This tool is publicly available for free and will continue to improve in terms of features and accuracy. Other work was conducted to develop simulation tools to model the performance of any arbitrary complex fenestration system such as common Venetian blinds, fabric roller shades as well as more exotic innovative facade systems such as optical louver systems...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} years, solar <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> have become {{integral}} {{parts of the}} building envelope. New designs, technologies and materials are constantly introduced and tested in shading industry. Nowadays, adaptation in solar <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> is the almost exclusive goal of every design. Adaptive solar <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> are preferable as they adapt to external climate conditions and indoor needs, succeeding high performance and efficiency at the same time. The term “adaptation” is eventually related to movement. The plurality of adaptive solar <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> perform by making use of integrated movement mechanisms. Ten Bucky-lab projects and ten study cases are analyzed in terms of visual comfort and analytical daylight simulations are conducted for the latter. The computer-based simulations focus on the annual daylight performance of each system in Athens. This procedure contributes in understanding in depth the way that adaptive <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> perform, by evaluating their efficiency performance. This research highlighted the most efficient <b>systems,</b> under basic <b>shading</b> principles. However, their movement mechanisms are relatively expensive and require frequent maintenance or even replacement. The proposed solar <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> introduces {{a new generation of}} adaptive <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> which are static and their adaptation mechanism is related to the material of the system and its properties. Smart glass technology and PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal) devices allow the fluctuation of the transparency coefficient of the glass. They are mainly used as vertical glazing on the building envelope in order to provide shade to the interior. Nevertheless, being vertical, they do not only block daylight but also view to the exterior space. The proposed solar <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> makes use of this innovative technology in a more efficient way. An external three-dimensional grid, with vertical and horizontal components perpendicular to the facade of the building is placed in front of the curtain wall <b>system,</b> <b>shading</b> the interior and allowing view to outside simultaneously. Computer-based simulations are performed in detail for west and south orientations. A reference room on the 10 th floor of an office building located in Athens is concerned. In addition, the proposed system is evaluated for the same reference room but located in Amsterdam via basic daylight simulations. The concept of this <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> is to provide the opportunity to control the transparency in great variety. Each component of the system can be controlled individually. Thus, either all or particularly selected horizontal and/or vertical shading components may be transparent or translucent. If shading is not needed, it may be totally invisible. As a result, the proposed <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> performs efficiently at any orientation and under any daylight conditions. Regarding efficiency performance, the proposed <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> provides acceptable indoor daylight conditions throughout the year in both examined orientations. The system requirements set for this research (daylit area, daylight autonomy, useful daylight index and glare percentage) are fulfilled. Focusing on its contribution in the energy consumption of the reference room, 35 % energy saving is accomplished in south orientation and 16 % in west orientation.

Dynamic façades with high performance glazing and <b>automated</b> <b>shading</b> {{have the potential}} to balance daylighting needs, comfort and energy use, when integrated with lighting and thermal systems controls. Recent efforts on developing efficient shading control strategies mainly focused on either providing more daylight to reduce lighting energy use, preventing glare, or controlling solar gains to reduce cooling requirements. Usually, this requires different sensors and control <b>systems</b> for <b>shading,</b> lighting and air-conditioning operation. ^ This Thesis presents {{the development and implementation of}} a model-based control algorithm for <b>automated</b> <b>shading</b> and lighting operation, aiming at minimizing energy use while reducing the risk of glare. A detailed lighting model is used to compute real-time interior lighting conditions, energy use and daylight glare probability, based on the readings of two sensors on every building façade. The model, validated with full-scale experiments, is able to predict the performance of dynamic façades with complex fenestration systems and employs a hybrid ray tracing and radiosity method for lighting simulation and a detailed daylight glare module based on DGP. The model-based operation ensures optimal shade position and light dimming levels that minimize energy use while satisfying glare constraints at each time step. The developed algorithm is demonstrated in a full-scale office space, controlling shades and electric lighting through the real-time model-based optimizer, using simple sensor readings as inputs. The results show the performance of the optimized controls in terms of energy use, visual comfort and daylight provision, leading to integrated, smart façade controls for perimeter building zones. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of commercially available and prospective advanced window systems {{on a commercial}} building's energy performance in mild and cold German climates is studied. The advanced windows include multipane windows with sun-control and/or low- emittance glazings and low-conductivity gas-fills, transparently insulated windows, evacuated windows, and windows with electrochromic or thermochromic switchable glazings. <b>Automated</b> <b>shading</b> devices are employed to avoid excessive solar gains, along with lighting controls {{to take advantage of}} the lighting energy savings from daylighting. The shade control is inherent in the switchable windows. Total annual energy savings between 4 % and 39 % are reported is compared to a building with clear, air-filled, double- pane windows. The switchable electrochromic windows show the greatest potential energy savings...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{solar shading}} {{in the context}} of {{commercial}} buildings. The motivation behind this research is to examine, if the inclusion of solar shading into building design can assist in the comfort of the users who occupy these buildings and to investigate can the incorporation of a solar <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> aid in the reduction of expenditure on mechanical cooling. In order to assess this, an examination has been carried out on published information regarding relevant aspects of solar shading encompassing the effects of solar gain on buildings (i. e. solar glare and heat gain), the impact on users of buildings and the possible reduction in reliance on air conditioning. An analysis of how such an assessment would take place through sun paths and glazing transmittance has been discussed. The various shading techniques possible have been outlined, followed by an examination of differing control methods and their application. In order to quantify shading and glazing transmittance an assessment of the g-value is outlined with the relevant pre-determined tables. A cost benefit analysis is included to discuss the cost implications of including a <b>shading</b> <b>system</b> and the reduction in expenditure on air conditioning from previous studies is outlined. The conclusions of this research are that <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> have a definite role to play in achieving an environmentally sound building; however, every building will require differing analysis to uncover the most applicable <b>shading</b> and control <b>system</b> for the subject building...|$|R
40|$|Consumption of {{specialty}} coffee, mainly organic coffee, increases worldwide following {{the tendency of}} consuming social and ecological sustainable products. Brazil is the world largest coffee producer, {{with an average of}} 2, 300, 000 tons of green coffee in the last 5 years. Cultivation of organic coffee and shaded coffee are common in Central America, while in Brazil both conventional and organic coffee are cultivated in the full sun system. The full sun system is criticized {{due to the lack of}} biodiversity and high demand for inputs. <b>Shaded</b> coffee <b>system</b> has more biodiversity, recycles and fix more chemical elements, such as N, P, K, Ca and C, having a great potential to mitigate the global warming, being consequently more sustainable. In Brazil, <b>shaded</b> coffee <b>system</b> is not well trusted and known as less productive. Seeking for organic coffee sustainability, this work evaluates productivity, coffee quality and chemical composition of coffee beans from two distinct organic coffee systems: shaded and full sun, in the largest arabica coffee producing region of the world, south of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. For productivity and coffee quality there was no statistical difference, although there was a tendency of superiority for the shaded treatment. For coffee beans composition, the <b>shaded</b> <b>system</b> presented higher K values. Considering the results obtained, the <b>shaded</b> <b>system</b> can be suited to increase organic coffee sustainability in this region of Brazil...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, as {{fenestration}} and <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> {{have become more}} complex and sophisticated, a great improvement of thermal and solar-optical performance has been required {{and as a consequence}} old methods of characterization have become inadequate. This evolution has yielded the introduction of new lumped parameters and the implementation of more sophisticated calculation models, which allow to evaluate the performance of fenestration and <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> taking into account a large number of factors, such as the angular dependence of solar heat gain. The suitability and usefulness of new parameters and models for a wide use depend on the level of knowledge of the interaction between fenestration systems and the external environment. In {{the first part of this}} work an analysis of incident solar radiation on fenestration has been performed, by using the climatic data contained in the average monthly days of some sites representative of the main Italian climatic zones. The ratio of direct solar radiation to diffuse solar radiation has been analyzed for different orientations of glazed surfaces and for different periods in the year. Moreover, the relation between direct radiation and its incident angle has been analyzed. In the second part of this work a calculation model for the determination of the solar energy transmittance (TSET) of fenestration and <b>shading</b> <b>systems</b> has been developed. The model is based on a reference tool developed by CSTB, which has been modified by the authors in order to increase its flexibility, to adequate it to the existent national and international standard and recommendation, to take into account the angular dependence of solar heat gain through complex fenestration and <b>shading</b> <b>systems.</b> The combined application of the calculation model to some fenestration systems using the results of the external environment analysis has allowed to identify a wide range of cases and to obtain general rules about the applicability and usefulness of different calculation models depending on geometric and exposure features of glazed surfaces and on the period of the yea...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the article}} {{is to develop a}} louver control method that does not involve {{photometric}} values measurement. The idea proposed by the authors is to use sky images as an actuator for controlling <b>automated</b> <b>shading</b> devices. The fundamental problem of these studies is the dynamic of changes in lighting conditions in different areas of sky. Three different models of the sky were selected. Louvers with semi-open and closed slat position were examined. Seven different scenarios, taking into account the type of radiation and window sky visual range, were built and analyzed to draw general principles for the described control method. A system was used to describe louver position in the partly cloudy model of the sky for an office building. Method has proved to be effective for blind control, but require further improvements...|$|R
