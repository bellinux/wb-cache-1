40|$|Feedback-based control methods {{determine}} {{the behavior of}} cellular systems, an example being <b>autogenous</b> <b>control,</b> the regulation of production of a protein by itself. This control strategy was theoretically shown to be superior to an equivalent but nonautogenously regulated system when based on a repressor. Although some of its advantages were later confirmed with isolated synthetic circuits, the superiority of <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> in natural networks remains untested. Here, we use the SOS DNA repair system of Escherichia coli, where <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> {{is part of a}} single-input module, as a valid model to evaluate the functional advantages and biological implications of this mechanism. We redesign the control of its master regulator, the protein LexA, so that it becomes nonautogenously controlled. We compare both systems by combining high-resolution expression measurements with mathematical modeling. We show that the stronger stability associated with the autogenous regulation prevents false triggering of the response due to transient fluctuations in the inducing signal and that this control also reduces the system recovery time at low DNA damage. Likewise, autoregulation produces responses proportional to the damage signal level. In contrast, bacteria with LexA constitutively expressed induce maximal action even for very low damage levels. This excess in response comes at a cost, because it reduces comparatively the growth rate of these cells. Our results suggest that <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> evolved as a strategy to optimally respond to multiple levels of input signal minimizing the costs of the response and highlights reasons why master regulators of single-input modules are mostly autorepressed...|$|E
40|$|Ribosomal {{proteins}} L 4 and L 22 {{both have}} a globular domain that sits {{on the surface of}} the large ribosomal subunit and an extended loop that penetrates its core. The tips of both loops contribute to the lining of the peptide exit tunnel and have been implicated in a gating mechanism that might regulate the exit of nascent peptides. Also, the extensions of L 4 and L 22 contact multiple domains of 23 S rRNA, suggesting they might facilitate rRNA folding during ribosome assembly. To learn more about the roles of these extensions, we constructed derivatives of both proteins that lack most of their extended loops. Our analysis of ribosomes carrying L 4 or L 22 deletion proteins did not detect any significant difference in their sedimentation property or polysome distribution. Also, the role of L 4 in <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> was not affected. We conclude that these extensions are not required for ribosome assembly or for L 4 -mediated <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of the S 10 operon...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L 4 has two functions: it is a {{structural}} {{component of the}} 50 S ribosomal sub-unit {{and it is a}} repressor of both transcription and translation of its own transcription unit, the 11 -gene S 10 operon. Genetic and biochemical studies have suggested that L 4 can interact with 23 S rRNA as well as with both RNA interactions. However, no significant similarities between its two RNA targets {{can be found at the}} primary or secondary structure level. To test if identical determinants of L 4 are involved in both ribosome assembly and <b>autogenous</b> <b>control,</b> we have isolated L 4 mutants defective in either of these functions and asked if a mutant protein divested of one function is also deficient in the other. Several mutations eliminated <b>autogenous</b> <b>control,</b> but still allowed assembly of the mutant L 4 protein into functional ribosomes. Conversely, several mutant L 4 proteins that could not be detected in 50 S subunits nevertheless could regulate expression of the S 10 operon. These results indicate that the L 4 determinants required for autogenous regulation and ribosome incorporation are not congruent...|$|E
40|$|Literature {{regarding}} {{the outcome of}} maxillary sinus floor elevation to create sufficient bone fraction to enable implant placement was systematically reviewed. Bone fraction and implant survival rate were assessed to determine whether grafting material or applied growth factor affected bone fraction. Trials where sinus floor elevations with <b>autogenous</b> bone (<b>controls)</b> were compared with autogenous bone combined with growth factors or bone substitutes, or solely with bone substitutes (test groups) were identified; 12 of 1124 fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses comparing the bone fraction after applying: autogenous bone; autologous bone with growth factors (platelet rich plasma); or autogenous bone and bone substitutes (bovine hydroxyapatite, bioactive glass, corticocancellous pig bone) revealed {{no significant differences in}} bone formation after 5 months. A significantly higher bone fraction was found in the autogenous bone group compared to the sole use of beta-tricalciumphosphate (P = 0. 036). The one-year overall implant survival rate showed no significant difference between implants. Bone substitutes combined with autogenous bone provide a reliable alternative for autogenous bone as sole grafting material to reconstruct maxillary sinus bony deficiencies, for supporting dental implants after 5 months. Adding growth factors (platelet rich plasma) to grafting material and the sole use of beta-tricalciumphosphate did not promote bone formation...|$|R

Implant survival, plaque, gingival, and bleeding indices, probing depth, and pen-implant radiographic bone levels were assessed at baseline and 12 months after functional loading. During osseointegration, three implants failed on the test side (two patients) and no implants failed on the control side, resulting in 3 -month survival rates of 91 % and 100 %, respectively. No implants were lost after functional loading and no differences in soft tissue parameters or pen-implant bone loss were observed between the control and test sides.

40|$|The LysR-type {{transcriptional}} regulator (LTTR) CysB is a {{transcription factor}} in Escherichia coli cells, where as a homotetramer it binds the target promoter regions and activates the genes involved in sulphur utilization and sulphonate-sulphur metabolism, while negatively autoregulating its own transcription. The hslJ gene {{was found to}} be negatively regulated by CysB and directly correlated with novobiocin resistance of the bacterium. cysB mutants showed upregulation of the hslJ: : lacZ gene fusion and exhibited increased novobiocin resistance. In this study the hslJ transcription start point and the corresponding putative s 70 promoter were determined. The hslJ promoter region was defined by employing different hslJâ€“lacZ operon fusions, and transcription of the hslJ gene was shown to be subject to both repression imposed by the CysB regulator and direct or indirect <b>autogenous</b> negative <b>control.</b> These two regulations compete to some extent but they are not mutually exclusive. CysB acts as a direct repressor of hslJ transcription and binds the hslJ promoter region that carries the putative CysB repressor site.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the regulation of}} the S 10 ribosomal protein (r-protein) operon {{among members of the}} gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria, which includes Escherichia coli. In E. coli, this 11 -gene operon is autogenously controlled by r-protein L 4. This regulation requires specific determinants within the untranslated leader of the mRNA. Secondary structure analysis of the S 10 leaders of five enterobacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morganii) and two nonenteric members of the gamma subdivision (Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae) shows that these foreign leaders share significant structural homology with the E. coli leader, particularly in the region which is critical for L 4 -mediated <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> in E. coli. Moreover, these heterologous leaders produce a regulatory response to L 4 oversynthesis in E. coli. Our results suggest that an E. coli-like L 4 -mediated regulatory mechanism may operate in all of these species. However, the mechanism is not universally conserved among the gamma subdivision members, since at least one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not contain the required S 10 leader features, and its leader cannot provide the signals for regulation by L 4 in E. coli.

40|$|The {{committing}} step in Met and S-adenoSyl-L-Met (SAM) synthesis is catalyzed by cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CGS {{under control}} of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter show increased soluble Met and its metabolite S-methyl-Met, but only at specific stages of development. The highest level of Met and S-methyl-Met was observed in seedling tissues and in flowers, siliques, and roots of mature plants where they accumulate 8 - to 20 -fold above wild type, whereas the level in mature leaves and other tissues is no greater than wild type. CGS-overexpressing seedlings are resistant to ethionine, a toxic Met analog. With these properties the transgenic lines resemble mto 1, an Arabidopsis, CGS-mutant inactivated in the <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> mechanism for Met-dependent down-regulation of CGS expression. However, wild-type CGS was overexpressed in the transgenic plants, indicating that <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> can be overcome by increasing the level of CGS mRNA through transcriptional control. Several of the transgenic lines show silencing of CGS resulting in deformed plants with a reduced capacity for reproductive growth. Exogenous feeding of Met to the most severely affected plants partially restores their growth. Similar morphological deformities are observed in plants cosuppressed for SAM synthetase, even though such plants accumulate 250 -fold more soluble Met than wild type and they overexpress CGS.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effect of lowâ€“intensity pulsed {{ultrasound}} in the posterolateral lumbar fusion of rabbit. MethodsA total of 48 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into the observation group and control group, including the autogenous iliac observation group, artificial bone observation group, artificial bone <b>control</b> group and <b>autogenous</b> iliac <b>control</b> group according to the different bone grafting. The posterolateral lumbar fusion of rabbits in each group was analyzed and compared. ResultsAfter 4 weeks of treatment using the lowâ€“intensity pulsed ultrasound, the fusion in the bone grafting area of observation group was good. There was the relatively dense fusion area between the right transverse process and artificial bone. The left transverse process had been completely fused, with the clear bone trabecula through the fusion area. There was no significant fusion sign in the control group. According to the fusion comparison between two groups, the fusion rate of the observation group was 83. 3 % and it {{was significantly higher than}} the one of the control group (37. 5 %). Results of the comparison were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). The number of chondrocytes and the increase in the relative grayâ€“scale in the fusion area of the iliac observation group were significantly higher than ones of the iliac control group (P< 0. 05). The number of chondrocytes and the increase in the relative grayâ€“scale in the fusion area of the artificial bone observation group were significantly higher than ones of the artificial bone control group (P< 0. 05). The expression of ILâ€“ 1, ILâ€“ 6 and ILâ€“ 17 4 weeks after the treatment of the observation group was significantly lower than the one of the control group, with the statistical significance (P< 0. 05). It indicated that the treatment of lowâ€“intensity pulsed ultrasound could reduce the expression level of inflammatory factors. ConclusionsThe lowâ€“intensity pulsed ultrasound can significantly increase the bone grafting fusion rate of the rabbit's posterolateral lumbar fusion. The possible mechanism is that it promotes the lumbar posterolateral endochondral ossification and reduces the inflammatory reaction...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To analyze bone {{repair process}} in Wistar rats' calvaria, {{with the use}} of two {{different}} biomaterials. METHODS: Forty two male Wistar rats were used, and four bicortical cranial cavities were created in each animal. The cavities were filled with: bioactive glass (BG); calcium sulfate barrier (CSB); bioactive glass covered with calcium sulfate barrier (BG/CSB); and <b>autogenous</b> blood clot (<b>control).</b> The animals were euthanized 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, 90, e 120 days after surgery. The scalps were removed and submitted to a routine process for histological preparation: staining with Haematoxylin and Eosin (HE). RESULTS: The BG was not completely resorbed; however, after 60 days, a decrease in size as well as a change in the morphological granule were observed. CSB was not observed in the last group (after 120 days). CONCLUSIONS: In Wistar rat calvaria bioactive glass, in an isolated form, negatively interfered in the bone repair process; the calcium sulfate barrier, in an isolated form, presented the capacity to maintain space, allowing the flow of osteogenic cells; the bioactive glass covered with calcium sulfate barrier association presented a better osteoconductive capacity when compared to isolated materials; calcium sulfate barrier was completely resorbed after 90 days; control cavities did not completely heal until 120 days after surgery...|$|R
40|$|The type III {{secretion}} system (T 3 SS) is {{a principal}} virulence determi- nant of the model bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. T 3 SS effector proteins inhibit plant defense signaling pathways in susceptible hosts and elicit evolved immunity in resistant plants. The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor HrpL coordinates the expression of most T 3 SS genes. Transcription of hrpL is depen- dent on sigma- 54 and the codependent enhancer binding proteins HrpR and HrpS for hrpL promoter activation. hrpL is oriented adjacently to and divergently from the HrpL-dependent gene hrpJ, sharing an intergenic upstream regulatory region. We show that association of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) -HrpL complex with the hrpJ promoter element imposes negative <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> on hrpL transcription in P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000. The hrpL promoter was upregulated in a Î” hrpL mu- tant and was repressed by plasmid-borne hrpL. In a minimal Escherichia coli back- ground, the activity of HrpL was sufficient to achieve repression of reconstituted hrpL transcription. This repression was relieved if both the HrpL DNA-binding func- tion and the hrp -box sequence of the hrpJ promoter were compromised, implying dependence upon the hrpJ promoter. DNA-bound RNAP-HrpL entirely occluded the HrpRS and partially occluded the integration host factor (IHF) recognition elements of the hrpL promoter in vitro, implicating inhibition of DNA binding by these factors {{as a cause of}} negative <b>autogenous</b> <b>control.</b> A modest increase in the HrpL concen- tration caused hypersecretion of the HrpA 1 pilus protein but intracellular accumula- tion of later T 3 SS substrates.

A translational control of rp-mRNA distribution between polysomes and mRNPs is observed, but this is not due to an autogenous regulation by r-proteins. After stage 30 the amount of rp-mRNA declines specifically in the mutants because the transcripts are unstable. Considering the temporal correlation between this event and the onset of r-protein synthesis we suggest that an <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> operates at the level of transcript stability...|$|E

The causative organisms progressed differently, the dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium catenatum, {{is well known}} toxic species. The Environmental Impact Assessment model (EIA) was applied to Mex Bay. It is a three-dimensional water quality and flow model, based on the three interacted dimensional: longitude, latitude and depth, calculations {{of time and space}} variations. The model deals with processes that affecting the water quality. It was initiated with measured field data and load input. The model was used to simulate phytoplankton biomass transport and ambient nutrient concentrations (nitrate, phosphate & ammonia). The model results and the field measurements are compared in order to fit the model. Generally, the calculated flow and concentrations corresponded well with observations. Deviations are attributed to several reasons. A notable influence of the main outfall on the concentrations, particularly in the near shore area, as well as, on the seawater quality was detected. The spatial distribution of the phytoplankton standing crop coincided clearly with the accompanied chlorophyll a concentrations calculated by the model. The results stressed the need to reduce load input into Mex Bay, in order to counteract eutrophication in Alexandria waters.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of three control measures in reducing nursery mortality caused by Haemophilus parasuis, namely, a commercial vaccine, an <b>autogenous</b> vaccine, and <b>controlled</b> exposure using a low dose of live, virulent organisms. Methods: The experiments were performed in a multi-farm system experiencing high nursery mortality (> 4. 8 %) due to H parasuis infection. In Experiment 1, pigs were vaccinated at weaning using a commercially available, one-dose H parasuis vaccine. In Experiment 2, pigs were vaccinated at processing and at weaning with an autogenous vaccine. In Experiment 3, pigs were orally inoculated at processing using a bacterial suspension containing a total of 105 - 6 colony forming units per mL of three H parasuis strains prevalent in the studied herd. Experiments 1 and 2 were repeated five times (5 consecutive weeks of production), and Experiment 3 was repeated nine times. Results: Mortality in pigs exposed to H parasuis was lower (P <. 001) than that in groups vaccinated with either commercial or autogenous vaccines. Discussion: The lack of effect of parenteral vaccination may be due to lack of crossprotection between heterologous strains, timing of vaccination, and potential interference of maternally-derived immunity. The efficacy of controlled exposure likely reflects the induction of homologous mucosal immunity preventing pathogen systemic invasion. Implications: The use of controlled exposure of young pigs to the prevalent H parasuis strains involved in nursery mortality provides a valuable alternative for control of H parasuis, compared to traditional vaccination using commercial or autogenous products...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{allosteric}} {{control in the}} biosynthetic pathway for aromatic amino acids provides a basis to explain vulnerability to growth inhibition by l-phenylalanine (0. 2 mM or greater) in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. 29108. We attribute growth inhibition to the hypersensitivity of 3 -deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7 -phosphate synthase to feedback inhibition by l-phenylalanine. Hyperregulation of this initial enzyme of aromatic biosynthesis depletes the supply of precursors needed for biosynthesis of l-tyrosine and l-tryptophan. Consistent with this mechanism is the total reversal of phenylalanine inhibition {{by a combination of}} tyrosine and tryptophan. Inhibited cultures also contained decreased levels of phycocyanin pigments, a characteristic previously correlated with amino acid starvation in cyanobacteria. l-Phenylalanine is a potent noncompetitive inhibitor (with both substrates) of 3 -deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7 -phosphate synthase, whereas l-tyrosine is a very weak inhibitor. Prephenate dehydratase also displays allosteric sensitivity to phenylalanine (inhibition) and to tyrosine (activation). Both 2 -fluoro and 4 -fluoro derivatives of phenylalanine were potent analog antimetabolites, and these were used in addition to l-phenylalanine as selective agents for resistant mutants. Mutants were isolated which excreted both phenylalanine and tyrosine, the consequence of an altered 3 -deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7 -phosphate synthase no longer sensitive to feedback inhibition. Simultaneous insensitivity to l-tyrosine suggests that l-tyrosine acts as a weak analog mimic of l-phenylalanine at a common binding site. Prephenate dehydratase in the regulatory mutants was unaltered. Surprisingly, in view of the lack of regulation in the tyrosine branchlet of the pathway, such mutants excrete more phenylalanine than tyrosine, indicating that l-tyrosine activation dominates l-phenylalanine inhibition of prephenate dehydratase in vivo. In mutant Phe r 19 the loss in allosteric sensitivity of 3 -deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7 -phosphate synthase was accompanied by a threefold increase in specific activity. This could suggest that existence of a modest degree of repression <b>control</b> (<b>autogenous)</b> over 3 -deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate synthase, although other explanations are possible. Specific activities of chorismate mutase, prephenate dehydratase, shikimate/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase, and arogenate/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase in mutant Phe r 19 were identical with those of the wild type...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae {{represents}} the primary model organism {{with which the}} molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions and co-evolution of host-specificity have been explored. Its virulence is dependent upon the needle-like Type-III secretion system (T 3 SS) for translocation of effector proteins that interfere with plant defence signalling into the host cell cytoplasm. The sigma factor (Ïƒ) HrpL co-ordinates the concomitant transcription of genes encoding the T 3 SS complex and its associated substrates. In P. syringae, the paralogous activator proteins HrpR and HrpS are both required for Ïƒ 54 -dependent transcription of hrpL. Furthermore, HrpS is subject to allosteric inhibition by HrpV, which is in turn relieved by HrpG. A holistic view of how signalling and regulatory processes control the transition into hrpL-dependent pathogenicity {{in response to the}} in planta environment is lacking. In this thesis, I first present evidence for negative <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of the hrpL gene by its Ïƒ factor product in the P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 strain. This novel mechanism is dependent upon HrpL recruiting the bacterial RNA polymerase to the adjacent and divergently transcribed hrpJ promoter. Preliminary in vitro studies suggest that the physical proximity of the RNAP-HrpL holoenzyme complex inhibits at a distance one or more regulatory events required for transcription initiation at hrpL. With respect to its physiological significance, functional analyses infer that the fine control of HrpL expression afforded by negative <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of HrpL expression contributes to correctly ordered T 3 SS secretion. Secondly, I show that by modulating the activity of the global Gac-Rsm signalling cascade the sensor histidine kinase RetS positively regulates T 3 SS gene expression as well as affecting other aspects of lifestyle switching. Control of hrpL expression by Gac-Rsm is exerted in part via post-transcriptional regulation of HrpV which, indicative of divergent target specificities, is achieved to varying extents by the three CsrA paralogues in P. syringae.

40|$|Inadequate bone {{volume on}} the {{posterior}} maxilla limits dental implant rehabilitation. Maxillary sinus grafting is often indicated to increase the bone volume in this region. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), a cellular-based therapy, has been recently introduced as a chair-side procedure. The overall aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} single-visit clinical stem cell therapy for maxillary sinus bone grafting in atrophic maxilla using bone marrow derived MSC from BMAC. The study aimed to evaluate the quantity of nucleated cells, MSCs and their differentiation capacity in the bone marrow aspirate and BMAC in rabbits and humans. The bone regeneration and healing of maxillary sinus graft using different grafting materials in combination with BMAC were evaluated in rabbits and humans. Materials and methods involved an in vitro laboratory experiment, an in vivo animal experiment and a preliminary human clinical trial. The bone marrow aspirates from the rabbits and humans were submitted for the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the nucleated cells and the differentiation capacity of the MSCs before and after concentration. The rabbit maxillary sinus model was used to test the different grafting materials. 24 rabbits with 48 sinuses were randomized into 4 groups: sham <b>control,</b> <b>autogenous</b> bone, bovine bone mineral (BBM) and BBM+BMAC. The rabbits were sacrificed at 2, 4 or 8 weeks and the sinuses were analyzed by histological examination and micro-CT scan. In the human clinical trial, the patients were divided into 2 groups basing on their grafting need for dental implant rehabilitation. On bilateral sinus grafting (study 1), it was a split mouth design comparing BBM and BBM+BMAC and on unilateral sinus grafting (study 2), it was a randomized controlled design comparing BBM+BMAC and autogenous bone. The bone regeneration capacity was assessed histologically by trephine biopsy and cone beam CT scans for graft volume and graft height. Results of the in vitro study confirmed that the quantity of nucleated cells and colony forming unit-fibroblasts after concentration have increased substantially when compared with before concentration in rabbits at a factor of 1. 84 and 3. 76, respectively, and in humans at a factor of 4. 43 and 106. 88, respectively. The BMAC could retain their in vitro multi-differentiation capability of osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineage. In the in vivo rabbit study, bone regeneration and satisfactory healing of maxillary sinus grafts using either autogenous bone, BBM or BBM+BMAC was confirmed. The quantity of new bone increased and demonstrated interconnection with no sign of inflammatory changes. BBM or BBM+BMAC retained more graft volume rather autogenous bone. In the preliminary clinical study, bone-aspirating technique did not produce any morbidity and higher patientsâ€™ satisfaction when compared with hip harvesting. On evaluation of bone healing after maxillary sinus grafting, both BBM and BBM+BMAC underwent similar trend of slow graft reduction. The BMAC+BBM could retain greater volume than autogenous bone. In conclusion, a single-visit stem cell therapy for maxillary bone grafting in atrophic maxilla using BMAC+BBM have been developed based on in vitro laboratory and in vivo rabbit experiments and substantiated by a preliminary clinical trial. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli genes {{regulated}} by environmental inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels form the phosphate (Pho) regulon. This regulation requires seven proteins, whose synthesis is under <b>autogenous</b> <b>control,</b> including response regulator PhoB, its partner, histidine sensor kinase PhoR, all four {{components of the}} Pi-specific transport (Pst) system (PstA, PstB, PstC, and PstS), and a protein of unknown function called PhoU. Here we {{examined the effects of}} uncoupling PhoB synthesis and PhoR synthesis from their normal controls by placing each under the tight control of the arabinose-regulated ParaB promoter or the rhamnose-regulated PrhaB promoter. To do this, we made allele replacement plasmids that may be generally useful for construction of ParaB or PrhaB fusions and for recombination of them onto the E. coli chromosome at the araCBAD or rhaRSBAD locus, respectively. Using strains carrying such single-copy fusions, we showed that a PrhaB fusion is more tightly regulated than a ParaB fusion in that a PrhaB-phoR+ fusion but not a ParaB-phoR+ fusion shows a null phenotype in the absence of its specific inducer. Yet in the absence of induction, both ParaB-phoB+ and PrhaB-phoB+ fusions exhibit a null phenotype. These data indicate that less PhoR than PhoB is required for transcriptional activation of the Pho regulon, which is consistent with their respective modes of action. We also used these fusions to study PhoU. Previously, we had constructed strains with precise Î”phoU mutations. However, we unexpectedly found that such Î”phoU mutants have a severe growth defect (P. M. Steed and B. L. Wanner, J. Bacteriol. 175 : 6797 â€“ 6809, 1993). They also readily give rise to compensatory mutants with lesions in phoB, phoR, or a pst gene, making their study particularly difficult. Here we found that, by using ParaB-phoB+, PrhaB-phoB+, or PrhaB-phoR+ fusions, we were able to overcome the extremely deleterious growth defect of a Pst+ Î”phoU mutant. The growth defect is apparently a consequence of high-level Pst synthesis resulting from <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of PhoB and PhoR synthesis in the absence of PhoU...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{mechanisms}} for regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression {{have been established}} for gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the regulation of these genes in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis {{has not yet been}} characterized. In this study, the B. subtilis rpsD gene, encoding ribosomal protein S 4, was found to be subject to <b>autogenous</b> <b>control.</b> In E. coli, rpsD is located in the alpha operon, and S 4 acts as the translational regulator for alpha operon expression, binding to a target site in the alpha operon mRNA. The target site for repression of B. subtilis rpsD by protein S 4 was localized by deletion and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to the leader region of the monocistronic rpsD gene. The B. subtilis rpsD leader exhibits little sequence homology to the E. coli alpha operon leader but may be able to form a pseudoknotlike structure similar to that found in E. coli...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{study of}} the ability of His 6 -tagged ribosomal protein S 7 of Thermus thermophilus to {{interact}} with the truncated S 12 â€“S 7 intercistronic region of str mRNA of Escherichia coli has been described. A minimal S 7 binding mRNA fragment {{is a part of the}} composite hairpin, with the termination codon of the S 12 cistron on one side and the initiation codon of the next S 7 cistron on the other. It has a length in the range of 63 â€“ 103 nucleotides. The 63 nucleotide mRNA fragment, which corresponds to a putative S 7 binding site, binds very poorly with S 7. Tight RNA structure models, which behave as integral systems and link the S 7 binding site with the translational regulation region of the hairpin, are suggested. This observation provides more insight into the mechanism of S 7 -directed <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of translational coupling of str mRNA...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of the <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of the S 10 ribosomal protein operon of Escherichia coli {{has suggested that the}} secondary or tertiary structure of the leader transcript is important for this regulation. We have therefore determined the secondary structure of the leader by enzyme digestion and chemical modification. Our results suggest that the 172 base leader exists in two forms, differing only immediately upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the first gene. We discuss the possibility that the equilibrium between these alternate structures is important for the L 4 -mediated regulation of translation of the S 10 operon. We have also determined the structure of several mutant transcripts. Correlation of these structures with the regulatory phenotypes suggest that a hairpin about 50 bases upstream of the first gene is essential for the control of translation of the operon. Finally, our results show that a two base substitution in an eight base loop destabilizes the attached stem...|$|E
40|$|Genetic and {{biochemical}} {{studies have}} established that Fur and iron mediate repression of Bordetella alcaligin siderophore system (alc) genes under iron-replete nutritional growth conditions. In this study, transcriptional analyses using Bordetella chromosomal alc-lacZ operon fusions determined that maximal alc gene transcriptional activity under iron starvation stress conditions {{is dependent on}} the presence of alcaligin siderophore. Mutational analysis and genetic complementation confirmed that alcaligin-responsive transcriptional activation of Bordetella alcaligin system genes is dependent on AlcR, a Fur-regulated AraC-like positive transcriptional regulator encoded within the alcaligin gene cluster. AlcR-mediated transcriptional activation is remarkably sensitive to inducer, occurring at extremely low alcaligin concentrations. This positive <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> circuit involving alcaligin siderophore as the inducer for AlcR-mediated transcriptional activation of alcaligin siderophore biosynthesis and transport genes coordinates environmental and intracellular signals for maximal expression of these genes under conditions in which the presence of alcaligin in the environment is perceived.

40|$|The peptide chain {{release factor}} 2 (RF 2) gene, prfB, was cloned from Salmonella typhimurium by DNA {{hybridization}} using the Escherichia coli prfB probe. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of prfB are 87. 0 % and 95. 6 % homologous between E. coli and S. typhimurium, respectively, including an in-frame premature UGA stop codon at position 26, {{the site of}} + 1 frameshift for mature RF 2 synthesis. The supK 584 mutation, which had been isolated as a recessive UGA suppressor in S. typhimurium, caused an opal (UGA) substitution at amino acid position 144 in the prfB gene. Complementation, reversion, and gene fusion analyses led {{to the conclusion that}} supK is a S. typhimurium RF 2 mutation and this opal RF 2 mutation generates a UGA suppressor activity, presumably because of inefficient translation termination due to the reduced cellular level of RF 2. In fact, suppression of the supK opal mutation results from a form of <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of RF 2 synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the Escherichia coli StpA protein was {{investigated}} and a functional comparison undertaken with the structurally analogous nucleoid protein H-NS. Analysis of stpA and hns expression indicated that although stpA transcript levels are {{much lower than}} those of hns, the two gene products are capable of both negative <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> and cross-regulation. Examination of cellular proteins in stpA, hns, or stpA-hns backgrounds revealed that StpA can repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes. Mechanistic parallels in regulation of gene expression are indicated by the ability of both proteins to inhibit transcription from promoters containing curved DNA sequences, and to form nucleoprotein structures that constrain DNA supercoils. Despite their functional similarities, each molecule is capable of independent activities. Thus, H-NS regulates a class of genes that are unaffected by StpA in vivo, whereas StpA has much stronger RNA chaperone activity in vitro. We therefore propose that in addition to its role as a molecular back-up of H-NS, StpA's superior effect on RNA may be exploited under some specific cellular conditions to promote differential gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Translation {{initiation}} region (TIR) of the rpsA mRNA encoding ribosomal protein S 1 {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient in Escherichia coli despite the absence of a canonical Shineâ€“Dalgarno-element. Its high efficiency is under strong negative <b>autogenous</b> <b>control,</b> a puzzling phenomenon as S 1 has no strict sequence specificity. To define sequence and structural elements responsible for translational efficiency and autoregulation of the rpsA mRNA, a series of rpsAâ€²â€“â€²lacZ chromosomal fusions bearing various mutations in the rpsA TIR was created and tested for Î²-galactosidase activity in the absence and presence of excess S 1. These in vivo results, as well as data obtained by in vitro techniques and phylogenetic comparison, allow us to propose a model for the structural and functional organization of the rpsA TIR specific for proteobacteria related to E. coli. According to the model, the high efficiency of translation initiation is provided by a specific fold of the rpsA leader forming a non-contiguous ribosome entry site, which is destroyed upon binding of free S 1 when it acts as an autogenous repressor...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} in heme {{biosynthesis}} is the formation of 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Mutations in two genes, hemA and hemL, result in auxotrophy for ALA in Salmonella typhimurium, but the roles played by these genes and the mechanism of ALA synthesis are not understood. I have cloned and sequenced the S. typhimurium hemA gene. The predicted polypeptide sequence for the HemA protein shows no similarity to known ALA synthases, and no ALA synthase activity was detected in extracts prepared from strains carrying the cloned hemA gene. Genetic analysis, DNA sequencing of amber mutations, and maxicell studies proved that the open reading frame identified in the DNA sequence encodes HemA. Another surprising {{finding of this study}} is that hemA lies directly upstream of prfA, which encodes peptide chain release factor 1 (RF- 1). A hemA::Kan insertion mutation, constructed in vitro, was transferred to the chromosome and used to show that these two genes form an operon. The hemA gene ends with an amber codon, recognized by RF- 1. I suggest a model for <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of prfA expression by translation reinitiation...|$|E
40|$|The 11 -gene S 10 ribosomal protein operon of Escherichia coli {{is under}} the <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> of L 4, {{the product of the}} third gene of the operon. Ribosomal protein L 4 {{inhibits}} both transcription and translation of the operon. Our in vivo studies indicated that L 4 regulates transcription by causing premature termination within the untranslated S 10 operon leader. We have now used an in vitro transcription system to study the effect of purified L 4 on expression of the S 10 operon. We find that the cell-free system reproduces the in vivo observations. Namely, in the absence of L 4, most of the RNA polymerases read through the termination site in the S 10 attenuator; the addition of L 4 results in increased termination at this site. However, RNA polymerase does not terminate at the S 10 attenuator, with or without L 4, unless an additional factor, protein NusA, is added to the transcription reaction. These results suggest that the attenuator in the S 10 operon is a NusA-dependent terminator whose efficiency is regulated by ribosomal protein L 4...|$|E
40|$|Ribosomal protein L 4 of Escherichia coli regulates {{expression}} {{of its own}} eleven gene S 10 operon both by inhibiting translation and by stimulating premature termination of transcription. Both regulatory processes presumably involve L 4 recognition of the S 10 leader RNA. To help define L 4 's regulatory target, we have investigated the protein's cognate target on 23 S rRNA. Binding of L 4 to various fragments of the 23 S rRNA was monitored by determining their ability to sequester L 4 in an in vitro transcription system and thereby eliminate the protein's effect on transcription. Using this approach we identified a region of about 110 bases within domain I of 23 S rRNA which binds L 4. A two base deletion within this region, close to the base to which L 4 has been cross-linked in intact 50 S subunits, eliminates L 4 binding. These results also confirm the prediction of the <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> model, that L 4 bound to its target on rRNA is not active in regulating transcription of the S 10 operon...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to Escherichia coli no molecular mechanism controlling the biosynthesis of ribosomal proteins has been elucidated in Gram-positive organisms. Here {{we show that}} {{the expression of the}} Bacillus subtilis infC-rpmI-rplT operon encoding translation factor IF 3 and the ribosomal proteins L 35 and L 20 is autoregulated by a complex transcription attenuation mechanism. It implicates a 200 -bp leader region upstream of infC which contains two conserved regulatory elements, one of which can act as a transcription terminator. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches we show that expression of the operon is regulated at the level of transcription elongation by a change {{in the structure of the}} leader mRNA which depends upon the presence of ribosomal protein L 20. L 20 binds to a phylogenetically conserved domain and provokes premature transcription termination at the leader terminator. Footprint and toeprint experiments support a regulatory model involving molecular mimicry between the L 20 -binding sites on 23 S rRNA and the mRNA. Our data suggest that Nomuraâ€™s model of ribosomal protein biosynthesis based on <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> and molecular mimicry is also valid in Gram-positive organism...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of the S 10 ribosomal protein operon of Escherichia coli was studied by using a lambda prophage containing {{the beginning of the}} S 10 operon (including the promoter, leader, and first one and one-half structural genes) fused to lacZ. The synthesis of the lacZ fusion protein encoded by the phage showed the expected inhibition during oversynthesis of ribosomal protein L 4, the autogenous regulatory protein of the S 10 operon. Moreover, the fusion gene responded to a nutritional shift-up {{in the same way that}} genuine ribosomal protein genes did. However, the gene did not exhibit the expected growth rate-dependent regulation during steady-state growth. Thus, the genetic information carried on the prophage is sufficient for L 4 -mediated <b>autogenous</b> <b>control</b> and a normal nutritional shift-up response but is not sufficient for steady-state growth rate-dependent control. These results suggest that, at least for the 11 -gene S 10 ribosomal protein operon, additional regulatory processes are required to coordinate the synthesis of ribosomal proteins with cell growth rate and, furthermore, that sequences downstream of the proximal one and one-half genes of the operon are involved in this control...|$|E
