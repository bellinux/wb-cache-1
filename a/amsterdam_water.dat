40|$|Since March 1995 <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Water</b> Supply {{has applied}} {{biological}} activated carbon filtration (BACF) {{in the treatment}} process of the Leiduin plant. In this plant (capacity 70 × 106 m 3 /y) pretreated River Rhine water is infiltrated in the dune area, west of Amsterdam, for artificial recharge. Post treatment comprises rapid sand filtration, ozonation, hardness removal, biological activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration. At the start the carbon reactivation frequency was set at 18 months, based on removal efficiencies for AOX (adsorbable organic halogens), DOC, pesticides and micropollutants. After four years of operation of a pilot plant (10 m 3 /hour) in parallel with the full-scale plant, the remaining removal capacity and the break-through profile of the carbon filters was investigated. In contrast to the full-scale plant, no carbon reactivation was applied in the pilot plant during the operation of 4 years. Spiking experiments were carried out after ozonation, in the influent of the biological activated carbon filtration with a cocktail of different pesticides after 1. 5, 3 and 4 years. Influent concentrations varied between 2 to 10 μg/l. Without carbon reactivation the filter effluent still complies with the Dutch drinking water standards and guide lines, {{as well as with}} the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Water</b> Supply standards: DOC is less than 2 mg/l (actually 1. 2 mg/l) and AOX remains below 5 μg/l. After four years, with spiking concentrations of 2 μg/l still no pesticide break-through was observed in the two-stage biological activated carbon filtration process. It can be concluded that a running time of 3 years between two reactivations in the two stage biological active carbon filtration is achievable, without negatively affecting the finished water quality. Average DOC concentrations will increase up to 1. 2 mg/l, from 1 mg/l with running times of 2 years. After four years or 100, 000 bedvolumes the AOC content is equal to or lower than 10 μg/l after biological activated carbon filtration. With slow sand filtration at the end and as polishing step AOC will be less than 10 - 5 μg/l. With every extension of six months duration time a saving of ε 305, 000 on reactivation costs is possible. With every 6 month extension of the running time of the carbon filters a saving of ε 610, 000 is realised on the reactivation costs of the Leiduin treatment plant...|$|E
40|$|<b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Water</b> Supply (AWS) uses Biological Activated Carbon Filtration (BACF) for {{the removal}} of natural organic matter in general and the removal of organic micropollutants in particular. In order to {{minimize}} costs and environmental burden, {{it is important to know}} whether successive reactivations of carbon reduces its effectivity, and whether pesticides are effectively removed after prolonged running times of the carbon filters. The first aspect avoids the necessity of carbon replacement (i. e. costs), while the second aspect reduces the reactivation frequency (i. e. environmental burden). In a future extension scheme, AWS considers the use of an Integrated Membrane System (IMS), and it is important to know whether the application of BACF is beneficial in the IMS. Six years of operation of BACF in the River- Lake Waterworks (31 million m 3 /year) have shown that successive reactivations do not affect the DOC removal capacity of the carbon. Three years of operation of BACF in the River-Dune Waterworks (70 million m 3 /year) have shown that the carbon retains its pesticide removal capacity.

In addition, several insect groups were monitored in pitfalls and plots, and along transects. The dune grasslands of the Taraxaco-Galietum veri show a strong increase of characteristic plant species and a recovery of rabbits, butterflies and grasshoppers. In the dune grasslands of the Phleo-Tortuletum ruraliformis vegetation responds more slowly to sod cutting, probably due to lower nutrient availability. Number of rabbits and the grasshopper Oedipoda caerulescens increased as well.

Although the number of individuals per group and most weather conditions also showed some relation to flight distances, their influence was relatively unimportant compared to that of hunting regime and habitat structure.

Research was carried out with ultra-low-pressure membranes and an organophosphonate antiscalant (Permatreat 191). With this antiscalant no biofouling was introduced upon its use. Because of its low environmental impact, sulphuric acid was preferred above hydrochloric acid, but the barium sulfate scaling risk was increased. Experiments were conducted with both types of acid in increasing recovery steps from 80 % up to 90 %.

To become climate neutral, Waternet will need to achieve a reduction of GHG-emissions of approximately 97. 2 kton/year. Setting this goal puts them {{at the forefront of}} public utilities moving towards more sustainable practices. In order to reach the ambitions, a mitigation policy plan up to 2020 will be devised. The aim of this research was to explore mitigation measures for GHG-emission reduction. The main focus of mitigation measures is on the Amsterdam watercycle, since it offers much potential for innovative GHG mitigation, such as thermal energy, chemical energy and resource recovery. Out of twenty-six available measures, four reduction measures and six compensation measures were evaluated. By means of a multi-criteria analysis and marginal abatement cost curves, insights were gained on climate impact, cost-effectiveness, service delivery, and Waternet’s influence and autonomy in realization of the mitigation measures. Of the evaluated measures, wind energy production and shower water heat recovery have the highest potential for the reduction of GHG-emissions, respectively 37. 3 kton/yr and 28. 7 kton/yr. The total package of ten mitigation options could lead to a GHG-emission reduction of 88. 1 kton/yr. The remaining 9. 1 kton/year can be compensated by other watercycle reduction and compensation measures which requires further research, or by the purchase of green electricity and/or carbon credits. In conclusion, Waternet can achieve its goal of climate neutrality in 2020 by implementing the package of researched mitigation measures with a minimal procurement of carbon credits and/or green electricity...|$|R
40|$|The ‘Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen’ is a {{dune area}} near Haarlem in the {{calcareous}} Dune district. Since 1851 {{it is the}} water catchment area of Amsterdam. Due to the lowering of the groundwater level the moist dune slacks have disappeared gradually. Since 1957 infiltration {{of water from the}} river Rhine takes place for the <b>water</b> supply of <b>Amsterdam.</b> This <b>water,</b> rich in nutrients, causes among others a ruderal vegetation of high forbs and poor in species instead of the former species-rich dune slack vegetation. Since about 1970 locally a divergent vegetation is developing. In the so-called Groot Zwarteveld not only dune slack species have established, but also a number of species characteristic for dunes poor in lime and nutrients: Empetrum nigrum, Erica tetralix, Dryopteris cristata, Osmunda regalis and some Sphagnum species. The most remarkable species is Sphagnum imbricatum, which has been refound in the Netherlands after a long period of (seeming?) absence. It was its first observation in the Dune district. The species mentioned were not known from this dune area in former times. This vegetation development {{is a result of the}} new habitat. Firstly this dune area is superficially decalcified, stimulated by former agricultural management owing to which the humus content of the soil has increased. Secondly a layer of nutrient-poor rainwater has been formed on the nutrient-rich riverwater. This is caused by the very slow water movement in this area (without drains) and also by the small groundwater fluctuations (contrarily to most other places with a rapid water movement through the soil and great fluctuations in the groundwater). An important fact is that the vegetation is mown annually since 1974. A similar vegetation development takes place in other parts of the Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen where similar habitats have originated...|$|R
