In May 1999, as THSRC faced {{difficulties in}} raising capital, {{the government of}} Japan promised soft loans if THSRC switched to TSC. Although Eurotrain promised to match TSC's financial offerings, the Eschede train disaster in combination with TSC offered the newer 700 Series Shinkansen, convinced THSRC to reopen core system bid, and ultimately resulting in TSC selected as the preferred rolling-stock supplier in December 1999. Although Eurotrain eventually conceded in the bid, in February 2001 it filed for a US$800 million damage claim against THSRC at the Singapore International <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Centre.</b> After a lengthy arbitration process, the court ruled in March 2004 that THSRC should pay a compensation for the US$32.4 million Eurotrain spent on development and US$35.7 million for unjust enrichment.

2500|$|In Malaysia, {{the master}} {{franchisee}} agreement was terminated on 5 January 2017 by La Kaffa International due to contractual dispute with its country master franchisee, Loob Holdings. This legal dispute {{attracted the attention}} of local media and is currently in arbitration in Singapore. La Kaffa held a press conference in Kuala Lumpur announcing it would be taking over the Malaysian Chatime business operations and development with immediate effect. [...] This however appears to be largely incorrect with Loob Holdings rebranding 161 out of 165 Chatime outlets to Tealive brand on 17 February 2017. Due to Loob Holdings' alleged use of unapproved ingredients (which were later found out to be collaborations with other brands for locallization purposes [...] ), questionable practices, and a blatant breach of the terms of contract, La Kaffa International director Chen Zhao sought an injunction against the former master franchisee from operating a similar (bubble tea) business in Malaysia. On 29 May 2017, the High Court dismissed the injunction bid by La Kaffa International, against Loob Holding Sdn Bhd, from carrying a similar business as Chatime. Judicial Commissioner Wong Kian Kheong, in his oral judgement, ruled that the injunction would cause great risk of injustice to Loob Holding and its business and also associates. The court also found that the franchise termination by La Kaffa was done in bad faith. While both companies have taken their dispute to the Singapore International <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Centre,</b> La Kaffa reportedly tries to persuade LooB Holdings to settle this matter outside court.|$|E

40|$|Arbitration is {{of growing}} {{importance}} across the United Arab Emirate (UAE) {{and there are}} various arbitral regimes with different levels of international respectability within the federation. Despite {{the existence of a}} draft federal arbitration law there is no respective federal law in place. The economy of the UAE has expanded over the last 5 decades and with economic development has come an increase in commercial activities, which has led to higher incidence of commercial disputes on an equally high rate. Arbitration has not only become a favourite route for domestic commercial transactions but it also applies to international commercial transactions and investment disputes. With the increase of arbitration cases in the UAE, it has become necessary to pass a federal law for arbitration in general in order to fill the legal vacuum in the present civil and procedures law No. 11 / 1992. Passing a federal law to regulate arbitral proceedings would enhance the legal position of the UAE and not just a part of it in attracting international investment. This will in turn lead to improved economic growth and the encouragement of foreign investments. The significance of enacting a new arbitration law is that it would also help to end the conflict between the existing nine <b>arbitration</b> <b>centres</b> in the UAE with regard to the enforcement of local and foreign judgments. The different regulations and laws for each centre furthermore creates uncertainties about how to enforce awards between these centres. This begs the question of when will this important Gulf Cooperation Council member state have a deserving and fit for purpose federal law on commercial arbitration. This thesis evaluates the draft federal law, investigates the socio-legal challenges preventing the achievement of the noble aim of implementation of a federal law and evaluates the existing regimes and bodies regulating arbitration in the federating parts of the UAE...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to shed light on the area of family law in Albanian society in light of the absence of Islamic laws and courts. This research attempts to achieve that by discussing marriage, divorce and inheritance and their respective rulings in Albanian family law and civil law. This research is important because it draws attention to the painful legal reality that Albanian Muslims live in these times by discussing their legal, familial and social situations and the related judicial and Shari’ah matters. This research relies upon a research methodology of gathering the literature related to this topic and an analytical methodology of analysing the academic material and finding solutions. Additionally, this research proposes solutions to the issues that arise due to the absence of Islamic laws. This research has come to a number of conclusions and recommendations. The most important ones include that the Albanian Family Code {{is very different from the}} Islamic Shari’ah and is manmade law. Also, the Albanian government needs to prepare for the Muslims that which will protect their rights in issues related to family law by recognizing Islam as its religion in the Constitution and legislating based on the Shari’ah. Additionally, this can be done by establishing Shari’ah courts that judge using the Shari’ah or by establishing judicial bodies within the existing courts that will judge using the Shari’ah. This research also finds it necessary to establish Islamic <b>arbitration</b> <b>centres</b> and organizations recognized by the government that fully comprehend the Shari’ah and Albanian law to resolve the issues of the Albanian Muslims in family matters Lastly, the Islamic Affairs Committee needs to expand itsauthority to include supervising the application of the Islamic rulings in relation to family matters and to be the final authority in making judgements in family law cases so that it can document marriage contracts, divorce, and inheritance because it is the official body that represents Albanian Muslims. The researcher interviewed some relevant individuals including the Head of the Islamic Affairs Committee to propose solutions similar to these; he determined that the Committee is not seeking to achieve that because the society, according to them, is not ready for that and because the government is secular so the Islamic Affairs Committee cannot take on these authorities in accordance with the vision of the Head of the Committee...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the judiciary and arbitration must be based upon integration and cooperation and not upon competition and tension. From this point, the competent court must play the vital role of supporting and assisting the arbitration process during its various stages. To the extent that this relation is successful and harmonized, arbitration will be effective in resolving disputes within the shortest time and at the least expense. Judicial involvement in arbitral proceedings occurs during several stages of arbitration. This involvement starts with the competent court‟s decision to abstain from considering a case involving a dispute over an agreement that includes an arbitration clause. Court instead intervenes to enforce the arbitration agreement, supervising {{the selection of the}} arbitral tribunal and assisting in that process whenever the need arises. Thereafter, the court monitors the course of the arbitral proceedings by considering claims for the arbitrators' challenge and dismissal and, if such claims are successful, filling the resulting vacancy. Court Intervention extends to include an important and critical stage of the arbitral proceedings, which is the stage of pleading before the competent court. Whereas the competent court enjoys the power to enforce judicial decisions, the arbitral tribunal does not have such power. In this context, judicial assistance is indispensable to the arbitral tribunal, for example, in resolving a preliminary point, issuing a subpoena to a witness who refuses to appear before the tribunal, consolidating arbitral proceedings, ordering an uncooperative party to provide documents related to the dispute, rendering interim and conservatory measures, and extending the time limit for rendering the arbitration award. In considering the significance of the court's assistance of and support for arbitration at the procedural stage, the importance and contribution of this study is in its exploration of the pivots and patterns of the expected judicial review and assistance based upon both the provisions and rules of arbitration and judicial precedents. Interviews conducted with senior judges, arbitrators and chiefs of international <b>arbitration</b> <b>centres</b> provide a rich tributary that enhances this study and supports it with vast and vital experience and with fresh information that cannot be found in any previous scientific research of this topic. In short, this study focuses upon the conception of the judicial involvement in supporting arbitral proceedings inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and upon evaluating this involvement in comparison with the involvement of the judiciary {{in the rest of the}} GCC states and international applications in this regard. Moreover, the study offers proposals and recommendations to the Saudi legislator in particular and to the Gulf legislator in general, and draws a model framework for the {{relationship between}} the judiciary and arbitration during the proceedings stage.

40|$|The bulk of {{international}} commercial disputes are resolved by national courts. In Asia, regional international <b>arbitration</b> <b>centres</b> {{in places such}} as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo have also been partaking in these exercises albeit at varying levels of popularity. While commercial arbitrations remain popular, the influence of these bodies in driving convergence has been questioned. This has been in part due to the confidential nature of their awards and their ad hoc nature. The uptake {{of international}} commercial instruments in the region is growing, but the extent of harmonization of international commercial law remains weak. Even in countries such as Australia that have taken steps to adopt international commercial instruments, the efficacy of international law has been called into question. Application of these international rules have not been promising. In this regard, the lacklustre performance of the Convention for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) could be cited. There is no doubt that judicial institutions {{play a crucial role in}} achieving the lofty ideal of harmonisation. At [* 32] the other end of the spectrum, the establishment of fully blown regional international courts for commercial disputes is further away. This has been hampered by the obvious sovereignty concerns and the relative success of international commercial arbitration. It has been a little over a year since Singapore, a country that is already one of the most preferred arbitration destinations in the world, moved to establish an International Commercial Court, a unique institution that pushed the frontiers of cross border commercial dispute resolution. The Court heard its first case in May 2015 on a referral from the High Court. This case involved a dispute between Indonesian and Australian mining companies. n 1 The court is unique in that it allows appointment of foreign judges and dispenses with the application of Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s Rules of Evidence. Page 1 Naturally all Singapore regular courts are expected to apply the Singapore Rules of Evidence in disputes before them. However, an exception is made in regards to matters coming before the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC), where on application of the parties the Singapore Rules of Evidence may be disapplied pursuant to Order 110, Rule 23. n 2 As will be discussed later in this essay, this hybrid institution promises to combine the best of international commercial arbitration and that of judicial settlement of disputes. Elsewhere in Asia, we have had the Dubai International Financial Centre Courts of First Instance and Appeal, the Qatar International Court and Dispute Resolution Centre and, most recently, the Abu Dhabi Global Market Courts. The need for specialised commercial division has long been recognised in places like London, Delaware North, and Victoria in Australia. It is one thing to have a commercial division and yet another to make these divisions have an international orientation. This paper seeks to put these developments in comparative perspectives and examine normative, procedural, institutional issues and practical challenges that such endeavours entail. It will also assess and critically examine the legal/legislative infrastructure required to accommodate the establishment of hybrid judicial organs for cross border commercial disputes...|$|R

40|$|International {{arbitration}} {{has developed}} into a global system of adjudication, dealing with disputes arising {{from a variety of}} legal relationships: between states, between private commercial actors, and between private and public entities. It operates to a large extent according to its own rules and dynamics - a transnational justice system rather independent of domestic and international law. In response to its growing importance and use by disputing parties, international arbitration has become increasingly institutionalized, professionalized, and judicialized. At the same time, it has gained significance beyond specific disputes and indeed contributes to the shaping of law. Arbitrators have therefore become not only adjudicators, but transnational lawmakers. This has raised concerns over the legitimacy of international arbitration. Practising Virtue looks at international arbitration from the 'inside', with an emphasis on its transnational character. Instead of concentrating on the national and international law governing international arbitration, it focuses on those who practise international arbitration, in order to understand how it actually works, what its sources of authority are, and what demands of legitimacy it must meet. Putting those who practise <b>arbitration</b> into the <b>centre</b> of the system of international arbitration allows us to appreciate {{the way in which they}} contribute to the development of the law they apply.
