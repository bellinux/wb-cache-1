40|$|Section 8 D. a. {{applies to}} a company’s {{aggregate}} gross reserve before reinsurance. The reserve calculation requires {{a projection of}} future year-by-year cash flows, which includes such items as investment earnings and general insurance expenses. If a company has ceded 100 % of the business to an authorized reinsurer by use of coinsurance, the assets and net liabilities are {{no longer on the}} ceding company’s books. Additionally, the administration is also generally transferred to the reinsurer. In such circumstances, the projection of future cash flows is “hypothetical ” in that one must assume a starting asset portfolio, future investment strategy, future general insurance expenses, and so on. Furthermore, the ceding company generally does not have the data or systems to determine the reserves and must rely on the <b>assuming</b> <b>company.</b> Since the <b>assuming</b> <b>company</b> is required to calculate the reserves on both direct and assumed business, may the ceding company use the reserves as reported by the reinsurer in the reinsurer’s annual statement...|$|E

30|$|The {{basis of}} the {{following}} considerations on the moral advertisement of disinfectants was a theory developed by the German sociologist Nico Stehr, who developed {{the theory of the}} ‘Moralisation of the market’ [14]. He <b>assumed</b> that <b>companies</b> take more responsibility for society and act morally. The environmental consciousness of society has been increasing over the last years [15] and leads to a rising demand for goods that are produced with moral background [14]. As a consequence, companies are willing to accept financial costs that result from moral considerations and put the interests of society over their own [14]. Critics say that companies do not act morally but only try to use moral for marketing purposes [16]. Following the theory of Stehr, it was <b>assumed</b> that <b>companies</b> would act morally and advertise disinfectants for private users only when they are medically needed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{bankruptcy}} prediction literature generally ignores corporate {{ownership and}} <b>assumes</b> <b>companies</b> are independent economic entities. In Continental Europe this latter assumption does not hold, {{due to the}} importance of business groups. Using a sample of mostly non-quoted Belgian medium and large sized companies, we show that the predictive power of several accounting ratios that are commonly used in bankruptcy prediction models (e. g. perfonnance, leverage, liquidity and efficiency) is different for group member companies as compared to stand-alone companies. By exploiting these differences in relative importance, model fit can be improved without adding any new infonnation. Perfonnance can be increased further by directly adjusting for group related factors, e. g. by including a measure offmancial health of the group as a whole. Finally, it is shown that group adjustments can also improve the fit of some well-known existing prediction models...|$|R
