5|$|While {{over the}} Atlantic Ocean, a National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) C-130 {{hurricane}} hunter aircraft flew into Gladys on October 1 on a research mission. The {{mission was to}} study the storm and use the information to improve seeding operations for the now-defunct Project Stormfury.|$|E
5|$|During the Atlantic and {{northeast}} Pacific hurricane seasons, the Hurricane Specialists Unit (HSU) issues routine tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans. When tropical storm or hurricane conditions are expected within 48hours, the center issues watches and warnings via {{the news media}} and National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) Weather Radio.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season {{forecasts}} by Colorado State University {{called for}} 14named storms and 7hurricanes, of which three {{were expected to}} attain major hurricane status. The National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) later issued its initial forecast, which predicted 13 to 17named storms, 7 to 10hurricanes and three to fivemajor hurricanes. After several revisions in the projected number of storms, NOAA and CSU lowered their forecasts {{by the middle of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) is a {{government}} agency {{that is part of}} the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), operating under the control of the National Weather Service (NWS), which in turn is part of the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) of the United States Department of Commerce (DoC).|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI. The forecasts include weekly or monthly assessments of the significant factors that help {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA). According to CSU, the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9.6tropical storms, 5.9hurricanes, and 2.3major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12named storms, of which five to seven reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell {{far short of the}} actual activity of the season.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA), has 12.1named storms; of these, 6.4reach hurricane strength; and 2.7major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Additionally, the 1950–2000 CSU average for a normal season is 9.6named storms, of these 5.9reach hurricane strength, and 2.3become major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts ofhurricane {{activity}} are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration,</b> has six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The 1994forecast predicted that a total of 10storms would form, of which six of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast also projected that three of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 {{geologist}} Thomas Jaggar {{founded the}} Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The facility {{was taken over}} in 1919 by the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> and in 1924 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which marked the start of continuous volcano observation on Hawaii island. The next century {{was a period of}} thorough investigation, marked by contributions from many top scientists. The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns. Since that time, advances have enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation (e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages).|$|E
5|$|In early 2003 the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) Fisheries Office for Law Enforcement {{finished}} {{its investigation}} and charged Tran and Yu; Tai Loong Hong Marine Products Ltd., of Hong Kong, {{for whom the}} fins had been bought; and Chien Tan Nguyen, captain of the KD II, with 26 counts of violating the SFPA. They were assessed fines of $620,000, the highest civil penalty ever levied for {{a violation of the}} act.|$|E
5|$|Norman is {{also home}} of the National Weather Center, a {{cooperative}} research effort between the University of Oklahoma and the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> that houses a number of weather- and climate-related organizations; the city is also the proposed location of a future National Weather Museum. As {{a result of this}} on-going academic and public weather research, several private meteorological businesses are present in the city, including Weathernews Americas, Inc., Vieux and Associates, Inc., Weather Decision Technologies, WeatherBank, Inc., and Computational Geosciences, Inc.|$|E
5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} expert William M. Gray and {{his associates}} at Colorado State University issue forecasts of hurricane activity each year, separately from the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA). Gray's team determined {{the average number of}} storms per season between 1950 and 2000 to be 9.6tropical storms, 5.9hurricanes, and 2.3major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category3). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12named storms, of which 5 to 7 reach hurricane strength and 1 to 3 become major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season {{forecasts}} {{issued by}} Colorado State University (CSU) called for fourteen named storms and seven hurricanes, of which three {{were expected to}} attain major hurricane status. The National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) later issued its initial forecast, which predicted nine to fourteen named storms, four to seven hurricanes, and one to three major hurricanes. After several revisions in the projected number of named storms, both agencies lowered their forecasts {{by the middle of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Since 1984, {{forecasts}} of hurricane activity {{have been issued}} before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA). According to CSU, the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9.6tropical storms, 5.9hurricanes, and 2.3major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 12.1named storms, of which 6.4reach hurricane strength and 2.7become major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} scales {{that are not}} officially used {{by any of the}} Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres or the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres. However they are used by other organizations, such as the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration.</b> An example of such scale is the Integrated Kinetic Energy index, which {{measures}} the destructive potential of the storm surge; it works on a scale that ranges from one to six, with six having the highest destructive potential.|$|E
5|$|Titan {{was funded}} {{primarily}} by the US Department of Energy through ORNL. Funding was sufficient to purchase the CPUs {{but not all of}} the GPUs so the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> agreed to fund the remaining nodes in return for computing time. ORNL scientific computing chief Jeff Nichols noted that Titan cost approximately $60 million upfront, of which the NOAA contribution was less than $10 million, but precise figures were covered by non-disclosure agreements. The full term of the contract with Cray included $97 million, excluding potential upgrades.|$|E
5|$|Two National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) Research planes {{conducted}} experiments into Caroline. The {{experiments were}} {{to study and}} measure the wind velocity and the environment inside and around the eye {{as well as the}} boundary layer of the hurricane. The results of the experiments concluded that Caroline had a higher dissipation rate than normal hurricanes, with the dissipating rate averaging at 30%. This conclusion suggested that energy in a hurricane dissipating internally above the surface layer is two times higher than energy dissipating at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E
5|$|An {{off-season}} Atlantic hurricane is {{a recorded}} tropical or subtropical cyclone {{that existed in}} the Atlantic basin outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all Atlantic tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity is known to be between August and October. In the off-season, storms are most likely to occur in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of , there have been 81 off-season cyclones in the Atlantic hurricane database, which began in 1851. In addition, there were six storms before 1851, and one hurricane in 1863 that {{is not part of the}} official database.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} turned northward and {{was seen as}} a threat to the Hawaiian Islands, officials in the Papahanaumokuakea requested that all 17personnel in the region be evacuated. Several days before the storm passed through the islands, an AC-130 aircraft was flown to the area and evacuated the people stationed on Tern Island, while a National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> vessel evacuated the temporary residents on Laysan Island. Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. All of the structures were undamaged; however, two small natural habitat islands, Round and Disappearing Islands, were affected substantially. The former lost some land area and the latter was completely washed away.|$|E
5|$|Bitterman et al. in 1986 and 1995 {{showed that}} {{darkness}} and caffeine would delay {{the onset of}} changes to brain electrical activity in rats. In the years since, research on central nervous system toxicity has centred on methods of prevention and safe extension of tolerance. Sensitivity to central nervous system oxygen toxicity {{has been shown to}} be affected by factors such as circadian rhythm, drugs, age, and gender. In 1988, Hamilton et al. wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> to establish oxygen exposure limits for habitat operations. Even today, models for the prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all the results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Customers {{with their}} own {{installations}} include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes data from the Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes a breach of the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. In December 1991, CSU issued its first forecast for the year and predicted that 1992 would see eight named storms, four hurricanes, and one major hurricane. CSU also issued a forecast in April, June and August, however no revisions were made to the numbers of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricane predicted in 1992.|$|E

A normal season {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. Neither CSU or WRC issued a forecast on the number of major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. In early 1985, WRC predicted 8named storms and 5hurricanes. The CSU forecast for April 1985 was 11named storms and 8hurricanes. This forecast was not revised in June. In their August outlook, CSU predicted 10named storms and 7hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts like Dr. William M. Gray, {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA), has six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The July 23, 1983 forecast predicted that after the slow start to the season, that a total of eight storms would form, and five of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status. However, the predictions proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming {{by the end of the}} season and three of those reaching hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU). A normal season {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA), has eleven named storms, of which six reach hurricane strength and two of those become major hurricanes. On May 31, 1989, the CSU forecast that there would be seven named storms, four of which would intensify into a hurricane; there was no prediction of the number of major hurricanes. Prior to the season, the Weather Research Center (WRC) in Houston, Texas also issued a forecast, which called for ten named storms and six hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 and 2004, the US National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> {{carried out}} two expeditions to Titanic. The first, carried out between 22 June and 2 July 2003, {{performed}} four dives in two days. Its key aims were {{to assess the}} current condition of the wreck site and carry out scientific observations to support ongoing research. The stern section, which had previously received relatively little attention from explorers, was specifically targeted for analysis. The microbial colonies aboard Titanic were also a key focus of investigation. The second expedition, from 27 May– 12 June 2004, saw the return of Robert Ballard to Titanic nearly 20 years after he discovered it. The expedition spent 11 days on the wreck, carrying out high-resolution mapping using video and stereoscopic still images.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5|$|On May17, the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> {{issued its}} {{seasonal}} forecast for the 2004 central Pacific season, predicting {{four or five}} tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin. Likewise to the SMN, near average activity was expected {{largely as a result}} of a Neutral ENSO. The organization issued its experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season {{forecasts}} by the Colorado State University (CSU) {{called for}} a below average season, with 10 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) issued its first outlook on May24, predicting a total of 9–15 named storms, 4–8 hurricanes, and 1–3 major hurricanes; both agencies noted {{the possibility of an}} El Niño, which limits tropical cyclone activity. Following two pre-season storms, the CSU updated their forecast to 13 named storms, 5 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, while the NOAA upped their forecast numbers to 12–17 named storms, 5–8 hurricanes, and 2–3 major hurricanes on August9. Despite this, activity far surpassed the predictions.|$|E

5|$|The National Weather Center, {{located in}} Norman, houses a unique {{collection}} of university, state, federal, {{and private sector}} organizations that work together to improve the understanding of events related to the Earth's atmosphere. Norman lies within Tornado Alley, a geographic region where tornadic activity is particularly frequent and intense. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area, including Norman, is the most tornado-prone area in the world. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC), {{a branch of the}} National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA) is located at the NWC. SPC forecasts severe storm and tornado outbreaks nationwide. Additionally, research is conducted at the co-located National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), which includes field research and operates various experimental weather radars.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} the season, several {{meteorological}} services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> (NOAA), United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO), Coastal Carolina University (CCU), Colorado State University (CSU), and North Carolina State University (NCSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014–16 El Niño event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of between 66 and 103 units.|$|E
5|$|Blacknose sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and in turn}} fall prey to larger sharks. Like other members of their family, they exhibit a viviparous mode of reproduction in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. The females give birth to three to six young in late spring or early summer, either annually or biennually, after a gestation period of eight to 11 months. This species is not known to attack humans, though {{it has been documented}} performing a threat display towards divers. It is of moderate commercial and recreational importance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened. In 2009, the U.S. National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> announced the populations of the blacknose shark off the United States are being overfished, and proposed new conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{produced}} {{nitrogen oxides}} in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood {{to result in}} degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised. It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administration</b> in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.|$|E
