40|$|The article {{looks at}} {{the impact of the}} {{introduction}} of Union citizenship on the scope of application of the Treaty. In particular it considers how the citizenship provisions have affected the personal and the material scope of the Treaty. By virtue of Article 17 EC the personal scope of the Treaty is expanded so that any Union citizen, and not only the migrant citizen, now falls within the personal scope of the Treaty. The significance of this finding then depends on the definition of the material scope of the Treaty, i. e. on the identification of the rights that Union citizens can claim qua citizens. In this respect, it is clear that Union citizens have a right to move; and a right to reside in any of the Member States (subject to limitations and conditions). Union citizens have also a right to equal treatment deriving from Article 12 EC. In this respect, the article argues that such a right to equal treatment is not merely an <b>ancillary</b> <b>right</b> which is conditional upon migration; rather, Article 12 EC is a self-standing right pertaining to all those who fall within the personal scope of the Treaty. As a result, Article 12 EC is capable of being invoked by static union citizens to challenge reverse discrimination...|$|E

40|$|The European Commission {{consulted}} between March 23 and June 15, 2016 on {{the role}} of publishers in the copyright value chain. This response by the European Copyright Society (1) analyses why an intervention creating a new neighbouring right for publishers is being considered in the wake of recent decisions by the CJEU in Reprobel (2015), and the German BGH (2016) in Verlegeranteil; (2) examines the rationale for neighbouring rights; (3) advises against double layering of rights; (4) assesses the implications of a neighbouring right for publishers for “open access” policies; and (5) identifies regulatory design flaws in the introduction of an <b>ancillary</b> <b>right</b> for press publishers in Germany (2013) and Spain (2014). In conclusion it is argued that value generation in itself is not a good case for intellectual property protection, and that the onus of proof needs to lie with the proponents of a new right. They need to show what the costs are, who will carry them, that the costs are necessary and proportionate, and provide verifiable evidence. A version of this paper has been accepted for publication by European Intellectual Property Review [E. I. P. R. ] (September 2016). It is also available on SSRN [URL] and on the website of the European Copyright Society: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{determine}} how remedies inter-relate with the European rules on international private law. The thesis is broadly separated into two Parts, the first Part discussing the relationship between remedies and the general part of European international private law, and the second Part discussing the relationship between remedies and the specific parts of European international private law. From this analysis, three threads can be drawn. First, primary right, secondary right and the court order vindicating them are so closely related that, ideally, the same law ought to apply to all. They form a unit which should remain unbroken. Second, the distinction between substantive and ancillary rights is of crucial importance for remedies {{in the context of}} both jurisdiction and choice of law. Ancillary rights are those which arise by virtue of the trial process itself, whereas substantive rights are, or are perceived to be, created prior to the trial. The orthodox jurisdictional and choice of law rules only apply to substantive rights. Ancillary rights have their own, separate, rules. With one exception, the only court with jurisdiction over those ancillary rights is the court with jurisdiction over the substantive right to which they are ancillary. Furthermore, the lex fori must be applied to determine the nature of the <b>ancillary</b> <b>right.</b> Third, there exists a rule of exclusion which is of crucial importance for remedies in the context of both the enforcement of foreign judgments and choice of law. This rule of exclusion applies where the application of the foreign court order, whether applied by virtue of enforcing a foreign judgment, or applied by virtue of applying a foreign governing law under the choice of law process, would be too inconvenient for the forum courtâs machinery. Under such circumstances, the forum court can disapply the foreign law and substitute the closest order it can from its own legal system. </p...|$|E
40|$|In December 2005, the WTO {{responded to}} the HIV/AIDS {{pharmaceutical}} crisis in the least developed world by voting {{to make the first}} permanent amendment to the WTO Agreements since their original negotiation during the Uruguay Round. New Article 31 bis will amend the TRIPS Agreement to permit compulsory manufacturing licenses in order to facilitate supply of needed pharmaceuticals to those countries lacking the technological capacity to produce these drugs themselves. The amendment reflects a substantial shift in the essential TRIPS bargain, constituting a significant give-back to those developing countries that specialize in the generic production of pharmaceuticals. To date, however, there has been no significant utilization of this facility (which was provisionally established in August 2003). Rather, patent holders have determined - perhaps under the threat of these newly authorized compulsory licenses - to supply these markets directly with HIV/AIDS drugs at prices much lower than those prevailing in developed country markets. As a condition of doing so, both the pharmaceutical industry and those WTO members that champion their interests have sought and obtained limitations on the parallel trade of drugs subject to differential pricing. This shift away from TRIPS' prior neutrality on parallel trade may well spill-over into additional areas beyond the particular context in which the amendment developed. We make the following observations: 1. TRIPS was previously neutral on the permissibility of parallel trade. Until now, WTO members were free to either permit or prohibit the import and sale of intellectual property ("IP") -covered goods that had been placed into commerce in foreign markets. That is, IP-right holders {{may or may not be}} provided with an <b>ancillary</b> <b>right</b> to block the importation and sale of grey-market goods. 2. Parallel trade has not been a solution to assuring the supply of needed drugs to AIDS-stricken regions of the least developed world. Quite simply, there has not been an adequate source-of-supply at prices that the afflicted Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are capable of paying. 3. Compulsory licensing now has a clear legal basis as a result of the TRIPS amendment (and the provisional rule in place since August 2003), yet virtually no countries have resorted to compulsory licensing. 4. HIV/AIDS drug prices in LDC markets have fallen significantly, which suggests that pharmaceutical manufacturers have determined to supply LDC markets directly, instead of permitting LDC demand to be met by generic producers utilizing the amended TRIPS rules on compulsory licensing. Their determination to do so may have been motivated, at least in part, by the threat of compulsory licenses. 5. Both the WTO community and the pharmaceutical industry have embraced a policy of differential prices: high prices in developed markets and dramatically lower prices in LDC markets. There has also been significant differentiation in products supplied. 6. Effective controls on parallel trade are necessary to attain effective differential pricing. Without limits, low-priced drugs supplied to LDC markets would flow back, by operation of arbitrageurs, into high priced markets. This would undercut the economic returns in the high priced markets and starve LDCs of their supply. Thus, at least within the drug sector, TRIPS formal neutrality as applied to parallel trade cannot stand. 7. The European Union and the United States have non-IP restrictions that sharply reduce the likelihood of parallel trade in pharmaceuticals. The observed positional shift in TRIPS from neutrality on parallel trade to opposition may well spill-over from the HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals context into a larger rethinking of the appropriateness of IP-holders engaging in price discrimination...|$|E

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} frequently {{carries with}} it exclusive rights not only over the primary {{subject matter of the}} rights granted, but also over ancillary subject matter that is not within the definition of the primary grant, as for example in the patent doctrine of contributory infringement. Previous scholars have explored the potential for intellectual property rights to affect the size and structure of firms by mitigating transaction costs both between firms and within firms. Here we extend that framework to consider the impact of <b>ancillary</b> <b>rights,</b> which we expect to have their own effects on a firm’s “make or buy” decision. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>rights</b> may place an intellectual property holder in a position to license production of complementary products or components to other firms. In some instances the absence of <b>ancillary</b> <b>rights</b> may prompt firms to vertically integrate, in order to bring such transactions in house. We also anticipate that doctrines such as contributory infringement impact employee mobility out of firms holding patents. We anticipate that contributory infringement rights will tend to lower overall transaction costs, although this may vary with the circumstances in a particular industry...|$|R
