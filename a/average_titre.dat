40|$|Autoantibodies to albumin (AAA) {{were tested}} by an ELISA method in {{patients}} with A, B and NANB acute and chronic hepatitis, and in a control group. AAA-IgM had a different behaviour in acute hepatitis type A, in which we observed a high <b>average</b> <b>titre</b> as compared with B, and NANB hepatitis, in which we observed {{a decrease in the}} <b>average</b> <b>titre.</b> In the chronic phase, we noted a decrement of the <b>average</b> <b>titre</b> in all the types of hepatitis. For AAA-IgG, in the acute phase the <b>average</b> <b>titre</b> in hepatitis A, B and NANB was lower than in the control group. In the chronic stage, only NANB hepatitis showed a decrement of the <b>average</b> <b>titre</b> of the antibody. On the base of these results, we can say that the involvement of AAA seems to be different in hepatitis A from the other two types, in which the decrement of <b>average</b> <b>titre</b> may be explained by the formation of immunocomplexes which are not detected by this test...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} a natural indicator for acid-base titration which is extracted from guinea corn leaves popularly called “waakye leaves ” in Ghana. Four types of acid-base titration were studied: strong acid versus (v/s) strong base, strong acid versus weak base, weak acid versus strong base, and weak acid versus weak base. The indicator color change, pH range and the <b>average</b> <b>titre</b> values were determined {{for each type}} of acid-base titration. These values were comparable to those obtained from three standard indicators: methyl orange, methyl red and phenolphthalein. Total fla-vonoids (TF) and condensed tannin (CT) from the crude leaves extract were determined which might be the major rea-sons for the activity of the extract as an indicator for simple acid-base titration. The authors suggest that the natural in-dicator is cheap, available, simple to extract, user and environmentally friendly and could be an excellent replacement for standard indicators...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Antibodies with {{haemolytic}} {{properties are}} common within the ABO system. These lytic antibodies are immunoglobulin G (IgG) and in high titres cause haemolysis during blood transfusion. Information on Immunoglobulin types and concentration of ABO haemolysins in Nigerian population is {{not readily available}} especially in Northern Nigeria. Methods: Serum samples from 200 males and 25 females O group blood donors were screened for A and B haemolysins. Forty two positive samples (38 males and 4 females) were treated with dithiothretiol (DTT) for characterization of IgG class. Antibody titre was compared with grade of haemolysis. Results: Out of 50 positive samples 42 highly haemolytic serum samples had IgG titres of> or = 64 after treatment with DTT. There was 18. 6 % occurrence of α and or β haemolysins in blood group O donors also with <b>average</b> <b>titre</b> values of α-haemolysins (68. 2) and β-haemolysins (67). Conclusion: Results showsclear indication of high incidence of α and β haemolysins among the healthy blood group O donors hence, Haemolysin test {{was found to be}} a useful screening test to identify group O donors with high levels of IgG anti A and/or anti B as far as safe blood transfusion is concerned.

40|$|Background. Infection with {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) {{is considered}} {{a risk factor for}} progression of atherosclerotic disease. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) display signs of frequent CMV re-activation, which may be caused by the uraemia-associated defect in cellular immunity. The possible contribution of CMV seropositivity to the hugely increased risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with ESRD is not clear. Methods. In a retrospective study we analysed the clinical data of patients with ESRD that were evaluated for renal transplantation from January 2002 to March 2006. Classical cardiovascular risk factors and CMV seropositivity were related to the prevalence of atherosclerotic disease. Results. A total of 408 patients were evaluated with a median age of 52 years (range 18 - 81 years). Multivariate logistic regression identified age (odds ratio; OR 2. 7 per decade), smoking (OR 2. 2), hypertension (OR 1. 9), C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 2. 6) and CMV seropositivity (OR 2. 7) as independent variables that were significantly associated with a positive medical history of atherosclerotic disease. The <b>average</b> <b>titre</b> for anti-CMV immunoglobulin G was higher in patients with atherosclerotic disease (100 AU/ml vs 71 AU/ml, P < 0. 05). CMV seropositivity was independently associated with an elevated CRP. In addition, patients with the combination of a high CRP and CMV seropositivity showed the highest prevalence of atherosclerotic disease. Conclusion. CMV seropositivity is significantly associated with atherosclerotic disease in ESRD patients. Our data suggest that the risk for progressive atherosclerosis is specifically increased in patients with an inflammatory response to CMV...|$|E
40|$|For {{investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} using disperse dyes as an immunoassay chromogenic marker, a disperse dye, DADISPERSE NAVY BLUE SP, was selected in analyzing antibody against infectious bursal disease virus (anti-IBDV). With the color intensity revealed in the disperse dye immunochromatographic test (DICT) strip as the objective function, the optimal dyeing conditions were found as follows: dye concentration absorbance (at lambda(max) = 587 nm) = 3, pH 7, 50 degrees C, for 10 min. Under these conditions, the resultant dyed-antibody (rabbit anti-chicken) can produce an optimal color intensity reading of 55, 054 on the strip. For performing qualitative immunoassay, chicken sera samples taken from different farms {{were used for the}} anti-IBDV titre assessment. The results of DICT strips showed very high sensitivity and specificity as compared to that analyzed by FlockChek enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (F-ELISA) kits. For quantitative immunoassay, {{it was found that the}} color intensity measured with DICT was linearly correlated to that of F-ELISA titre (r(2) = 0. 9687). Therefore, DICT was further applied to the detection of chicken anti-IBDV sera under vaccination in the farms. The <b>average</b> <b>titres</b> of the sampling groups exhibited a strong agreement to that of F-ELISA. Accordingly, the DICT method developed in this study, shown to be reliable, cheap and simple in both qualitative and quantitative immunoassays, is particularly suitable for point-of-need testing (PONT) in agricultural applications.

There {{was no significant difference}} between the mean ACIF and IFA-LA titres, but the former method was preferred because it was not affected by non-specific staining. When 406 sera were screened for the presence or absence of antibodies, only five sera (1. 2 %) gave discordant results with the three tests. None of the tests could detect all of the sera that contained specific antibodies while each test detected over 98 % of these sera. Thus, the increased sensitivity of the immunofluorescence procedures did not result in an appreciably increased rate of detection of cytomegalovirus seropositive sera...|$|R

Between March and August, RHDV-specific RNA was detected in healthy rabbits spanning {{a wide range of}} age and antibody titres. Importantly, two virus lineages were identified; a novel widely divergent strain, recovered between March and August, and a strain related to UK epidemic strains, was recovered between May and July from juvenile rabbits. We propose that a non-virulent widely divergent strain of RHDV circulated asymptomatically amongst the wild rabbits potentially inducing immunity against the introduced epidemic strain that predominantly causes high fatality rates in young immunologically naïve rabbits...|$|R

Hundred subjects (59 males and 41 females) 35. 0 ± 11. 0 years old, working in Padua University, were admitted to health surveillance and antibody titre against tetanus toxin was determined after an average of 5. 3 vaccine doses (range 2 - 10 doses) and an interval since the last dose of 6. 4 years (range 0 - 21 years). Accurate tetanus vaccination history was collected based on documented data. On the <b>average,</b> antibody <b>titre</b> was 1. 59 IU/ml; only two subjects (2 %) had titre lower than 0. 15 IU/ml. Slight (r=- 0. 224), but significant (p< 0. 02) correlation was observed between antibody titre and age, but not number of vaccine doses and interval since the last dose. The results show that the primary series of vaccine is protective for a long period (more than 10 years) and that measure of antibody titre is preferable to injection of no required booster doses (owing to the side effects) ...|$|R

40|$|Background Hemophilia is a {{hereditary}} blood-clotting disorder due {{to factor}} VIII deficiency. Up to this date, {{the administration of}} factor VIII in preventing and managing bleeding has been the main treatment. One of the complications, which may occur due to re- peated administrations of factor VIII, is the formation of factor VIII antibody (factor VIII inhibitor). Objective To find out the prevalence of severe hemophilia-A with factor VIII inhibitor and its clinical characteristics. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on children with severe hemophilia-A at the National Hemophilia Care Centre, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, in June- August 2004. Results Out of 45 children studied, 16 had factor VIII inhibitor with <b>average</b> inhibitor <b>titre</b> of 1. 15 Bethesda units (BU) (range 0. 15 - 15 BU). Most of them (12 patients) had inhibitor titre < 5 BU. Chronic arthropathy was found in 17 out of 45 (37 %) children with severe hemophilia-A, consisting of nine patients from positive inhibitor group and 8 patients from negative inhibitor group. Thirty-nine patients (86 %) used an on-demand treatment pattern, among whom 15 had positive inhibitor. Among patients receiving prophylactic treatment pattern, only one had positive inhibitor. There were 39 patients (86 %) treated using cryoprecipitate, among whom factor VIII inhibitor was found in 12, while among those treated with fac- tor VIII concentrate, the inhibitor was positive in 4 / 6. The average amount of factor VIII transfused in positive and negative factor VIII inhibitor groups was similar. Conclusion The prevalence of factor VIII inhibitor in severe he- mophilia-A patients was 35 %. Chronic arthropathy occurred more often in patients with positive factor VIII inhibitor. Factor VIII inhibi- tor was found more frequently in patients with an on-demand treat- ment pattern and in those using factor VIII concentrat...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study has been}} carried out to investigate the effect of DPT immunization status on immune response against diphtheria and tetanus in the program of School Immunization Month (locally referred to as Bulan Imunisasi Anak Sekolah, BIAS) for children aged 5 - 6 years old after the immunization with DT 1 dosage. The research involved 92 primary school children of grade 1 in sub-district Cimandala, Bogor district. Objective of the research was to support the BIAS program that was started in 1998. The specific objective was to examine the level of immunity and the <b>average</b> antibody <b>titre</b> against diphtheria and tetanus after the immunization with DT 1 dosage as well as to explore the relationship between titre antibody with DPT 3 immunization status (complete) and DPT < 3 (incomplete). The research findings showed that one year after immunization with DT 1 dosage the percentage of immunity against diphtheria and tetanus in children with DPT 3 status was recorded at 96. 5 % and 100 % with the geometric mean titre (GMT) of 0. 3022 IU/ml and 1. 5536 IU/ml respectively. The percentage of immunity against diphtheria and tetanus for children with the dosage of DPT < 3 was 100 % with the GMT of 0. 2862 IU/ml and 1. 4306 IU/ml respectively. It may be concluded that {{there was no significant difference}} (p< 0. 05) between children with basic immunization status of DPT 3 and DPT < 3. Considering the fact that coverage qf DPT 3 since 1990 has been more than 80 %, and taking into consideration findings of the research, it is suggested that screening of basic immunization status or primary school children of grade 1 can be ignored. Further research is required to explore the immunity originated after immunization with TT 1 dosage for grade 2 and 3 school children, that is after obtaining a complete 5 dosage of TT immunization. There is a need to study anti titre against diphtheria in the long term...|$|R

In order to assess a new strategy for oral DNA vaccine formulation and delivery, plasmid encoding hemagglutinin (HA) gene of avian influenza virus, A/Ck/Malaysia/ 5858 / 04 (H 5 N 1) (pcDNA 3. 1 /H 5) was formulated using green synthesis of sliver nanoparticles (AgNP) with polyethylene glycol (PEG). AgNP were successfully synthesized uniformly dispersed with size in the range of 4 to 18 nm with an average size of 11 nm. Cytotoxicity of the prepared AgNP was investigated in vitro and in vivo using MCF- 7 cells and cytokine expression, respectively. At the concentration of - 5 log 10 AgNP, no cytotoxic effects were detected in MCF- 7 cells with 9. 5 % cell death compared to the control. One-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks immunized once by oral gavage with 10 μl of pcDNA 3. 1 /H 5 (200 ng/ml) nanoencapsulated with 40 μl AgNP (3. 7 × 10 - 2 μg of Ag) showed no clinical manifestations. PCR successfully detect the AgNP/H 5 plasmid from the duodenum of the inoculated chicken as early as 1 h post-immunization. Immunization of chickens with AgNP/H 5 enhanced both pro inflammatory and Th 1 -like expressions, although no significant differences were recorded in the chickens inoculated with AgNP, AgNP/pcDNA 3. 1 and the control. In addition, serum samples collected from immunized chickens with AgNP/H 5 showed rapidly increasing antibody against H 5 on day 14 after immunization. The highest <b>average</b> antibody <b>titres</b> were detected on day 35 post-immunization at 51. 2 ± 7. 5. AgNP/H 5 also elicited both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells in the immunized chickens as early as day 14 after immunization, at 7. 5 ± 2. 0 and 20 ± 1. 9 percentage, respectively. Hence, single oral administrations of AgNP/H 5 led to induce both the antibody and cell-mediated immune responses as well as enhanced cytokine production...|$|R
40|$|Although cytokine-producing T cells play a {{key role}} in the {{response}} to vaccination, they are not always revealed by antigen stimulation of primed lymphoid cells in vitro. In this study, mice were immunized subcutaneously with alum-precipitated keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) in adjuvant to activate interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) -producing CD 4 + T cells. IL- 4 mRNA was the dominant cytokine mRNA species found in draining lymph nodes (LN) 7 days after immunization and its levels were increased after in vitro stimulation with KLH for 24 hr. IL- 4 protein, on the other hand, was not detected in the supernatants of such antigen-stimulated cultures. The presence of T cells primed for IL- 4 production was nevertheless suggested by the findings that primed LN cells produced low IL- 4 titres in response to anti-CD 3 antibody, whereas normal LN cells did not, and primed CD 4 + LN cells produced readily detectable IL- 4 levels in response to antigen after one or more cycles of in vitro restimulation. Culture at limiting dilution showed that 1 - 2 % of 7 day KLH-primed CD 4 + LN cells were clonogenic and specific for KLH without prior expansion in vitro, and that this frequency was markedly increased by repeated stimulation in bulk culture. Most clonogenic cells in primed LN gave rise to IL- 4 -secreting clones and a smaller number gave rise to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) -producing clones. The precursor frequency of IL- 4 -producing CD 4 + cells in primed LN and the <b>average</b> IL- 4 <b>titre</b> per cloned cell support the conclusion that these two parameters account for the low levels of IL- 4 produced in bulk culture by LN cells from immunized mice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Serum Bactericidal Antibody assay {{with human}} {{complement}} (hSBA) using individual immune sera is a surrogate of protection for meningococcal vaccines. Strain coverage of 4 CMenB, a licensed vaccine against serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) disease, {{has been extensively}} assessed in hSBA using pooled sera, directly or through the Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS). The extent to which pooled-sera hSBA titres reflect individual protection is not yet fully understood. We analysed more than 17000 individual hSBA titres from infants and toddlers vaccinated with 4 CMenB, pooled-serum hSBA titres from subsets therein and MATS data from a 40 strain panel representative of invasive MenB disease in England and Wales. Individual hSBA titres segregated in two normal distributions, respectively from responding and non-responding subjects (fit_model-data: r= 0. 996, p-values < 0. 05). No individual subject showed abnormally high titres compared to the distributions. Also, when sera from the same subjects were tested individually and in pool, pooled-sera <b>titre</b> and <b>average</b> of individual <b>titres</b> from the same group were substantially indistinguishable (r= 0. 97, p-value << 0. 001). We identified a robust mathematical relationship between the mean of individual hSBA titres {{and the proportion of}} subjects achieving a protective titre (seroprotection rate, r= 0. 95, p-value << 0. 001). Using this relation, the seroprotection rate in 15 groups of vaccinees tested against 11 diverse meningococcal isolates was accurately predicted by the hSBA titre of the respective pooled sera (average prediction error 9 %). Finally, strains defined covered by MATS had on average 77 % predicted seroprotection rate (interquartile range, IQR: 66 – 100 %) and 39 % for non-covered strains (IQR: 19 – 46 %). We conclude that seroprotection rates in infants and toddlers vaccinated with 4 CMenB can be accurately predicted by pooled-serum hSBA, and that strain coverage defined by MATS is associated with high seroprotection rates. SummaryThe Serum Bactericidal Antibody assay (SBA) from individual sera is a surrogate of protection for meningococcal vaccines. We show that SBA performed on pooled sera predicts individual protection...|$|R
40|$|Incidence, Severity, and Impact 2012 : Poster Presentations: no. S 1 -PP 25 BACKGROUND: Although {{influenza}} {{is considered}} a pervasive global risk, the spatial heterogeneity of risk has not been studied, particularly in urban and rural locations in the same country. Despite numerous theoretical (Ferguson et al. Nature. 2005; Germann et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006) and empirical (Yang et al. PLoS One. 2012; Acuna-Soto et al. PLoS One. 2011) studies of the initial waves of pandemics, {{little is known about}} the interaction among human population structure, movement, and influenza transmission over longer periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 1424 individuals from 40 randomly selected spatial locations in southern China aged 2 - 90 years and obtained peripheral sera antibody titres against 5 historically circulating strains of H 3 N 2. Locations were chosen randomly from a fan-shaped geographic transect extending outward 90 km from the centre of Guangzhou, China. We used generalised additive models to investigate the effect of spatial covariates in models that included age and other individual-level covariates on titre levels as well as seropositivity as defined by a threshold {Lessler: 2012 fw}. RESULTS: We showed that local population density was consistently positively associated with increased titres across viruses representing multiple antigenic clusters{Smith: 2004 jc}, even at this small spatial scale. We found that each log increase in population density resulted in a 0. 78 log increase (95 % CI, 0. 29 - 2. 47) in <b>titre,</b> <b>averaged</b> across 5 strains of influenza virus. We defined the effective neighbourhood size (ENS) to incorporate population density and connectivity: for a given location, the ENS was all of those living within a given perimeter added to a proportion of those not within, discounted according to a power-law function of distance. We determined the optimal ENS model to explain our data and compared it with models of transport and findings from other disease systems. Parallel ENS models of titre thresholds (seropositivity) suggest an increase in odds of 1. 32 (95 % CI, 1. 12 - 1. 78) in the cumulative attack rate between urban and rural areas. Even over entire antigenic clusters, is seems that less dense rural communities may avoid large outbreaks of some influenza strains. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
