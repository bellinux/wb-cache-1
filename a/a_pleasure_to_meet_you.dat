50|$|In No More Fairy Tales (2016), {{a series}} of five two-channel video conversations {{highlights}} the reality of daily life in South Africa twenty years after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was embarked upon as a process which many hoped then would bring healing to the stricken country. In mid 2015, with student unrest that swept across the country {{it became clear that}} the wounds had not healed. One of the first completed videos - It's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> - follows a conversation between two young people in their twenties - Candice Mama and Siyah Mgoduka - whose fathers were killed by apartheid assassin Eugene de Kock.|$|E

Richard and Karen {{received}} an offer {{to be on the}} television program Your All American College Show in mid-1968. Their performance of June 22, 1968, was Richard's and Karen's first television appearance, with bassist Bill Sissoyev recruited for this appearance and their other appearances on the show in 1968. During this time, Richard and Karen continued to refine their craft and produced demo tapes in Joe Osborn's garage. One of these was heard by A&M Records' Herb Alpert, who was intrigued by Karen's voice. The A&M co-owner signed them to a record contract. Said Richard: [...] "We signed with A&M. In came Herb and he shook our hands and said in so many words 'It was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you.</b> Let's hope we have some hits.' [...] " ...|$|E

But the injury, taking him out of the war, perhaps saved his athletic future. [...] Into his 90s, he trains three days a week. He returns to the Championships because [...] "There are great friendships. And it is always <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> again." ...|$|R

50|$|It is {{therefore}} <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> philosopher who understands what Darwinism is about, and approves of it.Dennett {{goes well beyond}} biology. He sees Darwinism as a corrosive acid, capable of dissolving our earlier belief and forcing a reconsideration of much of sociology and philosophy. Although modestly written, {{this is not a}} modest book. Dennett argues that, if we understand Darwin's dangerous idea, we are forced to reject or modify much of our current intellectual baggage...|$|R
60|$|It was {{especially}} {{hard to say}} good-bye to Ella and Maud, for though they were in no sense sweethearts they were very pleasant companions. There were others whom it was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> in the halls and to emulate in the class-rooms, and when early in April, we went home to enter upon the familiar round of seeding, corn-planting, corn plowing, harvesting, stacking and threshing, we had only the promise of an occasional trip to town to cheer us.|$|R

2500|$|O'Mullane [...] "loved {{nothing more}} than a rough, tough, {{energetic}} game", and it was said that only Tom Wills could match his [...] "pluck and skill" [...] as a footballer. According to a teammate, O'Mullane's reputation as a first-rate boxer was enough to dissuade the opposition from getting into melees with his club. Harrison remembered O'Mullane as a strong, but good-tempered player, and stated that [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him on the football field—even when the meeting was shoulder to shoulder, and you happened to get the trifle worst of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{his final}} public {{statement}} Heath {{paid tribute to}} James Callaghan who died on 26 March 2005, saying [...] "James Callaghan was a major fixture in the political life of this country during his long and varied career. When in opposition he never hesitated to put firmly his party's case. When in office he took a smoother approach towards his supporters and opponents alike. Although he left the House of Commons in 1987 he continued to follow political life {{and it was always}} <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with him. We have lost a major figure from our political landscape".|$|R
6000|$|And {{very shortly}} after this, the archbishop, {{who had been}} taking a village walk, entered the room. It was evident that he was {{intimate}} with the occupiers of Hurstley Hall. He addressed Mrs. Thornberry with the ease of habitual acquaintance, while John Hampden seemed almost to rush into his arms. Job himself had seen his Grace in London, though he had never had the opportunity of speaking to him, but yielded to his cordiality, when the archbishop, on his being named, said, [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>an</b> old friend, and in times past a kind one." ...|$|R

6000|$|They {{moved across}} the room, {{greetings}} passing as they went. At their approach, Mr. Caryll looked up. Rotherby made him a leg with an excessive show of deference, arguing irony.

6000|$|... (Painfully endeavoring {{to be at}} ease.) <b>A</b> <b>pleasure,</b> Mr. Starkweather, <b>an</b> entirely {{unexpected}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you here. I was {{not aware}} you frequented frivolous gatherings of this nature.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the most}} notable moments of Vladimir Vazov’s life was his visit to England in 1936. The British legion celebrated the British victory in World War I. The British {{veterans}} invited one of their worthiest opponents on the battlefield. He was personally greeted by Lord Milne, who shook his hand with the words [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the Bulgarian delegation, as {{even though we were}} enemies, you - like us - fought not only like brave men, but also like gentlemen." [...] The British paid great honour to General Vazov as they lowered their national flags in his name. The chairman of the British legion Major Goldy said in his speech: “He {{is one of the few}} foreign officers whose name features in our history”.|$|R
6000|$|A little surprised, but {{not much}} alarmed, by their manner, McLeod {{said that it was}} <b>an</b> unusual <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with strangers in such an out-of-the-way place; that he and his sons, having {{finished}} their day's work, were about to return to their hut for supper, and that he would be more than delighted if they would take [...] "pot-luck" [...] with them.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2016, Averill {{referenced}} {{the artist}} Russell Mills {{as a source}} of current inspiration for the web project Just Six Degrees. [...] "I have long been aware and an admirer of the work of Russell Mills. From his early work with Brian Eno - both the album cover designs as well as their book More Dark Than Shark - through to his gallery installations and his work with Nine Inch Nails. So it was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him in person when we shared a stage at the recent Offset event in Dublin. The real inspiration came from meeting and talking to Russell and being able to hear him talk about the ideas and thought processes behind his work and to then see some of his work close up at the accompanying exhibition. But it was from the man himself and his attitude to his work and life that I drew some personal motivation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what does}} the fat Briton know or care about Boh Hla-Oo?" [...] said I. Then both together: [...] "Depend upon it, my dear Sir, the army in both Anglo-Saxon {{countries}} is a mischievously underestimated institution, and it's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> man who," [...] etc., etc. And we nodded triangularly in all good will, and swore eternal friendship. The Lieutenant made a statement which rather amazed me. He said that, {{on account of the}} scarcity of business, many American officers were to be found getting practical instruction from little troubles among the South American Republics. When the need broke out they would return. [...] "There is so little for us to do, and the Republic has a trick of making us hedge and ditch for our pay. A little road-making on service is not a bad thing, but continuous navvying is enough to knock the heart out of any army." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2012-2014Over brunch in New York, playwright Kirk Lynn asked Leonard what he {{was working}} on. Leonard handed him a copy of {{coaching}} legend Bum Phillips' autobiography and {{said he wanted to}} make an 'opera' based on Phillips' life. Lynn smiled and Leonard asked if he would read the book and consider writing the libretto. Later, Lynn agreed to create the libretto under the following condition, that Peter Stopschinski compose the score.Former Monk Parrots board member, Steven Beede, Esq., initiated a call for Leonard to speak with Bum and Debbie Phillips. When asked how they felt about an opera based on Bum's life, Bum Phillips replied, [...] "I can't sing a lick!" [...] They arranged <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> in person, then Leonard, Stopschinski, and Leonard's parents traveled to the Phillips' ranch in Goliad, Texas to discuss the performance rights. Upon arrival, Leonard shook hands with Bum Phillips and said, [...] "Mr. Phillips, it's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you." [...] Phillips replied, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> want to be met at 89." [...] They ate Subway sandwiches, baked beans, and pecan pie and Leonard and Stopschinski left with the Phillips' blessing to make the opera.|$|R

It is like Saladin's sword which cut through the cushion." [...] and [...] "Old Darwin is the dearest, sweetest, loveliest old grandpa that ever was. And on the whole he impresses me with his strength more than any man I have seen yet. There is a charming kind of quiet strength about him and about everything he does. He isn't burning and eager like Huxley. He has a mild blue eye, and is the gentlest of gentle old fellows. his long white hair and enormous white beard him very picturesque... guileless simplicity... I am afraid I shall never see him again, for his health is very bad. Of all my days in England I prize today the most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly not, Dorothy; but if {{you don't}} say it in words I think {{everyone}} could see that, at least, there is no regret on your part at the match being broken off. The wonder won't last long--another week and something fresh will be talked of, and by next year the whole affair will have died away. People have wonderfully short memories in society. Do you know, I rather take credit to myself as a prophetess, for {{on the evening of}} that dinner party where I last met you and Halliburn together, I told Captain Hampton that I didn't think your match would ever come off. By the bye, what a nice fellow he is. He is wonderfully little changed since I knew him as a boy down in Lincolnshire, before he went into the army. Sometimes boys change so when they become men, that it is quite <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> one who has grown up exactly as you might have expected he would do. You saw a good deal of him I believe?' ...|$|R
40|$|Once again I {{thank my}} colleagues at INSAH for finding {{the time in}} their busy {{schedules}} {{to work with me}} on M&E and indicators.

I thank Baba Traore for his time and patience explaining the intricacies of CILSS's organization.

Minata Tangara, Ashta Abderaman, Alhousseiny Toure, and Bouraima Konate of The Mitchell Group again deserve my thanks for their kind hospitality, assistance, and friendship during my visit. I thank my fellow consultants, Chako Cherif and Blamsia Braoussala, for their patience and good humor during our long discussions of the M&E system. Most of all I thank Wilbur Thomas and Jorge Oliveira for their sound suggestions on how to get the work done, their deft management, and their unfailing patience with both the substance and the logistics of producing this report.

40|$|We utilize Floer {{theory and}} an index {{relation}} relating the Maslov index, Morse index and Conley-Zehnder index for a periodic orbit {{of the flow}} of a specific Hamiltonian function to state and prove some nonexistence results for certain displaceable Lagrangian submanifolds. We start with results under the assumption that the symplectic mani-fold (M,ω) is closed and symplectically aspherical and then generalize to the case when (M,ω) is weakly exact. The specific Lagrangian sub-manifolds in consideration are split hyperbolic submanifolds, spheres, products of spheres, Cayley projective plane and quaternionic projec-tive spaces. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS First of all, I would like to thank very much to my advisor Ely Kerman for his wonderful teaching, encouragement, advice and generosity over the years. Without him, this thesis wouldn’t exist. It has been such <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> be his student and get the chance to work together. Also, I would like to express my gratitude to Eugene Lerman, Susan Tolman and Stephanie Alexander for great courses, advice and accepting to be in my committee. It has been <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> each of them. Also, many thanks to all the professors whom I have taken courses from in University of Illinois and Middle East Technical University and to many graduate students with whom I have worked together. Finally, I would like to thank my parents and friends very much for their encouragement. iii Contents...|$|R
2500|$|The Mortlockese Language is an Austronesian {{language}} spoken {{primarily on the}} Mortlock islands in Micronesia. In Mortlock culture, there is a hierarchy with chiefs called samwool.

The word for sleep using common language is maúr while the word for sleep using respectful language is saipash. Along with the respectful language, there are formal greetings called tiirou or fairo that are used in meetings and gatherings. In English, some examples of formal greetings would be [...] "good evening" [...] or [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you" [...] or [...] "how are you."

Storch races home and learns Jennifer has taken his daughter to the park. Storch goes to the park {{but no one is}} there. He gets back in his car and Jennifer, who was waiting in the backseat, knocks him unconscious. When he wakes, Jennifer rapes him with his shotgun and reminds him that she was just as innocent as his own daughter as he tries to plea for his life. She has attached one end of a string to the trigger and the other end to Matthew's wrist. Matthew is alive but unconscious, and Jennifer tells Storch, [...] "If I were you, I'd tell him not to move". When Matthew wakes up, he is confused and begins agitating when he sees Storch, and Storch's scream for Matthew to stop moving goes unheeded as Matthew triggers the shotgun, which fires a round that tears through Storch's anus and blows apart his face before hitting Matthew in the chest, leaving both men dead.
