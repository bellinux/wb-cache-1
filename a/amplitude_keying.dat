The proposed RF-I system exploits the simple architecture {{and characteristics of}} noncoherent ASK modulation. This provides an efficient way of increasing interconnect bandwidth by transmitting an RF-modulated data stream simultaneously with a conventional baseband counterpart over a shared off-chip transmission line.

40|$|A {{filter method}} is {{presented}} which allows a {{qualitative and quantitative}} identification of wave modes observed with plasma experiments on satellites. Hitherto existing mode filters {{are based on the}} MHD theory and thus they are restricted to low frequencies well below the ion cyclotron frequency. The present method is generalized to cover wave modes up to the characteristic ion frequencies. The spectral density matrix determined by the observations is decomposed using the eigenvectors of the linearized Hall-MHD equations. As the wave modes are dispersive in this formalism, a precise determination of the k-&gt;-vectors requires the use of multi-point measurements. Therefore the method is particularly relevant to multi-satellite missions. The method is tested using simulated plasma data. The Hall-MHD filter is able to identify the modes excited in the model plasma and to assign the correct energetic contributions. By comparison with the former method it is shown that the simple MHD filter leads to large errors if the frequency is not well below the ion cyclotron frequency. Further the range of validity of the linear theory is examined rising the simulated wave <b>amplitudes.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of heat energy harvesting using pyro-electric effect. In order to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} energy conversion from heat to electricity, the synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) (Guyomar et al., 2005) technique is experimentally tested, which has already proved its quality in electromechanical conversion. For several amplitude variations of temperature from 0. 5 to 8. 0 K, the conversion efficiency is found about 0. 02 % of Carnot thermodynamic cycle with a standard interface. Under the same heating conditions, experimental results show that the SSHI technique increases the converted energy by a factor which is about 2. 5 times of the standard interface, with which the efficiency practically becomes 0. 05 % of Carnot thermodynamic cycle. In this case, the produced electrical power for temperature amplitude 7 K is more than 0. 3 mW for an energy harvesting device composed of 8 g of active material. The main power limitation is due to temperature frequency.
