500|$|The episode {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Allan Johnson of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that the}} episode is good, but not great: [...] "It proves stunt-casting doesn't necessarily work unless the actor {{is up to the}} script and lead performers. And Douglas, an otherwise fine actor, basically does a caricature of a macho gay man." [...] Ted Cox of the Daily Herald wrote that the idea of Douglas being cast as a neurotic gay man [...] "isn't <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> this episode." [...] A television reviewer from Deseret News thought that because of his role on Will & Grace, Douglas should give the Oscar he won earlier in his career back. The reviewer concluded: [...] "He's embarrassingly bad, as is this episode." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Save the Last One" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. IGN's Eric Goldman praised the episode, {{giving it a}} nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. He opined {{that it was his}} favorite episode since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and added that [...] "it had scary zombie scenes, good action, interesting character interaction and a revelation at the end that gave us <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> process." [...] John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press was split on [...] "Save the Last One"; while asserting that it was [...] "imminently watchable", he felt that the episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized the dialogue. Serba wrote: [...] "The show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to the development of its characters. It needs {{to do a better job}} of biding its time between crowd-pleasing zombie attacks." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth. The show seems to be setting itself out to be a slow-burning character study in the context of a zombie apocalypse — and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice folks who just want brain-eating action — and the characters need to be more complex than they've been shown to be so far." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Tom McNamara {{scored the}} game 8.1 out of 10, writing [...] "Ties That Bind {{is quite a}} solid romp, and a cut above most of the games in the genre that are marred by poor controls, poor balancing, {{annoying}} music, bad voice acting, thin stories, {{and a host of}} other problems that define the vast middle ground. Surreal Software has a very clear and detailed vision of the location and the people and tortured souls that populate it, an intuitive and smooth control scheme, and a dripping, engaging atmosphere of unpredictable nightmare." [...] Like other critics, however, he felt the game didn't build on the original sufficiently; [...] "it doesn't do <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> expand on the theme of the original -- nightmare prison visions come alive, ghosts that kill, and churning violence [...] Still, if you liked the original, you should like Ties That Bind." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{extremely}} impressed, scoring the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 8.7 out of 10, {{and giving the}} game an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award. The Xbox version was also awarded the October [...] "Xbox Game of the Month" [...] award. Roper dismissed notions that the game was simply a Grand Theft Auto clone, arguing instead that it advanced the genre; [...] "much of Scarface is based on what we've seen in Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it's fairly obvious that Radical used said series as the blueprint {{and then went back}} and re-evaluated its shortcomings. The result {{is that we have a}} game that fixes many of GTAs problematic elements." [...] He praised the basic gameplay, the storyline, the balls meter, rage mode, and the aiming system. Although he was somewhat critical of the map, arguing too many areas in the game are accessible via only one road, he concluded [...] "there are a whole lot of little things about Scarface that make it fun, but it's the sum of its parts that make it the overall great game that it is. It does <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> fix many of the problems with other games in the genre, and it does an absolutely fantastic job of bringing the world of Scarface to gamers." [...] Mark Bozon and Chris Roper scored the Wii version 8.5 out of 10, also giving it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award, and writing [...] "Scarface is a very impressive game, and while there isn't a ton of Wii-specific additions to the package, everything that was added makes a big difference." [...] Praising the controls, they wrote [...] "it's amazingly easy to target enemies and blow off specific body parts in the process." [...] They called it [...] "an intelligent, high-budget, astonishingly impressive game," [...] arguing [...] "Wii owners that fit in the hardcore crowd will absolutely eat this one up, as it's currently one of the deepest and most entertaining experiences on the system." ...|$|E
