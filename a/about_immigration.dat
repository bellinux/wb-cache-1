5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate <b>about</b> <b>immigration</b> policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E

25|$|On 6 February 2000, an Ariana Afghan Airlines Boeing 727 with 156 {{people on}} board was hijacked and flown - {{stopping}} at Tashkent, Kazakhstan and Moscow - to Stansted Airport.

It later emerged that the motive behind the hijack was to gain asylum in the UK, sparking debate <b>about</b> <b>immigration</b> into the country. A large number of passengers on board the plane also applied for asylum. The remainder returned to Afghanistan. Nine hijackers were jailed but their convictions for hijacking were quashed for misdirection of the jury in 2003, and in July 2004, it was ruled {{that they could not}} be deported from the UK.|$|E

25|$|Shōnen Sekai was {{mentioned}} various times in many English novels. In the novel The New Japanese Women: Modernity, Media, and Women in Interwar Japan mentioned Shōnen Sekai in the notes to chapter 3 {{as one of}} many magazines that Hakubunkan made to relate to different parts of society. Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War also mentioned Shōnen Sekai as a popular magazine of that time, with an additional mention to Shōjo Sekai, its female equivalent. Issei: Japanese Immigrants in Hawaii mentioned Shōnen Sekai as just a publication of Hakubunkan. In the novel No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i During World War II had mention of Shimanuki Hyotayu who writes <b>about</b> <b>immigration</b> matters in Shōnen Sekai. Shōnen Sekai was also mentioned in both The Similitude of Blossoms: A Critical Biography of Izumi Kyōka (1873–1939), Japanese Novelist and Playwright and Japan's Modern Myths: Ideology in the Late Meiji Period.|$|E
25|$|The {{close of}} the twentieth century {{produced}} more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns <b>about</b> <b>immigration</b> and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties. In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years. In July 2000, it came second in the council elections for the North End of the London Borough of Bexley, its best result since 1993. At the 2001 general election it gained 16% of the vote in one constituency and over 10% in two others. In the 2002 local elections the BNP gained four councillors, three of whom were in Burnley, where it had capitalised on white anger surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward. This breakthrough generated public anxieties about the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it. In the 2003 local elections the BNP gained 13 additional councillors, including seven more in Burnley, having attained over 100,000 votes. Concerned that much of their potential vote was going to the UK Independence Party (UKIP), in 2003 the BNP offered UKIP an electoral pact but was rebuffed. Griffin then accused UKIP of being a Labour Party scheme to steal the BNP's votes. They invested much in the campaign for the 2004 European Parliament election, at which they gained 800,000 votes but failed to secure a parliamentary seat. In the 2004 local elections, they secured four more seats, including three in Epping.|$|E

Capitalising on anger surrounding the arrival of Ugandan Asian migrants in the country in 1972, Tyndall oversaw the NF during the period of its largest growth. Membership of the party doubled between October 1972 and June 1973, possibly reaching as high as 17,500.|$|E

500|$|Doctor Who {{novelist and}} Faction Paradox creator Lawrence Miles posted a scathing review of [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] on the Internet {{within an hour}} of its broadcast, {{focusing}} on a perceived political subtext suggesting that asylum seekers (the Gelth) are really all evil and out to exploit liberal generosity (the Doctor). He criticised the script for promoting xenophobia and [...] "claiming that all foreigners were invaders", especially as the top stories in the news were <b>about</b> <b>immigration</b> into Britain. The review produced considerable backlash on the Internet, mainly over his comments about writer Mark Gatiss. Miles was personally contacted and ran into trouble with his publishers. Miles deleted the review and posted a revision, though the original is still available on another of his websites.|$|E

Muñoz additionally reflected: [...] "We admire Arjona.

[...] "No Te Cambio Por Nada" [...] is intermittently rock-dabbled. The lyrics of [...] "De Vez En Mes" [...] pertain to a woman's menstruation.|$|E
500|$|As the Whig Party {{broke up}} after Fillmore's presidency, many in Fillmore's {{conservative}} wing joined the Know Nothings, forming the American Party. [...] In his 1856 candidacy as that party's nominee, Fillmore {{had little to}} say <b>about</b> <b>immigration,</b> instead focusing on {{the preservation of the}} Union, and won only Maryland. In his retirement, Fillmore was active in many civic endeavors. He helped to found the University of Buffalo, serving as its first chancellor. During the American Civil War, Fillmore denounced secession and agreed that the Union must be maintained by force if necessary, but was critical of the war policies of Abraham Lincoln. After peace was restored, he supported the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson. Obscure today, Fillmore has been praised by some for his foreign policy, but he is criticized by others for his enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act and for his association with the Know Nothings.|$|E
