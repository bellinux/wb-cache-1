5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> {{when he stopped}} {{at the side of the}} road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{was much}} in demand as a sideman for recordings, and {{appeared}} on albums {{by most of}} the major jazz leaders in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In April 1957, for instance, he appeared as a guest in an enlarged version of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, for an album later released as Theory of Art; this band included trumpeter Lee Morgan, with whom Kelly had recorded a few weeks earlier. The recording sessions continued four days later, with Kelly joining Blakey, Morgan and others on Griffin's A Blowin' Session; this was followed by three studio days for Gillespie, and another for trumpeter Clark Terry, {{before the end of the}} month. Later that year, Kelly made a rare appearance playing bass, for one track of vocalist Abbey Lincoln's That's Him!, after the regular bassist, Paul Chambers, became drunk <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> in the studio.|$|E

25|$|In {{that stage}} thirteen, the {{temperature}} was extremely high. Two riders from the North African team, Marcel Molinès and Abdel-Kader Zaaf, broke away after 15 kilometers, and created a large gap, also because the other cyclists were more occupied with getting drinks. Some 20 kilometers from the finish, Zaaf started to zigzag across the road. A safety official pulled him from the race, afraid for his safety, and Molinès rode through alone. Zaaf {{did not agree with}} the safety official, and mounted his bicycle again. He quickly fell off his bicycle <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> and spectators moved him into the shade of a tree. When he woke up, he realized that he was in a race, got on his bicycle again and rode away, but going into the wrong direction. An ambulance was called, and Zaaf was taken away. Zaaf claimed that he had received wine from a spectator, and as a Muslim he was not used to the alcohol. Behind the two North-African cyclists, Kübler had attacked, and left his rivals Raphaël Géminiani and Louison Bobet minutes behind. Of the favourites, only Ockers managed to stay with Kübler.|$|E

500|$|The {{formation}} of the Avon Gorge {{is the subject of}} mediaeval mythology. The myths tell tales of two giant brothers, Goram and Vincent, who constructed the gorge. One variation holds that Vincent and Goram were constructing the gorge together and Goram fell asleep, to be accidentally killed by Vincent's pickaxe. Another variation tells of the brothers falling for Avona, a girl from Wiltshire, who instructs the giants to drain a lake which stretches from Rownham Hill to Bradford-on-Avon (i.e. the Avon valley). Goram began digging the nearby Hazel Brook Gorge in Blaise Castle estate, but consumed too much beer <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> Vincent dug the Avon Gorge and drained the lake, winning the affection of Avona. Upon waking Goram stamped his foot, creating [...] "The Giant's Footprint" [...] in the Blaise Castle estate, and threw himself into the Bristol Channel, turning to stone and leaving his head and shoulder above water as the islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm.|$|E
500|$|According to folk {{tradition}} Marko never died; he {{lives on in}} a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, [...] "Oh God, what am I going to do now?" [...] God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep).</b> There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls {{on the ground and}} Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank [...] "eagle's water", which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.|$|E

500|$|After {{trying and}} failing to find work in New Hampshire, in 1833 Wilson walked {{more than one hundred}} miles to Natick, Massachusetts seeking {{employment}} or a trade. Having met William P. Legro, a shoemaker who was willing to train him, Wilson hired himself out for five months to learn to make leather shoes called brogans. [...] Wilson learned the trade in a few weeks, bought out his employment contract for $15, and opened his own shop, intending to save enough money to study law. Wilson had success as a shoemaker, and was able to save several hundred dollars in a relatively short time. [...] This success gave rise to legends about Wilson's skill; according to one story that grew with retelling, he once attempted to make one hundred pairs of shoes without sleeping, <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> with the one hundredth pair in his hand. [...] Wilson's shoe making experience {{led to the creation of}} the political nicknames his supporters later used to highlight his working class roots—the [...] "Natick Cobbler" [...] and the [...] "Natick Shoemaker".|$|E
500|$|There is a {{story about}} a dragon man from the village of Pečenjevce, eastern Serbia, who saw an ala in a cloud while he was scything. He said to scythemen beside him, [...] "I am going to sleep, and you swing a scythe above me," [...] before he lay down <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> A man who swung the scythe, however, {{inadvertently}} grazed him with the tip of the blade. When the dragon woke up, he told that he had been wounded by the ala he fought with, and lost a lot of blood. A dragon from the village of Bogojevac always kept with him a piece of a scythe blade or a knife. As soon as he perceived the imminent approach of bad weather, he would lie down on the ground and stick the blade above his head. It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died. At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, [...] "How tired I am!" [...] This was thought to refer to the strenuous battle he fought in the clouds.|$|E

In June 2012, Medrano was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter. If convicted on both counts, Medrano would have faced a maximum of ten years in prison.|$|E
