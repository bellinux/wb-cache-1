5|$|Scáthach teaches Cú Chulainn all {{the arts}} of war, {{including}} the use of the Gáe Bulg, a terrible barbed spear, thrown with the foot, that has to be cut out of its victim. His fellow trainees include Ferdiad, who becomes Cú Chulainn's best friend and foster-brother. During his time there, Scáthach faces a battle against Aífe, her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Scáthach, knowing Aífe's prowess, fears for Cú Chulainn's life and gives him a powerful sleeping potion to keep him from the battle. However, because of Cú Chulainn's great strength, it only puts him to sleep for an hour, and he soon joins the fray. He fights Aífe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but Cú Chulainn distracts her by calling out that Aífe's horses and chariot, the things she values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Scáthach, and bear him a son.|$|E
25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend told them he had implicated himself. The prosecution case included {{that there was no}} evidence that Bamber's father had telephoned him. They argued that the father was too badly injured to have spoken to anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he would have called the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was on the gun when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> and press the trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, they said, to have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E
500|$|Jack {{wakes up}} in a cell in the , where Juliet gently interrogates him. [...] At one point Jack attacks her and {{attempts}} to escape, holding an improvised weapon <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] He orders her to open a door, but she refuses to comply, claiming that doing so would kill them both. Ben appears and agrees that opening the door will kill them all. [...] Jack throws Juliet away, and then opens the door. As Ben dashes back through the door he came in, water starts rushing into the hallway. [...] Juliet helps Jack struggle into an adjoining room, tells him to push a button which she had previously mentioned was for emergencies. [...] He does so and she knocks him unconscious. When he awakes, she shows Jack a file which she says contains documents about his entire life. [...] Juliet asks Jack if he has any questions about Sarah. [...] After a pause, he asks, [...] "Is she happy?" [...] Juliet replies yes, and walks outside, and Ben congratulates her on a job well done.|$|E
60|$|Miss Mary's {{hand was}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own <b>throat,</b> which was {{streaked}} with blood.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Ada!' exclaimed Aunt Jane. 'You {{know that}} Fanny cannot go out <b>at</b> night with <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and I never will send out those young girls on any account.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{that you}} don't say {{anything}} against it, I don't care {{what else you}} say." [...] Suzette put on her jacket and stood buttoning it <b>at</b> <b>her</b> soft <b>throat.</b> [...] "I do it; and I do it for mother's sake and for father's. I care as much for them as you do." ...|$|R
2500|$|... wears a small fancy-work {{collar and}} a ribbon <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] Her thick, wavy hair is parted {{in the center}} and poufed over her ears, 1851.|$|E
60|$|She nodded, with a {{slightly}} arch expression, and loosened the scarf <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{the brother}} of the king dragged Soa to the couch, and {{throwing}} her down upon it stood over her, his spear-point <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{we enter}} the room, there stands Virginia under the rainbowed prisms of the great chandelier, receiving. But here was {{suddenly}} a woman of twenty-eight, where only this evening we knew a slip of a girl. It was a trick she had, to become majestic in a ball-gown. She held her head high, as a woman should, and <b>at</b> <b>her</b> slender <b>throat</b> glowed the pearls of Dorothy Manners.|$|R
50|$|It {{was said}} {{that no one could}} tell a lie or move, with Fragarach <b>at</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> thus the name 'Answerer'. It was also said to place the wind at the user's command and could cut through any shield or wall, and had a {{piercing}} wound from which no man could recover.|$|R
60|$|And Graham, gazing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face in profile, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{crown of}} gold-brown hair, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> singing <b>throat,</b> felt the old ache at the heart, the hunger and the yearning. The {{nearness}} {{of her was}} a provocation. The sight of her, in her fawn-colored silk corduroy, tormented him with a rush of visions of that form of hers--swimming Mountain Lad, swan- diving through forty feet of air, moving down the long room in the dull-blue dress of medieval fashion with the maddening knee-lift of the clinging draperies.|$|R
60|$|A woman {{stepped forward}} from the line of women, laughing, I protest, as merrily {{as any of the}} company. One hand, of course, shaded her eyes, the other was <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again {{he stepped}} closer to her. His evil face was convulsed with rage and desire. Like a wild beast he sprang upon her, {{and with his}} strong fingers <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> forced her {{backward}} upon the berth.|$|E
60|$|One {{piercing}} scream escaped {{her lips}} as the brute hand clutched her arm. Then she was dragged toward those awful fangs which yawned <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> But ere they touched that fair skin another mood claimed the anthropoid.|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} the borderman, trying to compose herself. As they neared Colonel Zane's cabin {{she saw her}} father, Will, the colonel, Betty, Nell, Mrs. Zane, Silas Zane, and others whom she did not recognize. They were all looking <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Helen's <b>throat</b> swelled, and <b>her</b> eyes filled when she got near enough to see her father's haggard, eager face. The others were grave. She wondered guiltily if she had done much wrong.|$|R
60|$|Her {{magnificent}} {{voice was}} now weak and uncertain. Her speech painfully hesitant. She {{who had been}} so strong, so brave, was now both easily frightened and readily confused. She who had once walked with the grace and power of an athlete was now in terror of an up-rolled rug upon the floor. Every time I looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> my <b>throat</b> ached with remorseful pain. Every plan I made included a vow to make her happy if I could. My success now meant only service to her. In no other way could I justify my career.|$|R
5000|$|But how? Not there? She {{starts with}} a small cry,And feels the empty space, and runs her eyeO'er all the bower, and {{stretches}} from the bedOne hasty foot, and listens with wild head.No sight—no voice: she tries to smile, heart-sick.And murmurs, 'Oh, 'tis but some hiding trick;He sees me through the boughs:' and so she rose.And, like a wood-nymph, through the glimmering goes.And for a while delays to call his name,Pretending she should spoil his amorous game;But stops <b>at</b> last, <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> full-pulsed with fears.And calls convulsively with bursting tears;Then calls again; {{and then in the}} open airRushes, and fiercely calls. He is not there. (lines 22-35) ...|$|R
6000|$|Esterbrook Elliott unpinned with {{a masterful}} touch the {{delicate}} cluster of Noisette rosebuds she wore <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> and transferred {{them to his}} buttonhole as he answered courteously: [...] "Certainly. My time, as you know, is entirely at your disposal." ...|$|E
60|$|To avoid further argument, she arose {{and went}} slowly upstairs. Through the doorway Mr. Gribble saw her helping herself {{up by the}} banisters, her left hand still <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> Then he heard her moving slowly about in the bedroom overhead.|$|E
60|$|An elderly lady, {{dressed in}} {{somewhat}} oppressive black, {{with a big}} cameo brooch <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> and a black satin bag in her hand, was being shown by the steward to a seat by Quest's side. She acknowledged the Captain's greeting acidly.|$|E
5000|$|Wilder {{reveled in}} {{poking fun at}} those who took {{politics}} too seriously. In Ball of Fire, his burlesque queen 'Sugarpuss' points <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sore <b>throat</b> and complains [...] "Pink? It's as red as the Daily Worker and twice as sore." [...] Later, she gives the overbearing and unsmiling housemaid the name [...] "Franco". Wilder is sometimes confused with director William Wyler; the confusion is understandable, as both were German-speaking Jews with similar backgrounds and names. However, their output as directors was quite different, with Wyler preferring to direct epics and heavy dramas and Wilder noted for his comedies and film noir type dramas.|$|R
60|$|The boat stopped <b>at</b> Tadoussac on <b>her</b> return, {{and among}} the spectators who {{came down to the}} landing was a certain very pretty, conscious-looking, silly, bridal-faced young woman,--imaginably the belle of the season at that forlorn watering-place,--who before coming on board stood awhile {{attended}} by a following of those elderly imperial and colonial British who heavily flutter round the fair at such resorts. She had an air of utterly satisfied vanity, in which there was no harm in the world, and when she saw that she had fixed the eyes of the shoreward-gazing passengers, it appeared as if she fell into a happy trepidation too blissful to be passively borne; she moistened her pretty red lips with her tongue, she twitched her mantle, she settled the bow <b>at</b> <b>her</b> lovely <b>throat,</b> she bridled and tossed her graceful head.|$|R
6000|$|... [Illustration: Nancy stood staring <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{with words}} beyond saying in her heart--words that rose in <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> and choked her] ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Huddlestone {{threw his}} head in the air; his eyelids quivered; next moment he fell insensible below the table. Northmour and I had each run to the armoury and seized a gun. Clara was on her feet with her hand <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{seemed so}} old and poor--what could she give him? She {{unhooked}} a little silver brooch <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] "You will get something for that," [...] she said; [...] "it's better than nothing. I am very sorry {{you are so}} old and poor." ...|$|E
60|$|Su-Su smiled, and {{her eyes}} were yet softer. Again she felt the soft hands <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> He was good to look upon, and the belt was indeed small, made for a smaller man; but what did it matter? She could make many belts.|$|E
5000|$|Detective Chief Inspector Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) {{has been}} summoned to a hearing to discuss her {{involvement}} {{in a case of}} British national security. The scene then flashes back to the previous year, when journalist Jo Powers (Elizabeth Berrington) is found dead <b>at</b> home with <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> cut: an apparent suicide, though Powers was recently subjected to online death threats after she publicly lambasted a disability activist's own recent suicide. While investigating Powers' death, Parke meets her brilliant new junior partner, Trainee Detective Constable Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay). Parke initially believes Powers was murdered by her husband; he claims that she appeared to be going insane and swung a broken wine bottle at him before killing herself.|$|R
50|$|On November 27, 1950, Beryl Atherton {{a teacher}} at the school, was found <b>at</b> <b>her</b> home with <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> slashed. The murder remains unsolved.|$|R
60|$|Clara saw {{his mouth}} shut hard. Again he glanced <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> It seemed like an agreement. She bent over the cards, coughing, to clear <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} six inches. Mother McGinnis {{stood there with}} white eyes--they were white, I say--and a yellow face, holding {{together}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> with one hand a dingy pink flannel dressing-sack. Tripp thrust the dollar through the space without a word, and it bought us entry.|$|E
60|$|While I {{got that}} {{he pushed her}} backward. Her {{strength}} seemed almost as great as his. I swabbed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> when I could, and found no mark; then helped him to control her a little. Miss Elizabeth leaped back to bed, wailing like a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{have no fear}} of him, captain," [...] {{she said}} gently. Then, with a quick movement, {{impulsive}} and womanly, she unpinned a little gold brooch <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> {{and gave it to}} him, saying: [...] "In token of my gratitude for bringing him back to us." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} {{they were all}} very stiff, but glad of the sun on {{sagebrush}} and river, and the boy and girl sang over breakfast. While Milt was gathering fuel {{he looked up at}} Claire standing against a background of rugged hills, her skirt and shoes still smug, but her jacket off, her blouse turned in <b>at</b> the <b>throat,</b> <b>her</b> hair blowing, her sleeves rolled up, one hand on her hip, erect, charged with vigor--the spirit of adventure.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a strange}} moment for Philippa. Nothing had altered within her, and yet a {{wonderful}} pity was glowing in <b>her</b> heart, tearing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> emotions, bringing a sob into <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} whimpering when the mother-weasel reappeared. She did not rush him, {{now that her}} young one was safe. She {{approached}} more cautiously, and the cub had full opportunity to observe her lean, snakelike body, and her head, erect, eager, and snake-like itself. Her sharp, menacing cry sent the hair bristling along his back, and he snarled warningly <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She came closer and closer. There was a leap, swifter than his unpractised sight, and the lean, yellow body disappeared for a moment {{out of the field}} of his vision. The next moment she was <b>at</b> his <b>throat,</b> <b>her</b> teeth buried in his hair and flesh.|$|R
