5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The motif was {{developed}} from sources including medical textbooks, and images of the nurse in the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> she has {{been shot in the}} eye. He referred to the still in paintings throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Queuing {{networks}} are studied at selected {{points in the}} steady state, namely, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> jobs of a given class arrive into a given node (either from the outside or from other nodes) and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> jobs of a given class leave a given node (either for the outside or for other nodes). The processes defined by these points are known to be, in general, non-Potsson, interdependent, and serially correlated; therefore {{the relation between the}} distribution of the system state embedded <b>at</b> those <b>moments</b> and <b>the</b> steady-state (or random point) distribution is not obvious a priori. For a large class of networks having product-form equihbrium distribnttons it is shown that (a) if the given job class belongs to an open subchain, <b>the</b> state distributions <b>at</b> input pomts, output points, and random points are identical, and (b) if the job class belongs to a closed subchain, <b>the</b> distribution <b>at</b> input and output points ts the same as the steady-state distribution of a network with one less job in that subchain...|$|R
5|$|When {{the act is}} assented to by the {{sovereign}} in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal assent is considered given <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the assent is declared {{in the presence of}} both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.|$|E

25|$|The {{point of}} release is the {{position}} of the ball in relation to the body <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the ball is released. It is crucial for the arm to be stiff, not bent, and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient bounce off the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble chucking. The left shoulder ought to be somewhat towards the stumps, the arm beside the bowler falling away, having just before this stage been pointing directly at the stumps.|$|E

The fact that after the notification of the expression the expresser dies, or becomes unable to make juridical acts, or is limited in capacity to make juridical acts, shall not null the expression of intent. In the interpretation of an expression of intent, the real intention of the parties must be sought rather than the literal meaning of the words. A person who offers to make a contract shall be bound by his offer except at the time of offer he has excluded this obligation or except it may be presumed from the circumstances or from the nature of the affair that he did not intend to be bound. Exposing goods for sale with their selling price shall be deemed to be an offer. However, the sending of pricelists is not deemed to be an offer. An offer ceases to be binding if it is refused. An offer made inter presentes ceases to be binding if it is not accepted at once.An acceptance which arrives late, except under the circumstances in the preceding article, shall be deemed to be a new offer.|$|E
25|$|In Venice, meanwhile, {{deliberations}} {{were taking}} place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, {{it was already too}} late for it to be able to take part in the battle. Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors— even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.|$|E

The area around them split apart, but the spot on which each stood was not touched. They stood separately like three pillars. Moses, Aaron, and all the great scholars came to hear the song of the sons of Korah, and from this they learned to sing songs before God.|$|E

Born in a San Juan slum, he initially believed the mission to Rakhat was divinely inspired. Several of his close friends and co-workers, people {{with a variety of}} unique skills and talents, had seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo; one of them, a gifted young technician, was the first to hear the transmissions. In Sandoz's mind, only God's will could bring this group of people with the perfect combination of knowledge and experience together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the alien signal was detected.

25|$|Revisionism {{challenged}} {{the view that}} fundamental and irreconcilable sectional differences made the outbreak of war inevitable. It scorned a previous generation's easy identification of the Northern cause with abolition, but it continued a tradition of hostility to the Reconstruction measures that followed the war. The Civil War became a needless conflict brought on by a blundering generation that exaggerated sectional differences between North and South. Revisionists revived {{the reputation of the}} Democratic party as great nationalists before the war and as dependable loyalists during it. Revisionism gave Lincoln's Presidency a tragic beginning at Fort Sumter, a rancorous political setting of bitter factional conflicts between radicals and moderates within Lincoln's own party, and an even more tragic ending.

25|$|As well as {{linking the}} two series {{into a single}} future history, the present book served to address a {{criticism}} leveled against the largely radioactive Earth as depicted in Pebble in the Sky and mentioned in several other books. Though not explicitly stated, there was the clear implication the world being mostly radioactive and humans precariously surviving in the uncontaminated areas in between {{was the result of}} a nuclear war hundreds or thousands of years before the time of the plot. This would have made Pebble in the Sky part of the post-nuclear war subgenre common in the 1950s. It was, however, pointed out by critics that such an extensive use of nuclear weapons as to leave persistent and widespread radiation even after centuries would have completely destroyed all life on Earth <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> it took place. Therefore, in the present book Asimov provided a different origin for the future Earth's radioactivity.|$|E

During World War II, he was supportive of the dictatorship of Ion Antonescu and Romania's alliance with Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union. As late as 1944 he abhorred the attempts of the Romanian opposition to negotiate the country's switch to the camp of the United Nations. Even after the war, in his personal journals he continued to adopt a position sympathetic to the Romanian and Nazi war criminals, dismissing the Nuremberg Trials and the People's Tribunals.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte envisaged a joint {{publication}} {{by the three}} sisters. Anne was easily won over to the project, and the work was shared, compared, and edited. Once the poems had been chosen, nineteen for Charlotte and twenty-one each for Anne and Emily, Charlotte went about searching for a publisher. She took advice from William and Robert Chambers of Edinburgh, directors {{of one of their}} favourite magazines, Chambers's Edinburgh Journal. It is thought, although no documents exist to support the claim, that they advised the girls to contact Aylott & Jones, a small publishing house at 8, Paternoster Row, London, who accepted but rather at the authors' own risk as they felt the commercial risk to the company was too great. The work thus appeared in 1846, published using the male pseudonyms of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily), and Acton (Anne) Bell. These were very uncommon forenames but the initials of each of the sisters were preserved and the patronym could have been inspired by that of the vicar of the parish, Arthur Bell Nicholls. It was in fact on 18 May 1845 that he took up his duties at Haworth, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the publication project was well advanced.|$|E
25|$|With Giustiniani's Genoese troops {{retreating}} {{into the}} city and towards the harbor, Constantine and his men, now {{left to their own}} devices, kept fighting and managed to successfully hold off the Janissaries for a while, but eventually they could not stop them from entering the city. The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defense collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by Ulubatlı Hasan pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians ran over to their ships, {{and a few of the}} Genoese got over to Galata. The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered. The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicolò Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.|$|E
