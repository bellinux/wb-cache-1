The seizure of prey by the constrictor, though invisibly swift, is quite simple in mechanism; {{it is simply}} the return to its coil of an opened watch-spring, and is just as instantaneous. But the steady and continuous motion, without a visible fulcrum (for the whole body moves at the same instant, and I have often seen even small snakes glide as fast as I could walk), seems to involve a vibration of the scales quite too rapid to be conceived. The motion of the crest and dorsal fin of the hippocampus, {{which is one of}} the intermediate types between serpent and fish, perhaps gives some resemblance of it, dimly visible, for the quivering turns the fin into a mere mist. The entrance of the two barbs of a bee's sting by <b>alternate</b> <b>motion,</b> [...] "the teeth of one barb acting as a fulcrum for the other," [...] must be something like the serpent motion on a small scale. ** Richard Owen.|$|E
6000|$|... 170 In Dr. Whewell’s {{latest version}} of his theory (Philosophy of [...] Discovery, p. 331) he makes a {{concession}} respecting the medium of [...] the transmission of light, which, taken {{in conjunction with the}} rest [...] of his doctrine on the subject, is not, I confess, very intelligible [...] to me, but which goes far toward removing, if it does not actually [...] remove, the whole of the difference between us. He is contending, [...] against Sir William Hamilton, that all matter has weight. Sir [...] William, in proof of the contrary, cited the luminiferous ether, and [...] the calorific and electric fluids, “which,” he said, “we can neither [...] denude of their character of substance, nor clothe with the [...] attribute of weight.” “To which,” continues Dr. Whewell, “my reply [...] is, that precisely because I can not clothe these agents with the [...] attribute of Weight, I do denude them of the character of [...] Substance. They are not substances, but agencies. These Imponderable [...] Agents are not properly called Imponderable Fluids. This I conceive [...] that I have proved.” Nothing can be more philosophical. But if the [...] luminiferous ether is not matter, and fluid matter, too, what is the [...] meaning of its undulations? Can an agency undulate? Can there be [...] <b>alternate</b> <b>motion</b> forward and backward of the particles of an agency? [...] And does not the whole mathematical theory of the undulations imply [...] them to be material? Is it not a series of deductions from the known [...] properties of elastic fluids? This opinion of Dr. Whewell reduces [...] the undulations to a figure of speech, and the undulatory theory to [...] the proposition which all must admit, that the transmission of light [...] takes place according to laws which present a very striking and [...] remarkable agreement with those of undulations. If Dr. Whewell is [...] prepared to stand by this doctrine, I have no difference with him on [...] the subject.|$|E

The side alternation causes the hip to tilt which requires the contra lateral muscles of the back to be activated - while one leg is lifted the other drops.

5000|$|Scissor or flutter kick {{involves}} <b>alternate</b> <b>motion</b> of the fins {{parallel to}} the sagittal plane of the swimmer. As the one leg thrusts in the ventral direction in the power stroke, the other performs the return stroke, which provides some thrust, but is significantly less powerful in most cases as the ankle tends to feather the blade. The blade must bend during the power stroke to thrust water away from the diver and thereby provide propulsion along the centreline. Efficient propulsion requires a low drag attitude in the water, and thrust along the direction of movement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a mechanism with the following specifications: continuous <b>alternate</b> <b>motion,</b> wide motion phases with constant angular velocity, parallel input and output shafts, and great strokes. Those specifications derive from a possible application in the textile field. The mechanism is composed of two star wheels properly coupled together: there are two counter-rotating input wheels, alternately coupling with slots first, then teeth at each side of the output wheel. As usual for star wheels, pins and slots handle the acceleration and deceleration phases, while the constant velocity phase is performed by coupling sectors of toothed gears. A proper design of pins and slots is performed, so {{that at the same time}} when a pin from one input wheel is releasing a slot, a pin from the other input wheel engages a slot on the other side of the output wheel, forcing the latter to an opposite motion. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth <b>alternate</b> <b>motion.</b> By annihilating the arrest phases typical of star wheels, the proposed system eliminates the discontinuities in the acceleration diagram. The paper develops a complete parametrical analysis of the device, underlining the effect of the constraints on the shape of the motion laws with particular emphasis on the acceleration and deceleration phases. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth <b>alternate</b> <b>motion.</b> With respect to an analogous mechanism realizing the same laws of motion, e. g., cams, this device is very compact and economical, also presenting parallel input and output shafts, and significantly reduces sliding and wea...|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} {{the mechanisms of}} speech intelligibility impairment due to neurologic impairments, intelligibility decline was modeled {{as a function of}} co-occurring changes in the articulatory, resonatory, phonatory, and respiratory subsystems. Method Sixty-six individuals diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were studied longitudinally. The disease-related changes in articulatory, resonatory, phonatory, and respiratory subsystems were quantified using multiple instrumental measures, which were subjected to a principal component analysis and mixed effects models to derive a set of speech subsystem predictors. A stepwise approach was used to select the best set of subsystem predictors to model the overall decline in intelligibility. Results Intelligibility was modeled as a function of five predictors that corresponded to velocities of lip and jaw movements (articulatory), number of syllable repetitions in the <b>alternating</b> <b>motion</b> rate task (articulatory), nasal airflow (resonatory), maximum fundamental frequency (phonatory), and speech pauses (respiratory). The model accounted for 95. 6 %of the variance in intelligibility, among which the articulatory predictors showed the most substantial independent contribution (57. 7 %). Conclusion Articulatory impairments characterized by reduced velocities of lip and jaw movements and resonatory impairments characterized by increased nasal airflow served as the subsystem predictors of the longitudinal decline of speech intelligibility in ALS. Declines in maximum performance tasks such as the <b>alternating</b> <b>motion</b> rate preceded declines in intelligibility, thus serving as early predictors of bulbar dysfunction. Following the rapid decline in speech intelligibility, a precipitous decline in maximum performance tasks subsequently occurred...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} instabilities {{developed}} in a fluid in which viscosity depends on temperature. In particular, we consider a dependency that models a very viscous (and thus rather rigid) lithosphere over a convecting mantle. To this end, we study a 2 D convection problem in which viscosity depends on temperature by abruptly changing its value {{by a factor of}} 400 within a narrow temperature gap. We conduct a study which combines bifurcation analysis and time-dependent simulations. Solutions such as limit cycles are found that are fundamentally related to the presence of symmetry. Spontaneous plate-like behaviors that rapidly evolve towards a stagnant lid regime emerge sporadically through abrupt bursts during these cycles. The plate-like evolution <b>alternates</b> <b>motions</b> towards either the right or the left, thereby introducing temporary asymmetries on the convecting styles.

40|$|Background: Motor speech disorders, such as dysarthria, are {{a common}} {{sequelae}} reported after traumatic brain injuries. However, there is limited research {{on the effects of}} sport-related concussions (SRC) on motor speech disorders. ^ Aims: The current study aimed at replicating and extending a previous research study, Dolan (2013), conducted at the University of Texas at El Paso. In her study, Dolan (2013) incorporated and evaluated motor speech tasks: sequential motion rates, and motor limb tasks: movement execution initiation and finger repetition, in athletes following a sport-related concussion. The current study duplicates Dolan’s (2013) study. In addition, it investigates the effects of a SRC on <b>alternating</b> <b>motion</b> rates, speech rate, and intelligibility in a sentence repetition task. ^ Methods: Motor speech and motor limb tasks were investigated in 18 individuals (7 males, 11 females; age = 18. 78 years ± 2. 37) following a SRC and 18 individuals (7 males, 11 females; age = 19. 66 years ± 3. 03) in a control group, closely matched by age and education. Oral diadochokinesis (DDK) tasks: sequential <b>motion</b> rates and <b>alternating</b> <b>motion</b> rates were measured and acoustically analyzed using Kay Elemetrics: CSL, model 4500. Speech rates were attained using the computerized Sentence Intelligibility Test. Motor limb tasks included a finger repetition task and a movement execution initiation time task. Total duration times for all speech and the motor limb tasks were compared between groups. ^ Results: The results demonstrate slower DDK syllable duration and total duration times in athletes following a SRC compared to individuals in the control group. Additionally, individuals following a SRC showed slower finger repetition duration and movement execution initiation times in comparison to the control group. Although, speech rate and speech intelligibility is not significant, speech rate did differ; slower speech rate is still noted in athlete’s post-SRC in comparison to the control group. ^ Conclusions: Sport-related concussions do {{have a significant impact on}} the motor speech and the motor limb mechanisms, further adding to the already known consequences. ...|$|R
