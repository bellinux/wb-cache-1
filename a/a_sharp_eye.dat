25|$|The four {{survivors}} were bitterly grieved by the loss, {{for they}} had grown into a band of brothers, and they swore to keep <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye</b> out for the Albatroses of Richthofen's squadron which had brought down Nash. At {{the same time they}} thought that Nash was dead. On the morning of June 27th they met the Richthofen Staffel near Courtrai, and this time Collishaw found himself engaged with the bright-green Albatros of Allmenröder – though he was not aware at the moment that he was fighting the conqueror of Nash. It was one of the classic dogfights of the war, like Barker against Linke, like Hawker against Richthofen – two skilled and experienced fighters, who knew every trick, had met.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{positive}} feedback {{for the film}} came from Joblo.com reviewer Berge Garabedian, who praised director Bertino for [...] "building the tension nicely, with lots of silences, creepy voices, jump scares, use of songs and <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye</b> behind the camera, as well as plenty of Steadicam give it all more of a voyeuristic feel." [...] Empire Magazine remarked on the film's retro-style, saying, [...] "Like much recent horror, from the homages of the Grindhouse gang through flat multiplex remakes of drive-in classics, The Strangers looks to the '70s.", and ultimately branded the film as [...] "an effective, scary emotional work-out." [...] Slant Magazines Nick Schager listed The Strangers as the 9th best film of 2008. Also, the film was ranked #13 on [...] "Bravo's 13 Scarier Movie Moments" [...] television piece.|$|E
500|$|Hawke {{pursued a}} number of {{projects}} away from acting throughout the early 2000s. He made his directorial debut with Chelsea Walls (2002), an independent drama about five struggling artists living in the famed Chelsea Hotel in New York City. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. A second novel, 2002's Ash Wednesday, was better received and made the New York Times Best Seller list. The tale of an AWOL soldier and his pregnant girlfriend, the novel attracted critical praise. The Guardian called it [...] "sharply and poignantly written... makes for an intense one-sitting read". The New York Times noted that in the book Hawke displayed [...] "a novelist's innate gifts... <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye,</b> a fluid storytelling voice and the imagination to create complicated individuals", but was [...] "weaker at narrative tricks that can be taught". In 2003 Hawke made a television appearance, guest starring in the second season of the television series Alias, where he portrayed a mysterious CIA agent.|$|E
5000|$|Both of Alexeieff’s wives greatly {{contributed to}} the success of the films. Alexandra was more {{critical}} and had <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>eye,</b> Claire had better technical and mathematical skills. She was more patient with Alexeieff and praised him frequently while Grinevsky looked the other way Claire was quoted by her biographer as saying, “"Between us, he's the genius." ...|$|R
50|$|McGahern is also {{considered}} {{a master of}} the Irish tradition of the short story. Several collections were published as well as Love of the World, a collection of non-fiction essays. His autobiography, Memoir (All Will be Well: a Memoir in the US), was published in 2005 a year before his death outlining numerous influential moments in his life which critics often speculated were present within his earlier work. Andrew Motion wrote In a tremendously distinguished career, he has never written more movingly, or with <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
50|$|Blackhurst's books resurrect {{the forests}} with <b>a</b> <b>sharp,</b> {{historical}} <b>eye</b> and <b>a</b> natural love of detail. The logging industry no longer depends on water-travel {{to deliver the}} logs from the headwaters to the sawmills, but during its heyday it meant respectable work for high pay.|$|R
500|$|In a 2007 interview, {{the author}} {{described}} {{the novel as}} her [...] "Beauty and the Beast story", stating that like the Beast, Dain is an outcast and misfit among the novel's society. Chase describes Dain as [...] "truly awful: [...] rude, overbearing, and intimidating... He consciously uses his monstrousness {{in the same way}} he uses his vast wealth and his social position: to control his world and protect himself. It's sad, in a way, because he’s isolated, like the Beast of the fairy tale trapped in his castle. But Dain is not pitiful by any means: [...] He’s smart, cynical, and sarcastic, with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye</b> for the ridiculous. He has a sense of humor and is adept with clever comebacks and putdowns". Jessica represents the Beauty of the story, someone who [...] "enters the Beast’s lair of her own accord" [...] as his equal [...] "no matter how awful" [...] he acts.|$|E
500|$|Various {{writers have}} {{commented on the}} book. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge called it [...] "This sweet {{delightful}} book". The novelist Virginia Woolf observed that [...] "By some apparently unconscious device [...]. a door [...] left open, through which we hear distant sounds." [...] Among poets, Edward Thomas wrote that [...] "In this present year, 1915, at least, {{it is hard to}} find a flaw in the life he led" [...] while W. H. Auden stated that [...] "Selfishly, I, too, would have plumbed to know you: I could have learned so much." [...] The naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough called White [...] "A man in total harmony with his world." [...] The novelist Roald Dahl has the main character in his short story [...] "The Visitor" [...] read the book. The writer and zookeeper Gerald Durrell commented in The Amateur Naturalist that White [...] "simply observed nature with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye</b> and wrote about it lovingly." ...|$|E
500|$|Religion {{is focused}} on in Grampa's {{momentary}} possession, and Marge believing {{what he said to}} be a message from God. Groening joked the film [...] "posit the existence of a very active God", when asked if he believed it was likely to offend. Mark I. Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, said the film [...] "treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye</b> out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds". Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the [...] "chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility." [...] In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, [...] "It is [...] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion." [...] Trees are a motif in the film, and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film. The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, a reference to the biblical figures of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden.|$|E
40|$|Like morally {{sensitive}} hospital staff, philosophers resist routine simplification of morally complex cases. Like hospital clergy, they favour reflective and principled decision-making. Like hospital lawyers, they refine {{and extend}} the language we use to formulate and defend our complex decisions. But hospital philosophers are not redundant: they have {{a wider range of}} principles and categories and <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>eye</b> for self-serving presuppositions and implicit contradictions within our practices. As semi-outsiders, they are often best able to take an 'external point of view,' unburdened by routine, details, and departmental loyalties. Their clarifications can temporarily disrupt routine, but can eventually improve staff morale, hence team practice and patient welfare...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2011 interview, Kriesi credits this {{experience}} with {{giving him a}} competitive advantage over his colleagues who may be experts {{in one or more}} narrow facets of programming or design, yet have little understanding or experience in other equally important areas of the development lifecycle. Kriesi explained in multiple interviews that the aphorism [...] "jack of all trades" [...] best describes his philosophy that separates him from others, who he concedes might be more talented as programmers or have <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>eye</b> for design, yet lack the broad experience required to become a success in the current digital market as an independent designer.|$|R

2500|$|On the {{southwest}} {{side of the}} hill is a piece of land given by Charlemagne to the Abbey of Saulieu in 775. According to legend his wife had insisted white grapes be planted on the site, to avoid his beard being stained by red wine. [...] If so she had <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye</b> for a vineyard, as the 72ha of Corton-Charlemagne produces some of the great white Burgundies. 	The appellation of Aloxe-Corton covers 297.1 ha. of which 169.6 ha is Grand Cru and 37.5 ha is Premier Cru.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{ideas on}} domesticity and the [...] "natural faculty for housewifery", as {{described}} in her book Household Education (1848), stemmed from her lack of nurture growing up. Although their relationship with her mother was better in adulthood, she saw her mother as {{the antithesis of the}} warm and nurturing qualities which Harriet knew to be necessary for girls at an early age. Her mother urged all her children to be well-read, {{but at the same time}} opposed female pedantics [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye</b> for feminine propriety and good manners. Her daughters could never be seen in public with a pen in their hand." [...] Her mother strictly enforced proper feminine behaviour, pushing her daughter to [...] "hold a sewing needle" [...] as well as the (hidden) pen.|$|E
2500|$|On the 1stofMay, too, the carman {{becomes a}} {{different}} creature. Not particularly civil at any time, on moving day {{he must be}} approached with caution. He has become lord of the ascendant. Ordinary offers do not tempt him. He {{has been known to}} laugh to scorn a man who offered him $5 to convey a load half a dozen blocks. He declines making any previous engagements. He seeks no customers, but rather conveys the idea that he would prefer to be let alone. At the same time he keeps <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>eye</b> to business, and only accepts an offer when he knows he can't beat a cent more out of his customer. And then when be is engaged, he goes about his work with supremest indifference. ... He is above all ordinances; he is a creation of the day; to-morrow he will be a mere carman, amenable to law and standing in fear of the Mayor's Marshal.|$|E

5000|$|Since World War I, a {{long line}} of American servicemen-artists have {{produced}} artwork based on their experiences in combat. The USMC artists have documented the life of Marines in the field. Like his predecessors, Sgt. Battles' artwork develops during a process of [...] "balancing a tactical eye as a Marine" [...] with the [...] "artist's visual eye" [...] and also noticing the way the light is bouncing off the body armor. [...] Battles' deployment to Iraq gave him <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>eye</b> for what can be portrayed in a combat zone."Go to war, do art" [...] is the motto of a Marine combat artist. The mission is to capture images of war on canvases and sketchpads.|$|R
60|$|Sam and Songbird found Rater {{sitting on}} a side porch of his home, with his basket-making {{materials}} scattered around him. He was a tall, thin man, somewhat deaf, but with <b>a</b> pair of <b>sharp</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R

"Well, Mr. Bullen," [...] {{one of them}} said, [...] "I have up {{till now}} {{regarded}} you {{as little more than}} a boy, in spite of your pluck in going up as a native soldier to Chitral.

60|$|Mr Kernan halted and preened {{himself before}} the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half {{sovereign}} I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits {{me down to}} the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.

50|$|He {{lived and}} wrote {{about what he}} lived through. He said that writing was an exhilarating {{activity}} into which he could delve himself and forget the pains of everyday life.
