40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the state of}} development of two innovative web-based control laboratories and focuses in particular {{on the needs of}} the <b>automation</b> <b>technician</b> community. The two processes selected to be simulated and controlled via the Internet were a self-regulating liquid level process and a didactical heat-flow setup.

40|$|Laboratories are {{the central}} {{workplace}} {{in research and}} industry for biological, chemical, or pharmaceutical experiments. Nowadays, labs are equipped with automated and semi-automated devices, even though human technicians remain indispensible for their flexibility. The realization of laboratories that are both efficient and flexible is a demanding task. We claim that interfaces constitute the bottleneck here: computer interfaces between technicians and the information infrastructure, communication interfaces between devices and the information infrastructure, and the transport of substances as an interface between <b>automation,</b> <b>technicians,</b> and storage facilities. In our approach, we tackle the challenge from all three angles. For the human-computer interface, we're utilizing cutting-edge touch-screen technology that is molded into the manual work place, the lab desk. Thereby, the computer interface becomes the manual workplace. This part of our project is still ongoing research. Laboratory devices come in many flavors and, unfortunately, most of them come along with proprietary electronic interfaces. As a result, device integration is a major challenge in laboratory environments. To cope with this challenge, we followed a twofold approach. First, we devised a communication protocol based on the well-known XML standard {{that allows us to}} interact in a generic way with arbitrary devices and the information infrastructure. Second, we are developing a software called "driver generator" that allows technicians to easily integrate devices without the burden of programming devices directly. Both the protocol specification and the driver generator are currently applied in real-world scenarios for the automated fabrication of human tissue. The third approach addresses the issue of transportation of materials and samples in laboratories. We developed a small, flexible, and robust carrier robot that interacts with automated devices, manual workplaces, and storage facilities. The semi-autonomous carrier robots move on top of desks or shelves along guidelines and landmarks, whereby both can easily be set up or removed. Furthermore, the carrier is capable of communicating with the information infrastructure. Currently, we're testing our demonstrator robot in real lab environments. To prove the versatility of our approach, we are developing a realistic lab environment. We aim to provide a show-room laboratory which makes the discussed technologies ready for experimentation in a real-world setup combining manual workplaces, automation, storage, and the information infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of IEC 61850 as {{the de facto}} SA standard for the communication between devices in a substation and the related system requirements {{has made it possible}} and justifiable to integrate station Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) on a high-speed peer-to-peer communication network (Ethernet) through standardization. IEC 61850 presents a set of standard object-oriented (OO) data models to describe the processes to be implemented and controlled in a substation and a set of service models for the interactions between devices in a substation and the transfer of all sorts of IED data. IEC 61850 proposes the concept of standardizing IED data using data objects referred to as logical nodes. This makes it possible to achieve the ldquoplug and playrdquo capability so that information and commands can be shared on a single network independent from any implementation. In this paper, the authors describe the standard's application-view model and present the use of OO methodology and techniques for the implementation of the Logical Node (LN) application-view data model of the standard. The target audience for this paper includes power system protection and <b>automation</b> engineers and <b>technicians</b> as well as research personnel who have at least a basic understanding of the IEC 61850 international standard and other technology mechanisms addressed in this paper. ...|$|R
