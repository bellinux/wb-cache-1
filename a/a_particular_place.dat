5|$|That the Sacs and Foxes did {{claim the}} country generally, where this land lies, is not controverted; nor was their claim ceded to the United States till 1824. And {{this raises the}} {{question}} whether, according to Spanish usage, whilst that power governed Louisiana, an existing Indian claim to territory precluded inhabitation and cultivation under a permit to inhabit and cultivate <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>place</b> designated in the permit, and {{which was in the}} Indian country. Spain had no treaties with any of the Indian tribes in Louisiana, fixing limits to their claims, so far as we are informed. The Indians were kept quiet, and at peace with Spanish subjects, by kind treatment and due precautions, which did not allow obtrusion on lands claimed by them, without written permits from the Governor; but that such permits were usual, cannot be doubted.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they did not condemn {{witnesses}} as perjurers until other witnesses directly incriminated the first witnesses. Thus if the first witnesses testified that one person killed another, and other witnesses testified that the victim or the alleged murderer was with the other witnesses on that day in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>place,</b> then they did not condemn the first witnesses as perjurers. But if the other witnesses testified that the first witnesses were with the other witnesses on that day in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>place,</b> then they did condemn the first witnesses as perjurers and executed the first witnesses on the other witnesses' evidence.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Christianity {{has taught}} that Heaven is the {{location}} of the throne of God as well as the holy angels, although this is in varying degrees considered metaphorical. In traditional Christianity, it is considered a state or condition of existence (rather than <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>place</b> somewhere in the cosmos) of the supreme fulfillment of theosis in the beatific vision of the Godhead. In most forms of Christianity, heaven is also understood as the abode for the redeemed dead in the afterlife, usually a temporary stage before the resurrection of the dead and the saints' return to the New Earth.|$|E

25|$|A place cell {{is a type}} of {{pyramidal}} neuron within the hippocampus that becomes active when an animal enters <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>place</b> in its environment; this place is known as the place field. A given place cell will have only one, or a few, place fields in a typical small laboratory environment, but more in a larger region. There is no apparent topography to the pattern of place fields, unlike other brain areas such as visual cortex—neighboring place cells are as likely to have nearby fields as distant ones. In a different environment, typically about half the place cells will still have place fields, but these will be in new places unrelated to their former locations.|$|E

25|$|There are 24 Muduvan and Paliyan {{families}} living there. They {{were said to}} have migrated from Manjampatti 200 years ago because of their fear of herds of wild elephants. They originally lived in caves. They eat wild roots, maize, fruits from wild plants, honey and bamboo rice. Their limited income comes from selling bamboo products and lemon grass oil, which they spend to buy rice from other villages. These people are nature worshippers. They do not worship regularly or have <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>place</b> of worship but have a sacred area in their village. They visit this area to celebrate the harvest festival Pongal and the rain (Mari) festival, during which they sacrifice a goat.|$|E
25|$|Performance {{art is a}} {{performance}} presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation.

It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and {{for any length of}} time. The actions of an individual or a group at <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>place</b> and in a particular time constitute the work.|$|E
25|$|In QM, {{predictions}} are {{formulated in}} terms of probabilities — for example, the probability that an electron will be detected in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>place,</b> or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a definite position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a hidden variables theory, {{might be able to}} predict those quantities exactly, {{while at the same time}} also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.|$|E
