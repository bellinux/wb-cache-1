25|$|On June 10, 1957, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} Enovid 10mg (9.85mg noretynodrel and 150µg mestranol) for menstrual disorders, {{based on}} data from its use by more than 600 women. Numerous additional contraceptive trials showed Enovid at 10, 5, and 2.5mg doses to be highly effective. On July 23, 1959, Searle filed a supplemental application to add contraception as an <b>approved</b> <b>indication</b> for 10, 5, and 2.5mg doses of Enovid. The FDA refused to consider the application until Searle agreed to withdraw the lower dosage forms from the application. On May 9, 1960, the FDA announced it would approve Enovid 10mg for contraceptive use, and did so on June 23, 1960. At that point, Enovid 10mg had been in general use for three years and, by conservative estimate, at least half a million women had used it.|$|E

40|$|Context: Therapeutic agents {{treating}} serious {{conditions are}} eligible for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval. The clinical evidence accrued on agents receiving accelerated approval has not been systematically evaluated. Our objective {{was to assess the}} timing and characteristics of available studies. Methods: We first identified clinical studies of novel therapeutic agents receiving accelerated approval. We then (1) categorized those studies as randomized or non-randomized; (2) explored whether or not they evaluated the FDA-approved indications; and (3) documented the available treatment comparisons. We also meta-analyzed the difference in start times between randomized studies that (1) did or did not evaluate <b>approved</b> <b>indications</b> and (2) were or were not designed to evaluate the agent’s effectiveness. Findings: In total, 37 novel therapeutic agents received accelerated approval between 2000 and 2013. Our search identified 7, 757 studies including 1, 258, 315 participants. Only one third of identified studies were randomized controlled trials. Of 1, 631 randomized trials with advanced recruitment status, 906 were conducted in therapeutic areas for which agents received initial accelerated approval, 202 were in supplemental indications, and 523 were outside <b>approved</b> <b>indications.</b> Only 411 / 906 (45. 4 %) trials were designed to test the effectiveness of agents that received accelerated approval (“evaluation” trials); others used these agents as common background treatment in both arms (“background” trials). There was no detectable lag between average start times of trials conducted within and outside initially <b>approved</b> <b>indications.</b> “Evaluation” trials started on average 1. 52 years, (95 % CI: 0. 87 to 2. 17) earlier than “background” trials. Conclusions: Cumulative evidence on agents with accelerated approvals has major limitations. Most clinical studies including these agents are small and non-randomized, and about a third are conducted in unapproved areas, typically concurrently with those conducted in approved areas. Most randomized trials including these therapeutic agents are not designed to evaluate directly their clinical benefits but incorporate them as standard treatment...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Biosimilars are {{biologic}} {{products that}} receive authorization {{based on an}} abbreviated regulatory application containing comparative quality and nonclinical and clinical data that demonstrate similarity to a licensed biologic product. Extrapolation of safety and efficacy has emerged as an important way to simplify biosimilar development. Regulatory authorities have generally reached the consensus that extrapolation of similarity from one <b>indication</b> to other <b>approved</b> <b>indications</b> of the reference product can be permitted if it is scientifically justified. Areas covered: Recently, the first biosimilar, biosimilar infliximab (Remsima/Inflectra) to the innovator monoclonal antibody infliximab (Remicade), was approved in the European Union, Canada and South Korea; the USA subsequently approved its first biosimilar, a less complex molecule (filgrastim-sndz). Based on two clinical trials of biosimilar infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, the European Medicines Agency allowed extrapolation to all eight <b>approved</b> <b>indications</b> for innovator infliximab, whereas Health Canada did not permit extrapolation to the indications for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. These differing decisions on extrapolation of indications for biosimilar infliximab highlight important unanswered regulatory and scientific questions. Here, we propose substantive scientific considerations for indication extrapolation. Expert opinion: The preclinical and clinical criteria that are currently required to merit indication extrapolation have not been rigorously evaluated...|$|R
