More generally, we give a criterion for when an electron system with abelian statistics and K_H = 0 can support <b>a</b> <b>gapped</b> edge: we show that <b>a</b> <b>gapped</b> edge is possible if and only if there exists a subset of quasiparticle types M such that (1) all the quasiparticles in M have trivial mutual statistics, and (2) every quasiparticle that is not in M has nontrivial mutual statistics with at least one quasiparticle in M. We derive this criterion using three different approaches: a microscopic analysis of the edge, a general argument based on braiding statistics, and finally a conformal field theory approach that uses constraints from modular invariance.
