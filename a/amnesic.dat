5|$|The game follows Hawk, an <b>amnesic</b> Valhalla gladiator who trains at {{his mentor}} Okamoto's gym. Among other {{recurring}} characters are Hiroko, a rebellious temple knight; Beth, {{a woman from}} the center who vows to always stay by Hawk's side; Daleth, who {{claims to be the}} Messiah, and fights Hawk multiple times; Zayin, a temple knight; and Gimmel, a man from the Arcadia forest, who knows Hawk from somewhere.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amnesic</b> {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked <b>amnesic</b> properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{lists of}} words {{were used in}} a mixed-modality fashion (some read aloud by the subject, others read only by the experimenter). They were {{presented}} in this format to both Korsakoff <b>amnesics</b> and matched controls, with subjects only told to remember the words themselves. Controls and <b>amnesics</b> were matched on item-memory (forced-choice recognition) by using longer lists, tested at longer delays, for the controls. Despite this, however, the controls performed significantly better than the <b>amnesics</b> at modality-identification judgements about the items chosen during recognition. Whether the reported result reflects the memory deficit which causes amnesia, {{or whether it is}} more properly attributed to additional (frontal lobe) pathology present in only certain <b>amnesics,</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the extent to}} which confabulators are susceptible to false recall and false recognition, and whether false recognition is reduced when memory for studied items is experimentally enhanced. Five confabulating patients, nine non-confabulating <b>amnesics</b> – including patients with (F <b>amnesics)</b> and without frontal-lobe dysfunction (NF <b>amnesics)</b> – and 14 control subjects underwent the DRM paradigm [Roediger, H. L., & McDermott, K. B. (1995). Creating false memories: Remembering words not presented in lists. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, 21, 803 – 814. ] in two experimental conditions. In both conditions participants studied eight lists of semantic associates, and free recall was tested after the presentation of each list. In the Standard condition recognition was tested after the presentation of all the lists, whereas in the Proximal condition patients were administered a six-item recognition task after the presentation of each list. Participants also provided remember or know judgements, and described the content of their recollections. All groups of patients recalled a lower proportion of targets and critical lures than did control subjects, but confabulators recalled more words unrelated to the studied lists than did NF <b>amnesics</b> and controls. All groups of participants improved true recognition across conditions. However, whereas normal controls suppressed false recognition to critical lures in the Proximal compared to the Standard condition, and non-confabulating <b>amnesics</b> showed comparable gist-based false recognition, confabulators showed increased levels of false recognition to critical lures across conditions. Furthermore, NF <b>amnesics</b> significantly reduced fals...|$|R
40|$|Two {{groups of}} {{undergraduates}} received simulated amnesia instructions that either informed them how <b>amnesics</b> perform on memory tasks (informed; n = 11) {{or did not}} inform them about how <b>amnesics</b> perform on memory tasks (uninformed; n = 9). A third group received no such instructions (control; n = 9).

5|$|The {{events of}} the game unfolds {{successively}} from the viewpoints of four different Warhead protagonists. The first one is Gene, {{a young man who}} becomes <b>amnesic</b> after the Arks accident. He is the son of professor Alvin, one of the builders of the Arks, who disappeared some time after the accident. While searching for his sister Aliz kidnapped by a strange creature, Gene is mutated into a Warhead and watches his arm turning into a weapon during a battle against some Otellos. He is assisted by a small floating companion named Pake; and is later joined by the Warhead Kilroy, who was an assistant to professor Alvin; and Meme, a mysterious but determined, optimistic young female Warhead.|$|E
5|$|XIII is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Ubi Soft Paris {{and published by}} Ubi Soft for most platforms except for the OS X version, which was published by Feral Interactive. Loosely based on the first five volumes of the 1984 Belgian graphic novel series XIII, the protagonist Jason Fly (XIII) is a confused and <b>amnesic</b> man who searches for his identity throughout a comic book-style, cel-shaded world. Found stranded on a beach by a lifeguard, Fly is accused of having killed the President of the United States. The accusation later transpires as mistaken, as Fly finds himself facing a gang of 20 conspirators ("The XX") who aim to overthrow the government. The Xbox version of the game was developed by Southend Interactive, while the OS X version was developed by Zonic.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and <b>amnesic</b> actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E
50|$|Amnesia is an {{abnormal}} mental {{state in which}} memory and learning are affected out of all proportion to other cognitive functions in an otherwise alert and responsive patient. There are two forms of amnesia: Anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia, that show hippocampal or medial temporal lobe damage. Anterograde <b>amnesics</b> show difficulty in the learning and retention of information encountered after brain damage. Retrograde <b>Amnesics</b> generally have memories spared about personal experiences or context independent semantic information.|$|R
5000|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as hypnotics, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, myorelaxants and <b>amnesics.</b> [...] Having less proclivity for overdose and toxicity, they have widely supplanted barbiturates.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{participatory}} design {{and evaluation of}} an orientation aid for individuals who have anterograde amnesia. Our design team included six <b>amnesics</b> who have extreme difficulty storing new memories. We describe the methods we used to enable the participation of individuals with such severe cognitive impairments. Through this process, we have conceived, designed, and developed the OrientingTool, a software application for Personal Digital Assistants {{that can be used}} by <b>amnesics</b> to orient themselves when feeling lost or disoriented. Two complementary studies were conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this tool in ecologically valid contexts. Our findings suggest that the OrientingTool can improve an <b>amnesic’s</b> independence and confidence in managing situations when disoriented, and that participatory design may be productively used with participants who have significant cognitive disabilities.

5|$|Days before Halloween, a man explodes a {{truck in}} Mars' capital city, {{spreading}} what {{is assumed to}} be a new pathogen that kills or sickens over three hundred people. In response, the Mars government issues a record bounty of 300 million woolong for the culprit's capture. Faye, who was pursuing Lee Sampson, a hacker that was apparently driving the truck, sees the terrorist and the Bebop crew decide to take on the bounty. Each follows different lines of inquiry. Ed, using a tattoo on the attacker's wrist, manages to identify him as Vincent Volaju, a former member of a military squad apparently killed in the Titan War. In reality, Vincent was the only survivor of a test involving the pathogen, having been immunized with a test vaccine: made an <b>amnesic,</b> he suffers from hallucinations, and his inability to tell dreams from reality eventually drove him insane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} episode, an <b>amnesic</b> Kay {{is accused of}} murdering defense {{attorney}} Tsubasa Kagome. Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay's case; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate with help from prosecutor Franziska von Karma. He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases, and finds a recording indicating that Kagome's murderer had a burn mark on their chin. When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee, Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi, {{the head of the}} investigation committee and Yumihiko's father, as the auctioneer and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor. Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark, identifying him as Kagome's murderer. Kay then remembers being attacked by someone and Shelly de Killer reveals the concept of the mastermind to Edgeworth and Kay.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly <b>amnesic</b> to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies using}} the process {{dissociation}} and the remember—know procedures led to conflicting conclusions regarding {{the effects of}} anterograde amnesia on recollection and familiarity. We argue that these apparent contradictions arose because different models were used {{to interpret the results}} and because differences in false-alarm rates between groups biased the estimates provided by those models. A reanalysis of those studies with a dual-process signal-detection model that incorporates response bias revealed that amnesia led to a pronounced reduction in recollection and smaller but consistent reduction in familiarity. To test the assumptions of the model and to further assess recognition deficits in <b>amnesics,</b> we examined receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) in <b>amnesics</b> and controls. The ROCs of the controls were curved and asymmetrical, whereas those of the <b>amnesics</b> were curved and symmetrical. The results supported the predictions of the model and indicated that amnesia was associated with deficits in both recollection and familiarity...|$|R

40|$|Are dissociations between {{categorization}} {{and explicit}} memory in tests of <b>amnesics</b> and normals evidence for multiple memory systems? Or could these dissociations be artifacts arising from methodologies {{used in some}} experiments ? We report {{a series of studies}} exploring this issue. Using normals in various states of simulated amnesia we show that categorization at test is well above chance {{even in the absence of}} prior exposure to category members. We also show that subjects perform well when tested with items that conflict with categories they had studied earlier. We argue that subjects in some paradigms can extract information about categories from the test rather than rely on memory for studied category members. In further studies, we generalize these findings to other stimuli and other category structures that have been used in tests of <b>amnesics</b> and normals...|$|R
25|$|<b>Amnesic</b> {{patients}} {{are described as}} those who have suffered damage to their medial temporal lobe, resulting in the impairment of explicit recollection of everyday facts and events. Priming studies on <b>amnesic</b> patients have varying results, depending on both the type of priming test done, {{as well as the}} phrasing of the instructions.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{studies from}} <b>amnesic</b> {{patients}} indicate that priming {{is controlled by}} a brain system separate from the medial temporal system that supports explicit memory.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{metabolite}} of diazepam, prazepam, and temazepam, and has moderate <b>amnesic,</b> anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative, and {{skeletal muscle}} relaxant properties {{compared to other}} benzodiazepines.|$|E
40|$|In nondemented <b>amnesics,</b> {{disorientation}} mostly {{reflects a}} failure to select memories that pertain to ongoing reality (increased temporal context confusion; TCC), a failure strongly associated with orbitofrontal damage. In the present study, we used the same paradigm [...] 2 runs of a continuous recognition task [...] in 23 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score of 1 - 2). We found that disorientation was frequent in this sample (52 %). However, although it correlated moderately well with general measures of dementia severity, verbal episodic memory and executive functioning, {{there was no significant}} correlation with TCC. Thus, disorientation in AD appears to reflect general cognitive decline rather than a specific cognitive failure such as increased TCC. This finding is compatible with the different distribution of degeneration in AD and the orbitofrontal damage typically present in severely disoriented <b>amnesics...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{long-term}} heavy alcohol consumption on brain functions {{is still under}} debate. The authors investigated a sample of 17 Korsakoff <b>amnesics,</b> 23 alcoholics without Korsakoff's syndrome, and 21 controls with peripheral nerve diseases, matched for intelligence and education. Executive functions were examined for word fluency, the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, an alternate response task, and an "n-back" working memory task. Korsakoff <b>amnesics,</b> but not alcoholics, showed a marked memory impairment. They also scored lower {{in each of the}} executive tasks-the alcoholics only in the alternate response task. This task also correlated with the years of the alcohol dependency. First, the authors conclude that Korsakoff's syndrome is associated not only with a memory impairment but also with a global executive deficit. Second, the decline in the ability to alternate between different responses argues for a restricted neurotoxic effect of alcohol on some frontal lobe areas...|$|R
25|$|Phrasing of the {{instructions}} {{associated with the}} test has had a dramatic impact on an <b>amnesic's</b> ability {{to complete the task}} successfully. When performing a word-stem completion test, patients were able to successfully complete the task when asked to complete the stem using the first word that came to mind, but when explicitly asked to recall a word to complete the stem that was on the study list, patients performed at below-average levels.|$|R
25|$|On occasion, benzodiazepines can induce extreme {{alterations}} in memory such as anterograde amnesia and <b>amnesic</b> automatism, {{which may have}} medico-legal consequences. Such reactions occur usually only at the higher dose end of the prescribing spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{effect would}} {{be an increase in}} red tide events, which could contribute to the accumulation of toxins (domoic acid, brevetoxin, saxitoxin) in small organisms such as anchovies and shellfish, in turn increasing occurrences of <b>amnesic</b> shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amnesic</b> {{patients}} {{do as well}} on perceptual priming tasks as healthy patients, however they show some difficulties completing conceptual priming tasks, depending on the specific test. For example, they perform normally on category instance production tasks, but show impaired priming on any task that involves answering general knowledge questions.|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} (mean age 64 years) with {{a previous}} episode of transient global amnesia (TGA) were examined {{to assess the}} functioning of objective memory (by using the Randt Memory Test), the metamemory capacities (Sehulster Memory Scale), the residual level of retrograde amnesia (Questionnaire of Remote Events), {{and the level of}} depression (Geriatric Depression Scale). Patients with residual retrograde amnesia scored significantly lower than non-amnesic ones on indices of both short-term and long-term memory, and for one of three main metamemory components, namely self-rating of memory functioning through comparison with memory functioning of peers (Set 3). Age, time interval from TGA attack and TGA duration did not prove to influence memory and metamemory scores. Retrograde amnesia and depression were rather substantially associated (1 / 5), and this association was found to negatively influence nearly all memory and metamemory scores. Depression level showed a positive correlation with short-term memory functioning in non-amnesics. The different pattern and strength of the relationships between metamemory components and objective memory dimensions observed in <b>amnesics</b> and non-amnesics indicate that metamemory evaluations are more closely related to memory functioning in <b>amnesics</b> than in non-amnesics...|$|R
2500|$|Recently, new {{evidence}} has been presented {{in support of a}} more precise interpretation of this hypothesis. The hippocampal formation includes, among other structures: the hippocampus itself, the entorhinal cortex, and the perirhinal cortex. These latter two make up the [...] "parahippocampal cortices". <b>Amnesics</b> with damage to the hippocampus but some spared parahippocampal cortex were able to demonstrate some degree of intact semantic memory despite a total loss of episodic memory. This strongly suggests that encoding of information leading to semantic memory does not have its physiological basis in the hippocampus.|$|R
5000|$|To further {{validate}} {{the discovery of}} [...] "normal" [...] memory in severe <b>amnesics,</b> Warrington used methods involving stem completion. The stem completion tasks involved patients learning a battery of words, and later identifying the learned words. Patients {{were able to identify}} a previously learned word when presented with the first three letters, but were unable to identify a previously learned word when given the choice between a learned word and unknown word. These tests provided further evidence of different types of memory, now known as implicit memory and explicit memory.|$|R
25|$|Individuals with Korsakoff's syndrome, {{the result}} of {{thiamine}} deficiency in chronic alcoholics, have damage to the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary nuclei, as well as degeneration of the frontal lobes. They display both amnesia and poor metamemory. Shimamura and Squire found that while patients with Korsakoff's syndrome displayed impaired FOK judgments, other <b>amnesic</b> patients did not.|$|E
25|$|Barrie {{was very}} perspicacious in noticing {{many aspects of}} children's mental {{development}} decades before they were studied by cognitive psychologists. In particular, Peter lacks the mental capacity for secondary mental representation and cannot recollect the past, anticipate the future, consider two things at once or see things from another person's point of view. He is therefore <b>amnesic,</b> inconsequential, impulsive and callous.|$|E
25|$|Anecdotal evidence, from an <b>amnesic</b> patient named CH who {{suffered}} from declarative memory deficits, was obtained supporting a preserved memory capacity for song titles. CH's unique knowledge of accordion music allowed for experimenters to test verbal and musical associations. When presented with song titles CH was able to successfully play the correct song 100% of the time, and when presented with the melody she chose the appropriate title from several distractors with a 90% success rate.|$|E
40|$|A brief {{review of}} the {{literature}} on retrograde amnesia in Korsakoff's syndrome is presented. Various explanations of the phenomenon are discussed including the notions that it results from the effects of “state-dependency”, that it occurs {{as a result of a}} progressive learning problem and that it arises through a failure in contextual processing. None of these hypotheses can satisfactorily account for the length and temporal gradient of alcoholic <b>amnesics</b> retrograde amnesia. Although some evidence points towards the hypothesis that anterograde and retrograde amnesia might result from separate and independent impairments, this view is presently unproven and leaves open what causes the form and duration of Korsakoffs retrograde amnesia...|$|R
40|$|Nearly 10 % of {{a sample}} of men charged {{with a variety of}} {{offences}} claimed amnesia for their offence. The amnesia occurred only among those who had committed violence and was most frequent following homicide. All the <b>amnesics</b> had a psychiatric disorder, four having a primary depressive illness and the remainder being almost equally divided between schizophrenia and alcohol abuse. None of the amnesias had any legal implications. The circumstances of the offences suggested a variety of mechanisms to account for the amnesia, including repression, dissociation and alcoholic black-outs. Psychological defence mechanisms were probably of some importance, even when alcohol was an important factor...|$|R
40|$|Mental {{localization}} efforts tend {{to stress}} the where more than the what. We argue that the proper targets for localization are well-specified cognitive models. We make this case by relating an existing cognitive model of category learning to a learning circuit involving the hippocampus, perirhinal, and prefrontal cortex. Results from groups varying in function along this circuit (e. g., infants, <b>amnesics,</b> older adults) are successfully simulated by reducing the model’s ability to form new clusters in response to surprising events, such as an error in supervised learning or an unfamiliar stimulus in unsupervised learning. Reported task dissociations (e. g., categorization vs. recognition) are {{explained in terms of}} cluster recruitment demands...|$|R
