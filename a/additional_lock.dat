50|$|The next Sunday Stella again {{visits the}} office in order {{to search for the}} {{documents}} believed to because this time in search of the documents that will restore her family's wealth.

She looks through the safe without success, but she knows there is a special compartment with an <b>additional</b> <b>lock.</b> She gets the key from Truscott's desk and successful finds the papers in the locked compartment. At the same time Stella is in the office, Truscott goes to a dinner at the Country Club hosted by General Farwell. At the dinner the wealthy guests receive news from Wall Street that a bank in London collapsed and a financial crisis is imminent. Truscott is hit hard by the crisis and as a result cannot get banks to lend him money for the big project he has been working on thereby putting it on the verge of failure. Stella reviews the papers in her boarding house that night. The papers show the scheme that her father was planning that is very similar to Truscott's current endeavor revolutionizing the oil refining industry. The papers show $2 million in stock that her father has investment in his new company Universal Subterranean Development Company. She believes that this is the evidence that will prove their wealth; however, Stella then sees through the documents how her father's plan failed because of an economic collapse and the failures of his unscrupulous business partners. This proves that Wendell Truscott never stole from her father; it was Henry Merwin’s own fault that the family lost its fortune. Stella's findings cement the family's place outside the upper class of society and prevent Mrs. Merwin's dream of returning to their previous life impossible. She also learns that the income the family has been receiving was not generated by the Merwin estate but actually is Truscott's charity for the family. Stella returns the stolen papers to Mr. Truscott accompanied by a letter explaining her true identity as well as giving him her reason for resignation of the position. She thanks him for his generosity to the family and apologizes for taking advantage of the trust he showed her.|$|E

The ‘Brotherhood of Anubis’, consisting of Mr Altrichter, Mrs Engel, Victor and Mr Petkovic, is furious with Linn for resurfacing on the very day that Tom, Dick and Harry are wandering all over the school. She is not just putting herself at risk, declares Mr Altrichter, who has just arrived in the classroom. Victor and Mrs Engel then carefully escort Linn out of the school, so that she will not be seen by anyone and they will be safe again.Rufus speaks to Luzy in the girls’ lavatory. He thinks that Victor wants him out of the way so that he won’t be able to find Linn, but he does not want to give any details about his hospital stay. Rufus knows that Luzy has received a letter and he tells her that she can trust him. As a result, Luzy shows up with Rufus Malpied at the meeting place agreed upon with Linn. When Linn unexpectedly fails to show up, Rufus kidnaps Luzy. Rufus now attempts to exchange Luzy for Linn and makes contact with the ‘Brotherhood of Anubis’. But the brotherhood members (Mr Altrichter and Victor) refuse to go along with it. Rather, they tell the other students that Luzy has gone to visit her aunt and uncle in Spain.Students Nina and Delia do not believe, however, that Luzy is staying abroad; rather, they suspect that Luzy is in trouble and they begin researching her whereabouts. Rufus finds out and moves with Luzy to another location, but not before luring Nina and Delia to an abandoned factory building and locking them in there. A little later, they are both freed by Daniel. He had noticed their disappearance and had also managed to eavesdrop on a conversation between Rufus and Victor.Daniel, Nina and Delia now confront Victor and accuse him of doing nothing to free Luzy. But Victor still denies that any abduction took place and insists, on top of all that, that Luzy really is with her relatives in Spain. Victor wants the three students temporarily out of the way, so he punishes them with three days of ‘house arrest’.The next day, the three students meet with Mrs Engel. They are able to convince her that the time has come to meet with Rufus. Rufus does agree to a meeting, but he demands, in exchange for Luzy’s release, the folder containing Linn’s personal data. Mrs Engel warns Linn before her meeting with Rufus. This gives her and her family time to hide from Rufus. It comes time for the meeting between Mrs Engel and Rufus. While Mrs Engel stalls Rufus, Daniel, Nina and Delia set the kidnapped Luzy free. To enable Luzy and Linn to speak to each other, Mrs Engel arranges a web chat.

40|$|High-speed {{synchronous}} systems require {{tightly controlled}} clock timing allowances for high performance operation. A Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) is a commonly used circuit to de-skew any variations due to process, voltage, or temperature (PVT). While a DLL will effectively align an input reference clock to an outgoing data clock, the DLL will not adjust the reference duty cycle {{if it is}} non-ideal. For this purpose a Duty Cycle Corrector (DCC) {{can be used in}} tandem with the DLL. Through the combined use of a DLL and a DCC, a high-speed system can be provided with a clock that has been both de-skewed across PVT and has a good duty cycle. Three DCC designs are compared: the Half-Cycle Delay Line (HCDL), Open Loop (OL), and the Integrated Half-Cycle Delay Line (IHCDL). The HCDL DCC features a stable closed loop duty cycle detection and wide duty cycle range at the cost of larger layout area. The OL DCC features less stable open loop detection with the benefit of minimal forward path delay again at the cost of larger layout area. The IHCDL DCC is a hybrid design that, through the use of only a single delay line for both 0 ̊ and 180 ̊ phase generation, provides the advantages of the HCDL DCC with a substantial improvement to the required layout area. The design of a generic DLL and the IHCDL DCC are detailed in this thesis. The performance of the IHCDL is verified through simulation. Across a range of 3 - 10 ns the IHCDL DCC corrects duty cycle to within +/- 5 % of 50 %. The <b>additional</b> <b>lock</b> time and power consumption of the IHCDL DCC (compared to the DLL only) are evaluated. Finally, the jitter induced by the IHCDL DCC across PVT and voltage supply variations is evaluated. Suggestions are made for the improvement of duty cycle correction...|$|E

Belleville washers should never overhang the joint they are trying to secure, as all of their clamping force is on the outside perimeter edge of the washer. If a belleville washer overhangs a joint, its clamping effectiveness is exponentially reduced, and it is a poor application that will eventually fail under thermal expansion and contraction.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{water based}} public {{transport}} {{has a large}} contribution to the accessibility of rural areas in the Netherlands. Initiated by the industrial revolution a major shift from water based to land based public transport occurred. Until recent history water based public transport was considered unfeasible. Nowadays land based transport modes are threatened by their own success. The shortage of land available for land based public transport in rural areas creates congestion on highways and endangers the accessibility of many city centres. City centres which adopted their metropolitan status due to their location near the waterfront. This fact gives rise to investigate the feasibility of water based public transport in existing city centres and areas to be developed. The expansion of Almere, {{being part of the}} Amsterdam metropolitan region, outside the existing flood defence system in lake Markermeer is a strong example showing a large potential on accessibility by means of fast ferry navigation. An integral planning of water and land based infrastructure serving commuter related passenger transport, among other success factors, increases the success of tackling bottlenecks in the existing hydraulic infrastructure. For the water based public transport connection between Amsterdam Central Station and Almere the passage of the Schellingwoude lock complex is considered to be the most significant bottleneck causing previous attempts of shipping companies on this route to fail {{due to a lack of}} feasibility. Contradictory functional demands present at this lock complex in combination with the large yearly volume of commercial and recreational navigation passing this lock complex during the normative month (August) causes the lock operation process to involve an average passage time of fast ferry navigation outside the target conditions associated with water based public transport. In order to optimize the passage of fast ferry navigation at the Schellingwoude lock complex the feasibility of multiple lock system alternatives is investigated, being: - Alternative 1 a – Priority arrangement; - Alternative 1 b – Priority arrangement and separate locking method; - Alternative 2 a – Reservation of one lock chamber; - Alternative 2 b – Reservation of two lock chambers; - Alternative 3 – Priority arrangement and reservation of one lock chamber; - Alternative 4 a – Additional minimal lock chamber; - Alternative 4 b – Additional CEMT-class Vlb lock chamber; - Alternative 5 – Additional innovative structure. The performance criteria determining the feasibility of the proposed lock system alternatives are based on the target conditions associated with water based public transport derived from a travel time analysis on the preferred route between Amsterdam Central Station and Almere. The actual performance analysis is elaborated using the SIVAK 2 simulation model. From the performance analysis it is concluded that reservation of one lock chamber (Alternative 2 a) and the construction of an <b>additional</b> <b>lock</b> chamber with minimal dimensions serving fast ferry navigation (Alternative 4 a) are the best performing alternatives. Both alternatives lead to an average passage time of fast ferry navigation within the target conditions associated with fast ferry navigation and within the prescribed target conditions applied for commercial and recreational navigation. The best performing alternatives are further investigated using a social cost-benefit analysis. This analysis shows that alternative 4 a involves the least costs associated with direct effects compared to alternative 2 a during a life span of 100 years. This is mainly due to the effect of large financial consequences of additional waiting time of commercial and recreational navigation passing the Schellingwoude lock complex.

5000|$|The Model 1895 {{differed}} from the Mauser Model 1893 {{with regards to the}} bolt face. The bolt face used in the Mauser Model 1893 was square whereas the Model 1895’s was cylindrical, {{this is due to the}} fact that the square face was unnecessary for reliable feeding. In addition, the Model 1895 had an auxiliary shoulder behind the bolt handle in order to provide <b>additional</b> <b>locking</b> in case of bolt failure. Another major modification regarding the Model 1895 to the Model 1893 was the magazine follower, the tail of which was rounded so that the bolt could be closed on an empty chamber ...|$|R
500|$|Some <b>additional</b> <b>locks</b> were added, and by 1795, {{there were}} fifteen, three made of masonry blocks, and twelve with turf sides. There were also two single gates or half locks. The lowest lock was at Woodmill, where the {{navigation}} joined the estuary of the River Itchen, {{on its way}} to Southampton Water. The main wharves at the Southampton end were at Northam, about [...] below the lock, and barges worked down to them on the tide or were punted if the tide was rising. As the river was tidal below Woodmill Lock, the structure was rebuilt in 1829 with a third set of gates facing downstream, to prevent high tides flooding the navigation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{a family of}} shell finite elements with quadratic displacements across the thickness. These elements are very attractive, but compared to standard general shell elements they face another source of numerical locking in addition to shear and membrane <b>locking.</b> This <b>additional</b> <b>locking</b> phenomenon - that we call ''pinching locking'' - {{is the subject of}} this paper and we analyse a numerical strategy designed to overcome this difficulty. Using a model problem in which only this specific source of locking is present, we are able to obtain error estimates independent of the thickness parameter, which shows that pinching locking is effectively treated. This is also confirmed by some numerical experiments of which we give an account...|$|R
50|$|One {{hundred and}} nine locks were {{required}} to raise and lower the barges over this relatively short distance. Some of the locks were in consecutive series of four and five due to steep grades. The summit of the Black River Canal ("BRC") passed through Boonville in Oneida County, where it met with a feeder canal that originated in Forestport. The northern end of the canal proper terminated at Lyons Falls in Lewis County while canal boat traffic continued through to Carthage by way of improvements to the navigability of the Black River itself and the assistance of steamboats. Two <b>additional</b> <b>locks</b> and four dams on the river were needed to accomplish this feat.|$|R

The canal begins about 3 mi {{north of the}} locks at the Troy Federal Dam, {{at the point where}} the Erie Canal splits from the Hudson River. The Champlain Canal follows the Hudson River north for approximately 35 mi, with six locks providing navigation around dams on the Hudson River, until it reaches lock C-7 in Fort Edward, New York. At this point, the canal follows a constructed channel for approximately 25 mi, with five <b>additional</b> <b>locks,</b> bringing the canal to the southern end of Lake Champlain at Whitehall, New York.|$|R
