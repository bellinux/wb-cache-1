40|$|This paper derives {{analytical}} closed-form expressions that {{uncover the}} contributions of nodal active- and reactive-power injections to the active- and reactive-power flows on transmission lines in an AC electrical network. Paying due homage to current- and voltage-divider laws that are similar in spirit, we baptize these as the power divider laws. Derived from a circuit-theoretic examination of AC power-flow expressions, {{the constitution of the}} power divider laws reflects the topology and voltage profile of the network. We demonstrate the utility of the power divider laws to the analysis of power networks by highlighting applications to transmission-network allocation, transmission-loss allocation, and identifying feasible injections while respecting line <b>active-power</b> <b>flow</b> set points...|$|E

A novel strategy, {{for control of}} the power flow for a smart micro-grid is proposed. The utility grid power is dynamically controlled by a Power Electronic Transformer (PET). A 60 Hz, step-down transformer is generally used at the point of common coupling (PCC), to connect the micro-grid to the power system grid. Substitution of the conventional 60 Hz transformer, by a PET, results in enhanced micro-grid power management system, during grid-connected operation. The smart micro-grid is a set of controllable loads and distributed energy resources (DER); both renewable and non-renewable; that supply demand of a group of customers. The proposed dynamic power limiter (also referred to as PET) is a high-frequency, isolated power-converter system, comprised of a highfrequency step-down transformer and three-phase to single-phase matrix converters. The matrix converters are modulated with a novel pulse width modulation (PWM) strategy for a bi-directional power flow control. The output of the matrix converter generates a high frequency (few kHz) pulsating single phase AC at the primary and secondary of the transformer, which are phase shifted for active power control. The PET also allows voltage regulation by control of reactive power. The entire system; represented as two, three-phase AC systems with an intermediate high-frequency transformer; is simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The equivalent system has utility grid at the input side and a micro-grid on the output side. The micro-grid is modeled as an interconnected system consisting of set of DERs and smart loads. The simulation analyzes the change in micro grid’s power generation and consumption in response to the change in its local grid frequency, upon limiting the utility grid power. The PET hence restores the system frequency by adjusting supply and demand at the PCC. The micro-grid can now participate in frequency regulation for the main grid. The simulation results are obtained to verify the operation and claims of the dynamic power limiter as stated below: 1. Restricted active power flow to the micro-grid, at a desired value determined by the main utility grid. 2. Utilization of the change in local grid frequency, to dynamically control the active power generation or consumption within the micro-grid. 3. Decentralized control of the DERs as well as the controllable loads, which operate synchronously, to supply the demand within the micro-grid. 4. Bi-directional <b>active-power</b> <b>flow</b> capability at the PCC. 5. Voltage regulation by control of reactive power. 6. Contribution of the micro-grid components in frequency regulation of the main grid. 7. Smooth transition from islanding to grid-connected mode of the micro-grid, without the need of grid synchronization. 8. Extra degree of freedom due to the presence of active-power controller in a possible deregulation and market strategy within the micro-grid...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{energy is}} {{gradually}} becoming {{a major contributor}} to the overall energy production, especially in the developed world. This is because of the ever- increasing concerns about long-term availability of conventional fuels, global warming, and energy security. Wind power production is gradually moving offshore because of scarcity of onshore sites (particularly in Europe), environmentalists’ concerns over noise and visual pollution, and better wind conditions out in the open sea. Offshore wind farms are generally located close to the shore currently in shallow waters. However, more power demand from wind will eventually put more and more wind farms farther out in the deep sea. This would require floating turbine and grid-integration platforms. This is where High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnection between the offshore power plant and the onshore grid would become more attractive than the AC option. The power to be transmitted, if in excess of a certain amount, would necessitate either multiple Voltage Sourced Converter based HVDC (VSC HVDC) links or a single Line Commutated Converter based HVDC (LCC HVDC) link. The latter could be a cheaper option. LCC HVDC is and will remain the preferred choice for point-to-point transmission of bulk power in the foreseeable future due to it being a proven technology in use {{for more than half a}} century, its lower losses, and high power and voltage capability. There remain inherent issues of black-start, high content of lower-order harmonics, and high fundamental-frequency reactive-power consumption. The reactive power and harmonics are traditionally compensated-for by shunt-connected passive filters, which take up a lot of area and make the LCC HVDC terminal size large and expensive. In a deep-sea offshore perspective, this would increase the cost of the floating platform. This work has explored the possibilities of improvement in transformer-less series compensation of LCC HVDC so as to reduce the size of the converter terminal. The behaviour of the capacitor commutated converter based HVDC (CCC HVDC) was first compared to the conventional system. Later on, the Gate Commutated Series Capacitor (GCSC) was analysed for its potential in the reduction of the converter terminal size. The work ultimately culminated in the proposal of a new compensator termed the Series Pulsed Voltage Compensator (SPVC), which is a transformer-less series-connected compensator employing full bridges. The compensator reduces the reactive-power consumption of the HVDC terminal in addition to compensating for the reactive-power consumption of the heavy leakage reactances of the converter transformers. It also reduces the lower-order current harmonics. The compensator demonstrates the capability to follow the changes in reactive-power reference at any given <b>active-power</b> <b>flow,</b> a functionality which would eliminate the switching requirements employed in the conventional shunt compensation technique. Experiments on a small-scale laboratory setup have validated the simulation results. The functionalities mentioned above have been achieved using very small capacitors in the SPVC. This indicates a potentially significant reduction in the need for shunt-connected capacitor banks and large passive-filter inductors with associated switchgear for reactive and harmonic compensation. This would result in a sizeable reduction in the size of the LCC HVDC terminal. The simulation and modelling of an active shunt-connected reactive/harmonic compensator based on the relatively recent Conservative Power Theory is also presented in the appendix A. In addition, a few suggestions for improving the dynamic behaviour of the HVDC control loops are presented in appendix B. PhD i elkraftteknikkPhD in Electric Power Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{power systems}} {{operated}} by the utilities in developing countries suffer from a large gap between demand and generation, inadequate transmission capacity, and nonuniform location of the load centers and generating stations. Occurrences of faults in such systems, {{in most of the}} cases, end up with the worst consequences (i. e., complete blackout). This paper illustrates the way a blackout can be prevented in real time through controlled segregation of a system into a number of viable islands together with generation and/or load shedding. The nature and location of any fault that warrants such islanding can be ascertained in real time through monitoring the <b>active-power</b> (megawatt) <b>flows</b> at both ends of a number of prespecified lines. The blackout of June 20, 1998 in the Bangladesh Power Development Board system has been used as an example in the illustration. The philosophy of the proposed islanding scheme may be considered for implementation in other power systems also...|$|R
