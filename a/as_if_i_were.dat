25|$|The {{play was}} written in January 2006, {{initially}} with the title If I Were You, which was then altered to I to I before reverting to the original. However, there were no plans to produce the play that year, as the Stephen Joseph Theatre already planned to produce revivals of Intimate Exchanges and Woman in Mind. However, on 21 February 2006, Alan Ayckbourn suffered a stroke. As a result, directorship of Intimate Exchanges passed to Tim Luscombe, {{and the production of}} Woman in Mind was eventually dropped altogether. Whilst in hospital, Ayckbourn decided to use his latest play as a goal to work towards. I to I was scheduled for the autumn slot vacated by Woman in Mind in June, rehearsed at the rehearsal studio at his home, and the play was announced to the public, now retitled <b>as</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> You, in July.|$|E
25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
500|$|Whatever {{the truth}} of the rumours, James {{required}} a royal match to preserve the Stuart line. [...] "God is my witness", he explained, [...] "I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [...] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a barren stock." [...] On 20 August 1589, Anne was married by proxy to James at Kronborg Castle, the ceremony ending with James' representative, George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.|$|E

500|$|McConaughey was {{confirmed}} {{to be playing}} Walter Padick, Flagg's alter-ego, in the film adaptation of The Dark Tower in 2016. Nikolaj Arcel, the film's director and co-writer, said [...] "Matthew is an incredible actor who can do anything. That’s how I feel about [...] He could do anything." [...] Arcel described Walter as having [...] "a very interesting way of seeing the world. He sees it {{with a sort of}} delight, even though he is obviously {{on the wrong side of}} the light-and-dark spectrum. He’s someone I’ve been having a lot of fun with." [...] McConaughey described Walter with [...] "I enjoyed approaching my character <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> the Devil having a good time, getting turned on by exposing human hypocrisies wherever he finds them." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{outside the}} Pearl, Eko sees Yemi and follows {{him into an}} open field, where Yemi tells him {{it is time for}} Eko to confess his sins. Eko says he has not sinned, having not chosen the life he was given and that Eko had only done what he needed to do to survive. An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E

500|$|Later in 1939, Prokofiev {{composed}} his Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7, and 8, Opp. 82–84, {{widely known}} today as the [...] "War Sonatas." [...] Premiered respectively by Prokofiev (No. 6: 8 April 1940), Sviatoslav Richter (No. 7: Moscow, 18 January 1943) and Emil Gilels (No. 8: Moscow, 30 December 1944), they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter. Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev, [...] "having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created" [...] (i.e. in Zdravitsa) then subsequently, in the three sonatas, [...] "expressed his true feelings". As evidence, Jaffé {{has pointed out that}} the central movement of Sonata No. 7 opens with a theme based on a Robert Schumann lied 'Wehmut' ('Sadness', which appears in Schumann's Liederkreis, Op. 39): its words translate, [...] "I can sometimes sing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart. Nightingales... sing their song of longing from their dungeon's depth... everyone delights, yet no one feels the pain, the deep sorrow in the song." [...] Ironically (it appears no one noticed his allusion), Sonata No. 7 received a Stalin Prize (Second Class), and No. 8 a Stalin Prize (First Class).|$|E

2500|$|A {{stirring}} speech against {{racial discrimination}} {{was given by}} African-American activist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, in which she said [...] "You white women speak here of rights.

[...] An example of such good humor appears in a letter about her not yet used to being married: [...] "It seems sometimes exactly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> here for a visit. The illusion is quite dispelled however when Herman stalks into my room without even the ceremony of knocking, bringing me perhaps a button to sew on, or some equally romantic occupation." ...|$|E

In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I'm a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I'm in the country I'm a keen bird-watcher."

2500|$|The album {{did receive}} {{some level of}} criticism, though. thenewreview.net stated [...] "With songs like 'Ride Insane' 'Here and Now' and 'Nowhere', I became a little bored. I felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{listening}} to songs I had already heard before by the band, or perhaps even elsewhere, and wasn’t completely blown away by what was there." [...] Guitarinternational.com stated [...] "Cold Day Memory is a killer release, and one that should act to propel the band into the new decade with {{a renewed sense of}} confidence, hopefully forgetting, at least somewhat, the events that haunted them {{for the majority of the}} past decade. If this record is any indication of things to come, then we could be hearing great things from a band that has more than paid their dues, and come screaming back onto the scene, leaving no doubt that they deserve to be included next to the biggest names in Metal today." ...|$|E
