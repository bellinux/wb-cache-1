His offensive game is characterized by his powerful slapshot. He has won numerous hardest shot titles with the Canucks in the team's SuperSkills competitions, clocking one shot at 102.7 miles-per-hour (163.5 kph) in 2012. As a result, he is used frequently on the powerplay, being set up by teammates for shots from the point. <b>A</b> <b>well-rounded</b> defenceman, Salo also earns time on the penalty kill.|$|E
5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, {{with a straight}} or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> croup. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess feathering. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they are quick to learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Months before Entre a Mi Mundo was {{scheduled}} to be released, Pérez was booked on charges for driving under the influence, assaulting police officers, resisting arrest, and initiating a high-speed chase with police. In December 1992, Pérez was convicted and was ordered to pay $670 (1992 USD) in fines, court costs, and attorney fees. Pérez wrote that he felt guilty for the crimes that he was charged with, noting that Selena tried to convince Abraham that Pérez was <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> person. Pérez later told Abraham about his wrongdoing, but was dumbfounded when Abraham forgave him, a reaction that Pérez was not expecting. After the band completed the recording sessions for Entre a Mi Mundo, several members of the band and their friends went to a hotel in San Antonio, Texas to celebrate. According to Pérez, he, along with several of his friends, trashed the hotel. The next morning, Abraham was contacted by the manager of the hotel where the incident took place; Abraham immediately fired two road crew members. Pérez believed that Abraham would come for him next and fire him, but found that after he had apologized, Abraham accepted his apology and allowed him to continue being the band's guitarist.|$|E

25|$|A boxer-puncher is <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> boxer {{who is able}} {{to fight}} at close range with a {{combination}} of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter), but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.|$|E

He also won two FA Premiership winners medals. Towards the end of his playing career he moved into {{management}} as player-manager with Middlesbrough. <b>A</b> <b>well-rounded</b> midfielder, Robson had a good goal-scoring record; terrific anticipation, movement, timing on and off the ball; was fiercely competitive and brave; possessed high levels of stamina; tackled, passed well and was also a good header of the ball.|$|E

Galantin as the final Chief of the Bureau of Naval Materiel and the first Commander of the newly formed Naval Material Command.

25|$|In 1812, at age three, Nariakira was {{designated}} {{the heir to}} the Satsuma lordship by his father. As with any daimyō’s heir, Nariakira was prepared for his future role, by receiving <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> education in the martial and scholarly arts. As stated above, Nariakira shared his grandfather Shigehide’s fascination with Western culture and learning. The young Nariakira was fascinated by his grandfather’s collection of western items, which included clocks, musical instruments, telescopes, microscopes, and weapons. In the course of his education, he was also taught how to read and write Roman letters, and would later use Roman letters to write Japanese words as a personal form of code. Shigehide also introduced Nariakira to Philipp Franz von Siebold, a German physician serving {{as the director of the}} Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie)in Nagasaki, making him one of the few Japanese to have actually met a Westerner.|$|E
25|$|The {{founder of}} the {{aviation}} program at UND, John D. Odegard, logged over 10,000 hours of flight {{time in his life}} and was licensed for commercial flight and instrument operations. He was type-rated in Cessna Citations, Learjet, and Beechjet, as well as being a certificated flight instructor (CFI) and certified examiner for commercial, instrument, tailwheel, multiengine, and Citation type-ratings. Having broken the sound barrier in the Concorde (as a passenger) and having flown as a crop-duster to help pay for college, Odegard was no stranger to the varied envelopes of flight. He was quite familiar with the many aspects of aviation and his vision for <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> school which trains pilots in all aspects of flight helped the aviation program at UND become what it is today. Odegard died of cancer in 1998 at the age of 57. He is buried in Grand Forks, less than a mile away from the UND campus.|$|E

500|$|Readers {{and critics}} have {{described}} Tintin as <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> yet open-ended, intelligent and creative character, noting that his rather neutral personality—sometimes labelled as bland—permits a balanced {{reflection of the}} evil, folly, and foolhardiness, which surrounds him. [...] The character never compromises his Boy Scout ideals, which represent Hergé's own, and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story, rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist. Tintin's iconic representation enhances this aspect, with Scott McCloud noting that it [...] "allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world." ...|$|E

500|$|Jordan's {{athletic}} leaping ability, {{highlighted in}} his back-to-back slam dunk contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many with having influenced {{a generation of}} young players. Several current NBA All-Stars have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while growing up, including LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players [...] "the next Michael Jordan" [...] upon their entry to the NBA, including Anfernee [...] "Penny" [...] Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Vince Carter, and Dwyane Wade. Although Jordan was <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> player, his [...] "Air Jordan" [...] image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact Jordan himself has lamented.|$|E

500|$|Hazlitt's {{focus in}} the essay on Coriolanus is less on the various {{characters}} of Shakespeare's tragedy than on the fundamental moral and political principles behind their actions. For Hazlitt, this play showed in action the concepts behind political writings of his own day, such as Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France and Thomas Paine's Rights of Man. The character of Coriolanus {{is a type of}} the aristocratic hero, though presented as <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> individual, with a [...] "pride" [...] consisting of [...] "inflexible sternness of will", a [...] "love of reputation" [...] and [...] "glory", and a [...] "contempt of popular opinion". Hazlitt also comments on the characters of Coriolanus's mother and wife, and he points out the substantial fidelity of this play to its source in Thomas North's translation of Plutarch's Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans, extracting long passages from the life of Coriolanus.|$|E

[...] In addition, Staten said that the novel was the perfect way to do the character of Sergeant Johnson—who had appeared somewhat one-dimensional in the games—proper justice as <b>a</b> <b>well-rounded</b> character. Replying to G4TV's question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing [...] "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of Halo.
