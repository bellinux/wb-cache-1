5|$|Sound {{designer}} Frank Serafine, {{a longtime}} Star Trek fan, {{was invited to}} create the sound effects for the picture. Given access to state-of-the-art audio equipment, Serafine saw the picture as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology. Owing to background noise such as camera operation, much of the <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to create or recreate sounds to mix back into the scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} each {{game in the}} Myst series has fallen to various composers. Originally, the Millers {{believed}} that any music or sound besides <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> would distract the player from the game and ruin the sense of reality; Myst, therefore, was to have no music at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers that music heightened the sense of immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for Riven, which featured leitmotifs {{for each of the}} main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E

25|$|Active noise-cancelling {{headphones}} use a microphone, amplifier, {{and speaker}} to pick up, amplify, and play <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> in phase-reversed form; this {{to some extent}} cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> by 20dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments {{with other types of}} noise.|$|E

25|$|Evoked {{potential}} amplitudes {{tend to be}} low, {{ranging from}} less than a microvolt to several microvolts, compared to tens of microvolts for EEG, millivolts for EMG, and often close to a volt for ECG. To resolve these low-amplitude potentials {{against the background of}} ongoing EEG, ECG, EMG, and other biological signals and <b>ambient</b> <b>noise,</b> signal averaging is usually required. The signal is time-locked to the stimulus and most of the noise occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out with averaging of repeated responses.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} use of <b>ambient</b> seismic <b>noise</b> for seismic imaging requires {{better understanding of the}} <b>ambient</b> seismic <b>noise</b> wavefield and its source locations and mechanisms. Although the source regions and mechanisms of Rayleigh waves have been studied extensively, characterization of Love wave source processes are sparse or absent. We present here the first systematic comparison of <b>ambient</b> seismic <b>noise</b> source directions within the primary (~ 10 – 20 [*]s period) and secondary (~ 5 – 10 [*]s period) microseism bands for both Rayleigh and Love waves in the Southern Hemisphere using vertical- and horizontal-component <b>ambient</b> seismic <b>noise</b> recordings from a dense temporary network of 68 broadband seismometers in New Zealand. Our analysis indicates that Rayleigh and Love waves within the primary microseism band appear to be mostly generated in different areas, whereas in the secondary microseism band they arrive from similar backazimuths. Furthermore, the source areas of surface waves within the secondary microseism band correlate well with modeled deep-water and near-coastal source regions. Y. Behr, J. Townend, M. Bowen, L.

Many smartphones and personal media players are sold with earphones that do {{a poor job of}} blocking <b>ambient</b> <b>noise,</b> leading some users to turn up the volume to the maximum level to drown out street noise. People listening to their media players on crowded commutes sometimes play music at high volumes feel a sense of separation, freedom and escape from their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Gregory Maston of Bell Labs {{filed for}} a patent {{involving}} a circuit that could switch between several audio sources based on their levels. The loudest one was latched into the mix. This system did not ramp switched signals smoothly in and out and did not maintain a constant ambience. It was intended for speakerphone conferencing applications. In 1972, Keith A. T. Knox with the British Post Office Corporation developed an adaptive threshold gate circuit intended for speakerphone usage. The system used a second microphone somewhat near the first to sense <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> level.|$|E
25|$|Perceived quality can be {{influenced}} by listening environment (<b>ambient</b> <b>noise),</b> listener attention, and listener training {{and in most cases}} by listener audio equipment (such as sound cards, speakers and headphones). Furthermore, sufficient quality may be achieved by a lesser quality setting for lectures and human speech applications and reduces encoding time and complexity. A test given to new students by Stanford University Music Professor Jonathan Berger showed that student preference for MP3-quality music has risen each year. Berger said the students seem to prefer the 'sizzle' sounds that MP3s bring to music.|$|E
40|$|Signal {{transmission}} {{in ocean}} using {{water as a}} channel is a challenging process due to attenuation, spreading, reverberation, absorption, and so forth, apart from the contribution of acoustic signals due to <b>ambient</b> <b>noises.</b> <b>Ambient</b> <b>noises</b> in sea are of two types: manmade (shipping, aircraft over the sea, motor on boat, etc.) and natural (rain, wind, seismic, etc.), apart from marine mammals and phytoplanktons. Since wind exists in all places and at all time: its effect plays a major role. Hence, in this paper, we concentrate on estimating the effects of wind. Seven sets of data with various wind speeds ranging from 2. 11 [*]m/s to 6. 57 [*]m/s were used. The analysis is performed for frequencies ranging from 100 [*]Hz to 8 [*]kHz. It is found that a linear relationship between noise spectrum and wind speed exists for the entire frequency range. Further, we developed a noise model for analyzing the noise level. The results of the empirical data are found to fit with results obtained {{with the aid of}} noise model...|$|R
30|$|In theory, in {{an ideal}} situation, we would expect an {{isotropic}} distribution of <b>ambient</b> seismic <b>noise</b> sources to obtain time-symmetric CCFs and TDEGFs (e.g., Roux et al. 2005). However, in practice, most cases have yielded asymmetric results because of the uneven distribution of <b>ambient</b> seismic <b>noise</b> sources, which mainly correlated to microseisms generated by ocean wave interactions with the seafloor or coastlines (e.g., Sabra et al. 2005 b; Yao et al. 2006; Stehly et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2010). In Aso volcano, another consideration is LPTs, with dominant periods of 10 – 15  s, which have been observed as mentioned in the previous section. Consequently, we first attempted to understand the possible directionality of <b>ambient</b> seismic <b>noise</b> sources during the study periods.|$|R
50|$|Darkstep (also {{known as}} Darkside) is a subgenre of drum and bass that fuses {{elements}} of dark drum and bass with uptempo breakbeats and <b>ambient</b> <b>noises</b> (similar to those characteristic of neurofunk). Darkstep music is typically composed in a chromatic scale. Off-time and erratically cut breakbeat samples feature prominently. Darkstep comes from techstep, whereas neurofunk relies on science fiction soundscape and clean production. Darkstep uses traditional 1990s basslines like the Reese bass.|$|R
25|$|Marine {{life can}} be {{susceptible}} to noise or the sound pollution from sources such as passing ships, oil exploration seismic surveys, and naval low-frequency active sonar. Sound travels more rapidly and over larger distances in the sea than in the atmosphere. Marine animals, such as cetaceans, often have weak eyesight, and {{live in a world}} largely defined by acoustic information. This applies also to many deeper sea fish, who {{live in a world of}} darkness. Between 1950 and 1975, <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> at one location in the Pacific Ocean increased by about ten decibels (that is a tenfold increase in intensity).|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of a hybrid photovoltaic cell that contains piezoelectric materials {{can be increased}} simply by placing it near a source of <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> or vibration. The effect was demonstrated with organic cells using zinc oxide nanotubes. The electricity generated by the piezoelectric effect itself is a negligible percentage of the overall output. Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field {{set up by the}} vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the organic polymer layer. This process decreases the likelihood of recombination, in which electrons are energized but settle back into a hole instead of migrating to the electron-accepting ZnO layer.|$|E
25|$|Passive noise {{isolation}} is essentially using {{the body of}} the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers, with the aim to be able to monitor the recorded sound while shutting out the sound coming directly from the drums {{at the same time as}} much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce <b>ambient</b> <b>noise</b> by around 25dB.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to gain an increasing understanding of the properties of vegetation noise and also to the relative ratios of different natural <b>ambient</b> <b>noises</b> to mask wind turbine sound. A discrete vegetation noise model was developed and compared to an earlier model showing improved estimations, especially at frequencies below 0. 5 kHz. Field measurements of sound from deleafed trees are compared to a deleafed tree model with satisfactory agreement. A wind turbulence model (Sandia method) was coupled to the discrete model and thereby time series of fluctuating vegetation noise can be computed. Several measurements including higher wind speeds than reported in earlier literature were compared to predictions of fluctuating vegetation noise with good agreement. Psycho acoustic tests was performed by 36 subjects to determine the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios when wind turbine noise is inaudible in three different natural <b>ambient</b> <b>noises.</b> The masking threshold varied between - 6. 5 dBA and - 2. 7 dBA for coniferous tree noise and sea wave noise respectively. Further tests revealed that at S/N ratios of + 3 dBA and above the wind turbine noise was considered as the dominant sound source. QC 2010110...|$|R
50|$|Field {{recording}} {{often involves}} {{the capture of}} <b>ambient</b> <b>noises</b> that are low level and complex, and, in response, the requirements from the field recordist have often pushed the technical limits of recording equipment, that is, demanding low noise and extended frequency response in a portable, battery-powered unit. For this reason, field recordists have favoured high-quality (usually professional) recorders, microphones, and microphone pre-amplifiers. The history of the equipment used in this area closely tracks the development of professional portable audio recording technology.|$|R
