5|$|HDMI 1.3a was {{released}} on November 10, 2006, and had Cable and Sink modifications for type C, source termination recommendations, and removed undershoot and maximum rise/fall time limits. It also changed CEC capacitance limits, and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> form, with audio control commands added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> {{level of}} consciousness {{as a result}} of liver failure. Onset may be gradual or sudden. Other symptoms may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages it can result in a coma.|$|E

5|$|Matheos {{suggested}} using <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> {{version of}} the United States passport for the album's cover art. The differences are that the arrows are double-headed, the olive branch is wilted, and the eagle's wings have been clipped. Matheos, Moore and Portnoy decided against sending out promotional copies of the album before its release date {{in order to prevent}} an early Internet leak of it. The album was released in Europe on February 17, 2003.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} effects of benzodiazepine use can include cognitive impairment as well as affective and behavioural problems. Feelings of turmoil, difficulty in thinking constructively, loss of sex-drive, agoraphobia and social phobia, increasing anxiety and depression, loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests, and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use. Additionally, <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> perception of self, environment and relationships may occur.|$|E

5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} early 1954. The film was {{simultaneously}} shot in Tamil as Missiamma, with <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> cast. Missamma {{tells the story}} of two unemployed people of different religions and mentalities: M. T. Rao and Mary. They pose as a married couple to obtain jobs in a high school founded by Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram. As Rao and Mary fall in love, Gopalam's nephew A. K. Raju (an amateur detective) learns that Mary is Gopalam's missing elder daughter Mahalakshmi; she is unaware of her true identity.|$|E
5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, {{claimed the}} object was simply an 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly. Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained {{an image of the}} object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> copy of one of their own comet images.|$|E

5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows the use of <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion {{on the ground at}} varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E
5|$|The Crystarium is a {{leveling}} {{and growth}} system, making a return from Final Fantasy XIII in <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> form. The system consists of constellation-style {{representations of the}} character's weapons and tamed monsters, made up of small and large crystal nodes, which can be accessed {{from the start of}} the game. There is one Crystarium system available for each monster and Paradigm role. Crystogen points gained in battle can be used to expand the Crystarium, unlocking bonuses to health, magic, or strength, or provide the characters with new abilities and slots for battle accessories. For the monsters, the bonuses are unlocked with items dropped by defeated enemies.|$|E

5|$|The kulintang gong {{itself is}} {{believed}} to have been one of those foreign musical elements incorporated into kulintang music, derived from the Sundanese kolenang due to its striking similarities. Along with the fact that they play important roles in their respectively ensembles, both the kulintang and kolenang show striking homogeneity in tapered rims (as opposed to pronouncedly tapered Javanese bonang and non-tapered Laotian khong vong gongs). Even the word kulintang {{is believed to}} be just <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> form of the Sundanese word kolenang.|$|E
5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the design}} of the jersey was {{modified}} because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort. This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> design. Instead of using the traditional hoops, the side used a sky-blue based jersey and a red and white V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club's history where the traditional deep blue, red and white combination was absent from the jersey. After the war, the V-strip design reverted to the original blue that had been present in the original jerseys, and the single red and white stripes around the shirt's chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team's base design.|$|E

5|$|Five years later—with the First World War {{raging in}} Europe—the {{political}} climate had changed. A tentative five-year program {{put together in}} October and supported by President Woodrow Wilson called for ten battleships, six battlecruisers and ten destroyers {{to be completed by}} 1922. This was submitted to Congress in December 1915. On 2 June 1916, the House of Representatives passed the bill in a modified form, replacing five of the battleships with battlecruisers. On 29 August 1916, the Senate also passed <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> bill, keeping the original number of ships but stipulating that the program be completed in three years (FY 1917–19). The first four ships were paid for in FY 1917, the fifth in FY 1918, and the last in FY 1919.|$|E
5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce <b>an</b> <b>altered</b> state of consciousness and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E
