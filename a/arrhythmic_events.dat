Tedisamil blocks multiple types of potassium channels in the heart resulting in slowed heart rate. While the effects of tedisamil have been demonstrated in both atrial and ventricular muscle, repolarization is prolonged more efficiently in the atria. Tedisamil is administered intravenously and has a half-life of approximately 8 -13 hours in circulation. Tedisamil is being developed as an alternative to other antiarrhythmics as incidence of additional <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> is lower compared to other class III agents. Tedisamil also has significant anti-ischemic properties and was initially investigated as a potential treatment for angina until its antiarrhythmic effects were discovered.Tedisamil is manufactured by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the proposed trade name Pulzium and is currently in phase III of clinical testing for atrial fibrillation.|$|E

In this study we investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) can be helpful in identifying ARVC/D patients with increased risk of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> METHODS AND RESULts: We studied 30 consecutive patients (17 males; 45. 4 ± 18 years) with ARVC/D, diagnosed according to guideline criteria; 15 patients (50 %) had received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary SCD prevention. HRV was assessed on 24 -h ECG Holter monitoring. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (SCD, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ICD therapy for sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF)). During the follow-up period (19 ± 7 months), no deaths occurred, but 5 patients (17 %) experienced <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (4 VTs and 1 VF, all in the ICD group).

During the follow-up period (range 1 to 1, 112 days), there were 24 <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and 47 deaths. The initial relation between several prognostic factors and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> was explored with use of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of survival function. Impaired heart rate variability < 20 ms (p < 0. 0000), late potentials (p < 0. 0000), ventricular ectopic beat frequency (p < 0. 0000), repetitive ventricular forms (p < 0. 0000), left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % (p < 0. 02) and Killip class (p < 0. 02) were identified as significant univariate predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> When these variables were analyzed by using a stepwise Cox regression model, only impaired heart rate variability, followed by late potentials and repetitive ventricular forms remained independent predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> The combination of impaired heart rate variability and late potentials had a sensitivity of 58 %, a positive predictive accuracy of 33 % and a relative risk of 18. 5 for <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and was superior to other combinations including those incorporating left ventricular function, exercise ECG, ventricular ectopic beat frequency and repetitive ventricular forms.

However, {{the effect of the}} device on the risk of recurrent VTEs among patients who experience a first <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> has not been investigated. MethodsThe CRT-D versus defibrillator-only risks for first and subsequent fast VTEs (> 180 beats/min) were assessed by Cox proportional hazards and Andersen-Gill proportional intensity regression modeling, respectively, in efficacy analyses recognizing active device-type during follow-up. ResultsMultivariate analysis showed that CRT-D was associated with a significant 29 % (p = 0. 003) reduction in the risk of a first VTE, with a pronounced effect among patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) (hazard ratio [HR]: 0. 58; p < 0. 001) and no significant effect among non-LBBB patients (HR: 1. 05; p = 0. 82, p for the difference = 0. 02). Patients with LBBB who experienced a first VTE had no change in the risk of subsequent VTEs with CRT-D (HR: 0. 98; p = 0. 85). In contrast, the risk of recurrent VTEs with CRT-D was significantly increased among non-LBBB patients (HR: 3. 62; p = 0. 002, p for the difference = 0. 009). Recurrent VTEs increased the risk of subsequent heart failure or death.

Such guidelines {{were used in the}} Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) study. MethodsThis study was an analysis of the risk of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (arrhythmic death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and torsade de pointes VT) in the antiarrhythmic drug arm of the AFFIRM study. Each time an antiarrhythmic drug was begun, it was counted as an exposure to that drug and the risk of an arrhythmic event was calculated. ResultsA total of 2, 033 patients received 3, 030 exposures to antiarrhythmic drugs. Ninety-six <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> occurred by six years.

BACKGROUNDPrevious studies have shown that heart rate variability could predict <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and sudden death in postinfarction patients, but the prognostic value of heart rate variability for <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> or sudden death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy has not been established. METHODSTime and frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability on 24 -h electrocardiographic (ECG) recording was assessed in 116 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (91 men, aged 51 ± 12 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 34 ± 12 %). RESULTSMean follow-up (± SD) was 53 ± 39 months. Sixteen patients reached one of the defined study end-points (sudden death, resuscitated ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia) during follow-up. Using multivariate analysis, only reduced standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) (p = 0. 02) and ventricular tachycardia during 24 -h ECG recording (p = 0. 02) predicted sudden death and/or <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> For SDNN, a cutoff level of 100 ms seemed the best for the risk stratification.

Among eight patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, six suffered <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during a median follow-up period of 16 months. No patient without inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia suffered an arrhythmic event. Multivariate analysis showed that of all the variables examined, inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was the only independent predictor of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during the follow-up period. The sensitivity for predicting <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> by this response was 100 %, the specificity 97 % and the positive predictive accuracy 75 %. Individually, the other prognostic variables were less sensitive and much less accurate predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> but the combination of the occurrence of acute phase complications or frequent ectopic activity with an abnormal signal-averaged ECG approached the sensitivity and accuracy of inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Catecholaminergic {{polymorphic}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome associated with mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (Ryr 2) {{in the majority}} of patients. Previous studies of CPVT patients mainly involved probands, so current insight into disease penetrance, expression, genotype-phenotype correlations, and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> rates in relatives carrying the Ryr 2 mutation is limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: One-hundred sixteen relatives carrying the Ryr 2 mutation from 15 families who were identified by cascade screening of the Ryr 2 mutation causing CPVT in the proband were clinically characterized, including 61 relatives from 1 family. Fifty-four of 108 antiarrhythmic drug-free relatives (50 %) had a CPVT phenotype at the first cardiological examination, including 27 (25 %) with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Relatives carrying a Ryr 2 mutation in the C-terminal channel-forming domain showed an increased odds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (odds ratio, 4. 1; 95 % CI, 1. 5 - 11. 5; P= 0. 007, compared with N-terminal domain) compared with N-terminal domain. Sinus bradycardia was observed in 19 % of relatives, whereas other supraventricular dysrhythmias were present in 16 %. Ninety-eight (most actively treated) relatives (84 %) were followed up for a median of 4. 7 years (range, 0. 3 - 19. 0 years). During follow-up, 2 asymptomatic relatives experienced exercise-induced syncope. One relative was not being treated, whereas the other was noncompliant. None of the 116 relatives died of CPVT during a 6. 7 -year follow-up (range, 1. 4 - 20. 9 years). CONCLUSIONS: Relatives carrying an Ryr 2 mutation show a marked phenotypic diversity. The vast majority do not have signs of supraventricular disease manifestations. Mutation location may be associated with severity of the phenotype.

MethodsBetween 1995 and 2005 we prospectively collected clinical and electrophysiologic data from 184 children (66 % male; median age 10 years; range 8 to 12 years) with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation on the electrocardiogram. After electrophysiologic testing, subjects were followed as outpatients taking no medications. The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Predictors of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias were analyzed. ResultsOver a median follow-up of 57 months (min/max 32 / 90 months) after electrophysiologic testing, 133 children (mean age 10 years; range 8 to 12 years) did not experience <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> remaining totally asymptomatic, while 51 children had within 20 months (min/max 8 / 60 months) a first arrhythmic event, which was potentially life-threatening in 19 of them (mean age 10 years; range 10 to 14 years). Life-threatening tachyarrhythmias resulted in cardiac arrest (3 patients), syncope (3 patients), atypical symptoms (8 patients), or minimal symptoms (5 patients). Univariate analysis identified tachyarrhythmia inducibility (p < 0. 001), anterograde refractory period of accessory pathways (APERP) ≤ 240 ms (p < 0. 001), and multiple accessory pathways (p < 0. 001) as risk factors for potentially life-threatening <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Independent predictors by multivariate analysis were APERP (p = 0. 001) and multiple accessory pathway (p = 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence, characteristics and the predictive value of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) for subsequent death and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUNDNonsustained VT has been linked to an increased risk for sudden death in coronary patients. It is unknown whether this parameter can be used for selection of high-risk patients to receive an implantable defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden death in patients shortly after AMI. METHODSIn 325 consecutive infarct survivors, 24 -h Holter monitoring was performed 10 ± 6 days after AMI. All patients underwent coronary angiography, determination of left ventricular function and assessment of heart rate variability (HRV). Mean follow-up was 30 ± 22 months. RESULTSThere was a low prevalence (9 %) of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Nonsustained VT together with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found in only 2. 4 % of patients. During follow-up, 25 patients reached one of the prospectively defined end points (primary composite end point of cardiac death, sustained VT or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation; secondary end point: <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events).</b> Kaplan Meier event probability analyses revealed that only HRV, LVEF and status of the infarct-related artery were univariate predictors of death or <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> The presence of nonsustained VT carried a relative risk of 2. 6 for the primary study end point but was not a significant predictor if only <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> were considered. On multivariate analysis, only HRV, LVEF and the status of the infarct artery were found to be independently related to the primary study end point. CONCLUSIONSThere is a low prevalence of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Only 2 % to 3 % of all infarct survivors treated according to contemporary guidelines demonstrate both depressed LVEF and nonsustained VT. The predictive value of nonsustained VT for subsequent mortality and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> is inferior to that of impaired autonomic tone, LVEF or infarct-related artery patency. Accordingly, the use of nonsustained VT to select patients for primary implantable cardioverter/defibrillator prevention trials shortly after AMI appears to be limited...|$|E

However, QRS duration was a sig-nificant determinant of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (100 vs., 100 ms: adjusted OR 2. 75, 95 % CI 1. 37 – 5. 51; 120 vs., 120 ms: adjusted OR 1. 77, 95 % CI 0. 97 – 3. 23). QRS duration was also a predictor of overall mortality in the logistic regression models (100 ms: adjusted OR 3. 72, 95 % CI 1. 17 – 11. 9; 120 ms: adjusted OR 3. 09, 95 % CI 1. 39 – 6. 85). Conclusion In this ICD population, consisting largely of secondary prevention ICD recipients, longer QRS duration predicted higher likelihood of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Extent of QRS prolongation could guide the decision to initiate prophylactic anti-arrhythmic therapy in ICD patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{investigated}} prediction of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> by the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) and programmed stimulation {{in patients with}} nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Background. Risk stratification in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy remains controversial. Methods. Eighty patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia underwent signal-averaged electrocardiography (both time-domain and spectral turbulence analysis) and programmed stimulation. All patients were followed up for a mean of 22 ± 26 months. Results. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced in 10 patients (13 %), who all received amiodarone. The remaining 70 patients were followed up without antiarrhythmic therapy. Of the 80 patients, 15 % had abnormal findings on the time-domain signal-averaged ECG, and 39 % had abnormal findings on spectral turbulence analysis. Time-domain signal-averaged electrocardiography had a better predictive accuracy for induced ventricular tachycardia than spectral turbulence analysis (88 % vs. 66 %, p < 0. 01). During follow-up, there were 9 <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (5 sudden deaths, 4 spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation) and 10 nonsudden cardiac deaths. Cox regression analysis showed that no variables predicted <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> or total cardiac deaths. The 2 -year actuarial survival free of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> was similar in patients with or without abnormal findings on the signal-averaged ECG or induced ventricular tachycardia. Conclusions. In patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, 1) {{there is a strong}} correlation between abnormal findings on the time-domain signal-averaged ECG and induced ventricular tachycardia, but both findings are uncommon; and 2) normal findings on the signal-averaged ECG, as well as failure to induce ventricular tachycardia, do not imply a benign outcome...|$|E
40|$|Background—The {{prognosis}} {{of patients}} with saddleback or noncoved type (non–type 1) ST-elevation in Brugada syndrome is unknown. The {{purpose of this study was}} to clarify the long-term prognosis of probands with non–type 1 ECG and those with coved (type 1) Brugada-pattern ECG. Methods and Results—A total of 330 (123 symptomatic, 207 asymptomatic) probands with a coved or saddleback ST-elevation 1 mm in leads V 1 –V 3 were divided into 2 ECG groups—type 1 (245 probands) and non–type 1 (85 probands) —and were prospectively followed for 48. 715. 0 months. The absence of type 1 ECG was confirmed by drug provocation test and multiple recordings. The ratio of individuals with a family history of sudden cardiac death (14 %) was lower than previous studies.

Aims. We investigated the incidence, risk factors, and prognostic impact of silent atrial fibrillation (AF) after {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery. Methods. This observational study prospectively included 100 patients referred for CABG surgery. Holter ECG monitoring was used to record every <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> for 7 days. AF was defined as at least one episode> 30 s. Episodes recorded on Holter ECG monitoring but not clinically identified were classified as silent AF. Results. Among 34 patients who developed new-onset AF, 13 had silent AF. Compared with patients with maintained sinus rhythm (SR), silent AF patients had a significantly higher logistic EuroSCORE (2. 9 (1. 5 – 5. 2) versus 2. 3 (1. 4 – 3. 7) ...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) influences the relationship between abnormal myocardial sympathetic innervation imaging by iodine 123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123 I-mIBG) and outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). BackgroundIn systolic HF, both abnormal 123 I-mIBG imaging and reduced LVEF are associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events. Whether 123 I-mIBG imaging has the same predictive value across the LVEF spectrum is unclear. MethodsAmong 985 patients in the ADMIRE-HF (AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart Failure) trial with New York Heart Association functional class II or III HF and site-reported LVEF ≤ 35 %, the core laboratory–determined LVEFs were available for 901 subjects, ranging from 20 % to 58 % (mean LVEF 34 ± 7 %), and was > 35 % in 386 subjects. ResultsThe mean age of the study population was 62 ± 12 years, 80 % were male, and the majority had New York Heart Association functional class II symptoms and HF of nonischemic etiology. At all levels of LVEF, the 123 I-mIBG heart-to-mediastinum ratio of 35 %, there was no evidence of effect modification of LVEF on the risk associated with low heart-to-mediastinum ratio for death or <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> (adjusted hazard ratio: 2. 39 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 03 to 5. 55] vs. 5. 28 [95 % CI: 1. 21 to 23. 02]; interaction p = 0. 48) and for the composite (adjusted hazard ratio: 1. 80 [95 % CI: 1. 01 to 3. 23] vs. 2. 41 [95 % CI: 1. 11 to 5. 23]; interaction; p = 0. 86). For death or <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event,</b> the heart-to-mediastinum ratio appeared to improve the risk discrimination beyond clinical and biomarker data among both LVEF groups, with improvement in the model C-statistic (0. 67 vs. 0. 69, p = 0. 03) and integrated discrimination improvement (p = 0. 0008). Conclusions 123 I-mIBG imaging has prognostic value across a spectrum of LVEFs. Further studies may be warranted to prospectively test the prognostic value of 123 I-mIBG imaging in patients with HF and an LVEF > 35 %...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{models of}} {{myocardial}} ischemia have demonstrated reduction in arrhythmias using statins. It {{was hypothesized that}} previous statin therapy before hospitalization might be associated with reductions of in-hospital <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in patients with acute coronary syndromes. In this multinational, prospective, observational study (the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events [GRACE]), data from 64, 679 patients hospitalized for suspected acute coronary syndromes (from 1999 to 2007) were analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in previous statin users compared with nonusers.

40|$|Aims Cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) improves {{survival and}} quality of life in advanced heart failure (HF). Although mitral regurgitation (MR) reduction has been reported, its presence has been associated with non-response to CRT. This study was undertaken to assess the potential role of significant mitral regurgitation (SMR) persistence after CRT on clinical outcome, major <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> and echocardiographic response in the mid-long term. Methods and results Seventy-six patients (28. 9 % women, 63 + 11 years) with dilated cardiomyopathy in advanced HF were included. SMR, defined as regurgitant orifice area 0. 20 cm 2, was assessed at baseline and its evolution 6 months after CRT. Clinical outcome (cardiovascular death/HF readmission), major <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> and echocardiographic response (reverse remodelling) were recorded on follow-up. Thirty-two patients (42. 1 %) presented baseline SMR, becoming non-significant in 11 of the 32 patients (34. 3 %) 6 months after CRT. Its persistence was associated with higher rates of clinical events (46. 4 vs. 18. 7 %, P 0. 011), <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (35. 7 vs. 14. 5 %, P 0. 034), and less reverse remodelling (28. 5 vs. 83. 3 %, P, 0. 001) ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{a number}} of studies have shown that the {{incidence}} of late potentials is lower after thrombolytic therapy, it is not known whether this is paralleled by fewer <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during long-term follow-up. In patients with first acute myocardial infarction, filtered QRS duration was significantly shorter when treated with streptokinase (95 +/- 11 ms, n = 53) than when treated with conventional therapy (99 +/- 12 ms, n = 77, p < 0. 05). The low-amplitude signal (D 40) was shorter after thrombolysis (28 +/- 11 vs 33 +/- 12 ms, p < 0. 02). Terminal root-mean-square voltage did not differ significantly (41 +/- 24 vs 35 +/- 23 muV). Irrespective of treatment, late potentials were predictive in the complete group (n = 171) for <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during follow-up (13 +/- 6 months, range 6 to 24) (hazard ratio 7. 7, p < 0. 02, Cox proportional-hazards survival analysis), but treatment (streptokinase vs conventional) did not significantly affect outcome when added to the model. It is concluded that thrombolysis prevents the development of late potentials. However, this study does not confirm the hypothesis that prevention of late potentials leads to a decrease in <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study of the}} prognostic significance of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG), left ventricular function and 24 hour Holter ECG monitoring was performed in 102 patients (age 63 ± 11 years) after myocardial infarction. The signal-averaged ECG (40 Hz high pass bidirectional filtering) was obtained 10 ± 6 days after the acute myocardial infarction and all three tests were performed within 72 hours of each other. Ejection fraction was determined by radionuclide ventriculography. An abnormal signal-averaged ECG was seen in 44 % of patients; abnormal ejection fraction (10 ventricular premature depolarizations/h or couplets, or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, {{or a combination of}} these) in 62 %. During a 12 ± 6 month follow-up period, 15 patients (14. 7 %) had an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia or sudden cardiac death, or both. The event rates were higher in patients with an abnormal versus a normal signal-averaged ECG (29 versus 3. 5 %, p = 0. 003), an abnormal versus a normal ejection fraction (24 versus 6 %, p = 0. 001) and the presence versus the absence of high grade ectopic activity (23 versus 9 %, p = 0. 09). Patients with an abnormal signal-averaged ECG and an abnormal ejection fraction had a significantly higher (p = 0. 0007) event rate than did patients in whom both the tests were normal (36 versus 0 %; odds ratio 30. 1). Patients with an abnormal signal-averaged ECG, abnormal ejection fraction and presence of high grade ectopic activity had an event rate of 50 %, whereas there were no events in patients in whom all three tests were normal (p = 0. 01, odds ratio 19). When the stepwise Cox survivorship analysis was used with regression covariates, the ejection fraction, quantitative signal-averaged variables and presence of nonsustaihed ventricular tachycardia on 24 hour Holter monitoring had the most significant relation to an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event.</b> In conclusion: 1) The signal-averaged ECG defines a high risk group of patients; however, the combination of an abnormal signal-averaged ECG, abnormal ejection fraction and the presence of high grade ectopic activity identified the highest risk subset of patients for sustained ventricular tachycardia or sudden death, or both, in the first year after myocardial infarction. 2) This study provides a new noninvasive index for selecting for intervention a high risk subset of patients after myocardial infarction...|$|R
40|$|Background: Long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) {{is characterized}} by large variability in disease severity which remains a major hurdle in the clinical care of these patients. We hypothesized that common genetic variation is involved in disease susceptibility and severity. Objective: Identify common variants that contribute to disease susceptibility, QTc and occurrence of arrhythmia in LQTS. Methods: We included LQTS index cases through an international consortium of 25 referral centers. QTc was measured in a core lab by two experienced physicians. Cases were genotyped on the OmniExpress array. Genotypic data in ethnically matched controls was already available. We imputed > 7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Casecontrol analysis was performed correcting for sex and ancestry. Quantitative trait analysis for QTc was performed accounting for sex, ancestry and LQTS genetic subtype. We also assessed the association between a weighted genetic risk score (GRS 68) consisting of 68 SNPs previously associated with QTc {{in the general population}} with (1) case-control status, (2) QTc and (3) time to first <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event.</b> Results: The study included a total of 1195 European cases (495 LQT 1, 444 LQT 2, 85 LQT 3, 146 mutation negative; QTc 475 ± 45 ms; 23 % previous cardiac arrest) and 6962 controls. Case-control analysis uncovered 3 loci at genome-wide statistical significance; these were previously associated with QTc in the general population (NOS 1 AP-rs 12143842 [P= 5. 6 e- 09; odds ratio, OR= 1. 33], SCN 5 A/SCN 10 A-rs 7373065 [P= 4. 0 e- 08; OR= 2. 2] and KLF 12 -rs 1886512 [P= 5. 7 e- 08; OR= 1. 28]). No SNP was associated with QTc at genome-wide significance. Within cases, GRS 68 was modestly associated with QTc [P= 0. 037; QTc 469 ± 38 vs. 478 ± 40 in lowest vs. highest GRS 68 quartiles] but not with time to first <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event.</b> GRS 68 was higher in LQTS cases compared to controls [P= 1. 2 e- 25] and higher in mutationnegative vs. mutation-positive patients [P= 1. 2 e- 4]. Conclusion: Common genetic variation contributes to LQTS susceptibility. We identified a modest association of GRS 68 with QTc in LQTS. For the first time we provide evidence for a polygenic architecture of mutation-negative LQTS. The study is currently being extended to a large cohort of Japanese LQTS patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) {{therapy was}} {{traditionally}} applied {{in patients who}} survived a cardiac arrest or who experienced a symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Its use in primary prevention (i. e. in patients who have yet to experience a serious <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event,</b> but who are considered {{at high risk for}} sudden cardiac death) has become more common, and policy makers question whether ICD therapy should be reimbursed in these instances. Objective: To assess the cost effectiveness of primary prevention ICD therapy versus conventional therapy {{from the perspective of the}} Belgian health insurance system. Method: A lifetime 1 -month cycle Markov model was constructed and populated with clinical and effectiveness data from the SCD-HeFT study and real-world Belgian cost data expressed in year 2005 values.
