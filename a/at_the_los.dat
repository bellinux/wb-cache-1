5|$|Several {{versions}} of Blade Runner have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative {{responses to the}} previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version. The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre. Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut. A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.|$|E
5|$|The impracticability of a gun-type bomb using {{plutonium}} {{was agreed}} {{at a meeting}} in Los Alamos on July 17, 1944.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of Ohio's Miami University, {{he received his}} doctorate from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, in 1941. He worked at the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II, where he researched naval mines. In 1943, he was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Alamos Laboratory. There, he worked with scientists including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky {{on the development of}} the high explosives and exploding-bridgewire detonators required by atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|Chemists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Alamos Laboratory {{developed}} {{methods of}} purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E

5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit {{for about six months}} and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, during World War II, he {{was called}} into service at the War Metallurgy Committee in Washington, D.C.

When the {{laboratory}} was reorganized in April 1944, he became the Associate Division Leader in charge of metallurgy. His first task was recruiting metallurgists, who were in great demand by the war effort. He also had to arrange for the transport of their metallurgical equipment to Los Alamos under wartime conditions.|$|E
