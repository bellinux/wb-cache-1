5|$|As an {{opponent}} of the Vietnam War, Bedell signed a petition urging against United States military intervention in Iraq. This petition was signed {{with the names of}} 70 former Congressmen from the 1970s and was presented in a press conference on March 15, 2003. Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> an Iraq war would be similar to the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Invites to Golden League meets never materialised, but he {{continued}} to run at smaller events. He ran a European leading time of 10.06seconds at Papaflessia in Greece, and won the 100m and 200m races at the 2009 European Team Championships. He was the fastest entrant at the national championships but 2008 runner-up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance. The result took Chambers by surprise <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> limited opportunities to race had made him complacent. He later withdrew from the 200m race citing exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely {{that at least some of}} the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E

5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} Kwang-chih Chang {{said that}} {{it seemed like the}} Mongoloid race originated in South China, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it seemed like the Mongoloid race was differentiating itself from other races in the Late Pleistocene. Chang based these thoughts on a skull found in Sichuan and a skull found in Guangxi.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} series, series two {{contained}} {{a great deal}} of studio filming. Chibnall said this was because of the changed nature of the story, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> nearly all the major story moments in the second series occurred on a stage. David Tennant said that while the Jurassic Coast and several locations from series one are still featured in series two, most shooting occurred on studio sets near London.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written by Saddam {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> this is his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam ate his last meal of chicken and rice with a cup of hot water and honey.|$|E
25|$|First off {{the mark}} was Rhodes who sent Alfred Sharpe from Nyasaland in 1890, backed up by Joseph Thomson coming from the south, but Sharpe failed to persuade Msiri, and Thomson didn't make it to Msiri's capital at Bunkeya. Sharpe's reports were complacently dismissive about the {{likelihood}} of their rivals having any success, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> once the 60-year-old Msiri was gone, Katanga would be theirs. In this case it would probably {{have become part of}} Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, with which it shares strong cultural and ethnic links.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the campaign, conservatives such as Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, the {{president}} of the American Family Foundation, and Daniel Weiss, media analyst for James Dobson's Focus on the Family had criticized Romney for not having done enough, in their view, to stop Marriott Hotels from selling access to hardcore pornography in their hotel rooms in the decade from 1992 to 2001 that Romney had served on the hotel chain's board. Romney told the Associated Press that he did not recall pornography having come up for discussion while he had served on the board; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was unaware of how much revenue the hotels may have generated from pornography.|$|E

25|$|Manoah {{was told}} by his wife what happened, and Manoah entreated God to let the man of God come again and teach them what to do. God heeded Manoah and sent the angel to the woman as she sat alone in the field. Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E
500|$|During the 1988 campaign, Paul called Reagan [...] "a {{dramatic}} failure" [...] {{and complained}} that [...] "Reagan's record is disgraceful. He starts wars, breaks the law, supplies terrorists with guns made at taxpayers' expense and lies {{about it to}} the American people." [...] Paul predicted that [...] "the Republicans {{are on their way}} out as a major party," [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> although registered as a Republican, he had always been a libertarian at heart.|$|E
500|$|The drama was {{produced}} by Gareth Gwenlan, who worked on Only Fools and Horses between 1988 and 2003. Speaking to the Western Mail, he described it as [...] "essentially a love story" [...] between Joan and Freddie, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Lyndhurst [...] "told me he thinks it's the best thing he's ever done". Speaking about the casting of Lyndhurst, he said he [...] "would make a marvellous villain, which is something people will never have seen him do on TV before".|$|E

500|$|Snow Prince had {{its first}} special {{screening}} in Flanders, Belgium, where the novel A Dog of Flanders was set. This {{was the first}} time lead actor Shintaro Morimoto traveled overseas, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "My heart was beating very fast, but seeing the audience response, I gained more confidence in this film". Morimoto became the spokesperson for the Flanders government's tourism board because he was the lead actor of the film. Snow Prince was then shown in Hawaii, where it made its film festival debut at the Hawaii International Film Festival (HIFF) on 20 October 2009.|$|E
500|$|Elgar was {{contemptuous of}} folk music {{and had little}} {{interest}} in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries [...] "museum pieces". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.|$|E
500|$|Sydney Morning Heralds music writer, Bernard Zuel, {{said the}} band's use of [...] "indefinite hibernation" [...] {{was a way}} to soften the blow of the group's {{break-up}} for fans; he expected future reunions and performances for worthy causes. By June, Gillies was {{in the final stages of}} about 12months of working on his solo album <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane. In October, Johns was working on the soundtrack for My Mind's Own Melody – a short film. In May 2012 Johns recorded the new anthem for Qantas titled 'Atlas.' It is the first piece of commercial music Johns has composed.|$|E

[...] Estimating that around {{twenty percent of the}} {{original}} tracks had received [...] "significant changes", he applauded the increase in sound quality and said that he [...] "enjoy the OST tracks a great deal". The addition of the piano tracks and the orchestral track made the album a [...] "fine soundtrack" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> acquiring the soundtrack would be a [...] "very, very good idea". RPGamer, in their review of the game, said that the arrangements by Ito were [...] "quite pleasing to the ear", though they noted that the quality of the music was diminished by the [...] "terrible speakers" [...] of the Game Boy Advance.|$|E

500|$|Marburger {{characterized}} {{his participation}} {{as a learning}} experience, and the experience was credited with profoundly changing his view {{on the relationship between}} the scientific community and the public. He had never been to a public hearing prior to his participation in the Shoreham commission, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he had initially expected that the issues could be resolved by examining scientific data and establishing failure probabilities. However, he quickly became {{aware of the importance of}} the public participation process itself, stating that it was [...] "one of the rare opportunities for the public to feel they were being heard and taken seriously." [...] Marburger's conduct on the committee was praised by activists on both sides of the debate, with his focus on listening to all viewpoints and his ability to not take disagreements personally being especially noted.|$|E
