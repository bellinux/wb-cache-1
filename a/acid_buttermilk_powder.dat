40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the inhibitory effect of various dairy powders and milk constituents on the adhesion of a clinical isolate of Streptococcus mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. Adhesion of a microorganism to a cell surface such as epithelial cells or tooth enamel is considered to be the first step in pathogenesis. Inhibiting this process may have therapeutic effects in vivo. The adherence assays were performed by incubating S. mutans with HA in the presence of each test material for 45 min, followed by centrifugal separation of the HA. Unbound bacteria were then quantified using a fluorescent dye. Sweet and <b>Acid</b> WPC 80, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> and cream powder were found to very effectively inhibit adherence of S. mutans to phosphate-buffered saline coated HA (PBS-HA). Sodium caseinate and the casein fractions a-,b- and j-casein were also found to show high levels of anti-adhesive activity. A selection of test materials were assessed using saliva-coated HA (S-HA), and similar trends were observed. The results suggest commercial dairy powders, and certain milk proteins, can inhibit adhesion of S. mutans to HA and may have potential to control dental caries...|$|R

40|$|Almost 16 % of milk {{produced}} in European Union is being converted to butter. Buttermilk, {{is a low}} cost by-product from butter manufacture and available in large quantities but has been considered invaluable for many years. When cream is churned to butter the stable oil in water emulsion is destabilized and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is disrupted which is released in buttermilk. Thus, {{over the last two}} decades it has gained considerable attention due to its specific composition (proteins and polar lipids) attributed towards the MFGM. In account to this composition of <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder,</b> it finds application in food industry as a natural stabilizing and emulsifying agent. It also finds application as a source of total solids and is commercially being added upto 10 % in many food products.

40|$|Dental caries is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} disease caused by colonisation of tooth surfaces by cariogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus salivarius. Reducing initial adherence of such bacteria to teeth may delay onset of caries. Many foods, such as milk, can inhibit microbial adherence. In this investigation, the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on adherence of S. sobrinus and S. salivarius to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel, was examined.

40|$|The climates of {{many areas}} in Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Africa make it {{difficult}} to support a dairy industry based on fresh milk. In these areas the shelf life of fresh, undried milk products is short. Concentrated and dry milk products have increased storage stability because of a lower water activity and are therefore desirable in regions with such climatic conditions. Concentrated milk products are obtained from milk by the application of one or a combination of water removal techniques. Drying of these products can reduce the water content to below 3 %. The reduction in water content of milk will increase shelf life and reduce transportation costs. This is particularly important for manufacturers that export products to distant markets. These products may be recombined (water and a combination of ingredients added) or reconstituted (just water added) and then packed and sold by a food retailer, or sold directly to the consumer as a dry or concentrated product, e. g. whole milk powder (WMP) or canned evaporated milk.

40|$|Dental caries is {{a common}} {{bacterial}} infection, but the progression of this disease can be delayed by preventing initial attachment of cariogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to tooth surfaces. This study firstly compares the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on the adherence of S. mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. A fluorescence-based method was used to quantify adherence of S. mutans to HA both in the presence (S-HA) and absence (PBS-HA) of saliva. Secondly, binding of proteins present in the test materials to HA was quantified using bicinchonic acid assays and SDS-PAGE. In addition, the effect of UT and ET dairy powders on growth of S. mutans was examined using an optical-density based assay. UT acid whey protein concentrate (WPC) 80, sweet WPC 80, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP) and cream powder (CP) significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited adhesion of S. mutans at ≥ 31. 25 μg mL− 1 in the presence and absence of saliva.

Utah, however, is a hog-deficient area and produces about 109, 000 hogs less than are slaughtered in the state for its own use. Large amounts of milk by-products such as skim milk, buttermilk, and whey are produced in Utah. Large amounts of alfalfa are also grown in the irrigated sections, thus providing excellent pasture for the growing out and feeding of market hogs.

40|$|International audienceTo {{meet the}} {{increased}} consumer demand for yogurt with reduced fat content, various {{efforts have been}} made {{to improve the quality of}} reduced-fat variants that still is regarded as having inferior quality. As an alternative, a yogurt was produced from buffalo skim milk with the addition of microbial transglutaminase (TG; 1  U. g− 1 protein) and <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP; 1 and 2 % “w/w”). For comparison, a fat-free variant without TG or BMP and a full-fat yogurt were studied. Monitoring the pH drop during incubation time revealed that TG did not interfere with the pH reduction, while BMP addition accelerated the decline in pH. TG treatment or BMP addition substantially improved the water holding capacity functionality of the yogurt gel. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the addition of BMP enhanced the reactivity of TG as indicated by the appearance of high molecular weight protein polymer bands. These results were confirmed by scanning electron microscope analysis. The addition of TG and BMP, either individually or in combination, showed a marked impact on gel network, resulting in a more compact and dense gel structure accompanied by irregular agglomerated clusters of protein aggregates. Fat-free yogurts of individually BMP addition exhibited the most desirable organoleptic attributes as indicated by a sensory panel and were perceived as similar to the full-fat yogurt perception. Overall, the addition of TG or BMP appeared to have potential as a valuable alternative in fat-free yogurt production, and BMP can be used as a source of extra protein, which in turn offers promising option to develop innovative functional fat-free yogurt...|$|R

In this study MFGM materials were produced from several dairy sources such as buttermilk (BM), butter serum (BS) and buttermilk whey (BMW) by microfiltration (MF). The obtained materials, depending on the sources, were called BM-MFGM, BS-MFGM and BMW-MFGM, respectively. The compositions of starting materials and the isolated MFGM materials {{as well as their}} emulsifying properties were analyzed and compared. As expected, the MF resulted in enrichment of polar lipids (PLs), major components of MFGM. On dry matter basis, BM-MFGM and BS-MFGM were about 2. 5 times higher in PLs compared to their beginning materials while BMW-MFGM was about 8. 3 times compared to <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the microfiltered products still contained a high amount of non-MFGM proteins such as caseins, beta-lactoglobulin, and alpha-lactalbumin. Emulsions of 35 % soya oil in water were prepared with the mentioned materials using a homogenizer at various pressures. Generally, emulsions prepared with BMP and butter serum powder had significantly higher particle sizes than those prepared with the MFGM materials.

In this study, a material enriched in MFGM fragments was isolated from a reconstituted solution of <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP) using microfiltration. The emulsifying properties of this MFGM material, which is also called BMP MFGM, was investigated in comparison {{with those of the}} original material, BMP, and skim milk powder (SMP). Mixtures of 35 % soybean oil were prepared in water and were supplemented with BMP MFGM, BMP or SMP at the same concentration of total protein (2. 3 g/ 100 g product). The oil-in-water emulsions from the mixtures were made at five different two-step homogenization pressures (0 / 20; 30 / 20; 90 / 20; 150 / 20 and 210 / 20 bar). Emulsions prepared with BMP MFGM showed good stability at pressures above 30 / 20 bar. The measurement of particle size distribution and microscopy observation indicated the occurrence of the aggregation of emulsion droplets, especially at high homogenization pressures, when BMP or SMP were used. With the use of BMP MFGM, no such aggregation was observed. For all samples, the average droplet diameters decreased with increasing pressures. At 210 / 20 bar, emulsions prepared with MFGM BMP showed a monomodal particle size distribution with an average droplet size of about 0. 7 µm, which was significantly smaller than that of emulsions made with BMP and SMP. In conclusion, BMP MFGM had superior emulsifying properties compared to the other two materials. This difference could be (mostly) attributed to the difference in composition of the three materials of which BMP MFGM contained highest concentration of phospholipids...|$|R
40|$|Milk fat is {{encapsulated}} in a {{milk fat}} globule membrane (MFGM) that contains bioactive glycoproteins and glycolipids. The MFGM inhibits infectivity of rotavirus (RV), activity {{that has been}} attributed to its glycoprotein and carbohydrate components. However, previous studies of proteins and oligosaccharides in the MGFM have not accounted for all the bioactivity associated with the complete MFGM. The lipid fraction of the MFGM accounts for half of its composition by weight, and we postulate that this fraction should be tested by itself to determine if it plays a role in antiviral activity. Herein, the anti-RV activity of an organic extract of MFGM was tested. Natural and whey <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powders</b> containing bovine MFGM enriched in polar lipids were prepared by microfiltration and supercritical fluid extraction treatment to reduce the triglyceride content of the powders. Lipid fractions were then extracted from the MFGM using both single- and dual-phase extraction methods. Whole MFGM and organic extracts were screened in MA- 104 cells for anti-infective activity against a neuraminidase-sensitive rotavirus using a focus- forming unit assay. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for whole buttermilk and cheese whey MFGM against the rotavirus. In general, buttermilk MFGM exhibited greater RV percentage inhibition than cheese whey MFGM. Organic-soluble anti-RV compounds were identified in bovine MFGM. The most active fraction, isolated by dual-phase extraction and iatrobead chromatography, was free of proteins and highly nonpolar. Further separation of this fraction in a less polar solvent (30 : 1 chloroform:methanol) resolved at least 5 lipid-containing compounds, which likely contribute to the anti-RV activity associated with bovine MFGM. In summary, lipid components associated with MFGM appear to contribute {{in large part to the}} anti-RV activity associated with the bovine MFGM...|$|R
40|$|Pig meat {{production}} in New Zealand {{has traditionally been}} associated with the dairy industry, relying upon dairy by-products (principally skim-milk and whey) as major sources of protein and energy for pig feed. However, export market prospects for milk protein led to the diversification of dairy factory products, such as the ultra-filtration of whey protein and lactose extraction of whey. The prevailing economic climate also encouraged dairy farmers to change to whole milk,anker collection and large numbers of the supplementary pig enterprises were closed down. Despite fluctuations, market prices generally showed an increase and many farmers began investigating alternative food supplies in order to take advantage of these higher prices. Garbage and other edible waste provided only limited scope for expansion, and the main alternative appeared to be the use of cereal grains. The New Zealand pig industry, in the last 5 - 10 years, has therefore begun to move towards a specialised form of production based upon the use of diets containing a predominance of cereals, similar to what has prevailed in many overseas countries for a longer period. The local report of Kingma and Ryan (1971) illustrates the need for efficiency in the high cost system of production based upon meal feeding. Where skimmilk is the principal ingredient in the ration, the supply of dietary protein is generally adequate due to the high nutritive value of the protein in this feedstuff. However, when the major source of nutrients comes from cereal grains, although these provide a concentrated source of energy, the poor balance of amino acids becomes limiting to the utilization of such rations. In New Zealand there is a restricted range of feeds high in protein and suitable for incorporation into pig rations. They include skimmilk <b>powder,</b> <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder,</b> meat meal, meat and bone meal, liver meal and fish meal.

Generation of an ingredient enriched in dairy PLs would be advantageous from an industrial view to allow fortification of nutritionals, both infant and geriatric, in promoting brain health. The present work demonstrates a novel pilot scale process for the generation of a PL enriched ingredient from a BMP substrate. Utilising a combined process of targeted protein hydrolysis followed by selective removal by ultrafiltration of the smaller molecular weight peptide material, an ingredient with 8. 5 fold increase in PL material was achieved. SFE technology was utilised to generate a purified lipid extract with greater PL levels for future applications in biological assays to determine these pathways. The need for investigate and further develop the knowledge relating to the modes of action of these bioactive compounds would be beneficial from a nutritional perspective...|$|R

40|$|The {{proteins}} and polar lipids present in milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) fragments are gaining attention for their technological and nutritional properties. These MFGM fragments are preferentially enriched in side streams of the dairy industry, like butter serum, buttermilk, and whey. The {{objective of this}} study was to recover MFGM fragments from whey by tangential filtration techniques. <b>Acid</b> <b>buttermilk</b> cheese whey was chosen as a source for purification by tangential membrane filtration because it is relatively rich in MFGM-fragments and because casein micelles are absent. Polyethersulfone and cellulose acetate membranes of different pore sizes were evaluated on polar lipid and MFGM-protein retention upon filtration at 40 degrees C. All fractions were analyzed for dry matter, ash, lipids, proteins, reducing sugars, polar lipid content by HPLC, and for the presence of MFGM proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. A fouling coefficient was calculated. It was found that a thermocalcic aggregation whey pretreatment was very effective in the clarification of the whey, but resulted in low permeate fluxes and high retention of ash and whey proteins. By means of an experimental design, the influence of pH and temperature on the fouling and the retention of polar lipids (and thus MFGM fragments), proteins, and total lipids upon microfiltration with 0. 15 mu M cellulose acetate membrane was investigated. All models were highly significant, and no outliers were observed. By increasing the pH from 4. 6 to 7. 5, polar lipid retention at 50 degrees C increased from 64 to 98 %, whereas fouling of the filtration membrane was minimized. A 3 -step diafiltration of acid whey under these conditions resulted in a polar lipid concentration of 6. 79 g/ 100 g of dry matter. As such, this study shows that tangential filtration techniques are suited for the purification of MFGM fragments...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteJayendra K. AmamcharlaIn recent years, the {{interest}} in functional components such as phospholipids (PLs) is increasing {{as a result of}} growing awareness of their health benefits. PLs affect several cell functions, such as growth, molecular transport system, memory processing, stress responses, and central nervous system myelination. Many {{studies have shown that the}} neutral lipids can be successfully extracted using supercritical carbon dioxide (SCO₂) from different types of foods such as egg, canola, pumpkin seed, fish and dairy powders. It is an alternative method to avoid the use of large quantities organic solvents. The SCO₂ is a safe, environmentally friendly and economical process to extract edible lipids from a variety of matrices. However, a modifier such as ethanol is needed to fractionate PLs due to limited solubility of PLs in SCO₂. The objectives of this study were to optimize the SFE process parameters and to determine the effect of pressure, temperature, and ethanol concentration on the extraction efficiency of PLs from whey protein phospholipid concentrate (WPPC) and <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP). Three different batches of WPPC and BMP were obtained from a commercial manufacturer and followed a unique two-step extraction process to isolate PLs from WPPC and BMP. In Step- 1, neat supercritical CO₂ was used to remove all the neutral lipids at 414 bar pressure, 60 °C sample temperature, and 5 L/min CO₂ flow rate. The spent solids, the powder left after the first step extraction, were used to extract PLs in the second step. The Step- 2 (SCO₂-Ethanol) process was optimized in terms of pressure (350, 414 and 550 bar), temperature (40 °C and 60 °C) and concentration of ethanol (10 %, 15 % and 20 %) as independent factors. All the lipid fractions were analyzed by high performance lipid chromatography (HPLC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC). For WPPC, only ethanol concentration had significant effect (P < 0. 05) on the amount of PLs extracted after the Step- 2. On the other hand, temperature and ethanol concentration were significantly (P < 0. 05) affected the efficiency of SFE for BMP. The optimal processing conditions for WPPC and BMP were 350 bar pressure, 60 °C sample temperature and 15 % concentration of ethanol, and 550 bar of pressure, 60 °C sample temperature and 15 % concentration of ethanol, respectively. This study allowed obtaining PLs from dairy co-products such as WPPC and BMP as a separate ingredient and this could be useful in nutraceutical and infant formulations as well as different food products formulations...|$|R

Natural route is stirred in slowly in different batches at 80 - 90 C at a ratio of 10 - 1 A coagulum is instantly formed and then stirred for one or two minutes, and then left for a further five to seven minutes to enhance the coagulation of the proteins and the consolidation of the protein particles at the bottom. The whey is poured off and the curd distributed into cheese moulds and pressed for 12 - 15 hours. The cheese is then transferred to a brine solution. The action of heat and acid enable the casein and whey proteins to be recovered, which results in increased yield.
