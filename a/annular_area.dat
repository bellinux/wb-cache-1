Angle pattern sleeve valves employ a similar design as the inline sleeve valve by creating an outer <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> to contain the media and a sleeve with tapered nozzles to pass the flow.

It was known that nuclei would escape through this area, but by adding and heating fuel continually it was felt this could be overcome. As development of mirror systems progressed, additional sets of magnets were added to either side, meaning that the nuclei had to escape through two such areas before leaving the reaction area entirely. A highly developed form, the Mirror Fusion Test Facility (MFTF), used two mirrors at either end of a solenoid to increase the internal volume of the reaction area.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{used the}} Doppler {{proximal}} flow convergence technique as a physiologic tool {{to explore the}} effects of the time courses of mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> and transmitral pressure on dynamic changes in regurgitant orifice area. BackgroundIn functional mitral regurgitation (MR), regurgitant flow rate and orifice area display a unique pattern, with peaks in early and late systole and a midsystolic decrease. Phasic changes in both mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> and the transmitral pressure acting to close the leaflets, which equals left ventricular-left atrial pressure, have been proposed to explain this dynamic pattern. MethodsIn 30 patients with functional MR, regurgitant orifice area was obtained as flow (from M-mode proximal flow convergence traces) divided by orifice velocity (v) from the continuous wave Doppler trace of MR, transmitral pressure as 4 v 2, and mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> from two apical diameters. ResultsAll patients had midsystolic decreases in regurgitant orifice area that mirrored increases in transmitral pressure, while mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> changed more gradually. By stepwise multiple regression analysis, both mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> and transmitral pressure significantly affected regurgitant orifice area; however, transmitral pressure made a stronger contribution (r 2 = 0. 441) than mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> (added r 2 = 0. 008). Similarly, the rate of change of regurgitant orifice area more strongly related to that of transmitral pressure (r 2 = 0. 638) than to that of mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> (added r 2 = 0. 003). A similar regurgitant orifice area time course was observed in four patients with fixed mitral annuli due to Carpentier ring insertion. ConclusionsIn summary, the time course and rate of change of regurgitant orifice area in patients with functional MR are predominantly determined by dynamic changes in the transmitral pressure acting to close the valve. Thus, although mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> helps determine the potential for MR, transmitral pressure appears important in driving the leaflets toward closure, and would be of value to consider in interventions aimed at reducing the severity of MR...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Mitral annuloplasty is an {{important}} element of most mitral repairs, yet the effects of various types of annuloplasty rings on mitral annular dynamics are still debated. Recent studies suggest that flexible rings preserve physiologic mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> change during the cardiac cycle, while rigid rings do not. Methods: To clarify the effects of mitral ring annuloplasty on mitral annular dynamic geometry, we sutured 8 radiopaque markers equidistantly around the mitral anulus in 3 groups of sheep (n = 7 each: no ring, Carpentier-Edwards semi-rigid Physio-Ring [Baxter Healthcare Corp, Edwards Division, Santa Ana, Calif], and Duran flexible ring [Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn]). Ring sizes were selected according to anterior leaflet area and inter-trigonal distance (Physio-Ring 28 mm, n = 7; Duran ring 31 mm, n = 5, and 29 mm, n = 2). After 8 ± 1 days of recovery, the sheep were sedated and studied by means of biplane videofluoroscopy. Mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> was calculated from 3 -dimensional marker coordinates without assuming circular or planar geometry. Results: In the no ring group, mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> varied during the cardiac cycle by 11 % ± 2 % (mean ± SEM; maximum = 7. 6 ± 0. 2, minimum = 6. 8 ± 0. 2 cm 2; P ≤. 001). Mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> was fixed in the Physio-Ring group (4. 6 ± 0. 1 cm 2) and, surprisingly, also static in the Duran ring group (4. 8 ± 0. 1 cm 2; P =. 26 vs Physio-Ring). Furthermore, mitral annular 3 -dimensional shape changed in the no-ring group during the cardiac cycle, but not in the Physio-Ring or Duran groups. Conclusions: Mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> and shape did not change during the cardiac cycle after ring annuloplasty, regardless of ring type. Thus mitral <b>annular</b> <b>area</b> reduction, independent of intrinsic ring flexibility, is the chief mechanism responsible for the salutary effects of mitral ring annuloplasty.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} an acoustic factor (AF) on the comparison of central corneal thickness (CCT) and peripheral corneal thickness (PCT) measurements with Orbscan II and Pentacam. Methods: The CCT and PCT at 1, 2, and 3 radial distances from the corneal apex were measured using Orbscan II and Pentacam in 22 right eyes of 22 healthy adults (7 men, 15 women). Three measures were obtained from each 1 of the 25 points measured and then compared to gauge the agreement between both devices at the corneal center and anular areas located at 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -mm distances from the central measurement. Orbscan II readings were considered with and without an AF correction. Results: Pentacam provides statistically significant higher values than Orbscan II does at all the 25 locations analyzed (P, 0. 001). With a few exceptions, the average difference was fairly constant between 20 and 40 mm for all the corneal locations. A high correlation existed between central readings (r 2 = 0. 927; P, 0. 001) and average thickness at {{each one of the}} <b>annular</b> <b>areas</b> being analyzed (r 2 = 0. 897 at 1 mm, r 2 = 0. 876 at 2 mm, and r 2 = 0. 870 at 3 mm); Pentacam minus Orbscan II value averaged for all the points changed from 228610 to 22269 mm after the removal of the AF in Orbscan II. Conclusions: Central and peripheral measurements of the corneal thickness obtained with Orbscan II and Pentacam are significantly different. The removal of the AF in Orbscan II renders lower mean differences but decreases the agreement between both systems and potentially induces an overestimation of CCT and PCT by Orbsan II compared with Pentacam.
