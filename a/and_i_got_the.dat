500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then my phone rang <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> call. It's exciting. They told me they would call {{me as soon as}} the draft was over and we would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
500|$|In his review, Vaughn Johnson of the Philadelphia Media Network through Philly.com wrote: [...] "Everything {{that was}} {{presented}} to the worldwide audience was simple and didn't require anyone to know the Japanese language. Good, quality wrestling is a universal language, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> message New Japan sent Sunday loud and clear." [...] According to Johnson, some viewers were [...] "exposed to a product for the first time where the outcomes of the matches are still important, as Okada showed by openly crying after his loss to Tanahashi" [...] in a main event, which was [...] "just as much a spectacle as it was a fantastic match athletic exhibition." [...] He wrote that to call the Nakamura–Ibushi match [...] "physical would be a gross understatement... It was brutal to watch at times" [...] but [...] "one of the best" [...] he had ever seen. Johnson praised the event as [...] "devoid of popcorn matches and silly gimmicks that insult your intelligence", and commentators Ross and Striker for focusing [...] "on the action in the ring and the significance of it instead of cracking jokes and making a million plugs." ...|$|E
500|$|In the studio, the New York Dolls {{dressed in}} their usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did not approve of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the {{sessions}} to [...] "get the glitter out of your asses and play". Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive mixing console, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: [...] "It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff. Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album. According to Scopa, the group's carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with Rundgren's professional work ethic and schedule: [...] "He doesn't put up with bullshit. I mean, [...] rarely started their live sets before midnight, so who knows? Todd {{was very much in}} charge in the studio, however, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> impression that everybody was looking to him." ...|$|E

My dad was a DJ in his early twenties so he had quite an extensive record collection that I listened to occasionally. After I experienced my first heartbreak and I thought the world was going to end, the natural way to console my tattered heart was to write a song. Of course my parents, being the supportive and loving caretakers they are, showered me with much undeserved praise and encouraged me to keep writing.

2500|$|Dettori {{sent the}} colt into the lead {{soon after the}} start and set the pace from Highland Reel, Pleascach, Free Eagle and Found. Two furlongs from the finish Free Eagle made a forward move but as he {{challenged}} the favourite, Golden Horn veered to the right, hampering his challenger. Golden Horn kept on well in the closing stages to win by a length from Found, who stayed on to deprive Free Eagle of second. Following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards the result was allowed to stand. Dettori said [...] "It was a stellar field and he was showing what a good horse he is.

On August 7, , after Williams was booed for dropping a fly ball from Mickey Mantle, Williams spat {{at one of}} the fans that was taunting him {{on the top of the}} dugout. Williams was fined $5,000 for the incident. The next day against Baltimore, Williams was greeted by a large ovation, and received an even larger ovation when he hit a home run in the sixth inning to break a 2 – 2 tie. In The Boston Globe, the publishers ran a [...] "What Globe Readers Say About Ted" [...] section made out of letters about Williams, which were either the sportswriters or the [...] "loud mouths" [...] in the stands. Williams explained years later, [...] "From '56 on, I realized that people were for me. The writers had written that the fans should show me they didn't want me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> biggest ovation yet". Williams lost the batting title to Mickey Mantle in 1956, batting [...]345 to Mantle's [...]353, with Mantle on his way to winning the Triple Crown.|$|E

2500|$|On March 8, 1985, a truck bomb {{blew up in}} Beirut killing {{more than}} 80 people and {{injuring}} more than two hundred. The bomb detonated near the apartment block of Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a Shia cleric thought {{by many to be}} the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. Although the U.S. did not engage in any direct military retaliation to the attack on the Beirut barracks, the 1985 bombing was widely believed by Fadlallah and his supporters to be the work of the United States; Sheikh Fadlallah stating that [...] "'They sent me a letter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> message,' and an enormous sign on the remains of one bombed building read: 'Made in the U.S.A.'" [...] Robert Fisk also claims that CIA operatives planted the bomb and that evidence of this is found in an article in The Washington Post newspaper. Journalist Robin Wright quotes articles in The Washington Post and The New York Times as saying that according to the CIA the [...] "Lebanese intelligence personnel and other foreigners had been undergoing CIA training" [...] but that [...] "this was not our [...] operation and it was nothing we planned or knew about." [...] "Alarmed U.S. officials subsequently canceled the covert training operation" [...] in Lebanon, according to Wright.|$|E
2500|$|Doug Jones as the Faun and the Pale Man. As the Faun, Jones guides Ofelia to {{the fantasy}} world. As the Pale Man, {{he plays a}} {{grotesque}} monster with an appetite for children. Jones had previously worked with del Toro on Mimic and Hellboy, and said the director sent him an email saying, [...] "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you." [...] Jones responded enthusiastically to an English translation of the script, but then found out the film was in Spanish, {{which he did not}} speak. Jones says he was [...] "terrified" [...] and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, but Jones rejected this, preferring to learn the words himself. He said, [...] "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> pronunciation semi-right before I even went in," [...] using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words. Del Toro later decided to dub Jones with the voice of Pablo Adán, [...] "an authoritative theatre actor", but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements. Jones's dual casting is intended to suggest that the Pale Man (along with the toad) is either a creation of the Faun, or the Faun himself in another form.|$|E
2500|$|Parks reacted {{strongly}} to Beatlemania. Of it, he claimed, [...] "I lived under a billboard that said 'The Beatles is coming,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> {{sense that it}} was a plague, and {{that it was going to}} have cultural implication throughout the world.... It's almost like the vestigial functions, the appendixes of the musical life that I had just begun to have a scant association with were being excised from the body of music with the advent of folk music gone electric. So I started to learn piano." [...] He has repeatedly stated his annoyance with contemporary pop music during the mid-1960s and the culture's increasing anglophilia, going so far as to say, [...] "apart from Pet Sounds I didn't find anything striking coming out of the United States." [...] However, he had a favorable opinion of Bob Dylan's The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, and Parks has said to have been impressed with Dylan's [...] "speaking-voice" [...] style. Accordingly, [...] "I also looked at his written lyrics and realized that he didn't capitalize his letters. He was trying to copy e.e. cummings and, while it was transparently imitative, I thought it was a good position."By 1964, Parks was growing more and more interested with songwriting. Parks said that while bass player Hal Brown of the Brandywine Singers drove him sightseeing around a decrepit [...] "almost-ghost town", the two had a chance encounter with the San Francisco group the Charlatans in an old saloon. The group derided the 21-year-old Parks for his [...] "preppy" [...] and [...] "square" [...] appearance. Parks responded by showing off a song he had just recently written, named [...] "High Coin", which impressed the group so much so that they asked if they could record it. After agreeing, the Charlatans' version of [...] "High Coin" [...] received much airplay in San Francisco, which established Parks within the hippie counterculture. Parks shortly thereafter quit the Brandywine Singers and signed an artist contract with MGM Records. For the label, he would record the singles [...] "Number Nine" [...] and [...] "Come to the Sunshine", which did not succeed commercially. They were both produced by Tom Wilson. Two years later, Parks's compositions written for other artists were becoming known for their lyrical wordplay and sharp imagery. Producers Lenny Waronker and Terry Melcher were reportedly obsessed with the song [...] "High Coin" [...] in particular, and Waronker contacted Parks to persuade him to switch to Warner Bros. Records. The two then turned their attention to a relatively unknown group, the Tikis, and transformed them into the novelty act Harpers Bizarre, which became a success for the label. Harpers Bizarre performed a few of Parks's compositions on their albums, and Parks himself appears on the recordings alongside other uncredited musician friends. During this period, Parks worked frequently as a session musician, arranger, and songwriter and became acquainted with future close friends Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson, and Beach Boys bandleader Brian Wilson. Parks also performed on the Byrds' album Fifth Dimension and declined an offer by David Crosby to join the band.|$|E
