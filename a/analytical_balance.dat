25|$|Para{{magnetism}} {{is a form}} of magnetism whereby certain {{materials are}} weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields {{in the direction of the}} applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive <b>analytical</b> <b>balance</b> to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.|$|E

50|$|An <b>analytical</b> <b>balance</b> is a {{class of}} balance {{designed}} to measure small mass in the sub-milligram range. The measuring pan of an <b>analytical</b> <b>balance</b> (0.1 mg or better) is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically vented balance safety enclosure, which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1 μg without fluctuations or loss of product. Also, the sample must be at room temperature to prevent natural convection from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading. Single-pan mechanical substitution balance maintains consistent response throughout the useful capacity is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam, thus the fulcrum, by subtracting mass {{on the same side}} of the beam to which the sample is added.|$|E

40|$|Static {{balance is}} the {{reduction}} or {{elimination of the}} actuating effort in quasi-static motion of a mechanical system by adding non-dissipative force interactions to the system. In recent years, there is increasing recognition that static balancing of elastic forces in compliant mechanisms leads to increased efficiency as well as good force feedback characteristics. The development of insightful and pragmatic design meth-ods for statically balanced compliant mechanisms is the motivation for this work. In our approach, we focus on a class of compliant mechanisms that can be approxi-mated as spring-loaded rigid-link mechanisms. Instead of developing static balancing techniques directly for the compliant mechanisms, we seek <b>analytical</b> <b>balancing</b> tech-niques for the simplified spring–loaded rigid–link approximations. Towards that, we first provide new static balancing techniques for a spring-loaded four-bar linkage. We also find relations between static balancing parameters of the cognates of a four-bar linkage. Later, we develop a new perfect static balancing method for a general n-degree-of-freedom revolute and spherical jointed rigid-body linkages. This genera...|$|R
