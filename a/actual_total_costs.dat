40|$|This paper {{develops}} a cost model to do long range planning cost estimates for Deep Space Network (DSN) support of future space missions. The {{model is a}} function of eight major mission cost drivers such as uplink frequency upgrade (U/L), telemetry upgrade (TEL) and antenna gain/noise temperature (G/T) upgrade. This paper focuses on the costs required to modify and/or enhance the DSN to prepare for supporting future space missions. Two models are derived from actual cost data from three space missions: Voyager (Uranus), Voyager (Neptune), and Magellan. Model A allows you to estimate the total cost, and Model B allows you to estimate the time profile cost and total cost for DSN support of a similar future space mission. The models were back tested against the total cost and the time profile cost for DSN support of three projects, Voyager (U), Voyager (N) and Magellan, and gave cost estimates which range from 17 % below to 19 % above actual costs for Model A, and 22. 5 % below to 17. 5 % above for Model B. The total cost Model A was also applied to estimate the total costs for DSN support of two other independent projects: Mariner Jupiter/Satum (MJS - later became Voyager), and Viking. This model gave total cost estimates for DSN support which range from 15 % to 4 % above <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> for MJS and Viking, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{analyzes}} the costs {{that occur in}} construction process, during execution of construction and craft and installation phases. The determination of costs {{in the early stages}} of the project is demanding, therefore it is desired to use simplified cost prediction models, such as the model proposed by Stoy. IN this thesis, costs of 4 already completed buildings were predicted by using the Stoy model and compared to the <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs.</b> Two residential and two office buildings were selected in the analysis. The accuracy of the obtained results was within the limits set by Stoy, however the discrepancies were still large. Further, the influence of construction materials selection upon the total costs of the buildings was determined. The cost of the project can be decreased by appropriate selection of materials already in the development phase. An analysis of the bills of quantity was carried out for the buildings under consideration. The items bringing the largest contribution to the total cost were identified by ABC analysis. The analysis that was carried out shows that the most expensive item is the bearing structure and the envelope (façade and windows). Other high costs are selected craft works and electrical and mechanical works. When deciding on the sale of the building, selling an uncompleted building may be a competitive advantage. In this case, the buyer wants to know how much money will have to be invested into the building in order to complete it. For this purpose, we calculated the proportion of costs necessary for the completion of separate construction phases. These construction phases were compared between office building projects and residential building projects - especially the latter. The results obtained show that during the first three stages there were differences due to the complexity in earthworks and foundations. In the last stages the differences were very small, they practically matched. ...|$|E

Travellers are assumed to choose their route to minimise the <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> to the destination (i. e. the CBD). The model consists of two parts: the conservation law part and the Hamilton–Jacobi part. The finite volume method is used to solve each part on unstructured meshes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} paper a method is {{proposed}} {{for the evaluation of}} project management success in the case of industrial projects with primarily economic objectives. In order to achieve this, the project management efficiency is initially defined. The definition relation is further developed combining the objectives of completion time, cost and other success criteria concerning the operation and maintenance of the unit. After the final formulation, a parametric study is carried out in order to check the effect of the different parameters appearing in the relations and also suggest the way that these relations can be used. The proposed method can be applied after the completion of a project where the <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> and completion time are known. Furthermore, since the operation parameters of the constructed industrial unit can be easily measured, the future earnings can be easily predicted, provided that the market conditions coincide with the initially expected ones. Introducing these data to the proposed relations, the project management efficiency factor can be calculated. The concept of total project management efficiency can reveal the real importance of delay or increase of cost, or any other success criteria which can be included in the method and affect earnings...|$|R

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Orthopaedic department {{of a regional}} hospital in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years or older with previously untreated DC of 30 ° or greater in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the small, ring or middle finger. The collagenase group comprised 16 consecutive patients treated during the first 6 months following the introduction of collagenase as treatment for DC at the study centre. The controls were 16 patients randomly selected among those operated on with fasciectomy at the same centre during the preceding 3 years. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with collagenase was given during two standard outpatient clinic visits (injection of 0. 9 mg, distributed at multiple sites in a palpable cord, and next-day finger extension under local anaesthesia) followed by night-time splinting. Fasciectomy {{was carried out in}} the operating room (day surgery) under general or regional anaesthesia using standard technique, followed by therapy and splinting.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} and precision of inverse probability weighted (IPW) least squares regression analysis for censored cost data. METHODS: By using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare, we identified 1500 breast cancer patients who died and had complete cost information within the database. Patients were followed for up to 48 months (partitions) after diagnosis, and their <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> was calculated in each partition. We then simulated patterns of administrative and dropout censoring and also added censoring to patients receiving chemotherapy to simulate comparing a newer to older intervention. For each censoring simulation, we performed 1000 IPW regression analyses (bootstrap, sampling with replacement), calculated the average value of each coefficient in each partition, and summed the coefficients for each regression parameter to obtain the cumulative values from 1 to 48 months. RESULTS: The cumulative, 48 -month, average cost was $ 67, 796 (95 % confidence interval [CI] $ 58, 454 -$ 78, 291) with no censoring, $ 66, 313 (95 % CI $ 54, 975 -$ 80, 074) with administrative censoring, and $ 66, 765 (95 % CI $ 54, 510 -$ 81, 843) with administrative plus dropout censoring. In multivariate analysis, chemotherapy was associated with increased cost of $ 25, 325 (95 % CI $ 17, 549 -$ 32, 827) compared with $ 28, 937 (95 % CI $ 20, 510 -$ 37, 088) with administrative censoring and $ 29, 593 ($ 20, 564 -$ 39, 399) with administrative plus dropout censoring. Adding censoring to the chemotherapy group resulted in less accurate IPW estimates. This was ameliorated, however, by applying IPW within treatment groups. CONCLUSION: IPW is a consistent estimator of population mean costs if the weight is correctly specified. If the censoring distribution depends on some covariates, a model that accommodates this dependency must be correctly specified in IPW to obtain accurate estimates...|$|R

Physicians-in-training generally receive little education regarding costs of prescribed therapy and may rely on hospital pharmacists for this information. However, little is documented regarding either of these health care providers’ familiarity with out-of pocket medication expenses borne by patients in the community. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate and compare resident physician and hospital pharmacist familiarity with what patients pay for medications prescribed once discharged. Setting A major tertiary patient care and medical teaching centre in Canada. Method Internal medicine residents and hospital pharmacists within a specific health care organization were invited to participate in an online survey. Eight patient case scenarios and associated discharge therapeutic regimens were outlined and respondents asked to identify the costs patients would incur when having the prescription filled once discharged. Main Outcome Measure Total number and proportion of estimates above and below actual cost were calculated and compared between the groups using χ 2 tests. Responses ± 10 % of the true cost were considered correct. Mean absolute values and standard deviation estimated costs, as well as cost increments above and below 10 %, were calculated to assess the magnitude of the discrepancy between the respondent estimates and the <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>cost.</b> Results Forty-four percent of physician residents and 26 % of hospital pharmacists accessed the survey.

50|$|Instead {{of using}} a pre-determined rate based on estimates, why not base the {{overhead}} rate on the <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> manufacturing overhead <b>cost</b> and the <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> amount of the activity base incurred on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis? If an actual rate is computed monthly or quarterly, seasonal factors in overhead costs or in the activity base can produce fluctuations in the overhead rate. For example, the costs of heating and cooling a factory in Illinois will be highest {{in the winter and}} summer months and lowest in the spring and fall. If the overhead rate is recomputed {{at the end of each}} month or each quarter based on actual costs and activity, the overhead rate would go up in the winter and summer and down in the spring and fall. As a result, two identical jobs, one completed in the winter and one completed in the spring, would be assigned different manufacturing overhead costs. Many managers believe that such fluctuations in product costs serve no useful purpose. To avoid such fluctuations, actual overhead rates could be computed on an annual or less-frequent basis. However, if the overhead rate is computed annually based on the actual costs and activity for the year, the manufacturing overhead assigned to any particular job would not be known until the end of the year. For example, the cost of Job 2B47 at Yost Precision Machining would not be known until the end of the year, even though the job will be completed and shipped to the customer in March. For these reasons, most companies use predetermined overhead rates rather than actual overhead rates in their cost accounting systems.|$|R

METHODS: A cohort study using per-patient hospital discharge abstracts in a period of 4. 5 years of follow-up (from 1 / 1 / 1996 to 30 / 6 / 2000). Potential cost predictors were age, sex, body max index, hypertension, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A 1 c levels, insulin treatment, retinopathy, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, nephropathy, death and presence of comorbidity (cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and psychiatric disease). Among risk factors, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and smoking were considered. A two-part model has been adopted in order {{to take into account the}} presence of patients with zero hospital costs: the probability of any hospitalization has been modeled via a standard logit generalized linear model (GLM); the <b>actual</b> level of <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> has been modeled via a GLM, with a gamma cost distribution and a LOG link function. RESULTS: In 4. 5 years the median <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> per hospitalized person was 4404 (mean 8180). In line with existing evidence, diabetes complications showed a high impact on average costs. In particular, peripheral and coronary artery diseases determined more than 1000 increase in the median costs. Chronic comorbidity were responsible for the highest incremental hospitalization costs (1771). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization costs were significantly increased by the presence of diabetes complications and chronic conditions. The adoption of a two-part model has allowed to obtain estimates not neglecting the effect of covariates on the probability of having no hospital care...|$|R
