40|$|Integrated multi-fidelity {{modeling}} {{has been}} performed for combustion instability in aerospace propulsion, which includes {{two levels of}} analysis: first, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using hybrid RANS/LES simulations for underlying physics investigations (high-fidelity modeling); second, modal decomposition techniques for diagnostics (analysis 2 ̆ 6 validation); third, development of flame response model using model reduction techniques for practical design applications (low-order model). ^ For the high-fidelity modeling, the relevant CFD code development work is moving towards combustion instability prediction for liquid propulsion system. A laboratory-scale single-element lean direct injection (LDI) gas turbine combustor is used for configuration that produces self-excited combustion instability. The model gas turbine combustor is featured with an <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>section,</b> air plenum, swirler-venturi-injector assembly, combustion chamber, and exit nozzle. The combustor uses liquid fuel (Jet-A/FT-SPK) and heated air up to 800 K. Combustion dynamics investigations are performed with the same geometry and operating conditions concurrently between the experiment and computation at both high (2 ̆ 6 phis;= 0. 6) and low (2 ̆ 6 phis;= 0. 36) equivalence ratios. The simulation is able to reach reasonable agreement with experiment measurements {{in terms of the}} pressure signal. Computational analyses are also performed using an acoustically-open geometry to investigate the characteristic hydrodynamics in the combustor with both constant and perturbed inlet mass flow rates. Two hydrodynamic modes are identified by using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) analysis: Vortex Breakdown Bubble (VBB) and swirling modes. Following that, the closed geometry simulation results are analyzed in three steps. In step one, a detailed cycle analysis shows two physically important couplings in the combustor: first, the acoustic compression enhances the spray drop breakup and vaporization, and generates more gaseous fuel for reaction; second, the acoustic compression couples with the unsteady hydrodynamics found in the open-geometry simulation, enhances the fuel/air mixing, and triggers a large amount of heat addition. In step two, a modal analysis using DMD extracts the dynamic features of important modes in the combustor, and identifies the presence of Precessing Vortex Core (PVC) mode and its nonlinear interactions with acoustic modes. Moreover, the DMD analysis helps to establish the couplings between the hydrodynamics and acoustics in terms of frequencies. In step 3, Rayleigh index analysis provides a quantitative assessment of acoustics/combustion couplings and identifies local regions for instability driving/damping. ^ Two modal decomposition techniques, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), are assessed in terms of their capabilities in extracting important information from the original simulation dataset and in validating the computational results using the experiment measurement. A POD analysis provides a series of modes with decreasing energy content and it offers an efficient and optimized way to represent a large dataset. The frequency-based DMD technique provides modes that correspond to all single frequencies. ^ For the low-order modeling, fundamental aspects are examined to study necessary conditions, criteria and approaches to develop a reduced-order model (ROM) that is able to represent generic combustion/flame responses, which then can be used in an engineering level tool to provide efficient predictions of combustion instability for practical design applications. Explorations are focused on model reduction techniques by using the so-called POD/Galerkin method. The method uses the numerical solutions of the model equations as the database for building a set of POD eigen-bases. Specifically, the numerical solutions are calculated by perturbing quantities of interest such as the inlet conditions. The POD-derived eigen-bases are, in turn, used in conjunction with a Galerkin procedure to reduce the governing partial differential equation to an ordinary differential equation, which constitutes the ROM. Once the ROM is established, it can then be used as a lower-order test-bed to predict detailed results within certain parametric ranges {{at a fraction of the}} cost of solving the full governing equations. A detailed assessment is performed on the method in two parts. In part one, a one-dimensional scalar reaction-advection model equation is used for fundamental investigations, which include verification of the POD eigen-basis calculation and of the ROM development procedure. Moreover, certain criteria during ROM development are established: 1. a necessary number of POD modes that should be included to guarantee a stable ROM; 2. the need for the numerical discretization scheme to be consistent between the original CFD and the developed ROM. Furthermore, the predictive capabilities of the resulting ROM are evaluated to test its limits and to validate the values of applying broadband forcing in improving the ROM performance. In part two, the exploration is extended to a vector system of equations. Using the one-dimensional Euler equation is used as a model equation. A numerical stability issue is identified during the ROM development, the cause of which is further studied and attributed to the normalization methods implemented to generate coupled POD eigen-bases for vector variables.

Their {{performance}} is reported in terms of flame temperature and length, in order to ascertain the best ratio between primary and secondary air, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumption. To find the best ratio between primary and secondary air, the length and temperature of the flame were recorded {{for each of the three}} burners, examined by varying the <b>inlet</b> <b>sections</b> of the primary air and secondary air. The data on temperature and the flame length of each burner were processed using multiple regression analysis. The LPG consumption was determined with one of the burners using 10 different pressures in combination with three nozzles. The data obtained were subjected to non-linear regression using two gaseous outflow models. The various combinations of primary and secondary <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>sections</b> affected the values of the flame length and temperature. In general, the best combinations of primary and secondary <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> for flame temperature did not correspond to those for flame length. However, this experiment showed that the <b>inlet</b> of secondary <b>air</b> is critical for the performance of this type of burner, in terms of flame temperature. The fuel consumption trial showed that the model proposed for the gaseous outflow is suitable for describing the values of LPG consumption collected during the trial. © 2015 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers...|$|R

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s.

The computational fluid dynamics results of the laminar flow simulations revealed that the pressure loss coefficients of the sudden contraction and rounded <b>inlet</b> <b>sections</b> were very similar. The pressure loss coefficient of the sudden contraction <b>inlet</b> <b>sections</b> only being 3 to 6 % higher than the rounded <b>inlet</b> <b>sections.</b> This is due to the dominant effect of viscosity in the laminar flow regime. The viscosity reduces the extent of flow contraction occurring since transverse momentum is damped by the viscous dissipation. The dominant pressure loss mechanism in the laminar flow regime is hydrodynamic flow development. With hydrodynamic flow development the flow velocity profile changes from a uniform velocity profile before the <b>inlet</b> <b>section</b> into a pointed parabolic profile downstream in the tube. The turbulent flow simulation results revealed that the pressure loss coefficients of the rounded <b>inlet</b> <b>sections</b> investigated in this study were very similar. The pressure loss coefficient of the sudden contracting <b>inlet</b> <b>section</b> was higher than the rounded inlet sections’ pressure loss coefficient. The results indicated that rounded tubular <b>inlet</b> <b>sections</b> would be of limited value in the laminar flow regime; it would however be beneficial in the turbulent flow regime. Prof. J. P.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{analysis was used to}} simulate the flowfield generated in an Aerolizer 1 with different <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> sizes at 30, 45, and 60 l/min. Dispersion performance of the modified inhalers was measured using mannitol powder and a multistage liquid impinger at the same flow rates. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size had a varying effect on powder dispersion depending on the flow rate. At low flow rates (30 and 45 l/min), reducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size increased the inhaler dispersion performance by increasing the flow turbulence and particle impaction velocities above their critical levels for maximal powder dispersion. At 60 l/min, re-ducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size reduced the inhaler dispersion performance by releasing a large amount of powder from the device before the turbulence levels and particle impaction velocities could be fully developed.
