5|$|Belgrano is {{considered}} one of the greatest heroes in Argentina's history. A monument complex (Monumento Nacional a la Bandera, National Flag Memorial) was built in 1957 in honour of the flag, in Rosario. The Flag Memorial <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> that surround it are the seat of national celebrations every Flag Day, on 20 June, the anniversary of Belgrano's death. Jujuy Province is declared the honorary capital of Argentina each 23 August since 2002, in reference to the Jujuy Exodus.|$|E

5|$|Director Park (officially Simon and Helen Director Park) is a {{city park}} in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. Opened in 2009 {{at a cost of}} $9.5 million, it covers a 700-space {{underground}} parking garage, which connects underground to the Fox Tower <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> Avenue West Tower. Located in downtown on Southwest Park Avenue, the nearly half-acre urban park lacks any natural areas and contains little vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 Victor Emmanuel II's {{grandson}} King Victor Emmanuel III {{donated the}} park's original 21 square kilometres (5,189 acres), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{was established in}} 1922. It was Italy's first national park. There were approximately 4,000 ibex in the park when it was protected. Despite {{the presence of the}} park, ibex were poached until 1945, when only 419 remained. Their protection increased, and there are now almost 4,000 in the park.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the palace}} {{including}} the entire estate {{was purchased by}} the City of Braunschweig. One condition for the purchase was that no structural changes ever be made <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> not be built on. The palace, which was rebuilt after the Second World War and reconstructed in 1987 to the historic original design, is now used for public events. The nearly four-hectare park has been {{open to the public}} since 1964.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the National Endowment for the Arts {{committed}} $250,000 to the Park District for {{the conservation}} and restoration of the reflecting pool. In 2004, the University of Chicago contributed $100,000 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> District Board $845,000 to repair the pool and its water circulation system. This work {{was carried out in}} the summer of 2005 at a slightly reduced budget, and the fountain was filled with water {{for the first time in}} over fifty years.|$|E
5|$|In {{other parts}} of Canterbury, the city walls became used for promenades by the more fashionable citizens. The Dane John Gardens were built between 1790 and 1803 by Simmons in the {{south-east}} corner of the walls, remodelling the old castle motte, and incorporating the Roman bank and the medieval wall-walk into the design. The ownership of the land was disputed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> was taken into {{the control of the}} city shortly after its construction.|$|E
5|$|Sangay {{is one of}} two active volcanoes {{located within}} the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's {{isolation}} has allowed it to maintain a pristine ecology relatively untouched by human interaction, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> hosts a biome ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush ecosystems are found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope.|$|E

5|$|The Cardiff Arms Park {{site was}} {{originally}} called the Great Park, a swampy meadow behind the Cardiff Arms Hotel. The hotel {{was built by}} Sir Thomas Morgan, {{during the reign of}} Charles I. Cardiff Arms Park was named after this hotel. From 1803, the Cardiff Arms Hotel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> had become the property of the Bute family. The Arms Park soon became a popular place for sporting events, and by 1848, Cardiff Cricket Club was using the site for its cricket matches. However, by 1878, Cardiff Arms Hotel had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|The {{best time}} for {{whitewater}} boating on Loyalsock Creek at Worlds End State Park is from March to May, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> hosts a slalom race on Loyalsock Creek each spring. The whitewater gradient is 41 for {{the section of the}} creek in and near the park, and its rating on the International Scale of River Difficulty is II to III+, with sections reaching IV. The water is too swift for open canoes, so visitors are asked to use kayaks. The swimming area is closed to whitewater boating during the summer months.|$|E

5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{designated}} as a Grade I listed building in 1958 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> and gardens {{are included in the}} National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens at Grade II. The house was bequeathed to the National Trust upon the death in 1982 of Henry John Ralph Bankes, along with Corfe Castle. The house and gardens are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{within the}} park is at an {{elevation}} of about , <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> itself sits in a natural basin. The basin and the underlying sandstone trap water and thus form the lake and surrounding bogs. The higher elevation leads to a cooler climate, and the basin helps trap denser, cooler air, leading to longer winters and milder summers.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{included}} a miniature golf course, which was eventually removed {{to make room}} for an overall expansion of both <b>the</b> <b>park</b> itself <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> area.|$|R

5|$|The {{national}} park center opened in 2001 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> was expanded on 23 August 2003. At {{the same time}} the adjacent Øvre Pasvik Landscape Protection Area was created, which borders Pasvik Nature Reserve. Thus the five protected areas were connected. Since 2011 a local political board has been responsible for the management of the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} its western border {{running along the}} Finland–Norway border. The two most {{prominent}} lakes are Ellenvatn and Ødevatn, both of which flow into tributaries of the river Pasvikelva. The fauna and flora are typical of the Siberian taiga, and include some species uncommon for Norway. The park is a habitat for the brown bear and also has a large population of moose; reindeer husbandry takes place during winter. Eight species of fish live in the lakes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> has 190 species of flowering plants.|$|E
5|$|Thirty years later, Congress passed {{legislation}} creating New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park, commemorating the city's past.

In 2008, WHALE {{turned over the}} neighboring Corson Building, built 1875-84, to the Park Service, which it had renovated after a 1997 fire. Plans call {{for it to be}} used for educational purposes related to the park, with a 60-seat theater, archival space, seminar room, and similar features.|$|E
