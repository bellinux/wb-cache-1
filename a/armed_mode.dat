We present a self-consistent n-body model for this system which includes an SPH gas component.

40|$|Knowing {{accurate}} {{model of}} a system is always beneficial to design a robust and safe control while allowing reduction of sensors-related cost as the system outputs are predictable using the model. In this context, this paper addresses the kinematical and dynamical model identification of the multipurpose rehabilitation robot, Universal Haptic Pantograph (UHP), and present experimental validations of the identified models. The UHP is a Pantograph based innovative robot actuated by two SEAs (Series Elastic Actuator), aiming at training impaired upper limbs after a stroke. This novel robot, thanks to its lockable/unlockable joints, can change its mechanical structure so that it enables stroke patient to perform different training exercises of the shoulder, elbow and wrist. This work focuses on the <b>ARM</b> <b>mode,</b> which is a training mode used to rehabilitate elbow and shoulder. The kinematical model of UHP is identified based on the loop vector equations, while the dynamical model is derived based on the Lagrangian formulation. To demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} models, several experimental tests were performed. The results reveal that the mean position error between estimated values with the model and actual measured values stays in 3 mm (less than 2...|$|R

40|$|Teleoperation {{is a form}} of {{telerobotics}} {{which refers}} to human operation of a robotic system over a remote link. The teleoperated robotic arm onboard the Space Shuttle and three more advanced arms onboard the International Space Station (ISS) are essential tools in the continued construction, maintenance, resupply, and scientific operations of this orbiting laboratory. Operating the Shuttle and ISS arms is a highly skilled and delicate task which requires extensive training. An operator typically monitors arm motion using video cameras which are often not ideally located. A major problem associated with using telerobotic arms is the disparity between the direction of joystick movement and the resulting motion of the arm as observed on video monitors. It is known that humans differ in their ability to perform mental rotations or imagine scenes from different perspectives. In some <b>arm</b> control <b>mode</b> and camera configurations, large control/view disparities require difficult mental coordinate transformations. We hypothesized that these differences impact telerobotic operator performance. In this experiment we investigated the effect of spatial skills, control/view frame disparity, and <b>arm</b> control <b>mode</b> on telerobotic operator performance. A virtual environment was developed to simulate the Basic Operational Robotics Instruction System (BORIS) used for ISS training. Nineteen non-astronaut subjects completed 3 training lessons to learn to operate a 6 Degree of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm. During the training they were presented with several realistic tasks which required them to operate the arm in both high (greater than 90 °) and low (less than 90 °) control/view disparity scenarios, and in external (environment fixed) and internal (<b>arm</b> fixed) control <b>modes.</b> We found that spatial abilities correlated with some overall performance metrics in both internal and external modes. In the high control/view disparity condition, Purdue Spatial Visualization of Views Test (PSVT) and a bi-manual control test predicted the number of changes in control inputs. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a performance {{evaluation of a}} 384 -bit NIST elliptic curve over prime fields on a 32 -bit ARM 946 E microprocessor running at 100 -MHz. While adhering to the constraints of an embedded system, the following items were investigated to decrease computation time: {{the importance of the}} underlying finite arithmetic, the use of hardware accelerators, the use of memory options, and the use of available processor features. The elliptic curve implementation utilized existing finite arithmetic C code to interface to an AiMEC Montgomery Exponentiator Core. The exponentiator core supports modular addition, modular multiplication, and exponentiation. The finite arithmetic C code also contained functions to perform operations which are not performed by the exponentiator such as non-modular multiplication, non-modular addition, and modular subtraction. Multiple enhancements were made to the finite field arithmetic. These provided a 22 % time reduction in execution time of the 384 -bit elliptic curve multiplication. Enhancements included writing assembly functions, adding checks prior to performing a modular reduction, utilizing the exponentiator core only when modulus reduction was necessary, using multiplication if more than two additions are required and placing the finite arithmetic into its own library and using <b>ARM</b> <b>mode.</b> Other optimizations investigated including: cache usage, compiler options (speed vs. size), and Thumb instruction set vs. ARM instruction set provided minimal reduction, 3. 6 %, in the execution time...|$|R

When the attack meter is fully charged, players are able to unleash a high-damage [...] "rush attack" [...] against their opponents.
