5|$|Humber was {{assigned}} to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber {{was hit in the}} face on a line drive by Luis Cruz. After lying on the mound for a few minutes, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and walk on his own to the dugout. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he received eighteen stitches. He earned the second PCL Pitcher of the Week Award of his career for play during the week ending August 1. He won the award based on having posted a complete game 4-hit 7-strikeout shutout against the Nashville Sounds on July 30.|$|E
25|$|On February 4, 2006, at UFC 57, Liddell faced Randy Couture in {{a rubber}} match, After an action packed first round, Liddell landed a big punch to Couture's face {{causing him to}} bleed, Couture bounced back with a take down of Liddell, but he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> right away. Later {{in the second round}} as Couture moved in Liddell countered similar to in the second fight at UFC 52 {{knocking}} Couture out, defeating Couture for the second time via knockout in Las Vegas, Nevada to retain the light heavyweight championship belt. After the fight, Couture announced his retirement from mixed martial arts.|$|E
500|$|Tomjanovich was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{and walk}} around, however, {{and on the}} way into the locker room he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became {{aggressive}} and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel. Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggressiveness; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured {{in such a way that}} Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth. He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him. The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said [...] "I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it" [...] and likened the surgery to Scotch-taping together a badly shattered eggshell.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the doctor}} hasn't {{tendered}} me any information," [...] said Frank, stopping his horse, so that Armstrong was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> close <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his elbow.|$|R
5000|$|... 2004: In {{spite of}} hitting his 2nd {{shot at the}} 72nd hole into the water, Adam Scott is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>up</b> and down for bogey to win by one shot over PÃ¡draig Harrington.|$|R
50|$|The win at Memorial was {{particularly}} memorable. Bryant's tee {{shot on the}} 72nd hole found a hazard. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>up</b> and down for par and secure his one-shot victory over Fred Couples.|$|R
500|$|... "Dancing With Myself" [...] is McHale's {{first solo}} {{performance}} on the show. Murphy commented that the performance is Artie's chance to [...] "break away from being misunderstood by everyone" [...] and express himself, explaining that although Artie is usually [...] "a very secure guy" [...] who does not care about others' opinions of him, [...] "Wheels" [...] sees his friends take his disability for granted: [...] "So this performance is all about him saying, 'Look, this is who I am, and this is who I want to be. McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him {{more aware of the}} challenges that people with disabilities face: [...] "It's a completely different side of life. More than ever, I realize how grateful I am to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> between each take and walk around. I'm glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week. And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chang {{paced the}} sidelines during {{changeovers}} as he risked not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> if {{he sat down}} and ate bananas and drank water at every opportunity. He also adopted some unusual tactics in an attempt to overcome his cramps such as hitting the ball high into the air on many points to slow the game down (known as [...] "moon balls"), and began to go for more winners in order to shorten the points. [...] The success of these tactics caused Lendl, known {{to be one of the}} least easily fazed players, to lose his rhythm and also prompted him to swear at the umpire and the crowd, especially after losing a key point in the fifth set when Chang shocked him by delivering an under-arm serve.|$|E
2500|$|Day ten {{brought the}} lightest winds {{seen in the}} 34th America's Cup. The start of the first race was pushed back by five minutes, due {{to the need to}} shift one of the marks on the start line. Oracle had the better start in the [...] winds, and luffed Team New Zealand at the reach mark. The first {{downward}} leg was very {{different from the rest of}} the racing, as neither boat was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> on its foils. Aotearoa appeared to be the stronger boat in the light breeze, and rounded the leeward gate 1:42 ahead of the Americans. The Kiwi boat continued to extend their lead during the third leg and the main concern turned to whether they would be able to cross the finish line within the 40 minute race limit. Unfortunately for them, despite being ahead by more than 1,000 metres in winds of between [...] near the end of the fourth leg, with 90% of the race complete, the time expired forcing the abandonment of the race.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can do {{that and}} welcome," [...] said Jack's father. [...] "But take my advice and take a good lunch along, because {{you may not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{anything}} <b>up</b> there. I don't know whether there are any farmhouses around or not." ...|$|R
50|$|The 3d PRS {{continued}} to fly single plane missions to Japan, taking high altitude pre-strike target planning photos and poststrike damage assessment photos. The losses incurred by the 3d PRS {{in this type}} of activity were relatively light. Seldom were the Japanese <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fighters <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30,000 feet in time to intercept the photo ships.|$|R
6000|$|... "The ebb {{is nearly}} done--they'll never be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ship <b>up</b> on the {{shelving}} rock {{where they had}} the Sea-Otter, until the water rises ten or twelve feet." ...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "no-challenge" [...] rule adopted {{prior to}} the [...] season was {{modified}} to eliminate the automatic [...] "no-review" [...] penalty when a coach challenges a play that is subject to automatic review by the replay booth (turnovers, scoring plays, and any play inside of the two-minute warning). This change was prompted after last season's Thanksgiving Day game when Detroit Lions' head coach Jim Schwartz threw a challenge flag on a play where replay clearly showed Houston Texans' running back Justin Forsett's knee touched the ground, but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and score a touchdown. Due {{to the way the}} rule was written at the time the penalty for the errant challenge prevented the play from being reviewed. Under the revised rule teams will be charged a time-out (or an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty if the team is out of time-outs) when a coach throws a challenge flag on a booth-reviewable play, but the play will still be reviewed if the replay booth believes a review is necessary. This change has been referred to as the [...] "Jim Schwartz rule".|$|E
60|$|Almost {{before the}} door closed on the doctor Nat was asleep. A {{fortnight}} later he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and sit in an easy-chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] she said. [...] "My uncle {{is really about}} the same. The doctor thinks he may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in about a week." ...|$|E
50|$|With only 25 seconds remaining, Williams {{began to}} rain in a long, {{unanswered}} combination, which ultimately sent Tyson into {{the ropes and}} onto the canvas with 10 {{seconds left in the}} round. Tyson remained seated on the canvas before finally attempting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>up</b> as the referee's count reached seven. Although the groggy Tyson was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>up,</b> he narrowly missed beating the referee's count of ten. As a result, Williams was declared the winner by knock-out at 2:51 of the fourth round.|$|R
60|$|On {{the night}} of the 14th, the enemy again made an attack on the water bearers, but were repulsed with loss. The water way was, indeed, a source of {{constant}} anxiety. Between it, and the trees at the northwest corner of the fort, there was a stretch of seventy yards of sandy beach; lying underneath an overhanging bank, which entirely covered it from the fire of the fort, so that the enemy were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the water tunnel without exposing themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Lynch {{asked his}} mother to bring him {{a cup of water}} from the well, which he drank, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> then <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and walk unsupported. He told his mother that he was to [...] "visit the well neine dayes, and to drinke thereof three tymes in etech day, and that he would doe well, and douth to {{continue}} since to observe the same dayly, and since is cured of the vomitting disease, and douth eath and drink ever since with a great apetit and desire, and douth slipe well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very nice}} of you, but it's very naughty also. Run {{off to bed}} {{as fast as you}} can, or you won't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{tomorrow}} morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't be {{safe for}} some time; you're {{not used to}} the fumes," [...] he said. [...] "If you went there now, you wouldn't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're all young, Betty! Can't {{you put up}} {{with any}} one that is not older than yourself! I'm afraid he would hardly be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> the pulpit stair." ...|$|E
50|$|The first punch that Tyson landed was a {{left hand}} that dropped Savarese to the canvas. Savarese was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>up,</b> but {{was met with}} a furious assault from Tyson. Referee John Coyle {{attempted}} to stop the fight at 26 seconds by getting in between the two, but Tyson continued to hammer away at Savarese, taking down Coyle in the process. Shortly after, Tyson's corner entered the ring and Tyson calmed down. Tyson was awarded the technical knockout victory after only 38 seconds of action, {{it was the second}} quickest fight of his career, behind only his 30-second victory over Marvis Frazier in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|Foreman {{would make}} quick work of Roman, ending the fight after just {{two minutes and}} {{making it one of}} the {{shortest}} heavyweight title fights in history. A little over a minute into the fight, Foreman had Roman up against the ropes and landed several powerful punches that put Roman down. Roman was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>up</b> and continue on, but Foreman quickly resumed his attack and caught Roman flush with a right hook that sent Roman crashing to the mat. Roman again answered the referee's count, but Foreman would quickly hit Roman with a right uppercut that put Roman down for the count. Foreman was named the winner by knockout at 2:00 of the first round.|$|R
5000|$|Maccarinelli's next {{fight was}} an all-British {{unification}} {{fight against the}} WBA/WBC champion David Haye. The fight took place on 8 March 2008 at the O2 Arena, London and was much hyped in the weeks running up to the event, being given the tagline [...] "bombs away" [...] (referring to the high KO percentages and punching power both men boasted). Maccarinelli lost the fight and his WBO belt when he was knocked out in the 2nd round. A right hand by Haye knocked Maccarinelli down {{towards the end of}} the round and although he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>up</b> it was on unsteady legs and the referee stepped in to stop the fight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, please let's {{not start}} anything. Sorry I haven't been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> oftener, but I've been taking work home. You {{know how it}} is--you know when you get busy with your dancing-school----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} plenty of time, miss; she will anchor off Grain Spit till the tide begins to run up hard. You won't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> the creek till an hour before high tide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much farther," [...] I said. [...] "I am {{sure there}} is firm ground beneath us, {{but it will not}} do to move. If we should fall down, we might not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Grace, I'd tried {{everything}} but that; and I {{could not stand}} it. Death was a joke to that. Not <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out!--To rage <b>up</b> and down for hours like a wild beast; long to fly at one's gaoler and tear his heart out;--beat one's {{head against the wall}} in the hope of knocking one's brains out;--anything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of that horrid notion, night and day over one--I can't get out!" ...|$|R
50|$|After {{his time}} with Lidiaâs Kitchen, Abin decided to travel to Italy and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> set <b>up</b> quickly thanks to {{personal}} referrals from friend and business partner, Lidia Bastianich. During his time in Italy, Abinâs passion for Italian cuisine and restaurant management was solidified by the towns he visited, {{as well as the}} chefs and hotel staff he met. While on this travels, Abin received a call from a former colleague from Campagna in NYC, exclaiming, âYou have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> New York to see TAO!â Abin headed back to New York and interviewed for a position with TAO. After that meeting, he accepted an AGM position with the establishment. TAO was an immediate success and became the highest grossing restaurant in the US.|$|R
25|$|While the H11 {{was popular}} with hard-core hobbyists, Heath {{engineers}} realized that DEC's PDP microprocessors {{would not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Heath <b>up</b> the road to more powerful systems. Heath/Zenith then designed a dual Intel 8085/8088 based system dubbed the H100 (or Z-100, in preassembled form, sold by ZDS). The machine featured very advanced (for the day) bit mapped video that allowed up to 640 x 512 pixels of 8 color graphics. The H100 was interesting in that it could run either the CP/M operating system, or their OEM version of MS-DOS named Z-DOS, which were the two leading business PC operating systems at the time. Although the machine had to be rebooted to change modes, they could read each other's disks.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the bones}} of the forearm was indeed broken, and the Doctor, having applied splints and bandages, peremptorily ordered him to lie down. Bathurst protested that he was {{perfectly}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> with his arm in a sling.|$|E
60|$|Firing was {{continued}} after this, {{but with}} less fury. Burnside {{had not yet}} been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to render any assistance. But it was now only about nine in the morning, and he was getting into position on Hancock's right.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not very, thank goodness. Still, if he {{fell down}} {{he might not}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> again, {{especially}} if he'd hurt himself at all. Half a second. Let me get on some boots, and I'll come out and look. Shan't be long.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been nearly an hour later that {{something}} did begin to happen, Baas. It was as though sacks filled with chaff were being beaten against stone walls there in the cave. Ah! thought I to myself, your stomach is beginning to ache, Eater-up-of-Bena, and, as that goat had little horns on its head--to which I tied two of the bags of the poison, Baas--and, like all snakes, no doubt you have spikes in your throat pointing downwards, you won't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>up</b> again. Then--I expect this was after the poison-sugar had begun to melt nicely in the serpent's stomach, Baas--there was a noise as though a whole company of girls were dancing a war-dance in the cave to a music of hisses.|$|R
50|$|Before Typhoon 2 was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> its weapon <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed, Atomic {{spotted the}} danger and {{attempted}} to flip it but Typhoon 2 did not turn over. Atomic tried once more to flip Typhoon 2 but it hit the arena grinder instead and flipped itself onto its back, unable to self-right. Typhoon 2 charged up its weapon and attacked Atomic three times causing major damage before Atomic was eventually counted out. Typhoon advanced to Round 6.|$|R
50|$|After {{only one}} minute and 15 seconds of action, Green caught Jones with a right hand that dropped Jones to the canvas. Jones was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>up,</b> and, though he was clearly hurt from the punch, was allowed to continue. Green then swarmed Jones and furiously pounded Jones into a corner with a bevy of punches as Jones simply covered up. After nearly 20 seconds of abuse, Jones was finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{out of the corner}} and {{clinched}} Green. Following a break by the referee, Green continued his assault on Jones, who again just covered up and offered no offense. Following that exchange, the referee stepped in and Green was named the winner by technical knockout at 2:02 of the first round. Arguably the most lopsided loss in his career, it remains Jones' first and only first round knockout loss.|$|R
