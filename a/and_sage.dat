5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular enemies, the player also needs to defeat several bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. By defeating enemies, the player gains experience points, which make the hero's level increase; when this happens, the player gets points to spend on four different disciplines, each of which gives the hero access to different abilities and enhances different stats associated with the discipline: Warrior is associated with physical attacks, Monk with defense and health points, Mage with magic attacks and magic points, <b>and</b> <b>Sage</b> {{with an increase in}} the weapon limit gauge. Sometimes when enemies are defeated, they drop items; the player can carry items with them, which are grouped into stacks, each taking up one slot in the inventory.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Markham Sutherland is {{presented}} through various letters, journals, and the third-person {{account of the}} novel's supposed editor, Arthur. Sutherland, under pressure from his father to become a clergyman, confesses to Arthur his reservations about accepting the Thirty-Nine Articles and contemporary English Christianity in general. In particular, Sutherland {{is concerned about the}} depiction of God in the Old Testament, God's patronage of the Israelites on non-moral grounds, the doctrine of Eternal Punishment, and the supposed inerrancy of the Bible. Sutherland was profoundly influenced by John Henry Newman in his early years, but was ultimately unable to accept Newman's doctrines. Sutherland also seeks guidance in the writings of Victorian historian <b>and</b> <b>sage</b> Thomas Carlyle (who was Froude's chief intellectual influence in later years), but finds no solutions. Tormented by his doubts and subsequent alienation from his family, Sutherland becomes morbidly depressed.|$|E

5|$|The {{years of}} neglect {{following}} {{the closing of the}} hotel took a toll on the building's appearance with both the interior and exterior facade crumbling. In 2005, it was announced that the hotel would undergo a $112million renovation and acquisition with a planned opening in 2007 in a deal between Marriott International/Renaissance Hotels <b>and</b> <b>Sage</b> Hospitality, a Denver, Colorado-based company. The hotel's restoration process was quite lengthy because of the extensive interior damage. $22million of the expected $112million was the cost associated with the acquisition. Sage sought $22million in tax increment financing from the Chicago Community Development Commission. They eventually were approved for $18million in tax-increment financing. The final cost of the restoration came to $128million, of which the city of Chicago provided $13.5million for street-front improvement, including the restoration and recasting of over 10,000 pieces of decorative terra cotta, and federal historical tax credits because the building is a historical landmark. The Chicago Landmark status necessitated renovation oversight by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
