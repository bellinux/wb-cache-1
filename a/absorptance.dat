40|$|Solar <b>absorptances</b> {{are often}} {{derived from the}} {{reflectance}} values measured with devices which make use of integrating spheres. Instruments of this type can be operated in two different ways, according to whether spectral or integrated reflectances are measured. Though solar <b>absorptances</b> derived from spectral data are inherently more accurate, some commercially available reflectometers are found which are conceived for measuring integrated rather than spectral reflectances. Since these instruments are often provided with radiation sources which do not match the solar spectrum and/or detectors showing a spectrally selective response, they could in principle be affected by errors when dealing with selective surfaces. With the aim of giving an error estimate, {{the theory of the}} measurement was analyzed with reference to some selective samples well characterized for their reflectance properties. The results were then given an experimental validation by using an integrating sphere equipped with different sources and detectors...|$|R

The thermal emittances of the samples were 10 % for C–SiO 2, 6 % for the C–ZnO and 4 % for the C–NiO samples. The solar <b>absorptances</b> were 95 %, 71 % and 84 % for the C–SiO 2, C–ZnO and C–NiO samples, respectively.

Two different choices were adopted for the fractional scattering into the forward peak, the key parameter in this method. The application of these choices provided almost the same <b>absorptances,</b> and associated to very similar systematic errors.

50|$|As with photoacoustic spectroscopy, {{photothermal}} spectroscopy is {{an indirect}} method for measuring optical absorption, {{because it is}} not based on the direct measure of the light which is involved in the absorption. In another sense, however, photothermal (and photoacoustic) methods measure directly the absorption, rather than e.g. calculate it from the transmission, as is the case of more usual (transmission) spectroscopic techniques. And it is this fact that gives the technique its high sensitivity, because in transmission techniques the <b>absorptance</b> is calculated as the difference between total light impinging on the sample and the transmitted (plus reflected, plus scattered) light, with the usual problems of accuracy when one deals with small differences between large numbers, if the absorption is small. In photothermal spectroscopies, instead, the signal is essentially proportional to the absorption, and is zero when there is zero true absorption, even in the presence of reflection or scattering.|$|E

The range of material properties was given by an expert.The specific room understudy {{has a lot of}} fenestration, so it is not so surprising to see that the influence of the solar transmittance of the windows is the most influential of all material properties analyzed. The next influential factor is the conductivity of the bricks, followed by the thermal <b>absorptance</b> and the specific heat of the bricks.The most influential properties of the materials analyzed (bricks and glasses) are the solar transmittance of the glasses and the conductivity of the bricks.|$|E

30|$|Tandem {{solar cells}} {{consisting}} of amorphous and microcrystalline silicon junctions {{with the top}} junction nanopatterned as a two-dimensional photonic crystal are studied. Broadband light trapping, detailed electron/hole transport, and photocurrent matching modulation are considered. It is found that the <b>absorptances</b> of both junctions can be significantly increased by properly engineering the duty cycles and pitches of the photonic crystal; however, the photocurrent enhancement is always unevenly distributed in the junctions, leading to a relatively high photocurrent mismatch. Further considering an optimized intermediate layer and device resistances, the optimally matched photocurrent approximately 12.74  mA/cm 2 is achieved with a light-conversion efficiency predicted to be 12.67 %, exhibiting an enhancement of over 27.72 % compared to conventional planar configuration.|$|R
50|$|Excess {{waste heat}} created on the {{spacecraft}} is rejected to space {{by the use}} of radiators. Radiators come in several different forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted {{to the side of the}} spacecraft, and panels deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit. Whatever the configuration, all radiators reject heat by infrared (IR) radiation from their surfaces. The radiating power depends on the surface's emittance and temperature. The radiator must reject both the spacecraft waste heat and any radiant-heat loads from the environment. Most radiators are therefore given surface finishes with high IR emittance to maximize heat rejection and low solar <b>absorptance</b> to limit heat from the sun. Most spacecraft radiators reject between 100 and 350 W of internally generated electronics waste heat per square meter. Radiators weight typically varies from almost nothing, if an existing structural panel is used as a radiator, to around 12 kg/m2 for a heavy deployable radiator and its support structure.|$|E
5000|$|Kirchhoff's law {{of thermal}} {{radiation}} states that absorption equals emissivity opaque for every specific wavelength/frequency (materials often have quite different emissivities at different wavelengths). Therefore, if asphalt has an emissivity value of 0.90 {{at a specific}} wavelength (say wavelength of 10 micrometer, or room temperature thermal radiation), its thermal <b>absorptance</b> value would also be 0.90. This means that it absorbs and emits 90 percent of radiant thermal energy. As it is an opaque material, the remaining 10 percent must be reflected. Conversely, a low-e material such as aluminum foil has a thermal emissivity/absorptance value of 0.03 and as an opaque material the thermal reflectance value must be 1.0 - 0.03 =0.97, meaning it reflects 97 percent of radiant thermal energy. Low-emissivity building materials include window glass manufactured with metal-oxide coatings as well as housewrap materials, reflective thermal insulations {{and other forms of}} radiant thermal barriers. The thermal emissivity of various surfaces is listed in the following table.|$|E
30|$|The film {{deposited}} on plain glass showed poor <b>absorptance</b> of lower than 10 %, especially within a wavelength above 800  nm. In comparison, the <b>absorptance</b> of films {{deposited on}} patterned substrates enhances appreciably {{to more than}} 80 %. As {{the diameter of the}} nanopillar increases, the <b>absorptance</b> of the corresponding film rises within the whole wavelength range. The positive correlation between <b>absorptance</b> and diameter {{can be attributed to the}} increasing porosity of the nanostructure, which extensively lengthens the path of incident light and enhances the <b>absorptance</b> [8].|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>absorptance</b> {{is important for}} the analysis and modeling of laser-material interactions. Unfortunately, most of the <b>absorptance</b> data currently available consider only polished pure metals rather than the commercially available (unpolished, oxidized) alloys that are actually being processed in manufacturing. We present the results of <b>absorptance</b> measurements carried out at room temperature on as-received engineering grade nonferrous metals (Al, Cu, and Zn alloys). The measurements were made using an integrating sphere with a Nd:YLF laser at two wavelengths (1053 and 527 nm, which means that the results are also valid for Nd:YAG radiation at 1064 and 532 nm). The <b>absorptance</b> results obtained differ considerably from the existing data for polished, pure metals and should help improve the accuracy of laser-material interaction models. Some clear trends were identified. For all 22 cases studied the <b>absorptance</b> was higher than for ideal pure, polished metals. For all Al and Cu samples the <b>absorptance</b> was higher for the green than it was for the infrared wavelength, while for all Zn coatings this trend was reversed. No clear correlation between <b>absorptance</b> and surface roughness was found at low roughness values (Sa 0. 15 - 0. 60), but one rougher set of samples (Sa 2. 34) indicated a roughness-absorptance correlation at higher roughness levels.

It clearly shows that C-Si with etched black silicon arrays, compared to ordinary C-Si, remarkably enhances light <b>absorptance</b> throughout the wavelength range of 400 to 2500  nm. The sample etched for 60  min presents the highest <b>absorptance,</b> up to 95  % in the NIR range (800 to 2500  nm), and the average <b>absorptance</b> of this sample reaches 91  % in the wavelength range of 400 to 2500  nm. This high <b>absorptance</b> mainly comes from the multiple reflection of light among silicon nanocone arrays, increasing the light path and the capture ratio of photon. From the absorption spectra illustrated in Fig.  4 b, it can be easily found that the curves of samples with nanostructured networks show an obvious increase in the near-infrared band. This <b>absorptance</b> enhancement in the wavelength range of 400 to 2500  nm can be attributed to the increase in reflection times taken among the nanostructured silicon arrays.|$|E
