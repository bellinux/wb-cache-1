50|$|English {{beekeeping}} {{remained largely}} unchanged for centuries, {{until the late}} nineteenth century when moveable-frame hives were invented. By that time, the new hives and improved <b>artificial</b> <b>wax</b> foundations, new smokers, even new breeds of bees meant that the beekeepers of John Levett's day became the more dignified 'apiarists'. In today's world of collapsing bee populations, the Levett model of 'bee domination,' a mirror of its epoch of exploration and colonisation, seems particularly dated.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBeeswax is {{a mixture}} of many organic compounds, {{including}} hydrocarbons, wax esters, and fatty acids. Because fatty acids in beeswax also serve as social signals, we explored the functional significance of the fatty acids. The removal of the fatty acids from beeswax results in diminished yield stress, resilience, stiffness, and proportional limit stress of beeswax samples. Addition of stearic acid to beeswax enhances all of these properties except resilience. <b>Artificial</b> <b>wax</b> mixtures show a positive correlation between the amount of stearic acid in the wax mixture and yield stress. Unsaturated fatty acids found in beeswax behave similarly, with respect to their effects on the mechanical properties of <b>artificial</b> <b>wax</b> mixtures. Fatty acid concentration showed significant variation among colonies, particularly among the unsaturated fatty acids. We interpret these findings with respect to the mechanical properties of beeswax and the role of fatty acids in communication among bees...|$|E

40|$|The exposed gravel of the braided {{rivers of}} the eastern South Island of New Zealand provide nesting habitat for rare endemic bird species. These endemic bird species evolved {{in the absence of}} {{mammalian}} predators and it is suspected that predation by introduced predators is a major cause of species decline in braided rivers. Large scale monitoring of predation in braided rivers has mainly been confined to the Waitaki Basin, using video cameras. Further study of nest predation in braided rivers may require more economical monitoring techniques in order to cover more rivers and reduce the risk of financial loss through damaged or stolen equipment. Artificial eggs and nests have been widely used {{over the past two decades}} and have provided significant advances in nesting biology theory. However an increasing volume of research has shown that the results from artificial nests should be interpreted with caution as they may not sufficiently replicate the real nest situation. This study provided an initial assessment of the utility of <b>artificial</b> <b>wax</b> eggs as a device to measure interference and artificial nests as a presentation technique for the wax eggs. There are several areas that were tested. Initially aspects of design were considered, did the wax egg need tying down, how should the wax eggs be tied, what strength of monofilament is appropriate, is a lure (natural egg) required to entice interference with the wax egg? Following this cryptically painted wax eggs were tested to replace the dyed wax eggs that had been used previously. Once the wax egg was designed it was trialled in both real Banded Dotterel and artificial nests. Overall rates of predation were compared between real and artificial nests along with the patterns of predation with respect to wax egg colour and location. The difference in predator suite recorded at real and artificial nests is also discussed. This study found wax eggs were less likely to be lost if they were tied down. Failures of the tethers during Trial 2 were mitigated by increasing the breaking strain of the monofilament from 6. 8 kg to 22. 7 kg. Well-rooted vegetation (where available) was found to provide a more suitable anchor than rocks, although either were satisfactory. High rates of interference were observed on dyed wax, real quail and chicken eggs. It was decided that these rates of interference were too high to consider these egg types for use during the breeding season. Cryptically painted wax eggs were then trialled and found to not induce a strong response from the predators like that observed with the other egg types. During the 2005 breeding season wax eggs were accepted by the majority of incubating adults and were seldom left unmarked following a predation event. However, in most cases predation could only be assigned to a predator group (avian or mammalian) rather than species, as the marks often lacked any clear distinguishing patterns for individual species. Impressions were identified to species level on seven occasions, two Black-backed Gulls and five Hedgehogs. There was no significant difference between the overall predation rates observed at real and artificial nests. Artificial nests also showed similar effects of wax egg colour and location as real nests. However, there was a difference in the predator suite between real and artificial nests. The avian:mammal split for real nests was avian 17 (65 %) and mammal 9 (35 %) against the artificial nests 24 avian (96 %) and mammal 1 (4 %). These results highlight a problem with artificial nest experiments which is that although predation rates may be the same between real and artificial nests there may be a bias in predator type and that these biases may be counterbalancing. These results show further evidence that where possible artificial nest studies should be verified or calibrated with real nest data to assess there accuracy. The use of artificial nest should not be discounted because it has been shown to be inaccurate for some situations. For instance artificial nests may be appropriate where a species is highly endangered and therefore real nests simply are not available, or in situations where measuring of predator presence rather than effect on a target prey species is of primary interest...|$|E

40|$|An {{artificial}} substrate {{consisting of}} a wax-based medium amended with nutrients has been developed for the in vitro study of microbial interactions on the phylloplane. Inoculation of bacteria and yeasts onto the surface demonstrated that these micro-organisms remain viable for up to 13 days (e. g. Aureobasidium pullulans) and proliferate on the surface under conditions of low humidity. The growth rate was slower (doubling time 1. 2 days) than on nutrient agar or in nutrient broth. The <b>artificial</b> leaf <b>wax</b> substrate supported a lower bacterial population (10 (6) - 10 (7) c. f. u. plate(- 1)) than conventional nutrient substrates. Inoculation with Aureobasidium pullulans in high (10 (9) c. f. u. plate(- 1)) or low (10 (4) c. f. u. plate(- 1)) numbers indicated that the surface could support between 16 x 10 (4) - 16 x 10 (5) c. f. u. per cm(2). In the absence of incorporated nutrients, yeast numbers were found not to increase. Spore germination and mycelial elongation of filamentous fungi also occurred on the <b>artificial</b> leaf <b>wax</b> substrate but rates were reduced in comparison with those on nutrient agar.

40|$|Introduction. Complete denture {{reinforced}} with metal bases is fabricated {{in cases of}} fracture risk {{as well as in}} selected patients with neuromuscular disorders. The aim of this report was to present different designs of metal framework for complete denture and their advantages in the treatment of edentulous patients. Material and Methods. The study included 116 edentulous patients who received complete dentures. The respondents were divided into two groups according to the type of denture used. Thirty one patients were rehabilitated with complete dentures {{reinforced with}} metal base, whereas 85 patients received conventional complete acrylic dentures. Metal bases were fabricated using Co-Cr-Mo alloy. Two designs different in regards to the vibrating line were fabricated: metal frame extended to the vibrating line and acrylic resin extended to the vibrating line. After investing and casting, metal bases were electropolished. Subsequent processes of arranging <b>artificial</b> teeth, <b>waxing,</b> flasking and finishing completed the fabrication process of dentures. Results. Denture base fractures were prevented in majority of patients. The design of upper denture where metal frame was extended to the vibrating line and metal base with elongation over the convex edentulous ridge in lower jaw were the most favored and successful in prosthetic rehabilitation of experimental group of edentulous patients. There was no need for rebasing of complete dentures reinforced with metal base. Conclusion. Complete denture reinforced with metal base presents a favorable design for rehabilitation of edentulous patients with well pronounced edentulous ridges and low tendency to resorption...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Restoration by implant-supported {{prosthesis}} {{seems to}} be a current option in the treatment of partially edentulous patients. Its success depends on the passive fit of the framework. Searching for new manufacturing materials and techniques to solve these problems, dental companies, combining clinical and experimental research, offer different solutions, such as Nobel Biocare, the “all in one” system, which is a framework designed by CAD/CAM. AIM OF PRESENTATION: Clinical and radiographical assessment of the passive fit of the titanium framework computer designed for partially edentulous patients. The case presented is that of an adult patient, partially edentulous. The definite impression taking was carried out, using the IRStechnique (Implant Reposition Splint), to obtain the working cast. The dental laboratory performed the setting of <b>artificial</b> teeth in <b>wax</b> and acrylic framework. Placed inside the patient 2 ̆ 7 s mouth for verification, and computer scanned to digitize its design. After data processing, titanium milling was performed. The passive fit was checked clinically by the Sheffield test. Subsequently, radiographs were taken with the parallel technique to check the adjustment. Using the patient 2 ̆ 7 s subjective assessment any type of pain or symptoms indicating the existence of tension between the framework and implants is recorded. The procedure ended with the application of a ceramic coating of Triceram. CONCLUSION: Good results of such frameworks are predictable at functional level, but more investigations are necessary to ensure that their use is a guideline for building partial frameworks...|$|R
