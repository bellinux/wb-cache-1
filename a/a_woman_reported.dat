25|$|One {{theory was}} {{submitted}} that Princess Doe {{may have been}} a runaway and could have been an individual using false names while employed at a hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Six people have recently come forward with suspected identities of Princess Doe. In 2012, a sample of her hair and a tooth were examined through isotope analysis and indicated that the victim was most likely born in the United States. The sample of her hair indicated that she had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States. The tooth sample indicated she could possibly be from Arizona. It is also believed that the girl had spent {{a long period of time}} in Long Island, New York. After seeing images of the girl's clothing on a newspaper, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>reported</b> to officials that she remembered seeing a girl wearing the same clothing as Princess Doe on July 13, 1982, just two days before her body was found. The woman claimed that she was shopping with her daughter at a store across from the cemetery and observed the victim's unique clothing. The shirt and skirt themselves were traced to a manufacturer in the Midwestern United States, although the brand labels were missing. Three people reported that they bought similar clothes, after viewing photos, at a Long Island store, which is now closed. It is unknown if the store was specifically located in Long Island or possibly in other locations. The 2012 composite of the victim also generated new tips, as it resembled several missing girls from the country.|$|E

2500|$|The anti-sexual {{harassment}} initiative {{has also}} collaborated with popular public service companies, {{such as the}} transportation service Uber under the Safe Corporates projects. [...] This is an organization that targets medium to large companies to train and educate their employees {{to take action against}} unwanted sexual behavior. [...] All drivers will undergo training to ensure that the service will be safe for all women to use. [...] The program is aimed to ensure that drivers will be able to prevent, recognize and not initiate inappropriate behavior. [...] This training is especially significant to Uber, as the company has been involved in recent controversy with sexual harassment and even rape in France, China, Canada and India. [...] The service has been banned in Delhi after <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>reported</b> that she was raped by her Uber driver. [...] The training given to Uber is one of many Safe Corporates projects, all of which aim towards a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual harassment, as well as steps to eliminating an attitude of sexual harassment and violence as socially acceptable.|$|E

40|$|Small-vessel {{arteritis}} {{is associated}} with hypertension be-cause the commonest varieties, granulomatous vasculitis with polyangitis and microscopic polyangitis with antineutro-phil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, usually cause necrotizing glomerular disease.

Large-vessel vasculitis, such as giant cell arteritis, commonly coincides with hypertension.

By this account, sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism levelled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony. For example, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>reports</b> to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer, she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead. In response her friend says sarcastically, [...] "Oh, brilliant, what an ingenious idea, that's really going to cure you."

[...] Tatar notes that the princess's sensitivity has been interpreted as poor manners rather than a manifestation of noble birth, a view said to be based on [...] "the cultural association between women's physical sensitivity and emotional sensitivity, specifically, the link between <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>reporting</b> her physical experience of touch and negative images of women who are hypersensitive to physical conditions, who complain about trivialities, and who demand special treatment".|$|R
