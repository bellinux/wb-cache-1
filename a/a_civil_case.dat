5|$|He {{bought a}} 365-acre (148-hectare) 20-bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through {{a chain of}} firms, trusts, and {{offshore}} companies in 1994. The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly {{before the end of}} his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the beneficial owner. , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>case</b> continues.|$|E

5|$|The {{verdict was}} treated with scepticism by much of the {{international}} media and the U.S. government of President Jimmy Carter. On 2 February 1978, {{based on the evidence}} given at the inquest, {{the attorney general of the}} Eastern Cape stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>case</b> against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of R65,000 (US$78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the South African Medical and Dental Council initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of the medics were found guilty of improper conduct. The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited as an example of a repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death as evidence of the need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of his exile, Zardari had several {{different}} legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, {{he would have had to}} deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>case</b> against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion.
