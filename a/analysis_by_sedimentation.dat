40|$|The {{envelope}} protein of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 HIV- 1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi complex to produce subunits designated gp 120 and gp 41, which remain noncovalently associated. While gp 41 has a well-characterized oligomeric structure, the maintenance of gp 41 -independent gp 120 intersubunit contacts remains a contentious issue. Using recombinant vaccinia virus to achieve high-level expression of gp 120 in mammalian cells combined with gel filtration analysis, {{we were able to}} isolate a discrete oligomeric form of gp 120. Oligomerization of gp 120 occurred intracellularly between 30 and 120 min after synthesis. <b>Analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>sedimentation</b> equilibrium unequivocally identified the oligomeric species as a dimer. In order to identify the domains involved in the intersubunit contact, we expressed a series of gp 120 proteins lacking various domains and assessed the effects of mutation on oligomeric structure. Deletion of the V 1 or V 3 loops had little effect on the relative amounts of monomer and dimer in comparison to wild-type gp 120. In contrast, deletion of either {{all or part of the}} V 2 loop drastically reduced dimer formation, indicating that this domain is required for intersubunit contact formation. Consistent with this, the V 2 loop of the dimer was less accessible than that of the monomer to a specific monoclonal antibody.

The addition of increasing numbers of macrophages to the agar underlayer resulted in a progressive increase {{in the numbers of}} both CFU-E and BFU-E that proliferated in the presence of Ep. CFU-E, but not BFU-E, proliferated to form colonies in the absence Qf exogenously added Ep, and this proliferation was enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion by the presence of macrophages in the underlayer. The enhancing effects of a given number of macrophages and a given concentration of Ep were greater than the sum of the individual effects of macrophages and Ep alone. This erythropoietic syngerism was more evident with BFU-E because burst formation was not seen in the absence of exogenously added Ep. Macrophage underlayers stimulated three to five times the number of erythroid bursts seen with Ep alone. Cell-free agar underlayers or agar underlayers prepared with nonadherent peritoneal cells or unseparated cells from thymus, lymph node, or spleen failed to augment Ep- dependent erythroid colony formation. No enhancement of CFU-E or BFU-E was demonstrable after depletion ofadherent cells from peritoneal cell suspensions by passage over columns of Sephadex G- 10. <b>Analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>sedimentation</b> velocity of peritoneal cells confirmed that the cells responsible for elaborating the erythroid-enhancing activity were macrophages on the basis of morphologic, histochemical, and functional criteria. Serum- free media conditioned by macrophages in the absence of Ep contained the erythroid-enhancing activities, which indicated that Ep was not required for the elaboration of these diffusible substances.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 9924 - 9928]. To examine effects of these missense mutations onproperties of TNSALP, the TNSALP mutants were expressed ectopically inCOS- 1 cells. The wild-type TNSALP was synthesized as a 66 -kDa endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) -sensitive form, and processed to an 80 -kDa mature form, which is anchored to the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). Although the mutant proteins were found to be modified by GPI, digestion with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, cell-surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence observation demonstrated that the cell-surface appearance of TNSALP (R 54 C) and TNSALP (D 277 A) was either almost totally or partially retarded respectively. The 66 -kDa Endo H-sensitive band was the only form, and was rapidly degraded in the cells expressing TNSALP (R 54 C). In contrast with cells expressing TNSALP(R 54 C), where {{alkaline phosphatase}} activity was negligible, significant enzyme activity was detected and, furthermore, the 80 -kDa mature form appeared {{on the surface of the}} cells expressing TNSALP (D 277 A). <b>Analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>sedimentation</b> on sucrose gradients showed that a considerable fraction of newly synthesized TNSALP (R 54 C) and TNSALP(D 277 A) formed large aggregates, indicating improper folding and incorrect oligomerization of the mutant enzymes.

USA 90 : 3319 - 3323, 1993) {{have reported}} that human p 53 behaves as a larger molecule during gel filtration than it does during sucrose gradient sedimentation. These differences argue that wild-type p 53 has a nonglobular shape. To identify structural and oligomerization domains in p 53, we have investigated the physical properties of purified segments of p 53. The central, specific DNA-binding domain within murine amino acids 80 to 320 and human amino acids 83 to 323 behaves predominantly as monomers during <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>sedimentation,</b> gel filtration, and gel electrophoresis. This consistent behavior argues that the central region of p 53 is globular in shape. Under appropriate conditions, however, this segment can form transient oligomers without apparent preference for a single oligomeric structure. This region does not enhance transformation by other oncogenes. The biological implications of transient oligomerization by this central segment, therefore, remain to be demonstrated. Like wild-type p 53, the C terminus, consisting of murine amino acids 280 to 390 and human amino acids 283 to 393, behaves anomalously during gel filtration and apparently has a nonglobular shape. Within this region, murine amino acids 315 to 350 and human amino acids 323 to 355 are sufficient for assembly of stable tetramers. The finding that murine amino acids 315 to 360 enhance transformation by other oncogenes strongly supports the role of p 53 tetramerization in oncogenesis. Amino acids 330 to 390 of murine p 53 and amino acids 340 to 393 of human p 53, which have been implicated by Sturzbecher et al. in tetramerization (H. -W. Sturzbecher, R. Brain, C. Addison, K. Rudge, M. Remm, M. Grimaldi, E. Keenan, and J. R. Jenkins, Oncogene 7 : 1513 - 1523, 1992), do not form stable tetramers under our conditions. Our findings indicate that p 53 has at least two autonomous oligomerization domains: a strong tetramerization domain in its C-terminal region and a weaker oligomerization domain in the central DNA binding region of p 53. Together, these domains account {{for the formation of}} tetramers and multiples of tetramers by wild-type p 53.

O foco deste estudo é o resíduo de britagem (RB) do basalto, subproduto da indústria mineradora, gerado através do processo de cominuição das rochas para produção de agregados utilizados na construção civil. O interesse {{comercial}} por este material é muito inferior em relação aos agregados produzidos, o que justifica sua pequena demanda. Este trabalho tem como objetivo avaliar a interferência da adição de finos de basalto nas propriedades mecânicas do cimento Portland. O material utilizado neste estudo foi coletado junto à pedreira localizada na região metropolitana de Londrina  Paraná, sendo este, caracterizado por meio dos seguintes ensaios: granulometria à laser, massa específica, massa unitária, superfície específica, difração de Raios-X e Microscopia Eletrônica de Varredura (MEV). Foram analisadas pastas compostas por cimento Portland CP-V ARI e diferentes teores de RB. As propriedades mecânicas destas composições foram avaliadas por meio de corpos de prova cilíndricos de argamassa, segundo o traço unitário em massa 1 : 3, rompidos à compressão axial. Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que, em função das características físicas do RB, sua incorporação em substituição parcial ao cimento Portland trouxe ganhos na resistência mecânica da pasta para valores de 2, 5 % em relação ao cimento CP-V ARI de referência, bem como foi observada a ocorrência de pontos de nucleação na microestrutura da pasta. Esta pesquisa vem contribuir para a aplicação do RB como material alternativo incorporado ao cimento Portland, destacando sua aplicação na execução de bases de rodovias. To {{meet the}} demand of inputs for construction {{the increasing use of}} mineral additions has been much intensified, with much of it being composed of waste from mining industries, steel mills and power plants. Noteworthy are the uses of silica fume, fly ash, blast furnace slag and waste crushing (WC). The WC is a byproduct of the mining industry, generated through the process of crushing rocks for the production of aggregates used in construction. Currently, the use of this waste is quite restricted in the production of concrete, due to its characteristics. The commercial interest in this material is much lower compared to the aggregates produced, which justifies its small demand. Notably, the extraction process and basalt rock grinding generates a large volume of waste. It is believed that, depending on the physical characteristics of WC, its incorporation into the Portland cement can bring gains in strength and durability to the concrete. This study aims to evaluate the effect of adding fine basalt on the mechanical properties of Portland cement. For that, a bibliographic review was initially conducted to know the experiences in Brazil, involving testing and performance evaluation of the WC. The material used in this study comes from quarries located in the region of Londrina - Paraná, and was characterized by the following tests: granulometric <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>sedimentation</b> (laser), density, bulk density, specific surface area, X-Ray diffraction and electron microscopy (EM). We analyzed pastes composed of Portland cement CPV-ARI and different levels of WC. The mechanical properties of the pastes were evaluated using specimens of cylindrical mortar according to the mix-design mass 1 : 3, ruptured to axial compression. We studied the interference of these additions on the mechanical performance and morphology of these compositions, focusing on the incorporation of light strips and optical of eco efficiency. The study aims to indirectly reduce the rate of CO 2 emissions, due to the reduced consumption of Portland cement to the substitution proposed. The obtained results demonstrated that, on the basis of physical characteristics of RB, its incorporation in partial replacement to Portland cement brought gains in mechanical strength of the folder for values of 2. 5 % in relation to the cement CP-V reference, as was observed the occurrence of nucleation points on the microstructure of the folder.

Besides {{the evaluation of the}} shape factors, (9) a roughness factor R is defined. When the shape of granules is evaluated, there can be effects of both shape and surface roughness. The scale of scrutiny of the measurement determines whether or not a shape factor is affected by surface roughness. We chose to call a protrusion smaller than 60 mum a roughness, and a larger protrusion a shape effect. The best evaluation of granule shape is obtained when shape and roughness are described by different parameters. The aspect ratio, the mass shape factor, OPCS, e(R) and the radial shape factor could not significantly discriminate between some of the different shapes. The other three shape factors give distinct differences in value for all different shapes used in this study. Of these factors, Stokes' shape factor was rejected because of the high viscosity of the oil needed, which results in a significant temperature dependency. Circularity and the new projection shape factor both work very well for our granules. The combination of the roughness factor with the new projection shape factor will provide a good description of granule shape and roughness. Granule shapes were(C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Mapping of hypersensitive sites for micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion indicated that CENP-A nucleosomes were phased on the αI-type array {{as a result of}} interactions between CENP-B and CENP-B boxes, implying a repetitive configuration for the CENP-B/CENP-A nucleosome complex.
