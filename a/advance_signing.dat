5000|$|Driver confusion, due to left-turns {{being made}} from {{the right side of}} the roadway — an {{uncommon}} configuration outside of the northeastern United States. Expectancy issues may be compounded due to inconsistency between intersections, where some intersections may be jughandles and others may be standard intersections. These issues can be reduced through <b>advance</b> <b>signing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After hastily {{signing the}} Human League in 1978 it became {{apparent}} to Virgin Records that the band were not very profitable, with none of their releases under Fast Records making any impact on the charts. Virgin began putting pressure on the group to justify their large <b>advance</b> <b>signing</b> fee. Pressure was put on Ware, Oakey and Marsh to abandon their no traditional instruments rule and use conventional instruments {{in an attempt to}} be more commercial and sell more records. Ware reluctantly agreed but insisted that any material recorded this way should be released under a pseudonym to ensure that it wasnt confused with the pure electronic sound of The Human League. [...] "I Dont Depend on You" [...] was the only product of this compromise with Virgin. It was recorded with the addition of session musicians and was released under the name The Men. The song also features the synth riff from debut single Being Boiled {{towards the end of the}} track. Afterwards the band were able to record tracks in their original style for Virgin. Before any further conventional style records could be recorded, the original Human League had split; Oakey then took the new reformed band down a different commercial and pop route.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{describes the}} first phase of the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) fluorescent orange sign sheeting evaluation. The general goal of the evaluation was to develop a reasonable list of approved fluorescent orange sign sheeting products while ensuring the approved products will function adequately for the intended purpose. The evaluation used a human factors type test with an expert panel of test subjects. The evaluation resulted in the conditional approval of three fluorescent orange prismatic sign sheeting materials for use on rigid/semi-rigid substrate materials and four prismatic roll-up sign materials. The approval of the materials is conditional, pending a follow-up evaluation after one year of outdoor exposure. BACKGROUND A recent Arizona Transportation Research Center study (1) indicates that 3 % of all reported accidents occur in work zones. The study also indicates that work zone accidents on the Arizona state system are over-represented when compared to all accidents statewide. While this study did not recommend any specific counter measures related to the type of work zone signing, it is obvious that <b>advance</b> <b>signing</b> is the first line of defense for warning and directing traffic safely through the work zone. It is also widely held that conspicuity of the warning sign is an important factor in driver recognition of warning signs. Hummer and Scheffler (2) found fluorescent orange signs in work zone...|$|E

2500|$|A rather {{informal}} distinction {{among the}} directional signs {{is the one}} between <b>advance</b> directional <b>signs,</b> interchange directional signs, and reassurance <b>signs.</b> <b>Advance</b> directional <b>signs</b> appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction. A number of countries do not give information for the road ahead (so-called [...] "pull-through" [...] signs), and only for the directions left and right. <b>Advance</b> directional <b>signs</b> enable drivers to take precautions for the exit (e.g., switch lanes, double check whether this is the correct exit, slow down).|$|R

While each nation has its own system, the first approach sign for a motorway exit is mostly placed at least 1000 m from the actual interchange.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to determine if intersection behavior of those 18 to 24 and 65 + benefited from <b>advanced</b> in-vehicle <b>signs</b> presented in a head-up display (HUD) format. The University of Calgary Driving Simulator (UCDS) was used to determine whether intersection performance improved in the presence of several <b>advanced</b> <b>signs</b> or whether unwanted adaptive behaviors occurred (e. g., increasing speed to run the light instead of stopping). Invehicle signs facilitated an increase in stopping occurrences for both younger and older drivers at intersections with relatively short yellow onsets. In addition, eye movement analysis revealed significant age effects with regard to vertical and horizontal gaze variablity, with younger drivers showing increases in vertical gaze variability compared to the older drivers. Younger drivers also looked more often and had longer percentage of durations fixating on the HUD compared to the older drivers...|$|R

Summary of Background Data. The research literature concerning disc degeneration is particularly diverse, {{and there are no}} accepted definitions to guide biomedical research, or medicolegal practice. Definitions. The process of disc degeneration is an ab-errant, cell-mediated response to progressive structural fail-ure. A degenerate disc is one with structural failure com-bined with accelerated or <b>advanced</b> <b>signs</b> of aging. Early degenerative changes should refer to accelerated age-re-lated changes in a structurally intact disc. Degenerative disc disease should be applied to a degenerate disc that is also painful...|$|R
