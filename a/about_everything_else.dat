Because I needed something in the show that was meaningless, because there is always something in the dream that doesn't make any sense at all. In this case it was the Cheese Man. He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning. This to me means that we're being successful, because this means they're not worried <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> which means they sort of did understand most other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} [...] "B", however was less {{positive}} than other critics. While {{he stated that}} the musical numbers were [...] "among the best things the show has ever done", he felt that [...] "just <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> around them gets short shrift", criticizing the increase in performances on {{the first half of}} the season for upsetting the balance of the series. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8/10, observing that while he was in the minority of reviewers for not [...] "absolutely loving it", he found [...] "The Power of Madonna" [...] to be [...] "a bit messy in the writing department, even while it delivered several really great scenes and moments along the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Mercedes began a {{relationship}} with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace). He proposed marriage to her, but she refused. Mercedes has sex with a stranger; Metcalfe remarked, [...] "Sex usually makes her forget <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> that's going on. But afterwards she still can't stop thinking about Malachy, so she decides {{to go and see}} him to work out how she feels". Mercedes subsequently accepted Malachy's proposal and they marry. Mercedes found that she did not contract HIV from Malachy, but a Hollyoaks source described the news as [...] "bitter sweet" [...] because it was possible that her husband could die and leave her on her own. The source expanded on this, saying that if Mercedes had contracted HIV then the pair [...] "would be going through everything together".|$|E
500|$|In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a [...] "clothing-optional" [...] {{campground}} in Sherman, New York, {{attended by}} about 400members. The event was ostensibly intended {{to celebrate the}} coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at that time, Stang speculated that they might arrive in 8661, an inversion of 1998; this has been interpreted as a satire {{of the way that}} religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures. Some critics have dismissed the event as a prank or form of [...] "performance art". Steve Bevilacqua, the Church's business manager, admitted that his group made strange predictions about aliens, but contended that their statements were as believable as the account of Jesus' walk on water. Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they have lied <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else),</b> so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5 after 1998. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated. Cusack casts the productions as carnivalesque or an echo of ancient Greek satyr plays.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was moderately positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of Scully's portrayal, noting [...] "Really, this works best as a Scully episode. I prefer Darin Morgan's {{version of the}} character , but I doubt that version could support a full episode about God {{in the same way}} that this more searching, and lost, Scully does." [...] However, Handlen was critical of some of the religious aspects of the episode, noting that [...] "If there's a Christian God in the X-Files universe, doesn't that trump just <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> that Mulder and Scully have spent their time on?... There are too many implications here for the show to support, and while it doesn't destroy the episode, it does make it difficult for me to back it as fully as I'd like to." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode highlights Scully and her faith, and in the process, manages to presage many of the future plot developments for the series and her character. The spiritual war at the foundation of the series mythology is reflected in a situation that speaks directly to Scully and her upbringing, and though some of the religious metaphors are heavy-handed, it works well enough." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of the episode's [...] "inventiveness," [...] which [...] "derives from its choice of the most mainstream paranormality of all—Christianity." [...] The review also wrote positively of the Mulder-Scully role reversal, calling the change [...] "always welcome". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She noted that [...] "Scully's search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama, and Gillian Anderson is up to the challenge." [...] Vitaris, however, criticized elements of the plot, most notably the [...] "un-saintly" [...] quality of Kevin and Kevin's lack of emotion after his mother is killed. Furthermore, she called the ending [...] "a real mess". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, and called it a [...] "peculiarly bloodless episode". The two wrote that many of the traits possessed by Kevin were only helpful in certain isolated scenes, such as the ability to bilocate. Shearman and Pearson concluded that the show should [...] "take a serious subject by all means, but then take the subject seriously." ...|$|E

2500|$|Time is {{allocated}} for {{discussion of the}} annual budget after it is tabled by the Minister of Finance; however, most MPs spend {{much of the time}} questioning the government on other issues. Shad contends that although about 20 days are given for discussion of the budget, [...] "the budget debate is used to hit the government on the head <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> other than the budget. From potholes to education policy to illegal immigrants." [...] If Parliament votes to reject the budget, it is taken as a vote of no-confidence, forcing the government out of office. The government will then either have to reform itself with a new cabinet and possibly new Prime Minister, or call for a general election. As a result, Shad states that [...] "MPs may criticize, they may have their say but the government will have its way" [...] {{when it comes to the}} budget.|$|E

The Los Angeles Times declared it [...] "A furtive step on Presley's part in a screen career".

40|$|The 25 {{years of}} the post-Mao era of Chinese fiction {{is divided into two}} {{distinct}} stages: the pre- 1989 period, and the post- 1989 period. If this division is true <b>about</b> almost <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in China, it is especially true with literature. This is because literature had been used as a lethal weapon for political struggle by Mao before and during his regime, and this tradition, though strongly challenged in the post-Mao era, still lingers, though in very different forms now and much watered down. Even the recent trends of art for art s sake, or for the sake of entertainment, or for the sake of religious consciousness, could also be read as political gestures, and are indeed treated as such by Chinese literary officialdom, and also by Western China experts. Despite the fact that Chinese fiction has been highly politicized, this paper will examine, as much as possible, the development of fiction as an art. Only the artistic quality can support my argument that recent novels from China deserve not only more scholarly attention but also more reader appreciation than they have hitherto received around the world. ...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{established}} way to measure expenditure {{in the context of}} a general purpose survey. Therefore NatCen's Questionnaire Development Testing (QDT) Hub, working in collaboration with the Institute for Fiscal Studies and collaborators from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, are looking at how best to measure expenditure in a social survey context. This report provides findings from the cognitive testing of four different question formats: 1. A 'one-shot' question i. e. a single question asking 'How much did you spend on everything in the last month?' 2. A 'two-part' question i. e. two questions, one that asks about spending on essentials and one that asks <b>about</b> spending on <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> 3. A 'breakdown' question i. e. that asks respondents to say how much they spend on each item on a list of common types of expenditure 4. And 'income minus surplus' question that asks respondents to work out how much money they receive per month and how much of that income remains unspent. It is possible that spending can be calculated from this information. This project is funded by the Nuffield Foundation...|$|R
