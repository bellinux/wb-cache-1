5|$|Throughout {{the modern}} period the {{situation}} of indigenous languages has grown increasingly precarious in Mexico, and the numbers of speakers of virtually all indigenous languages have dwindled. Although the absolute number of Nahuatl speakers has actually risen over the past century, indigenous populations have become increasingly marginalized in Mexican society. In 1895, Nahuatl was spoken by over 5% of the population. By 2000, this proportion had fallen to 1.49%. Given the process of marginalization combined with the trend of migration to urban areas and to the United States, some linguists <b>are</b> <b>warning</b> of impending language death. At present Nahuatl is mostly spoken in rural areas by an impoverished class of indigenous subsistence agriculturists. According to the Mexican national statistics institute, INEGI, 51% of Nahuatl speakers {{are involved in the}} farming sector and 6 in 10 receive no wages or less than the minimum wage.|$|E

The trail leads hikers along a 1.7-mile hike with beautiful views of five cascades of Crabtree Falls. The land formerly in private ownership prior to the late 1970s is in the George Washington National Forest.

2500|$|Finally {{on demand}} of Meinhof's {{attorney}} Klaus Croissant and the International Committee for Political Prisoners, an international investigation commission {{was created in}} order to examine the conditions surrounding Meinhof's death. Once more the German authorities refused to give the complete (first) autopsy report to the commission, hindering their investigation. In 1978 the committee published its report, concluding that: [...] "The formal claim that Ulrike Meinhof committed suicide by hanging is unfounded, {{given the fact that the}} investigation results reasonably converge to the conclusion that she could not hang herself. Most probably Ulrike Meinhof was already dead before she was hanged and there <b>are</b> <b>warning</b> signs indicating the involvement of a third party regarding her death." ...|$|E

[...] "We <b>are</b> <b>warning</b> {{people not to}} buy tickets that are not yet on sale because {{it is unlikely that}} they will receive those tickets", announced the organization's chief, Graham Burns. He concluded, [...] "It's impossible when the dates haven't been announced to be selling tickets for something when there are no announced dates". Jackson's official website allowed fans to register early for a [...] "pre-sale" [...] draw. Some fans had difficulty applying, as the website could not deal with the large number of registrations—reportedly up to 16,000 applications a second. In the space of 24 hours, nearly a million people from around the world registered for pre-sale tickets, enough to fill the venue 50 times over. Tickets that had not even been printed were selling on auction website eBay for £300. Sales of Jackson's albums increased following the press conference. Overnight, sales of Off the Wall rose 200%, Bad rose 110%, Dangerous rose 165% and Thriller 25 rose 155%.|$|E

2500|$|Binge {{drinking}} is considered harmful, regardless of a person's age, {{and there have}} been calls for healthcare professionals to give increased attention to their patients drinking habits, especially binge drinking. Some researchers believe that raising the legal drinking age and screening brief interventions by healthcare providers are the most effective means of reducing morbidity and mortality rates associated with binge drinking. Programs in the United States have thought of numerous ways to help prevent binge drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests increasing the cost of alcohol or the excise taxes, restricting the number of stores who may obtain a license to sell liquor (reducing [...] "outlet density"), and implementing stricter law enforcement of underage drinking laws. [...] There are also a number of individual counseling approaches, such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral approaches, that have been shown to reduce drinking among heavy drinking college students. In 2006, the Wisconsin Initiative to Promote Healthy Lifestyles implemented a program that helps primary care physicians identify and address binge drinking problems in patients. In August 2008, a group of college presidents calling itself the Amethyst Initiative asserted that lowering the legal drinking age to 18 (presumably) was one way to curb the [...] "culture of dangerous binge drinking" [...] among college students. This idea is currently the subject of controversy. [...] Proponents argue that the 21 law forces drinking underground and makes it more dangerous than it has to be, while opponents have claimed that lowering the age would only make the situation worse.

5000|$|Prewarnings <b>are</b> <b>warnings</b> {{given to}} {{individuals}} after an event but before social interaction (when misinformation can <b>be</b> introduced). These <b>warnings</b> <b>are</b> meant to guard an individual against potential memory conformity. They can <b>be</b> <b>warnings</b> against {{the credibility of}} a witness or any other attempts to encourage the individual trust internal sources and resist external conformity. [...] For many lab experiments, these prewarnings have consistently been effective in decreasing memory conformity. [...] Some prewarnings can work paradoxically to increase memory conformity by overly sensitizing the initial viewer, who then mistakenly incorporates incorrect post-event information into their initial memory.|$|R
