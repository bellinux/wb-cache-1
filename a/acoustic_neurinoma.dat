40|$|CSF {{rhinorrhea}} is {{a common}} complication of <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma</b> surgery via the suboccipital route. In this paper we present our incidence of CSF rhinorrhea and our surgical techniques for {{reducing the risk of}} this post-surgical complication. Following removal of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma,</b> the drilled posterior wall of the internal auditory canal is covered with bonewax, muscle or fat pieces, and fibrin-glue, while the previously reflected dura is sutured in place keeping the packing material in position. Bone chips removed during the craniectomy are then mixed with fibric glue and are used for a cranioplasty. Although we routinely perform aggressive drilling of internal auditory canal to facilitate total removal of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma,</b> only 1 out of 94 consecutive cases (1 %) showed postoperative CSF rhinorrhea. Since previous reports mention the rate of this complication following <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma</b> surgery varies between 4 % and 27 %, we believe that our methods may be useful in helping reduce the incidence of postoperative rhinorrhea...|$|E

None of the patients had signs or symptoms of central nervous system dysfunction. INTERVENTION: Posturographic tests comparing patients with and without a semirigid neck collar.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Posturography measuring velocity and variance of quiet stance and measuring body sway induced by vibration at 60, 80, and 100 Hz to the calf muscles. Tests were conducted with eyes open and closed. RESULTS: In tests with vibration at 100 Hz to the calf muscles and with eyes open, body sway velocity was significantly higher when patients were wearing a neck collar. No {{significant difference was found}} in any other test. CONCLUSION: Restricting head-neck movements with a neck collar does not improve postural stability in patients with compensated unilateral total vestibular loss.

All the <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinoma</b> samples {{used in the present}} study showed a similar ganglioside profile on TLC (thin-layer chromatography). For the microscale ganglioside analysis, a newly developed TLC blotting/secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) system together with TLC immunostaining method was employed.

Loss of part or all of chromosome 22 is frequently found in acoustic schwannomas, suggesting that the NF 2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene involved in the genesis of these tumors. Only a few spinal schwannomas have been molecularly characterized so far, showing that chromosome 22 loss might also occur in these tumors. Here we present the molecular analysis of chromosome 22 in 23 acoustic schwannomas and nine schwannomas of other locations (including other cranial nerves and spinal and {{peripheral nerve}}s). Most of these tumors were from sporadic cases. Multiple schwannomas of various locations were analyzed in two patients with NF 2.

The tumors with partial monosomy included four with terminal deletions and one with a deletion of the centromeric part of the long arm of chromosome 22. The region between the beta B 2 - 1 crystallin locus (CRYB 2 A) and the myoglobin locus (MB) was commonly deleted in these tumors. Our studies suggest that a schwannoma-related tumor suppressor gene within this region, which might be the NF 2 gene, is involved in the development of schwannomas of various locations in the nervous system.

50|$|They {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} stereotactic high-energy proton irradiation in goats {{resulting in a}} seminal publication in Nature in 1958. This technique was also applied in a few patients with Parkinson's disease (pallidotomy), psychiatric disorder (capsulotomy) and pain (mesencephalotomy). Although precisely placed and well-limited lesions could be produced by the focused proton beams, as demonstrated in a few autopsy cases, the synchrocyclotron proved to be too complicated for general clinical use. This compelled Leksell to consider other radiation sources and he started designing the cobalt-60 gamma unit, which was fully integrated with the stereotactic system. The development of the ‘‘beam-knife’’ took place after Leksell had been appointed successor to Olivecrona in 1960 and the first unit was inaugurated in 1967. Later the same year reports of the two first cases, patients with cancer related pain subjected to radiosurgical thalamotomy, were published. Originally, radiosurgery and the gamma unit were developed {{with the hope that}} it would offer a bloodless, and less risky, method to be applied principally in functional neurosurgery, for example in thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, Leksell had always considered his sterotactic instrument a surgical tool that should also be utilized in general neurosurgery in order to enhance precision and minimize hazards. This idea had to some extent been realized by the extensive use of stereotactic technique in puncturing cysts and also in performing biopsies in critical regions. The gamma unit soon proved to be useful in the treatment of some diseases previously requiring neurosurgery, such as pituitary adenomas, <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurinomas</b> and arteriovenous malformations.
