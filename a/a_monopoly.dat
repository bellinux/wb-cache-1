40|$|In {{this paper}} we study how {{privatization}} and deregulation of production of intermediate goods influence capital accumulation. Our model is solved under three alternative scenarios: {{one where the}} intermediate sector is composed of <b>a</b> public <b>monopoly</b> under government control, one where the intermediate sector is dominated by <b>a</b> private <b>monopoly,</b> and one with a competitive intermediate sector. The comparison of these models suggests that the income benefits of state-to-market transitions are mostly due to increased competition on the deregulated market and that the privatization of state enterprises {{is not likely to}} generate significant changes in the economy when the public monopoly is replaced by <b>a</b> private <b>monopoly.</b> In fact, the model predicts that for high enough levels of public investment, <b>a</b> public <b>monopoly</b> would be preferred to <b>a</b> private <b>monopoly</b> in terms of the resulting aggregate income level. We find that elimination of monopoly rights can increase aggregate income by more than 20 %...|$|R

5|$|In 1942, Himmler {{consolidated}} all of {{the offices}} for which Pohl was responsible into one, creating the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt; WVHA). The entire concentration camp system was placed {{under the authority of}} the WVHA. The SS owned Sudetenquell GbmH, a mineral water producer in Sudetenland. By 1944, the SS had purchased 75 percent of the mineral water producers in Germany and were intending to acquire <b>a</b> <b>monopoly.</b> Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone, bricks, and cement for the SS-owned Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke (German Earth And Stone Works; DEST). In the occupied Eastern territories, the SS acquired <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> in brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks. The DWB also founded the Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke (East German Building Supply Works; GmbH or ODBS) and Deutsche Edelmöbel GmbH (German Noble Furniture). These operated in factories the SS had confiscated from Jews and Poles.|$|E

40|$|We {{analytically}} {{characterize the}} effects of ownership and competition {{in the health care}} industry on quality provision, market coverage and optimal co-payment policy. <b>A</b> private <b>monopoly</b> selects <b>a</b> lower quality than a public supplier, and the socially optimal co-payment rate with <b>a</b> private <b>monopoly</b> exceeds that with <b>a</b> public <b>monopoly.</b> We establish that the optimal co-payment policy is invariant to the introduction of private competition. Thus, market coverage is invariant to the introduction of competition, whereas all consumers with a higher willingness to pay for quality are better off with competition...|$|R

At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since {{that would allow them to}} cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens SAFE had <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> on the routes Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> on the routes Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss.

5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International.
