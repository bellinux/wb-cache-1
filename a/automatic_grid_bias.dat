40|$|Image and {{statistical}} analysis are two important stages of cDNA microarrays. Of these, gridding {{is necessary to}} accurately identify the location of each spot while extracting spot intensities from the microarray images, and automating this procedure permits high-throughput analysis. Due to the deficiencies of the equipment used to print the arrays, rotations, misalignments, high contaminations with noise and artifacts, and the enormous amount of data generated, solving the gridding problem {{by means of an}} automatic system is not trivial. Existing techniques to solve the <b>automatic</b> <b>grid</b> segmentation problem cover only limited aspects of this challenging problem and require the user to specify the size of the spots, the number of rows and columns in the grid, and boundary conditions.

40|$|Electronegative ion {{thrusters}} are {{a variation}} of traditional gridded ion thruster technology differentiated by the production and acceleration of {{both positive and negative}} ions. Benefits of electronegative ion thrusters include the elimination of lifetime-limiting cathodes from the thruster architecture and the ability to generate appreciable thrust from both charge species. While much {{progress has been made in}} the development of electronegative ion thruster technology, direct thrust measurements are required to unambiguously demonstrate the efficacy of the concept and support continued development. In the present work, direct thrust measurements of the thrust produced by the MINT (Marshall's Ion-ioN Thruster) are performed using an inverted-pendulum thrust stand in the High-Power Electric Propulsion Laboratory's Vacuum Test Facility- 1 at the Georgia Institute of Technology with operating pressures ranging from 4. 8 x 10 (exp - 5) and 5. 7 x 10 (exp - 5) torr. Thrust is recorded while operating with a propellant volumetric mixture ratio of 5 : 1 argon to nitrogen with total volumetric flow rates of 6, 12, and 24 sccm (0. 17, 0. 34, and 0. 68 mg/s). Plasma is generated using a helical antenna at 13. 56 MHz and radio frequency (RF) power levels of 150 and 350 W. The acceleration grid assembly is operated using both sinusoidal and square waveform biases of +/- 350 V at frequencies of 4, 10, 25, 125, and 225 kHz. Thrust is recorded for two separate thruster configurations: with and without the magnetic filter. No thrust is discernable during thruster operation without the magnetic filter for any volumetric flow rate, RF forward Power level, or acceleration <b>grid</b> <b>biasing</b> scheme. For the full thruster configuration, with the magnetic filter installed, a brief burst of thrust of approximately 3. 75 mN +/- 3 mN of error is observed at the start of grid operation for a volumetric flow rate of 24 sccm at 350 W RF power using a sinusoidal waveform <b>grid</b> <b>bias</b> at 125 kHz and +/- 350 V. Similar bursts in thrust are observed using a square waveform <b>grid</b> <b>bias</b> at 10 kHz and +/- 350 V for volumetric flow rates of 6, 10, and 12 sccm at 150, 350, and 350 W respectively.
