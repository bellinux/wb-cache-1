5|$|Freddy vs. Jason (2003) is a {{crossover}} film {{in which}} Jason battles A Nightmare on Elm Street's villain Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a supernatural killer who murders {{people in their}} dreams. Krueger has grown weak, <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> his home town of Springwood have suppressed their fear of him. Freddy, who is impersonating Jason's mother (Paula Shaw), resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) from Hell and sends him to Springwood to cause panic and fear. Jason accomplishes this, but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues in both the dream world and Crystal Lake. The identity of the winner is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the population in the USSR owned cars. Because of the widespread lack of any mode of private transport, most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport. Due to a relative shortage of cars and good-quality roads, the Soviet people travelled twice as much by bus, train and rapid transit <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the First World. Soviet bus-transport, throughout most {{of the history of the}} Soviet Union, was controlled either by the regional or the republican branches of the Ministry of Transport. Since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel, Soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity-driven, rather than fuel-consuming transport. In the mid-1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed-gas energy for buses. By 1988 only 1.2 percent of buses used gas energy, while 30 percent used diesel. Soviet bus-enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Rats in New York City are prevalent, {{as in many}} densely {{populated}} areas. For a long time, the number of rats in New York City was unknown, and a common urban legend {{was that there were}} up to five times as many rats <b>as</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> 2014, however, scientists more accurately measured the entire city's rat population to be approximately only 20% of the number of humans; i.e., there were approximately 2 million rats to New York's 8.4 million people {{at the time of the}} study.|$|E
25|$|Toys {{became more}} {{widespread}} {{with the changing}} attitudes towards children engendered by the Enlightenment. Children began to be seen <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> and of themselves, as opposed to extensions of their household {{and that they had}} a right to flourish and enjoy their childhood. The variety and number of toys that were manufactured during the 18th century steadily rose; John Spilsbury invented the first jigsaw puzzle in 1767 to help children learn geography. He created puzzles on eight themes – the World, Europe, Asia, Africa, America, England and Wales, Ireland and Scotland. The rocking horse (on bow rockers) was developed {{at the same time in}} England, especially with the wealthy as it was thought to develop children's balance for riding real horses.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the reason}} why {{injuries}} effect an athlete so much, as if any normal person got an injury they could just work around it, but for an athlete, this causes them to be separated from their sport and could mean a loss of identity is established. Normal, everyday people have skills in all aspects of their life, and have support all around them in everything they do; and as athletes are so focused on their sports, when they break out into everyday life {{they are less likely to}} achieve their further meaning in life relating to their career and future life options due to their inability to develop themselves <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> their early lives.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June 1906 the Police Chief of Białystok, Derkacz, was murdered, {{most likely}} on {{the orders of}} the Russian commissar and fervent anti-semite Szeremietiev. Derkacz, who was Polish, {{was known for his}} liberal sympathies and {{opposition}} to anti-semitism; for this he was respected by both the Jewish Bund and the Polish Socialist Party. On a previous occasion, when Russian soldiers attacked Jews in the marketplace, Derkacz had sent in his policemen to put down the violence and had declared that a pogrom against the Jews would occur “only over his dead body”. His murder was a foreboding of the violence to come, <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the city noted that after Derkacz’s death Russian soldiers began preparing for a pogrom.|$|E
25|$|Melton {{challenges}} {{the validity of}} many anti-NRM sources and testimonies of former members (which {{he refers to as}} apostates) critical of their previous groups. While testifying as an expert witness in a lawsuit, Melton asserted that when investigating groups, one should not rely solely upon the unverified testimony of ex-members, and that hostile ex-members would invariably shade the truth and blow out of proportion minor incidents turning them into major incidents. Melton also follows the argumentation of Lewis Carter and David Bromley and claims {{that as a result of}} their study, the treatment (coerced or voluntary) of former members <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> need of psychological assistance largely ceased and that an (alleged) lack of widespread need for psychological help by former members of new religions would in itself be the strongest evidence refuting early sweeping condemnations of new religions as causes of psychological trauma. This view is shared by several religious scholars, and contested by others (see also “Criticism”).|$|E

25|$|Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was {{established}} on 14 December 1950. It protects and supports refugees {{at the request}} of a government or the United Nations and assists in providing durable solutions, such as return or resettlement. All refugees in the world are under UNHCR mandate except Palestinian refugees, who fled the current state of Israel between 1947 and 1949, {{as a result of the}} 1948 Palestine War. These refugees are assisted by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). However, Palestinian Arabs who fled the West Bank and Gaza after 1949 (for example, during the 1967 Six Day war) are under the jurisdiction of the UNHCR. Moreover, the UNHCR also provides protection and assistance to other categories of displaced persons: asylum seekers, refugees who returned home voluntarily but still need help rebuilding their lives, local civilian communities directly affected by large refugee movements, stateless people and so-called internally displaced people (IDPs), as well <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> refugee-like and IDP-like situations.|$|E

500|$|After Mitchell {{declared}} for the 2001 NFL Draft, one NFL scout {{told the}} Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in February, [...] "I don't think he's as fast <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the press {{try to say}} he is. He's absolutely fearless over the middle but he prefers to trap the ball instead of to extend for it. I don't think he has nearly the explosion {{to be considered a}} first." [...] Mitchell was also criticized by scouts for his small frame and potential character issues. Draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. rated Mitchell as the 16th-best prospect in the draft following the NFL Scouting Combine in which he ran a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, and called him a player on the rise. Kiper also rated him as the fifth-best wide receiver in the draft and projected Mitchell to be drafted in the mid-first round following his performance at the Combine. In rating players several times leading up to the draft, Kiper re-watched game film of each player and adjusted their rankings accordingly. In his March 5 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the tenth overall selection. He ranked Mitchell as the 18th-best player in the draft on March 30. NFLDraftScout.com projected Mitchell to be drafted in the second round and rated him as the eighth-best wide receiver in the draft. Kiper ranked him the fourth-best wide receiver in the draft on April 2. In his April 10 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Denver Broncos with the 24th overall selection. Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ranked Mitchell as the sixth-best wide receiver in the draft. Mitchell hired Tom Condon of IMG Football as his agent leading up to the draft.|$|E
