40|$|Abstract. The quantum {{model of}} a cluster, {{consisting}} of <b>A</b> <b>identical</b> particles, coupled by the internal pair interactions and affected by the external field of a target, is considered. A symbolic-numerical algorithm for generating A− 1 -dimensional oscillator eigenfunctions, symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to permutations of <b>A</b> <b>identical</b> particles in the new symmetrized coordinates, is formulated and implemented using the MAPLE computer algebra system. Examples of generating the sym-metrized coordinate representation for A− 1 dimensional oscillator func-tions in one-dimensional Euclidean space are analyzed. The approach is aimed at solving the problem of tunnelling the clusters, consisting of sev-eral identical particles, through repulsive potential barriers of a target. 6. ...|$|R
