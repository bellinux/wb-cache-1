5|$|On October 7, 1923, {{the first}} section of the trail, from Bear Mountain west through Harriman State Park to Arden, New York, was opened. MacKaye then called for a two-day <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> conference to be held in March 1925 in Washington, D.C. This meeting {{inspired}} the formation of the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> Conference (now called the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> Conservancy) (ATC).|$|E
5|$|The AMC {{maintains}} the AT from the New Hampshire border to Grafton Notch, with the Maine <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> Club responsible {{for maintaining the}} remaining miles to Mt. Katahdin. The international extension, called the International <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> begins at Mt. Katahdin.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Appalachian</b> Trail/Mountains-to-Sea <b>Trail</b> junction, path to Clingmans Dome Road (just east {{of trail}} terminus) ...|$|R
25|$|A grade {{crossing}} with a flashing overhead warning beacon was replaced in 2000 by a grade-separated exit, making the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail's</b> crossing here less hazardous. The Taconic levels {{off into a}} narrow section bearing due northeast along Hosner Mountain's steep west slope, with stone walls on either side. This ends after a mile with the Interstate84 (I-84) interchange, the only full cloverleaf along the Taconic.|$|R
50|$|The camps {{were opened}} in 1874, {{bordering}} the West Branch of the Pleasant River in northern Maine in the United States. They included a main lodge and 13 cabins {{as well as}} satellite camps for housing loggers. The camps are a 2.2 mile hike from Gulf Hagas and a 5.2 mile hike from the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail's</b> famed 100-Mile Wilderness. They are located approximately 20 mi east of Greenville and 30 mi northwest of Brownville.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> {{is home to}} {{thousands}} of species of plants and animals, including 2,000 rare, threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant and animal species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> the Continental Divide Trail, and the Pacific Crest Trail form what {{is known}} as the Triple Crown of Hiking in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{trail is}} {{currently}} protected along more than 99% of its course by {{federal or state}} ownership of the land or by right-of-way. The trail is maintained {{by a variety of}} citizen organizations, environmental advocacy groups, governmental agencies and individuals. Annually, more than 4,000 volunteers contribute over 175,000 hours of effort on the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> an effort coordinated largely by the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> Conservancy (ATC) organization. In total, the AT passes through eight national forests and two national parks.|$|E
50|$|Across {{the county}} line in Mount Holly, VT 103 passes {{within a few}} miles of the Crowley Cheese factory as it heads into the Shrewsbury village of Cuttingsville with even more {{variations}} in road quality. Outside Cuttingsville, it proceeds through Clarendon, where it crosses over the conjoined Long and <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trails</b> and intersects Airport and East Clarendon Roads, two local roadways leading, respectively, to the Kingsley and Brown Covered Bridges. Shortly after the junction with East Clarendon Road, VT 103 intersects VT 7B, the former routing of U.S. Route 7, before terminating at modern US 7 adjacent to the Rutland Airport, just south of Rutland.|$|R
50|$|The road intersects with Island Pond Road, a dirt path in Harriman, as it heads {{along the}} border. Arden Valley Road intersects with Crooked Road thereafter. Harris Mine is {{visible to the}} left as the road {{proceeds}} {{around the base of}} Echo Mountain. To the southeast of Lindley Mountain, Arden Valley Road turns east and into the park. Arden Valley Road passes Lake Cohasset and Upper Lake Cohasset as it heads eastward. The road intersects with the Long Path and Ramapo - Dunderberg - <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trails</b> soon afterward. Bradley Mine is visible to the left, and Arden Valley Road comes to an end at Tiorati Circle., where the road continues eastward as Tiorati Brook Road.|$|R
50|$|Black Mountain can {{be reached}} via the <b>Appalachian</b> Approach <b>Trail.</b> It is a 5.5 mi hike north from Amicalola Falls State Park, a 0.6 mi hike north from Nimblewill Gap, and a 2.3 mi hike south from Springer Mountain on the trail.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> is {{relatively}} safe. Most injuries or incidents {{are consistent with}} comparable outdoor activities. Most hazards are related to weather conditions, human error, plants, animals, diseases, and hostile humans encountered along the trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> {{came about}} in 1921. The trail itself was {{completed}} in 1937 {{after more than a}} decade of work, although improvements and changes continue. It is maintained by 31 trail clubs and multiple partnerships, and managed by the National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> Conservancy. The majority of the trail is in forest or wild lands, although some portions traverse towns, roads and farms. It passes through 14 states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.|$|E
5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided {{bend in the}} road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes in from the west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> crosses the road next to the line's <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
50|$|The nearest {{shelter from}} the summit is the Springer Mountain Shelter, located about 0.2 mi north of the summit. A water spring located near this shelter. Another nearby shelter is the Black Gap Shelter, located about 1.5 mi south of the summit on the <b>Appalachian</b> Approach <b>Trail.</b>|$|R
25|$|Areas in Vermont {{administered}} by the National Park Service include the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park (in Woodstock) and the <b>Appalachian</b> National Scenic <b>Trail.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mount Everett at 2,602 ft - or 793.1 m - is {{the highest}} peak in the south Taconic Mountains of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York. The {{mountain}} {{is known for its}} expansive views of the southern Taconics and Berkshires; for its old growth pitch pine and scrub oak; for the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail's</b> north-south traverse of its shoulders and summit grounds, and for its rare plant and animal communities. The mountain is named after a 19th-century governor of Massachusetts, Edward Everett. The name was proposed in 1841 by Edward Hitchcock, geologist to the state, in his [...] "Final Report on the Geology of Massachusetts." [...] Hitchcock wrote {{that at the time of}} his proposal, the mountain was known as Bald Mountain or Ball Mountain. Some old maps at the Sheffield Historical Society also label the mountain as [...] "The Dome".|$|R
5|$|An {{extension}} {{known as}} the International <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> continues northeast, crossing Maine and cutting through Canada to Newfoundland, with sections continuing in Greenland, through Europe, and into Morocco. Other separate extensions continue {{the southern end of}} the Appalachian range in Alabama and continue south into Florida, creating what is {{known as the}} Eastern Continental Trail.|$|E
5|$|Long-distance {{hiking trails}} in Massachusetts include the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> the New England National Scenic Trail, the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail, the Midstate Trail, and the Bay Circuit Trail. Other outdoor {{recreational}} activities in Massachusetts include sailing and yachting, freshwater and deep-sea fishing, whale watching, downhill and cross-country skiing, and hunting.|$|E
5|$|The Mount Washington Cog Railway ascends {{the western}} {{slope of the}} {{mountain}}, and the Mount Washington Auto Road climbs to the summit from the east. The mountain is popular with hikers (the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> crosses the summit). Other common activities include glider flying, and annual cycle and running races such as the Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb and Road Race.|$|E
25|$|Areas {{maintained}} by the National Park Service include <b>Appalachian</b> National Scenic <b>Trail,</b> Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor, and Weir Farm National Historic Site.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} route very roughly {{parallels the}} <b>Appalachian</b> National Scenic <b>Trail,</b> but generally follows river valleys and utilizes many long-abandoned logging roads that criss-cross the region.|$|R
50|$|On November 20, 2003, {{both the}} Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed charges against Gary L. Pilgrim, Harold J. Baxter, and PBA for civil {{securities}} fraud and breach of fiduciary duties. Pilgrim {{was accused of}} allowing one of his friends, Michael Christiani, {{the manager of a}} hedge fund called <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trails</b> L.P., to use a market timing strategy which rapidly traded shares of, among other funds, the PBHG Growth Fund. Though market timing is a legal and legitimate practice still in widespread use, it had begun to be considered potentially deleterious to buy-and-hold investors. In fact, at the time charges were brought in 2003, PBA had already expelled all market timers from its funds and had allowed no such activity since December 2001. There were no accusations or evidence of the illegal late trading which factored in other cases of the 2003 mutual fund scandal.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the park}} are {{a series of}} hiking trails. These include the Bear Hair Gap Trail and the more strenuous Coosa Backcountry Trail, which leads up toward Blood Mountain and the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> near Neal's Gap. Vogel Park {{features}} camping sites, cabins, swimming, boating and other recreational activities.|$|E
5|$|The road {{begins to}} climb again {{over the next}} few miles, passing a county park and finally the small Mount Peter ski area before {{crossing}} the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> along the ridgecrest of Bellvale Mountain. From here it once again drops down and bends in a northsouth direction to reach Greenwood Lake, where NY210 leaves to go {{along the side of the}} lake to the state line.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed limit}} is , due to curves, {{wildlife}} and tourists. Bicycles, motor vehicles, and pedestrians share the road. There are also deer, black bears, turkey, and other wildlife, which may appear and cross the road without warning. These all require extra precautions. The speed limit {{within the park}} is strictly enforced by park rangers. Numerous trails can be accessed along the drive, including {{a portion of the}} <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> which follows the road's path.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Appalachian</b> National Scenic <b>Trail</b> - 2160 mi - Springer Mountain, Georgia to Mt. Katahdin, Maine this forested {{trail is}} the longest natural public {{thoroughfare}} in the world ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Appalachian</b> National Scenic <b>Trail</b> {{passes through}} this region, and the portion that {{passes through the}} region's Mahoosuc Notch is popularly {{considered}} by hikers {{to be the most}} difficult mile of the entire trail.|$|R
50|$|The battlefields are {{preserved}} within the South Mountain State Park, Gathland State Park, and the <b>Appalachian</b> National Scenic <b>Trail.</b> Crampton's Gap Historic District and Turner's and Fox's Gaps Historic District are {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
5|$|Violent crime, {{including}} murder, {{has occurred}} on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims. The official website of the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> Conservancy {{points out that the}} number of violent crimes is extremely low when compared against the number of people (3 to 4 million) who hike on the trail every year.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black bear}} (Ursus americanus), {{among the largest}} animals along the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> rarely confronts people. The black bear is the largest {{omnivore}} that may be encountered on the trail, and it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians. Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon, except in certain sections, especially Shenandoah National Park and portions of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts sections, where bear populations have increased steadily since 1980; confrontations are rarer still.|$|E
5|$|A park {{entrance}} fee is charged {{at the four}} access points to the drive. Skyline Drive is a two-lane road that has 75 overlooks providing views of the Shenandoah Valley {{to the west and}} the Piedmont to the east. The drive provides access to numerous trails, including the <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> and it is also used for biking and horseback riding. Skyline Drive is the main road through Shenandoah National Park and has access to campgrounds, visitor centers, and resorts such as Skyland Resort and Big Meadows. The scenic drive is particularly popular in the fall for leaf peeping when the leaves are changing colors. Skyline Drive is designated a National Scenic Byway and a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
50|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of both the}} upcoming American Bicentennial of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the 1980 bicentennial of the Battle of King's Mountain, many citizens in the five states along the original routes—which included Georgia --- reenacted and hiked along the segments of the <b>Appalachian</b> mountain <b>trails</b> and highways closely following {{the path of the}} actual 1780 march to the battle site located near present-day Kings Mountain, North Carolina, on the North Carolina-South Carolina border.|$|R
50|$|The furnace {{remains and}} its reconstructed {{portions}} were named an American Society for Metals historical landmark in 1994. The park is a designated Civil War Discovery Trail site, {{a stop on}} the Alabama <b>Appalachian</b> Highlands Birding <b>Trail,</b> and was listed among the top 10 Alabama parks and nature areas visited in 2016.|$|R
50|$|Mount Greylock {{has over}} 70 miles of {{designated}} trails for hiking, mountain biking, back-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling, including an 11.5 mile {{section of the}} <b>Appalachian</b> National Scenic <b>Trail.</b> A primitive camping experience is available for backpackers at either the Mount Greylock Campground or 5 remote trailside backpacker shelters; the campground is only accessible by foot, as are the backpacker shelters.|$|R
