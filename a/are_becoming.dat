5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold.

The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy {{plays a major}} role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E

5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
