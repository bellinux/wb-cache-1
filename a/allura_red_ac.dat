40|$|<b>Allura</b> <b>red,</b> {{also known}} as Red dye # 40 and {{chemically}} represented as C 18 H 14 N 2 Na 2 O 8 S 2 is a common food coloring that {{has been found to}} cause medical problems in humans, but that has not been tested in other species. This experiment tests the effects of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> {{in the development of the}} painted lady butterfly, the most widely distributed butterfly in the world. We hypothesize that <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> will impede the development of painted lady butterflies, when mixed with their food. This experiment compares the effects of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> to that of pesticides on the declining bee populations of the world, as painted lady butterflies are also important pollinators. The experiment consisted of 40 caterpillars divided into four groups of ten, three groups of caterpillars received a dose of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> mixed into their food culture (High dose (Hi), Mid dose (Mid), Low dose (Lo)) and one group received culture only (Control (Con)). The time it took the caterpillars to develop in their chrysalises and to emerge was recorded to see if it took longer for the butterflies who were given dye to emerge. The higher the ratio of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> dye to food culture, the longer it took the caterpillars to emerge. Additionally, there was a higher mortality rate among the butterflies who received more dye, as well as higher rates of deformities. In the Con group, all butterflies emerged within 3 days of each other. In Lo group, 2 caterpillars died before chrysalis, 1 never emerged, and 2 died in emersion. In Mid group, 3 caterpillars died before chrysalis, 1 never emerged, and 1 died in emersion. In the Hi group, 1 caterpillar died and 3 never emerged.

All factors affecting the adsorption process were carefully studied {{and the conditions}} were optimized. Adsorption of E 129 onto activated carbon was found to increase by decreasing the mass of activated carbon, pH and ionic strength of the solution and by increasing temperature. The adsorption capacity of the activated carbon for <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> was relatively high. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity for E 129 dye was 72. 85 mg/g.

Tartrazine(TZ) and Fast green (FG) on mild steel in 0. 5 M HCI was studied at 30 - 60 °C using weight loss, electrochernical and quantum chemical methods. Quantum calculation {{based on the}} density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the reactivities and selectivities of four (4) of the studied dyes. The effects of inhibitor concentration on the inhibition efficiency have been studied. Inhibition efficiency increased with increase in concentration of the all the studied dyes within the concentration range 25 - 50 pm. The results obtained showed that the experimental inhibition efficiency follows the order: Fast green (FU) > <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> (AR) > Amaranth (AM) >Tartrazine (TZ). The potentiodynamic studies revealed that all the inhibitors are of mix-type. The adsorption of the studied dyes obeyed the Langrnuir adsorption isotherm. Some thermodynamic parameters such as the heat of adsorption, entropy of adsorption and free energy of adsorption have been calculated. Apparent activation energy has been calculated and discussed. Synergism parameter evaluated {{was found to be}} greater than unity for all the concentration of the dyes used suggesting that the increase in the inhibition efficiency of the dyes by the addition of KI is only due to the synergism. Density Functional Theory method was used utilized on the quantum chemical calculation performed both in vacuo and in solution using both the protonated and non-protonated species.

In fact, the study estimated that, on the average, consumers of red soft drinks consume 53. 1 litres per year, ranging from 39. 1 litres to 70. 7 litres of soft drink products under a scenario, or, 21. 3 litres, ranging from 12. 7 litres and 35. 9 litres under other hypotheses; while 9. 5 litres of red juice-based drinks are consumed per year, ranging between 7. 0 litres and 12. 5 litres, under a scenario, or, on the average, 6. 9 litres, ranging from 3. 2 litres and 17. 7 litres, under the other scenario. The amount of colorant in a red beverage ranges from 10. 9 mg/l in a red soft drink up to 55. 9 mg/l in a red-juice based product.
