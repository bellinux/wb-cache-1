50|$|The <b>Apple</b> <b>Worm</b> is a {{computer}} program written for the Apple computer, and especially for the 6502 microprocessor, which performs dynamic self-relocation. The source code of the <b>Apple</b> <b>Worm</b> is the first program printed in its entirety in Scientific American. The <b>Apple</b> <b>Worm</b> was designed and developed by James R. Hauser and William R. Buckley.|$|E
50|$|A more current {{example of}} a self-relocating program is an {{adaptation}} of the <b>Apple</b> <b>Worm</b> for the Intel 80x86 microprocessor and its derivatives, such as the Pentium, and corresponding AMD microprocessors.|$|E
50|$|As {{an extreme}} example of self-relocation it is {{possible}} to construct a computer program so that it does not stay at a fixed address in memory, even as it executes. The <b>Apple</b> <b>Worm</b> is a dynamic self-relocator.|$|E

50|$|Because the <b>Apple</b> <b>Worm</b> {{performs}} dynamic self-relocation {{within the}} one main memory of one computer, {{it does not}} constitute a computer virus, an apt if somewhat inaccurate description. Though the analogous behavior of copying code between memories is exactly the act performed by a computer virus, the virus has other characters not present in the worm. Such programs do not necessarily cause collateral damage to the computing systems upon which their instructions execute; there is no reliance upon a vector to ensure subsequent execution. This extends to the computer virus; it need not be destructive in order to effect its communication between computational environments.|$|E
40|$|T he Tortricidae, {{a family}} of {{lepidopteran}} insects, have challengedNew York State fruit growers since {{the arrival of the}} first European apple trees in the early 17 th century. ‘Apple worms ’ and surface feeding larvae con-tinue to damage our commercially grown fruit. This ‘Lepidoptera Com-plex ’ includes numerous species, more commonly known as the codling moth, oriental fruit worm, lesser <b>apple</b> <b>worm,</b> and the obliquebanded leafroller. In abandoned and poorly managed or-chards many more species can be found, comprising a very diverse complex of insect pests feeding on the fruit, foliage, and wood of apple throughout the northeast. Agricultural research conducted during the past 100 years has provided a variety of literature citations regard-ing insecticide resistance of the insect pest complex plaguing the apple. The codling moth is the most notable of these pests, exhibiting insecticide resis-tance during the early era of chemical development. Its {{believed to be the first}} lepidopteran insect noted to be resistant to the arsenical insecticides in the late 1920 ’s and again shortly after the devel-opment of DDT. Recent reports fro...|$|E

He says,--"His meat is <b>apples,</b> <b>worms,</b> or grapes: when he findeth apples or grapes on the earth, he rolleth himself upon them, until he have filled all his prickles, and then carrieth them home to his den, never bearing above one in his mouth; and if it fortune that one of them fall off by the way, he likewise shaketh off all the residue, and walloweth upon them afresh, until they be all settled upon his back again. So, forth he goeth, making a noise like a cart-wheel; and if he have any young ones in his nest, they pull off his load wherewithal he is loaded, eating thereof what they please, and laying up the residue for the time to come." ...|$|R

40|$|Custard apple (Annona {{squamosa}} L.) {{is one of}} efficacious medical {{plant that}} often used by local community for constipation, insectiside, carbuncle, scabies, gastrointestinal problem such diarrhoea, dysentery and anthelmintic. In Indonesia, worm disease is infection disease that still high prevalention. Although modern anthelmintic is in stock, but still common community is to use medical plant, specialy custard <b>apple</b> for therapeutic <b>worm</b> disease. The aim {{of this research was}} to deterinate anthelmintic capability of ethanol extract of seed custard <b>apple</b> on the <b>worm</b> Ascaridia galli on in vitro. This researches were pure experimental by using Lamson and Brown method submerges that have been modified by using 270 of worm femele, that devided into 9 groups treatment, which was 4 groups for ethanol extract of seed custerd apple in concentration of 10 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, 4 positive control groups (citrate piperazinae 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, 6 mg/mL, 8 mg/mL) and negative control group (NaCl 9 mg/mL). Each group consist of 6 petri disc and each petri disc contain 5 of worm and 25 mL solution. Anthelmintic capability is measurement observed is the mortality time rate of the worm and value LC 50, that is concentration is needed for killing 50 % worm population and than analysed date by one way ANOVA and continued by Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. The research result, shown that mortality time rate of worm after submerges by ethanol extract of seed custrad apple in concentration 10 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL, and. 40 mg/mL is 43, 33; 38, 00; 37, 66 and 34, 33 hours.
