5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado {{operators}} {{have chosen}} to undertake various life extension and upgrade programmes to keep their Tornado fleets as viable frontline aircraft for the foreseeable future. The RAF and RSAF have upgraded their Tornados to the GR4 standard to increase combat effectiveness, while German Tornados have been undergoing periodic upgrades under the multi-stage ASSTA (<b>Avionics</b> <b>System</b> Software Tornado in Ada) programme. With these upgrades, as of 2011, it is projected that the Tornado shall be in service until 2025, more than 50 {{years after the first}} prototype took flight.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2000, German IDS and ECR Tornados {{received}} the ASSTA 1 (<b>Avionics</b> <b>System</b> Software Tornado in Ada) upgrade. ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer, new GPS and Laser Inertial navigation systems. The new computer allowed {{the integration of}} the HARM III, HARM 0 Block IV/V and TAURUS KEPD 350 missiles, the Rafael Litening II Laser Designator Pod and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs. The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005, primarily consisting of several new digital avionics systems, a new ECM suite and provision for the Taurus cruise missile; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados (20 ECRs and 65 IDSs), as the Tornado {{is in the process of}} being replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon. The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme, started in 2008, will introduce support for the laser-targeted Joint Direct Attack Munition along with further software changes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to carry out}} the Assembly, Integration and Verification of the <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> of a technological experiment on-board the International Space Station. The <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> consists of three main subsystems, i. e. the on-board data handling, the electric power and the health management subsystem, and supports a technological experiment which focuses on the investigation of passive thermal control subsystem. The Assembly, Integration and Verification (AIV) campaign is a fundamental step of the design process, as the final objective of the AIV is to demonstrate that the end product meets the specified requirements. The selection of simple technical solutions and the necessity to keep cost down have driven the definition of the AIV plan, which has been tailored for the <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> under consideration. Main purpose of the methodology for the Assembly, Integration and Verification is to provide the designer with a step-by-step procedure to accomplish the verification and validation of the <b>avionic</b> <b>system.</b> The methodology shall pursue an incremental approach, which defines the test plan from components to parts, subsystems and system levels through subsequent integrations. Being the AIV a crucial process for the mission reliability of any system, the proposed methodology shall pursue the enhancement of the system reliability and safety by defining, for instance, the most appropriate verification methods to verify the compliance with requirements, the tests to perform and the most correct tests sequence. Models philosophies are discussed and the most suitable model philosophy for the <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> is selected. The methodology has been developed for the <b>avionic</b> <b>system</b> of a technological experiment but is flexible enough to be applicable to multi-purpose <b>avionic</b> <b>system,</b> capable to support different types of experiments. This paper provides an introduction to the <b>avionic</b> <b>system,</b> then it proceeds with the description of the AIV methodology and the main results obtained by its application to the <b>avionic</b> <b>system.</b> Eventually main conclusions are draw...|$|R

The larger cabin allows for the new <b>avionics</b> <b>system.</b> Those and the airframe changes are compensated by the exchange of the T700-IHI-401C2 engine. The first production SH-60K was delivered to JMSDF on 10 August 2005. A total of 50 SH-60Ks are being supplied under new production.|$|E

Now, UUP owns 10 helicopters AS355 F2 and N series, 6 CE 208 Caravan, 5 Pilatus Porter PC-6, 4 Cessna 172Sp, and 5 Beechcraft KingAir 350 (KingAir 350 is an advanced aircraft with latest Proline-21 <b>avionics</b> <b>system).</b> Police Air Unit has 4 bases in Sg.

25|$|In {{terms of}} cockpit {{equipment}} and avionics, the EC225 {{is equipped with}} a full glass cockpit with active-matrix liquid crystal displays; these include four 6-inch by 8-inch multi-functional displays as the predominant instrumentation for key flight information, two 4-inch by 5-inch monitors for displaying aircraft parameters, and a 3-inch screen for backup. The advanced helicopter cockpit and <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> is described as serving to reduce pilot and crew workload, being used to display flight management and sub-systems information and is complete with a four-axis digital autopilot. During a typical flight, the pilot programs the route into the aircraft and then monitors it, as opposed to direct continuous control of the flight; the need for paper charts has been eliminated by these systems. Under autopilot, the automatic flight control system acts to prevent pilot actions from exceeding the established flight envelope; the EC225 remains flyable with all automatic systems disabled. From initiating the startup sequence to being ready to takeoff only takes three minutes, however if the authorised Airbus checklist is used it take approximately 7 minutes.|$|E

The AV-8B cockpit was also used for the early trialing of Direct Voice Input (DVI), which allows the pilot to use voice commands to issue instructions to the aircraft, using a system developed by Smiths Industries. The main attack <b>avionics</b> <b>system</b> in original aircraft was the nose-mounted Hughes AN/ASB-19 angle-rate bombing system. The system combined a TV imager and laser tracker to provide a highly accurate targeting capability.

In order to provide tolerance to software faults, some form of state restoration is usually advocated as a means of recovery.

The concurrency present in most <b>avionics</b> <b>systems</b> and the further difficulties introduced by timing constraints imply that providing tolerance for software faults may be inordinately expensive or complex.
