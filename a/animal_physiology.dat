40|$|Historically, {{animals have}} been used in medical {{research}} to bring about many of the medical breakthroughs and advances seen today. The successful studies are accompanied by numerous, often concealed, failed studies that are inapplicable to human medicine due to stress and distress changing the 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 physiological parameters of that animal. The psychological stresses observed on the research animals are numerous and include habitat inconsistencies, exposures to abnormal conditions, experimental stresses, and the anticipation of awaiting a procedure. Often published papers disguise these conditions with delicate terminology to eliminate question of error in their data. When an animal is mentally, or physically stressed, the <b>animal’s</b> <b>physiology</b> is altered.

25|$|Ammonia {{also plays}} a role in both normal and {{abnormal}} <b>animal</b> <b>physiology.</b> It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The liver converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the urea cycle. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in cirrhosis, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as ornithine transcarbamylase, lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and coma of hepatic encephalopathy, as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and organic acidurias.|$|E

25|$|In 1816, François Magendie {{discovered}} that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein {{as an essential}} dietary component.

During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds). With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in <b>animal</b> <b>physiology,</b> Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value.

25|$|The {{missing link}} was the {{demonstration}} that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is actually contained in synaptic vesicles. About ten years later, {{the application of}} subcellular fractionation techniques to brain tissue permitted the isolation first of nerve endings (synaptosomes), and subsequently of synaptic vesicles from mammalian brain. Two competing laboratories were involved in this work, that of Victor P. Whittaker at the Institute of <b>Animal</b> <b>Physiology,</b> Agricultural Research Council, Babraham, Cambridge, UK and that of Eduardo de Robertis at the Instituto de Anatomía General y Embriología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Whittaker's work demonstrating acetylcholine in vesicle fractions from guinea-pig brain {{was first published in}} abstract form in 1960 and then in more detail in 1963 and 1964, and the paper of the de Robertis group demonstrating an enrichment of bound acetylcholine in synaptic vesicle fractions from rat brain appeared in 1963. Both groups released synaptic vesicles from isolated synaptosomes by osmotic shock. The content of acetylcholine in a vesicle was originally estimated to be 1000–2000 molecules. Subsequent work identified the vesicular localization of other neurotransmitters, such as amino acids, catecholamines, serotonin, and ATP. Later, synaptic vesicles could also be isolated from other tissues such as the superior cervical ganglion, or the octopus brain. The isolation of highly purified fractions of cholinergic synaptic vesicles from the ray Torpedo electric organ was an important step forward in the study of vesicle biochemistry and function.|$|E

O'Meara and others argued that <b>animal</b> <b>physiology</b> could be affected by pain during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections on an ethical basis, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals. Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle—many people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.|$|E

After studying the irritations and enlargements of the prostate gland in elderly men, and paying the university $100 ($ in current value), Brinkley graduated on May 7, 1915.

The Hungarian Academy of Sciences published her findings. Rona first coined the terms [...] "isotope labels" [...] and [...] "tracers" [...] during this study, noting that the velocity of diffusion depended on the mass of the nuclides.

An example of this is the selection of microenvironments to keep their body temperature within a “preferred range” (the temperature at which their body functions are running optimally). Even though this does assist with short-term fluctuations, there is still the issue of seasonal climactic changes, which will persist for much longer.
