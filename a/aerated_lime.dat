40|$|Four {{types of}} light weight {{concrete}} (LWC) {{commonly used in}} Hong Kong, namely, autoclave <b>aerated</b> concrete (plus <b>lime),</b> autoclave <b>aerated</b> concrete (plus Pulverized Fuel Ash or PFA), concrete with synthetic aggregate ‘Leca’ and concrete with polystyrene bean as aggregate were measured for their 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K contents using high-resolution gamma spectrometry. All the radionuclide contents except those for the PFA autoclave aerated concrete were below the world averages of building materials. The Ra-equivalents for these four LWC were 49. 6, 249, 122 and 44. 2 Bq kgÿ 1, respectively, and were much smaller than a recommended limit of 370 Bq kgÿ 1 for construction materials for dwellings. The gamma-dose rate for an indoor environment with partition walls built with LWC {{was estimated to be}} about 20 10 ÿ 8 Gy hÿ 1, which corresponded to a reduction in the eective dose of about 0. 25 mSv yÿ 1 when compared to that obtained for an indoor environment built with normal concrete (NC) only. The Rn exhalation rates from the three lowest Ra-equivalent LWC were calculated as 0. 509, 1. 28, and 0. 335 mBq mÿ 2 sÿ 1, respectively, which corresponded to a reduction in the indoor Rn concentration of around 14 Bq mÿ 3 and reduction in the tracheobronchial dose reaching 1 mSv yÿ 1 by using the James lung-dosimetry model, when compared to th...|$|R
