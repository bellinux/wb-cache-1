Antocianinas e elagitaninos presentes em frutas como as berries destacam-se por seu promissor efeito protetor em diferentes estágios do desenvolvimento do câncer de mama. Grumixama (G; Eugenia brasiliensis Lam) é uma espécie de cereja nativa do Brasil que assim como as amora-preta (AP; Rubus spp) e silvestre (AS; Morus nigra L.) contém alto teor de antocianinas e elagitaninos. Poucos estudos focaram na ação anticâncer destas berries no câncer de mama. Portanto, o objetivo do presente estudo foi avaliar os efeitos de extratos ricos em antocianinas ou elagitaninos de G, AP e AS no crescimento e na expressão de genes e miRNAs das linhagens de células humanas de câncer de mama MCF- 7 (receptor de hormônio positiva) e MDA-MB 231 (receptor de hormônio negativa). Não se observou citotoxicidade após 72 e 96 horas de tratamento com os extratos (25 - 200 &# 181 g/mL) ricos em antocianinas (<b>ASANT,</b> APANT e GANT) ou elagitaninos (APELA e GELA), em ambas as linhagens celulares. Após 72 horas de tratamento, GANT e APANT induziram parada de ciclo celular em G 0 /G 1 (12, 5 e 50 &# 181 g/mL, p< 0, 05) em células MCF- 7. Após 96 h, <b>ASANT,</b> APANT e GANT induziram parada de ciclo celular em G 0 /G 1 (12, 5 e 50 &# 181 g/mL; p< 0, 05) nessas mesmas células. Entretanto, na concentração de 200 &# 181 g/mL apenas GANT induziu parada em G 0 /G 1 (72 e 96 h; p< 0, 05). Em células MDA-MB 231, após 96 h APANT e GANT induziram parada de ciclo celular em G 0 /G 1 nas concentrações testadas (12, 5, 50 e 200 &# 181 g/mL, p< 0, 05), assim como <b>ASANT</b> nas concentrações de 12, 5 e 50 &# 181 g/mL (p< 0, 05). Em células MCF- 7, após 72 h APELA e GELA induziram aumento da proporção de células em subG 0 (200 &# 181 g/mL, p< 0, 05). Em MDA-MB 231, após 72 e 96 h, APELA e GELA (200 &# 181 g/mL) induziram aumento da proporção de células em subG 0 (p< 0, 05) e parada em G 0 /G 1 (p< 0, 05). Em células MCF- 7, GANT induziu morte celular por apoptose (p< 0, 05) após 72 e 96 h de tratamento. Entretanto, em MDA-MB 231 os extratos ricos em antocianinas não induziram morte celular. Em células MCF- 7, após 96 h GELA e APELA induziram principalmente necrose (p< 0, 05). Em MDA-MB 231, APELA e GELA induziram apoptose (p< 0, 05) após 72 e 96 h. Em células MDA-MB 231, após 72 h de tratamento foi observada inibição da proliferação celular por GELA, GANT e APELA (200 &# 181 g/mL; p< 0, 05). Em células MDA-MB 231, 48 h de tratamento com GELA; GANT e APELA (200 &# 181 g/mL) aumentaram a expressão 5 genes (ESR 2, FOXA 1, JUN, PTGS 2,VEGFA) e inibiram a expressão de 10 genes (ADAM 23, ATM, BCL 2, CDH 1, EGF, GLI 1, ID 1, MKI 67, SNAI 2 e THBS 1) correlacionados ao câncer de mama. Adicionalmente, GELA; GANT e APELA (200 &# 181 g/mL) induziram aumento da expressão de miR- 210 (p< 0, 05) e APELA (200 &# 181 g/mL) reduziu a expressão de miRNA 19 a/b (p< 0, 05) em células MDAMB 231. Coletivamente estes resultados sugerem que antocianinas de grumixama e elagitaninos de amora preta e grumixama apresentam potencial efeito protetor contra o câncer de mama. Adicionalmente, essa ação anticarcinogênica pode ser mediada por indução de morte celular, mais especificamente apoptose, redução de proliferação celular e modulação da expressão de genes e miRNAs relacionados ao câncer de mama. Breast {{cancer is}} characterized as the neoplasia {{with the highest}} incidence and mortality rates in women worldwide. Anthocyanins and ellagitannins present in certain fruits, such as berries, stand out for their promising protective effect {{at different stages of}} breast cancer development. Grumixama (G; Eugenia brasiliensis Lam), a cherry species from Brazil, as well as blackberry (AP; Rubus spp) and mulberry (AS; Morus nigra L.) contain elevated concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Few studies focused on the anticarcinogenic action of these berries in breast cancer development. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effects of extracts rich in anthocyanins or ellagitannins from G, AP and AS on cellular growth and genes and miRNAs expression in human MCF- 7 (hormone receptor positive) and MDA-MB 231 (hormone receptor negative) cell lines. No cytotoxicity was observed after 72 and 96 hours of treatment with extracts rich in anthocyanin (25 - 200 &# 181 g/mL) (<b>ASANT,</b> APANT and GANT) or ellagitannins (APELA and GELA) in both cell lines. After 72 hours of treatment, GANT and APANT induced cell cycle arrest at G 0 /G 1 (12. 5 &# 181 g/mL and 50 &# 181 g/mL, p< 0. 05) in MCF- 7 cells. After 96 h, <b>ASANT,</b> APANT and GANT induced cycle arrest at G 0 /G 1 (12. 5 and 50 &# 181 g/mL; p< 0. 05) in MCF- 7 cells. However, at 200 &# 181 g/mL, only GANT induced G 0 /G 1 (72 and 96 h; p< 0. 05). In MDA-MB 231 cells, after 96 h APANT and GANT induced cell cycle arrest at G 0 /G 1 with the three tested concentrations (12. 5, 50 and 200 &# 181 g/mL, p< 0. 05), as well as <b>ASANT</b> at concentrations 12, 5 and 50 &# 181 g/mL (p < 0. 05). In MCF- 7 cells, after 72 h APELA and GELA induced an increase in the proportion of cells in subG 0 (200 &# 181 g/mL, p< 0. 05). In MDA-MB 231, after 72 and 96 h, APELA and GELA (200 &# 181 g/mL) induced an increase in the proportion of cells in subG 0 (p< 0. 05) and cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 (p< 0. 05). In MCF- 7 cells, GANT induced apoptosis (p< 0. 05) after 72 and 96 h of treatment. However, in MDA-MB 231, extracts rich in anthocyanins did not induce cell death. In MCF- 7 cells, after 96 h GELA and APELA induced mainly necrosis (p< 0. 05). In MDA-MB 231, APELA and GELA induced apoptosis (p< 0. 05) after 72 and 96 h. In MDA-MB 231 cells, inhibition of cell proliferation by GELA, GANT and APELA (200 ?g/mL; p< 0. 05) was observed after 72 h of treatment. In MDA-MB 231 cells, treatment for 48 h with GELA, GANT and APELA (200 &# 181 g) increased expression of 5 genes (ESR 2, FOXA 1, JUN, PTGS 2, VEGFA) and inhibited expression of 10 genes (ADAM 23, ATM, BCL 2, CDH 1, EGF, GLI 1, ID 1, MKI 67, SNAI 2 and THBS 1) correlated with breast cancer. In addition, GELA; GANT and APELA (200 &# 181 g/mL) induced increased expression of miR- 210 (p< 0. 05) and APELA (200 &# 181 g/mL) reduced the expression of miRNA 19 a/b (p< 0. 05) in MDA-MB cells 231. Collectively these results suggest that anthocyanins of grumixama and ellagitannins of blackberry and grumixama have potential protective effect against breast cancer. Additionally, this anticarcinogenic action can be mediated by induction of cell death, more specifically apoptosis, reduction of cell proliferation and modulation of the expression of genes and miRNAs related to breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Two {{tropical}} forest fragments namely Ikot Efre Etak and <b>Asanting</b> community forests in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria were assessed {{for the population}} and diversity index of plants producing valuable forest products. Appropriate ecological model were used to obtain the plant population density, Abundance/Richness index, diversity index similarity index. A total of 69 plant species comprising 41 species of trees, 13 shrub, 8 herbs, 4 climbers and 3 palms were encountered in the study areas. Apart from Canarium schweinfurthii (Linn.) and Mimusops heckelii (Linn.) with density of 11 and 16 individual/ha respectively, all other tree species had a density of less than 10 individual/ha. Bambusia vulgaris (Schrad. Ex Wend.) had the highest shrub population density of 31 individual/ha, and in the herb category, Costus afar (Ker-Gawl.) and Hippocratea africana (Willd.) had the highest density of 53 and 11 individual/ha. Furthermore, the result also shows that Ancistrophyllum secondiflorum (P. Beauv and Wendl.) had the highest population density of 23 individual/ha in the pal...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{mobility}} {{was one of}} the many facets of Asante political, social structure and institutions which reveals the intricate nature of Asante Government. Mobility studies in Africa have engaged the attention of both anthropologists and historians and in Ghana anthropologists have been the pioneers in this field. 1 Hagan and Wilks discussed mobility in Asante when they examined the nature of Asante bureaucracy in the 19 th century. 2 This paper addresses the subject of mobility in Asante in greater detail with special emphasis on the involvement of slaves and people of servile origin in the process of political and social mobility in pre-colonial Asante. Mobility in this context refers to the movement of persons as individuals or in groups from one social position to another either horizontally or vertically. 3 Pre-colonial Asante had numerous avenues for mobility. It was an open, not a closed society. Mobility in political administration is traced in Asante tradition to Asantehene Osei Tutu (C 1697 - 1717) and his able adviser Okomfo Anokye. Osei Tutu's experience as a captive in the Denkyira court must have influenced his ideas on mobility. On his return to Kumasi he brought back many Denkyiras some of whom were grafted into the <b>Asant...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aim : Ziziphus mauritiana is an endemic fruit {{spread in}} the savannah region of Cameroon. The fruit, locally called Jaabi, is {{harvested}} dry and consumed as such or processed into a local cake named Yaabande, using three baking techniques (sun drying, steam baking and stifle baking). The aim {{of the study is}} to characterize the sensory profile and consumer acceptability of the fruit and its processed product, in order to evaluate the determinant of their quality attributes as influenced by ecotype, origin and processing method. Place of Study: The study was carried out in the Department of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Ngaoundéré, Cameroon. Methodology: Physico-chemical analysis, sensory profile by a semi trained panel, and consumer acceptability of the fruits and their processed pro ducts were undergone through collection of two ecotypes of the fruit (Jaabi Dakamji and Jaabi Lammuji) from four areas (Garoua, Mora, Maroua and Mokolo). African and non African consumers were used for the consumer tests. Results: Sensory analysis differentiated the fruits by ecotype and origin, with the Dakamji ecotype appearing more homogeneous whatever the origin. The processed cakes differed mainly by their texture, depending on the baking method, with chewi ng texture for sun processed method, while samples from steam and stifle baking were more firm in mouth. Meanwhile, all samples were acceptable at comparable level corresponding to ple <b>asant</b> character, the sweet taste constituting the main criteria for consuming the products, both for African and non African consumers. In this respect Dakamji ecotype was sweeter, due to its higher sugar conte nt, while the sweetness of Lammuji ecotype was lowered by its acid content. Conclusion: Jaabi and Yaabande samples are globally acceptable by consumers, whatever the origin and the variety. Development of products emphasising the original taste of Jaabi and standardisation of processing techniques appear as some main aspects of the market development of the fruit.
