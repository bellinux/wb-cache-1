5000|$|Estate taxes, while {{affecting}} more taxpayers than inheritance taxes, do {{not affect}} many Americans {{and are also}} {{considered to be a}} tax aimed at the wealthy. In 2007, all of the state governments combined collected $22 billion in tax receipts from estate taxes and these taxes affected less than 5% of the population including less than 1% of citizens in every state. In 2004, the <b>average</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> of the federal estate tax was 0% for the bottom 80% of the population by household. The <b>average</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> of the estate tax for the top 20% was $1,362. The table below gives a general impression of the spread of estate taxes by income. A certain dollar amount of every estate can be exempted from tax, however. For example, if the government allows an exemption of up to $2 million on an estate then the tax on a $4 million estate would only be paid on $2 million worth of that estate, not all $4 million. This reduces the effective estate tax rate. In 2001, the [...] "exclusion" [...] amount on estates was $675,000 and the top tax rate was 55%. The exclusion amount steadily increased to $3.5 million by 2009 while the tax rate dropped to 45% when it was temporarily repealed in 2010. The estate tax was reinstated in 2011 with a further increased cap of $5 million for individuals and $10 million for couples filing jointly and a reduced rate of 35%. The [...] "step-up basis" [...] of estate tax law allows a recipient of an estate or portion of an estate to have a tax basis in the property equal to the market value of the property.This enables recipients of an estate to sell it at market value without having paid any tax on it. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this exemption costs the federal government $715 billion a year.|$|E

In addition to this, we find the VAT enlargement reform has improved the redistribution effects of the two taxes though lowering the <b>average</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> and narrowing the income gap “within” the low-income household group. Since this reform has not brought a considerable tax cut to the expenditure items which are particularly essential for the low-income households, the income gap “between” the household groups with different income levels is nearly unaffected. As such, the overall improvement of the redistribution effects is rather mild. Further simulation indicates the redistribution effects of VAT can be more effectively improved through lowering the tax burden on necessities.|$|E

The Swiss fiscal system offers sufficient intra-national variation in tax codes to allow us to estimate these effects with considerable precision. We find that high average taxes and complicated tax codes depress firm birth rates, while tax progressivity per se promotes firm births. The latter result supports the existence of an insurance effect from progressive corporate income taxes for risk averse entrepreneurs.
