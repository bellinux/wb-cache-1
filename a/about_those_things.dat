25|$|Wittgenstein also ponders the {{possibility}} of a language that talks <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that are known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that of a language in which one names one's sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the meaning of the term is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, 'S', and intends to use that word to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a private language.|$|E

Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and {{the publisher of the}} books, prepared Brisingrs release by printing 2.5million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, I found that I can't really allow myself to think <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. I sat there and I started obsessing about every single word." [...] He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead.

It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> I don't really talk to everybody.

I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E

[...] Variety reviewer Jeremy Gerard compared the show to Twin Peaks and was overall positive to the series, but said [...] "I just wish it were a little more fun, that I didn't have this nagging feeling that it wants to hurt me the next time I come around." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B and said it had [...] "great visuals and a commanding performance by Henriksen." [...] Justine Elias from The New York Times was mostly positive to the series and said [...] "If The X-Files, with its offbeat humor and conspiracy theories, wonders <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that go bump in the night, Millennium explores the darkness – and embraces it."

In the grand scale of Kim Jong-il’s plan, further {{excerpts}} from the recording went as follows: “If we continually show Western films on television, show them without restraint, then only nihilistic thoughts can come <b>about...</b> all <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> patriotism, patriotism - we have to increase this, but we only make them idolize Western things...

2500|$|The Fault in Our Stars {{received}} critical acclaim. Critics mostly {{praised the}} book for its humor, strong characters, language, themes and new perspective on cancer and romance. The New York Times review of the book called it [...] "a blend of melancholy, sweet, philosophical and funny" [...] and said that it [...] "stays the course of tragic realism", while noting that the book's unpleasant plot details [...] "do nothing to diminish the romance; in Green's hands, they only make it more moving." [...] NPR's Rachel Syme noted that [...] " [...] voice is so compulsively readable that it defies categorization," [...] saying that the [...] "elegantly plotted" [...] book [...] "may be his best." [...] Time called The Fault in Our Stars [...] "damn near genius." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] " [...] love story is as real as it is doomed, and the gut-busting laughs that come early in the novel make the luminous final pages all the more heartbreaking", and gave the novel an overall A grade. Amazon.com calls it [...] "insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw" [...] and Green's [...] "most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet." [...] The Manila Bulletin says that the book is [...] "a collection of maudlin scenes and trite observations about the fragility {{of life and the}} wisdom of dying. And while it does talk <b>about</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> and more, the treatment of it is far from being maudlin or trite." [...] The Manila Bulletin also added that [...] "Just two paragraphs into the work, and he immediately wallops the readers with such an insightful observation delivered in such an unsentimental way that its hard not to shake your head in admiration." [...] The Manila Bulletin stated that The Fault in Our Stars was a triumph for John Green. USA Today called it a [...] "elegiac comedy."

50|$|Some of {{the factors}} used to measure quality of working life pick up on things that don’t {{actually}} make people feel good, but which seem {{to make people feel}} bad <b>about</b> work if <b>those</b> <b>things</b> are absent. For example, noise - if the place where someone works is too noisy, they might get frequent headaches, or find they cannot concentrate, and so feel dissatisfied. But when it is quiet enough they don’t feel pleased or happy - they just don’t feel bad. This can apply to a range of factors that affect someone's working conditions.|$|R
60|$|The great {{misfortune of}} the modern English {{is not at all}} that they are more boastful than other people (they are not); it is that they are boastful <b>about</b> <b>those</b> {{particular}} <b>things</b> which nobody can boast of without losing them. A Frenchman can be proud of being bold and logical, and still remain bold and logical. A German can be proud of being reflective and orderly, and still remain reflective and orderly. But an Englishman cannot be proud of being simple and direct, and still remain simple and direct. In the matter of these strange virtues, to know them is to kill them. A man may be conscious of being heroic or conscious of being divine, but he cannot (in spite of all the Anglo-Saxon poets) be conscious of being unconscious.|$|R
