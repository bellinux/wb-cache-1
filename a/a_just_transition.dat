5000|$|Finally, Left Renewal {{outlines}} {{their approach}} to environmental sustainability as a movement to achieve climate justice, primarily through forms of eco-socialism. It is heavily argued that the intersection between society and environment cannot be separated, and that an internationalist perspective of climate justice is needed that recognises that all people {{are part of a}} global ecosystem irrespective of ethnicity, gender, or sexuality. As a logical conclusion to this, the group argues that people can only resolve climate change by achieving climate justice; again, providing a simple summation of, [...] "None of us are free, until we are all free". This follows on to the argument that the interests of the environment, and the working class, should never be pitted against one another, and that working toward <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>transition</b> in collaboration with and alongside the working class, is needed in order to [...] "uncover a renewable world". The statement concludes by outlining that solutions to climate change cannot come from green-capital partnerships, and top-down market solutions, but must come from people organising in their workplaces and their communities. As such, the group opposes consumer taxes, such as ‘cap and trade’ mechanisms, and cross-class compromises with big business and capital.|$|E
5000|$|Definition and {{evolution}} of the Just Transition concept A summary of this evolution is contained {{in an article published}} by the International Journal on Labour Research In 1998, a Canadian union activist, Brian Kohler, published what was going {{to become one of the}} first mentions of the Just Transition concept in a union newsletter. It constituted an attempt to reconcile the union movement’s efforts to provide workers with decent jobs and the need to protect the environment. As Kohler had clearly stated previously: “The real choice is not jobs or environment. It is both or neither.” In ten years, the union movement perception of environmental challenges has evolved and with it the definition, boundaries and scope of the “just transition” needed. Today, “Just Transition” can be understood as the conceptual framework in which the labour movement captures the complexities of the transition towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, highlighting public policy needs and aiming to maximize benefits and minimize hardships for workers and their communities in this transformation. In a document prepared by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), Just Transition is defined as a “tool the trade union movement shares with the international community, aimed at smoothing the shift towards a more sustainable society and providing hope for the capacity of a green economy to sustain decent jobs and livelihoods for all” (ITUC, 2009b). It is important to note that Just Transition is a supporting mechanism of climate action, and not inaction. Just Transition is not in opposition to, but complements environmental policies. This comforts the idea that environmental and social policies are not contradictory but, on the contrary, can reinforce each other. This approach to the Just Transition concept was unanimously adopted at the 2nd ITUC Congress, in 2010, when the Congress declared “Just Transition” to be “the” approach to fight climate change: 5. Early mentions of Just Transition can also be found in ICFTU: ‘Plough to Plate’ Approaches to Food and Agriculture, 2000; ICFTU: Fashioning A New Deal - Workers and Trade Unions at the World Summit for Sustainable Development, 2002. International Journal of Labour Research 2010 Vol. 2 Issue 2 142 Congress is committed to promoting an integrated approach to sustainable development through <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>transition</b> where social progress, environmental protection and economic needs are brought into a framework of democratic governance, where labour and other human rights are respected and gender equality achieved (ITUC, 2010). Other Global Union Federations, representing workers in specific economic sectors, joined this policy approach. The International Transport workers’ Federation (ITF) adopted, at its 2010 Congress, a resolution stating that “while the urgent adoption of these policies is vital to tackle climate change, the ITF and its affiliates must defend the interests of transport workers by fighting to ensure that these policies are implemented in a way which protects jobs and creates new ones through a process of just transition” (ITF, 2010). Federations of industrial workers have also voiced their positions on Just Transition. The International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers’ Unions (ICEM), for example, states that “with <b>a</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Transition,</b> we can build a public consensus to move towards more sustainable production” (ICEM, 2009). The Just Transition framework is a package of policy proposals which addresses the different aspects related to the vulnerability of workers and their communities: uncertainties regarding job impacts, risks of job losses, risks of undemocratic decision-making processes, risks of regional or local economic downturn, among others. A concept whose use has broadened ...|$|E

In January 2005, the Clean Energy Future Group together with Environment Victoria released the report [...] "Toward Victoria's Clean Energy Future", a plan to cut Victoria's Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by 2010. It largely focused on cleaner alternatives to Hazelwood, and warned that continued support of coal-fired power development would lock the State into CO2 emissions that would dwarf any current proposed measures for reducing emissions. Following the 2014 Hazelwood mine fire, Environment Victoria worked with locals in the Latrobe Valley to ensure national attention to the pollution disaster by generating media coverage and urging an inquiry into the fire; releasing a report by Harvard University researchers about the hidden health costs of Hazelwood; appearing at both inquiries, cross-examining both government regulators and ENGIE executives and ensuring mine rehabilitation was on the agenda; and petitioning the mine owner to pay its firefighting bill to the Country Fire Authority. It afterwards entered into a campaign to improve coal mine rehabilitation efforts in Victoria {{and to ensure that}} mine rehabilitation bonds cover the actual costs of rehabilitation. in 2015, it started a petition signed by thousands of Victorians to call on the French government to phase out Hazelwood.

40|$|The ways {{in which}} {{electricity}} is being generated, distributed, transmitted, and stored are undergoing unprecedented change. Movements for energy democracy, and proponents of <b>a</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> -a transformation of the current fossil fuel-based system into place-based, sustainable, equitable, and democratically controlled economies-have attempted to capture the potential of these changes to realize a low-carbon electricity system through new and more equitable electricity generation and procurement models. Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) is one such utility-scale electricity service provision model in California that explicitly aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the provision of locally produced and democratically controlled renewable energy that simultaneously catalyzes localized economic development. Although community choice aggregation is a twenty-year-old electricity procurement and provision model, the growth of CCAs have been slow; they have only been legalized in seven states {{since its inception in}} 1997. To date, limited academic research has been conducted to examine the barriers to the growth of community choice aggregation Furthermore, this research does not connect CCA to larger strategies to enable such <b>a</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Transition,</b> nor does it identify policy levers to bolster community choice aggregators' ability to deliver on their stated goals. This thesis therefore examines the barriers to realizing community choice aggregation To do so, I conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals essential to the creation of six existing and two emerging community choice aggregators in California. I find that while exit fees, customer opt-outs, and financing remain persistent challenges to CCA formation, new CCA networks, and grassroots coalitions for <b>a</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> have allowed CCAs to overcome these barriers. Additionally, I observed that for community choice aggregators, maintaining business functions and ensuring ratepayer-based revenue take precedence over catalyzing economic development. Ultimately, I find that while the CCA market has experienced significant development, allowing them to provide ratepayers cost competitive renewable energy, community choice aggregators have not matured to a point where they are able to meaningfully catalyze local economic development or deepen civic engagement in energy-related decisions at a local level. In order to transform those challenges into opportunities for deepening civic engagement and community wealth for (low-income) communities (of color) and further realize a vision of <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>transition,</b> this thesis concludes with proposed state regulatory changes to catalyze mutually beneficial "public-public" relationships between CCAs, electricity co-operatives, and unions to further advance <b>a</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Transition,</b> and help community choice aggregators deliver on their goals. by Samuel Jung.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the report. Available from the {{publisher}} via the URL in this record. This paper explores the opportunities for a ‘just transition’ to low carbon and sustainable energy systems; one that addresses the current inequities in the distribution of energy benefits and their human and ecological costs. In order to prioritize policies that address energy poverty alleviation and sustainability concerns, national action and higher levels of international cooperation and coordination are required to steer public policy towards a broader range of public interests. This also implies re-directing the vast sums of private energy finance that currently serve a narrow set of interests. This paper considers how national and global energy governance must adapt and change to ensure <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>transition</b> to low carbon and sustainable energy systems. Creating a low carbon and sustainable energy transition will face significant challenges in overcoming opposition from a broad array of interest groups. The challenges of guiding <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>transition</b> are amplified by the relinquishing of government control over the energy sector in many countries and the current weak and fragmented state of global energy governance. The necessary changes in energy decision making will entail complex trade-offs and rebound effects that make strong, participatory and transparent institutional arrangements essential in order to govern such challenges equitably. In this respect, procedural justice is critical to achieving distributive justice and to creating a simultaneously rapid, sustainable and equitable transition to clean energy futures...|$|E

40|$|The {{mixing time}} of room impulse {{responses}} denotes {{the moment when}} the diffuse reverberation tail begins. A diffuse sound field can physically be defined by 1) equidistribution of acoustical energy and 2) a uniform acoustical energy flux over the complete solid angle.

40|$|Climate change {{mitigation}} poses significant {{challenges for}} South Africa and its energy development, historically highly energy intensive. At the same time, the country faces {{a host of}} daunting development challenges, exacerbated by the legacy of apartheid. Examining both challenges, this paper considers how alternative conceptions of a development path can be achieved. In the short term, energy efficiency provides large potential for mitigation – and energy savings at the same time. Changing South Africa’s fuel mix, dependent to three-quarters on coal, {{is at least a}} medium-term challenge. The minerals–energy complex is so central to the economy that it is likely to take decades to change dramatically. The most transformative change is to an alteration in economic structure, likely to take long to achieve. The article examines specific policy instruments that might be implemented to achieve such a transformation. A transition to a low-carbon economy will require a paradigm shift in industrial policy. It will require considered provision for sectors sensitive to changes in energy prices. Building up new, climate-friendly industries will be needed to sustain employment and investment. To enable <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>transition,</b> provision will have to be made for emissions-intensive sectors, {{if they are to be}} phased out over time.

With a National Action Plan on Climate Change, a Vision 2030 Strategy, a new constitution and a revised Energy Policy, Kenya is at a critical cross-roads with respect to defining its energy future for the years to come. The challenge is to enable <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>transition</b> to a lower carbon economy that delivers poverty reduction and climate resilience at the same time.

Drawing on 29 interviews with government officials, donors and businesses conducted during 2013, insights gleaned from an interactive workshop with practitioners on the themes of the research, as well as available academic and grey literature, this paper explores the role of politics, actors and institutions in enabling or frustrating the pursuit of climate compatible energy development in Kenya. This is a critical time for Kenya in deciding its energy future and whether and how it will aim to make it ‘climate compatible’. Issues of power and political economy will {{play a key role in}} determining technological and social outcomes: the winners and losers from different energy pathways and on whose terms and how the trade-offs between competing policy objectives are resolved.

He had urged her to see a specialist, but she had refused, saying as a theosophist she saw death as <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> from one state to another, and would not have any interference with her body.A doctor was called in a few hours before her death, but her condition was too far advanced for him to be able to offer any treatment.The cause of death was recorded as cancer of the breast, accelerated by want of proper surgical dressing and food.|$|R
