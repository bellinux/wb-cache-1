5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard.

While typically using Vox <b>amplifiers,</b> by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, {{in contrast to the}} much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style.

5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then <b>amplifiers</b> {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational <b>amplifiers</b> enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the <b>amplifiers</b> were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E

5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer <b>amplifiers,</b> and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer <b>amplifiers</b> is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E
