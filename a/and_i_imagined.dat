500|$|To other reviewers, Captain Scarlet {{remains a}} [...] "camp classic" [...] that, in Bould's opinion, relates well to other Anderson {{productions}} {{due to a}} common depiction of [...] "a utopian future benefiting from world government, high technology, ethnic diversity, and a generally positive sense of Americanisation. They articulate the commonly made connection between technological developments and economic prosperity." [...] He also states that Captain Scarlet espouses [...] "Euro-cool consumerism". The concept of world government is common to Anderson's work and was inspired by his thoughts on the matter at the time: [...] "I had all sorts of fancy ideas about the future... we had the United Nations <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> {{that the world would}} come together and there would be a world government." [...] Peter Wright, on the series' depiction of technology, notes the [...] "qualified technophilia" [...] that it shares with Thunderbirds.|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees {{appear as}} characters, often eponymously, in {{children}}'s books. The surname Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series (1997–2007) {{is an old}} name for bumblebee. J. K. Rowling said the name [...] "seemed to suit the headmaster, because one of his passions is music <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> him walking around humming to himself". Among the many books for younger children are Bumble the Bee by Yvon Douran and Tony Neal (2014); Bertie Bumble Bee by K. I. Al-Ghani (2012); Ben the Bumble Bee: How do bees make honey? by Romessa Awadalla (2015); Bumble Bee Bob Has a Big Butt by Papa Campbell (2012); Buzz, Buzz, Buzz! Went Bumble-bee by Colin West (1997); Bumble Bee by Margaret Wise Brown (2000); How the Bumble Came to Bee by Paul and Ella Quarry (2012); The Adventures of Professor Bumble and the Bumble Bees by Stephen Brailovsky (2010). Among Beatrix Potter's [...] "little books", Babbity Bumble {{and other members of}} her nest appear in The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse (1910).|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, {{during his}} {{interview}} with Rap-Up, T.I. stated he recorded over 120 songs and had to narrow it down to 16 that would make Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head. T.I. claimed that he's going to take unused material from Heavy is the Head and arrange it into a new album titled Trouble Man: He Who Wears the Crown: [...] "Well, I had so much music man. I recorded like 120-something songs for this project, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> that, you know, if just giving the amount of music that we had left over that we weren't able to put on this project, that we’d do a sequel. So, you know, the sequel to this album will be He Who Wears the Crown. That’s {{the primary reason for}} the subtitle. That's the purpose of the sequel, so we’ll have a platform to display and release these songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He plays {{a highly}} {{decorated}} U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military {{as much as}} the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: [...] "He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me {{that he was going to}} get in shape <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was so fat, he was very, very shy about it... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way." [...] Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, Heart of Darkness, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: [...] "The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging—and yet he's getting paid for it." ...|$|E
60|$|When that {{length of}} time had elapsed, however, and he yet {{remained}} absent, fear crept over me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> the worst.|$|E
60|$|ASHER. I {{told him}} I couldn't discuss certain aspects. His {{emotional}} state troubled me,--he was going away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> {{he would get}} over it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Meddling is {{sometimes}} risky," [...] Austin agreed. [...] "On the other hand, Olivia {{is really not}} romantic, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> she is weighing young Lockwood's advantages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has only}} a week left, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> knows better than we do what will please him best," [...] she replied, and turned to her companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, but {{one feels}} lazy now and then; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> {{you let me}} stay because you {{wanted to talk to}} me! Was I wrong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me--kind man!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> in {{the quiet}} eyes {{the hint of a}} {{possible}} tear. [...] "And he was going away without my seeing him?" ...|$|E
60|$|I paused, for a {{new look}} had come into Benjy's eyes. He began that peculiar, {{sympathetic}} laugh of the negro, which catches and doubles on itself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> that a new admiration for me dawned on his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no train until to-morrow <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> {{the fellow}} wouldn't be {{satisfied}} with canned meat, {{so long as he}} could get something better when the cars stopped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What about Helen's money?" [...] Allott asked. [...] "I'm not a miner, but the assay reports look remarkably good, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> you'll {{get over}} your {{engineering}} troubles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did," [...] Jim admitted. [...] "Practical {{planning}} and optimism {{make a strong}} combine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> {{they are going to}} carry us through. But let's move the stores." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough! Enough! Oh! Ouch! Stop! You're {{landing on}} my naked skin, you know! Ow! O-w-w! I'll be good! I'll be good! I only {{wanted you to}} see my metamorphosis," [...] he said ruefully, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> he was rubbing his hurts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all--" [...] said Jimmy and stopped, {{because he}} did not want to state why he did go. [...] "Of course, it looks like a rash plunge," [...] he resumed. [...] "Still I doubt if it really is rash <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> you would approve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do not think,' said Isabel, as she {{afterwards}} narrated {{this scene}} to her husband, 'that I ever realized his being so much attached to Mary Ponsonby; I {{thought it was}} a convenient suitable thing in which he followed his father's wishes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> he had quite recovered it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You couldn't, in a sense," [...] Walters agreed. [...] "Still, of course, your wishes go a {{long way}} with him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> he is what one might call amenable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that!" [...] said Festing awkwardly. [...] "I did it when I {{fell over}} a stove at the settlement. The pipe came down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> the edge struck me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Father," [...] said Bob, [...] "school must be out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> {{you know}} where I'm going. I just thought I'd stop in to--to thank you, and get a benediction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{exaggerate the}} {{importance}} of the shooting accident," [...] he said. [...] "I and Mr. Stannard used our rifles. The night was dark <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> I had hit the warden. I expect Mr. Stannard had no grounds to think the unlucky shot was his. Until recently, the police believed the shot was mine." ...|$|E
60|$|Shortly {{after breakfast}} a message {{was brought to}} me that Mr Abney {{would like to see}} me in his study. I went without any sense of {{disaster}} to come. Most of the business of the school was discussed in the study after breakfast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> that the matter had to do with some detail of the morrow's exodus.|$|E
60|$|I had called, and {{had been}} shown into the empty drawing-room. The rocking-chair nodded invitingly at me. I never guessed it was an amateur rocking-chair. I was young in those days, with faith in human nature, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> that, {{whatever}} else a man might attempt without knowledge or experience, {{no one would be}} fool enough to experiment upon a rocking-chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the name}} of a girl in Elkington. I've been doing legal work for the Hutchinses, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> some idiot has been gossiping. She's just a young girl--much too young for me." ...|$|R
60|$|MR. A. It {{may depend}} on what amount there is to imbibe; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> that the child views this region as an arid waste; as of course we are {{considerably}} out of date.|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{have already}} had the honour of one {{interview}} with the Archduchess, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> that no useful purpose would be served by re-opening the subject of our discussion!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your uncle felt it very keenly. He {{was furious}} {{when the first}} news arrived and refused to believe you were to blame. Then when Major Allardyce wrote he {{scarcely}} spoke {{for the rest of}} the day and it was a long time before he recovered from the blow; I was staying at Sandymere. He loved you, Dick, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> he expected you to do even better than his son." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bethune laughed. [...] "Well, he's {{given you}} a good job. But why I asked was this: if Miss Fuller's quite {{satisfied}} about you, she'll probably put her maverick brother in your charge. She came here not long ago with the object of finding out if I was suited for the post, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> learned something about me in a quiet way. It was a relief when she obviously decided that I wasn't the proper man. The girl has intelligence. If she had asked me, I could have recommended you." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{secretary}} wrote {{as fast as}} I could dictate, {{and sometimes}} wished, I think, that I would dictate faster. She seldom made comments unless she thought it absolutely necessary to do so, but there were certain twitches and movements {{of her head and}} shoulders which might indicate emotions, such as pleasant excitement at the sudden development of the situation, or impatience at my delay in the delivery of interesting passages; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> that during the interpolation of descriptive matter she appeared to be anxious to get through with it as quickly as possible, and to go on with the story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen hundred tons, if she {{was full}} when she came in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> they hadn't much room in the sheds before. I wonder where Kenwardine gets the money, unless his friend, Richter, is rich." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{both looked}} at each other,--the {{naturally}} most veracious young woman in the colonies, and the subsequent allegorical impersonation of truth in America,--and knew each other lied, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine,</b> respected each other for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry for}} him," [...] muttered Jimfred. [...] "He's a queer-looking chap, with his pale yellow skin, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> our cruel Boolooroo {{is likely to}} patch him before long, as he did me--I mean us." ...|$|R
