Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.|$|E
25|$|The AKP was {{established}} by {{a wide range of}} politicians of various political parties and a number of new politicians. The core of the party was formed from the reformist faction of the Islamist Virtue Party, including people such as Abdullah Gül, Bülent Arınç. A second founding group consisted of members of the social conservative Motherland Party who had been close to Turgut Özal, such as Cemil Çiçek and Abdülkadir Aksu. Some members of the True Path Party, such as Hüseyin Çelik and Köksal Toptan, joined the AKP. Some members, such as Kürşad Tüzmen had nationalist or Ertuğrul Günay, had center-left backgrounds while representatives of the nascent 'Muslim left' current were largely excluded. In addition {{a large number of people}} joined a political party for the first time, such as Ali Babacan, Selma Aliye Kavaf, Egemen Bağış and Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> joined Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to found the new party.|$|E
500|$|With Watchmen, Alan Moore's {{intention}} was to create four or five [...] "radically opposing ways" [...] to perceive {{the world and to}} give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe in the notion of [...] " [...] regurgitated morals" [...] down the readers' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light.

50|$|By 550, {{the region}} was {{controlled}} by native Brittonic-speaking peoples except for the eastern coastal areas, which were controlled by the Anglian peoples of Bernicia and Deira.

There are many cultural similarities between the Chukchis and Koryaks, including economies based on reindeer herding. Both peoples refer to themselves by the endonym Luorawetlan ( [...] ; singular [...] ), meaning [...] "the real people". <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> and other, unrelated minorities in and around Kamchatka are known collectively as Kamchadals.|$|R
500|$|Construction {{started on}} the project in May. One lane of traffic in each {{direction}} was maintained for US41/M-28. Motorist seeking access to downtown were detoured via Grove Street or Lakeshore Boulevard. The Downtown Development Authority had plans to purchase billboards helping to direct customers to the downtown shopping district. A section of the intersection was opened in July to traffic from the south that turns west. The lanes northbound into downtown were opened {{in the beginning of}} August, and the city held a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 19, 2010. The remaining lanes were opened the next day. To address residents' concerns about truck traffic through the intersection, the mayor note that truck used the roundabout after the ribbon was cut.

500|$|This has {{resulted}} in several offenders being sent back to prison after breaching licence conditions. Since the unit was launched in 2006 more than 900 people have been filmed by the unit. Not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are suspects in crime however, people can be filmed if they are thought to associate with prolific offenders or {{if they have been}} stopped in an area of high crime under suspicious circumstances. Kieran Walsh, a civil liberties lawyer, said the unit's work [...] "could have implications" [...] for the force under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to privacy. He believes that filming must be a [...] "proportionate and reasonable" [...] response to a crime and that this {{does not appear to be}} the case as people are being targeted over what they might do in the future. It is uncertain as to how long data collected by the unit is to be kept but GMP currently anticipate it will be stored for 5years.|$|E

5000|$|The Koryaks are {{culturally}} {{similar to the}} Chukchis of extreme northeast Siberia. Both peoples refer to themselves by the endonym Luorawetlan ( [...] ; singular [...] ), meaning [...] "the real people". The Koryak language and Alutor (which is often regarded as a dialect of Koryak), are linguistically close to the Chukchi language. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> languages {{are members of the}} Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family.

50|$|Europeans {{encountered}} {{many groups}} {{of indigenous peoples}} in Florida. Recorded information on various groups ranges from numerous detailed reports to {{the mere mention of}} a name. Some of the indigenous peoples were taken into the system of Spanish missions in Florida, others had sporadic contact with the Spanish without being brought into the mission system, but many of the peoples are known only from mention of their names in historical accounts. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> were essentially extinct in Florida {{by the end of the}} 18th century.|$|R
2500|$|Inside the palace, the Tsar and Tsaritsa greeted {{representatives of}} their many Muslim {{subjects}} and other non-Christian guests; protocol prohibited non-Christians from witnessing inside the cathedral.

In another room of the palace stood a group of people in normal clothes; these were descendants of people who had saved the lives of Russian rulers at one time or another.

2500|$|However, in {{addition}} to their allegiance to the Free State, there were also other factors behind Republican animosity towards the old landed class. Many, but not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> had supported the Crown forces during the War of Independence. This support was often largely moral, but sometimes it took the form of actively assisting the British in the conflict. Such attacks should have ended with the Truce of 11 July 1921, but they continued after the truce and escalated during the Civil War. In July 1922, Con Moloney, the anti-treaty IRA's Deputy Chief of Staff, ordered that unionist property should be seized to accommodate their men. The [...] "worst spell" [...] of attacks on former unionist property came in the early months of 1923, 37 [...] "big houses" [...] being burnt in January and February alone.|$|E
60|$|As we {{approached}} the town, signs of life began to appear. At intervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, and about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation. There were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse, uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look like animals. They and the women, as a rule, wore a coarse tow-linen robe that came well below the knee, and a rude sort of sandal, and many wore an iron collar. The small boys and girls were always naked; but nobody seemed to know it. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> stared at me, talked about me, ran into the huts and fetched out their families to gape at me; but nobody ever noticed that other fellow, except to make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains.|$|E

In the Germanic pre-Migration Period (i.e., before c. 300 AD) the Frisii and the related Chauci, Saxons, and Angles {{inhabited}} the Continental European coast from the Zuyder Zee to south Jutland. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> shared a common material culture, and so cannot be defined archaeologically. What little is known <b>of</b> <b>these</b> early Frisii and their kings is provided by a few Roman accounts about two Frisian kings visiting Rome in the 1st century: Malorix and Verritus. By 400 AD the Frisii abandoned the land and disappeared from archeological records.|$|R

One of those problems is administrative: an Inuk in the United States could be considered [...] "Native American," [...] "Alaskan Native or [...] "Aboriginal American. The Yupik of both Alaska and Russia generally dislike being called Inuit, which is not a word in the Yupik language nor a word which they use to describe themselves, and prefer Yupik but will tolerate Eskimo.|$|R
60|$|Madame Fribsby had, of course, {{taken the}} strongest {{interest}} in the progress of Mr. Pen's love affair with Miss Fotheringay. She had been over to Chatteris, and having seen that actress perform, had pronounced that she was old and overrated: and had talked over Master Pen's passion in her shop many and many a time to the half-dozen old maids, and old women in male clothes, who {{are to be found}} in little country towns, and who formed the genteel population of Clavering. Captain Glanders, H.P., had pronounced that Pen was going to be a devil of a fellow, and had begun early: Mrs. Glanders had told him to check his horrid observations, and to respect his own wife, if he pleased. She said it would be a lesson to Helen for her pride and absurd infatuation about that boy. Mrs. Pybus said many people were proud of very small things, and for her part, she didn't know why an apothecary's wife should give herself such airs. Mrs. Wapshot called her daughters away from that side of the street, one day when Pen, on Rebecca, was stopping at the saddler's, to get a new lash to his whip--one and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> had made visits of curiosity to Fairoaks, and had tried to condole with the widow, or bring the subject of the Fotheringay affair on the tapis, and had been severally checked by the haughty reserve of Mrs. Pendennis, supported by the frigid politeness of the Major her brother.|$|E

25|$|Their {{ultimate}} origins are {{not well}} understood. In the Germanic pre-Migration Period (i.e., before c. 300 AD) the Chauci and the related Frisians, Saxons, and Angles inhabited the Continental European coast from the Zuyder Zee to south Jutland. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> shared a common material culture, and so cannot be defined archaeologically. The Chauci originally centered on the Weser and Elbe, but in c. AD 58 they expanded westward to the River Ems by expelling the neighboring Ampsivarii, whereby they gained a border with the Frisians to the west. The Romans referred to the Chauci living between the Weser and Elbe as the 'Greater Chauci' and those living between the Ems and Weser as the 'Lesser Chauci'.|$|R
5000|$|This gives ethnic {{locations}} about 1775 {{before the}} Russians came. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> were Sunni Muslims unless otherwise noted. In the mountains {{there were some}} pre-Islamic customs. NWCLS means Northwest Caucasian Language speakers and NECLS means Northeast Caucasian Language speakers. It {{should be noted that}} the linguistic nationalities that we now recognize are somewhat artificial. Two hundred years ago a man’s loyalty was to his friends, kin, village and chief and not primarily to his language group. The difference between steppe, mountain and plain was far more important than difference of language. Only the southern half (and the southernmost part of Dagestan) had organized states, usually Persian or Turkish vassals and few, if any, <b>of</b> <b>these</b> states corresponded well to language groups.|$|R
25|$|In {{the time}} of Caesar, {{southern}} Germany was Celtic, but coming under pressure from Germanic groups led by the Suebi. As described later by Tacitus, what is today southern Germany between the Danube, the Main river, and the Rhine had been deserted by the departure of two large Celtic nations, the Helvetii in modern Schwaben and the Boii further east near the Hercynian forest. In addition, also near the Hercynian forest Caesar believed that the Celtic Tectosages had once lived. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> had {{for the most part}} moved by {{the time of}} Tacitus. Nevertheless, Cassius Dio wrote that the Suebi, who dwelt across the Rhine, were called Celts, which could mean that some Celtic groups were absorbed by larger Germanic tribal confederations.|$|R

50|$|The Bangubangu are now {{thought to}} have a shared history with other early hunters (pre-Bembe hunters) who passed through the region, {{including}} the Bembe, Buyu, northern Hemba, and Holoholo. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> share similar carving styles that venerate the ancestors. They originated in the southeast around the Lualaba River and migrated in several waves to their current location near Lake Tanganyika. Like the Hemba, they have also been greatly influenced by their contact with the Luba. During the 19th century they cooperated with Moslem slave traders from the eastern coast and helped to establish a trading post at Kabambare. The population has been seriously reduced due to wars, slavery, and sickness, resulting in very few surviving examples of Bangubangu sculpture.|$|R
