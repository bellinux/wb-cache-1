40|$|This book {{provides}} an up-to-date analytical and empirical treatment of some important interactions between <b>paid</b> <b>and</b> unpaid labour {{and the social}} economy. The emphasis on the motivations for <b>paid</b> <b>and</b> unpaid labour, and on how these factors contribute to efficiently providing social services, gives a clear empirical counterpart {{to the concept of}} social economy. The book begins with a theoretical perspective on the development <b>and</b> characteristics of <b>paid</b> <b>and</b> unpaid labour in social services. Several empirical analyses, largely using novel data sets, are then provided about these phenomena in Italy, a country which has drawn broad international attention in this field, as well as in other European countries and in the US. Topics of particular interest include: preferences regarding <b>and</b> satisfaction with <b>paid</b> <b>and</b> unpaid labour; ownership structure and risk; ownership structure, remuneration <b>and</b> incentives for <b>paid</b> labour; characteristics of volunteer labour and its relationship with social capital endowment across Italian regions; and a comparative analysis of labour in the nonprofit sector across Europe...|$|R
