40|$|Analyses of {{asbestos}} bodies {{from the general}} population have confirmed that these structures, like asbestos bodies from the lungs {{of asbestos}} workers, contain an asbestos core. In members of the general population this core is almost always an <b>amphibole,</b> whereas <b>asbestos</b> workers may have bodies formed on either amphibole or chrysotile. Most adults have a few bodies, and increasing numbers are seen in blue collar workers and others who handle small amounts of the fiber, with the highest levels being seen in asbestos workers. In men with minimal or extensive occupational exposure, asbestos bodies are formed on the commercial fibers, amosite and crocidolite, whereas women also form a significant number of bodies on the noncommercial fibers, anthophyllite and tremolite. These findings suggest that women may be exposed to specific asbestos-containing products, eg, cosmetic talc. The commercial fibers found in women and white collar men probably reflect atmospheric pollution with asbestos.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This article {{examines}} the credibility and policy implications of the "amphibole hypothesis," which postulates that (1) the mesotheliomas observed among workers exposed to chrysotile asbestos {{may be explained by}} confounding exposures to amphiboles, and (2) chrysotile may have lower carcinogenic potency than amphiboles. METHODS. A critical review was conducted of the lung burden, epidemiologic, toxicologic, and mechanistic studies that provide the basis for the amphibole hypothesis. RESULTS. Mechanistic and lung burden studies do not provide convincing evidence for the amphibole hypothesis. Toxicologic and epidemiologic studies provide strong evidence that chrysotile is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma. Chrysotile may be less potent than some amphiboles for inducing mesotheliomas, but there is little evidence to indicate lower lung cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS. Given the evidence of a significant lung cancer risk, the lack of conclusive evidence for the amphibole hypothesis, and the fact that workers are generally exposed to a mixture of fibers, we conclude that it is prudent to treat chrysotile with virtually the same level of concern as the <b>amphibole</b> forms of <b>asbestos...</b>|$|R

40|$|Virtually all {{available}} data on persistence of naturally occurring mineral fibers in human lungs have been derived {{from studies of}} asbestos fiber loads. These studies indicate that, although both <b>amphibole</b> and chrysotile <b>asbestos</b> fibers {{are found in the}} lungs of the general population and exposed workers, amphibole fibers are universally present in disproportionately large and chrysotile fibers in disproportionately small amounts compared to their known abundance in the original inhaled dusts. Why this should be remains unclear. Most reports have shown that fiber accumulation is proportional to measured exposure for amphiboles, but this is not generally true for chrysotile. Very little information is available on actual fiber clearance rates from human lungs. For amosite and crocidolite, estimated clearance half-times are measured in years to decades, whereas for chrysotile the available, rather indirect, data suggest {{that the vast majority of}} fibers are cleared within months, although some fibers may be sequestered and very slowly cleared. Overall these studies suggest that the differences between amphibole and chrysotile fiber burdens in man reflect much faster clearance of chrysotile fibers, rather than a failure of chrysotile deposition.
