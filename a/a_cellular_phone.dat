The school district also receives revenues from <b>a</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> communication tower located at the site.|$|E
25|$|While {{containers}} {{are usually}} {{made from a}} single type and color of plastic, making them relatively easy to sort, a consumer product like <b>a</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors of plastics. In such cases, the resources {{it would take to}} separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded. However, developments are taking place in the field of active disassembly, which may result in more product components being reused or recycled. Recycling certain types of plastics can be unprofitable as well. For example, polystyrene is rarely recycled because the process is usually not cost effective. These unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in landfills, incinerated or used to produce electricity at waste-to-energy plants.|$|E

25|$|A {{wireless}} network consists of nodes (each {{of which is}} a transmitter, receiver or both, depending on the system) that produce, relay or consume data within the network. For example, base stations and users in <b>a</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> network or sensor nodes in a sensor network. Before developing stochastic geometry wireless models, models are required for mathematically representing the signal propagation and the node positioning. The propagation model captures how signals propagate from transmitters to receivers. The node location or positioning model (idealizes and) represents the positions of the nodes as a point process. The choice of these models depends {{on the nature of the}} {{wireless network}} and its environment. The network type depends on such factors as the specific architecture (for instance cellular) and the channel or medium access control (MAC) protocol, which controls the channels and, hence, the communicating structures of the network. In particular, to prevent the collision of transmissions in the network, the MAC protocol dictates, based on certain rules, when transmitter-receiver pairs can access the network both in time and space, which also affects the active node positioning model.|$|E
500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o you mind if I check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed <b>a</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Kims had <b>a</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> with them, their remote {{location}} in the mountains was {{out of range of}} the cellular network, rendering the phone unusable for voice calls. [...] Despite being unusable for voice calls, their cell phone would {{play a key role in}} their rescue. [...] Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because text messaging is a store-and-forward service. [...] Two Edge Wireless engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the data logs of cell sites, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims' cellphone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006 at around 1:30a.m., the Kims' cellphone made a brief automatic connection to a cell site near Glendale, Oregon, and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as tropospheric ducting, can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the cellular tower. They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains were within a line-of-sight to the cellular tower. This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on Bear Camp Road.|$|E
