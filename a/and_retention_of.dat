The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. Sri Lankan Tamil literature on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are noted for their archaism <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> words not in everyday use in the Tamil Nadu state in India.|$|E
5|$|Judge Green {{presided over}} a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper who had been dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a consent decree that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E

5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who had the support of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from Lãm. This did not bode well for the success of the operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, McMaster's School of Medicine adopted {{progress}} testing, {{developing the}} personal progress index (PPI), a {{system based on}} progress testing invented concurrently by the University of Missouri-Kansas City's medical school and the Maastricht University. The PPI is used as an objective method for assessing acquisition <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> knowledge for students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at regular intervals to {{all students in the}} program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20 percent on their first examination, and increase by five to seven percent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting the use of the PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{carboxymethyl}} hyaluronic acid, {{carboxymethyl starch}} and carboxymethyl chitosan were successfully prepared. The characterization of carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid was identified by IR and NMR techniques. The moisture absorption <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> abilities <b>of</b> these products were examined. Results showed that carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid, {{as well as}} carboxymethyl starch and carboxymethyl chitosan, had better moisture absorption <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> abilities both at 43 and 81 % relative humidity than the corresponding polysaccharide and hyaluronic acid. It is concluded that carboxymethylation could improve greatly the moisture absorption <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> abilities <b>of</b> polysaccharides <b>and</b> that carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid, carboxymethyl starch and carboxymethyl chitosan all would be very promising {{to be used as}} moisture absorption <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> ingredients instead <b>of</b> hyaluronic acid in cosmetics and in certain other fields...|$|R
5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation {{can influence the}} deposition <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The {{warships}} of the Batavian squadron {{were all}} commissioned into the Royal Navy {{and attached to}} the squadron at the Cape, an action for which Elphinstone was criticised by the Admiralty. Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796. His flagship Monarch passed right through the French fleet of the Expédition d'Irlande during a snow storm, anchoring in a disabled state at Crookhaven on 25 December. Following his return he was made Baron Keith for his capture <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the Cape Colony. Most of the sailors and soldiers in the Dutch force were Germans and nearly all entered British service, either with the Royal Navy or the East India Company. Lucas and the Dutch officers later returned to Europe in the cartel Gertruida. One of the captured ships, HMS Dortrecht became notorious the following year when the crew mutinied at Saint Helena in imitation of the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain. Only the intervention of Captain Charles Brisbane, who threw a noose around the ringleader's neck and threatened death if the disobedience was repeated, succeeded in intimidating the rebellious seamen. In the Batavian Republic Lucas's surrender caused popular outrage. On the admiral's return he faced a court martial by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic on 11 April 1797 and an investigation by Jacobus Spoors. Lucas did not survive to see {{the conclusion of the}} trial, dying of natural causes on 21 June 1797, but he was ultimately exonerated in December 1797.|$|E

Hence we argue that response (i) is incomplete, in that its rejection of realism is only partial. 1...|$|R
