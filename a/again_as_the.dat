5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> three leading {{officers}} {{could not agree}} on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Croyle {{remained}} the Chiefs' starting {{quarterback for the}} remainder of the season despite losing all six games that he started. He was the incumbent starter heading into the 2008 regular season, but suffered a shoulder injury in the Chiefs' first game. Croyle returned in Week 7 but suffered a torn MCL and was ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season. Croyle began the 2009 season once <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Chiefs' starting quarterback, filling in for an injured Matt Cassel. Croyle was released by the Chiefs in 2011 and later signed with the Arizona Cardinals. On May 21, 2012, he announced his immediate retirement from professional football.|$|E

5|$|Fan {{interest}} in women's wrestling sunk once <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> year closed, and Sing tired of working there. Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick. WWF management asked {{her not to}} perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief. After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract. She briefly returned to Japan, but {{did not like the}} new system, which did not guarantee payouts.|$|E
5|$|Hancock did {{not long}} survive his electoral opponent. After the election, he {{remained}} on duty as {{commander of the}} Division of the Atlantic. He attended Garfield's inauguration and served loyally under him and Arthur. In 1885, he visited the Gettysburg battlefield, the site of his most famous triumph two decades earlier. Hancock died the following year, after an abscess in his leg became infected. Weaver survived both of his more popular opponents, returning to Congress for {{four years in the}} 1880s, and running for president <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> nominee of the Populist Party in 1892.|$|E
5|$|In early 1975 Merlyn Rees set up {{elections}} for the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention at which all of Northern Ireland's politicians would plan their way forward. These were held on 1 May 1975 and the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC), which had won 11 out of 12 Northern Irish seats in the February 1974 general election, won a majority <b>again.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> UUUC would not abide any form of power-sharing with the Dublin government, no agreement could be reached and the convention failed, again marginalising Northern Ireland's politicians and the communities they represented.|$|E

5|$|The {{town centre}} was {{extensively}} remodelled in the 1970s, a scheme {{financed by the}} Showering family who owned the town's cider manufactories. The scheme included a new library (in a faithful copy of a former inn, The Bunch of Grapes, which had been demolished), and a new entertainment complex called The Centre, entirely in concrete, {{on the eastern side}} of the market square. When the allegedly Roman Chi Rho amulet was found in the Fosse Lane excavations in the 1990s, the complex was renamed The Amulet in honour of the find. It has recently been renamed <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Academy.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} {{in light of}} his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E
5|$|At the 1927 election, {{with the}} {{abandonment}} of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> new party Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England.|$|E

5|$|At this point, the Australian {{commander}} {{issued a}} new operation order, reassigning {{the task of}} capturing the Christmas Hills area to the 24th Infantry Brigade and pulling the 20th Infantry Brigade back to Nongora to rest up for {{the next phase of}} the campaign, which would see them advance up the coast. The strain of the advance along the coastal route, which had been the 24th Infantry Brigade's main effort, however, had taken its toll. As a result, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion was called forward <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 2/28th was plagued by sickness and the 2/43rd was physically worn out. On the night of 4/5 December, the Japanese withdrew from their forward positions, leaving behind a large quantity of equipment and their dead. The following morning, a composite force of Australians from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions then took up the advance towards the Christmas Hills, ranging west, and undertaking a series of flanking moves in order to break into the Japanese main defensive position, where the Japanese were well-entrenched. A firefight ensued in which six Japanese and seven Australians were killed, before the Australian attack was turned back.|$|E
5|$|Chesney served <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{leader of}} Stephen's army at Wallingford Castle in 1153 and in August he was {{defeated}} by Henry of Anjou. The subsequent peace settlement, the Treaty of Wallingford, gave Henry the English throne after Stephen's death. A part of the treaty awarded control of Oxford Castle to Roger de Bussy. Although Chesney had {{lost control of the}} castle, none of his lands were confiscated. Early in 1154, Chesney was with Henry, as he was a witness on two charters of Henry's. After Henry's ascension to the throne, Chesney came to terms with the new king, and received confirmation of his lands from the king by 1157. He spent time in Normandy with Henry from 1159 through to 1161. He continued to receive favours from the king, such as exemption for payment of danegeld on his manor of Deddington in 1156.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2003–04 season, Arsenal were {{determined}} to reclaim the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together {{with the likes of}} Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pirès, Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten, claiming the league title in the process. Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year, Henry emerged once <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award. With 39 goals scored in all competitions, the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the European Golden Boot. However, {{as was the case in}} 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone which affected Hawaii as a tropical storm. The fifth named storm of the busy 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Darby originated from a low pressure area that developed in the Eastern Pacific well southwest of Mexico during July2016. It gained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression on July11, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Darby the next day. Further intensification ensued, and Darby became a hurricane on July13. Over the next three days, Darby slowly strengthened to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale, becoming a major hurricane. Cool waters and dry air caused Darby to weaken {{over the next three}} days, although Darby managed to restrengthen slightly on July21 before weakening once <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> storm neared Hawaii. Just after midnight on July24 (UTC; 2:00p.m. on July23 HST), Darby made landfall on the Big Island, and weakened into a remnant low two days later.|$|E
5|$|In Bobby Petrino's {{first visit}} to Tuscaloosa as a head coach, Alabama opened conference play by {{defeating}} the Arkansas Razorbacks 35–7. After a scoreless first quarter, two big touchdown plays, a 52-yard run by Trent Richardson and a 50-yard pass from Greg McElroy to Julio Jones, had the Tide up 14–0 at the half. Arkansas responded early {{in the third quarter}} and cut the lead to 14–7 after Ryan Mallett hit Greg Childs for an 18-yard touchdown reception; the Hogs would not reach the end zone <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Tide responded with three unanswered touchdowns. Bama scored first on an 80-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Marquis Maze followed with two touchdowns by Mark Ingram, one on a 14-yard pass from McElroy and one on a 2-yard run, bringing the final score to 35–7.|$|E
5|$|In Somerset, NY148 {{remains a}} two-lane roadway, passing through sparsely {{developed}} areas {{on its way}} to the village of Barker. In the southern part of the community, the route meets Coleman and West Somerset roads (CR2 and CR3, respectively). Through Barker, NY148 is a two-lane residential street, passing west of Barker Free Library and east of Barker High School. After Haight Road, NY148 leaves the village, continuing north through a lightly populated area. At Arlington Road, the number of homes along NY148 rises once <b>again</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> route enters the hamlet of Somerset, located at the junction of NY148 and NY18 (Lake Road). This junction serves as the northern terminus of NY148, while CR15 continues north through Somerset towards Lake Ontario.|$|E
