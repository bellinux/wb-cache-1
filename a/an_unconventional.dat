40|$|We {{propose that}} {{unconventional}} superconductivity in hydrated sodium cobaltate Na_xCoO_ 2 results from an interplay of electronic correlations and electron-phonon interactions.

5|$|A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with <b>an</b> <b>unconventional</b> lifestyle, Creangă made {{an early}} impact as an {{innovative}} educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Free and Independent Faction.

5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting.

From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be <b>an</b> <b>unconventional</b> zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E
