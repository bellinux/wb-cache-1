5|$|The Kalimpong municipality, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1945, {{is in charge of}} the infrastructure of the town such as potable water and roads. The municipal area is divided into twenty-three wards. Kalimpong municipality is constructing additional water storage tanks to meet the requirement of potable water, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> an increase of water supply from the 'Neora Khola Water Supply Scheme' for this purpose. Often, landslides occurring in monsoon season cause havoc to the roads in and around Kalimpong. The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (WBSEDCL) that provides electricity here, needs to resolve issues like voltage fluctuations, unstable electrical supply and faulty electrical meters etc. faced by people of Kalimpong. Renewable Energy Development Agency of the state has plans to promote usage of solar street lights in Kalimpong and proposed an energy park here to sell renewable energy gadgets. The Public Works Department is responsible for the road connecting the town to the National Highway–NH-31A. The Kalimpong municipality has a total of 10 health care units, with a total of 433 bed capacity.|$|E

The 1972 Watergate disclosures, it is true, were made by only a score {{of the members of the}} mass media, but I remember Teapot Dome when only one of our 1,750 dailies (the Albuquerque Morning Journal) dared to tell the truth about White House corruption.

25|$|The primary urge {{to breathe}} is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people {{the first sign of}} low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{achieves}} {{its height}} {{in the water}} column by synthesising gas vesicles. As the cell rises up, it is able to increase its carbohydrate load through increased photosynthesis. Too high and the cell will suffer photobleaching and possible death, however, the carbohydrate produced during photosynthesis increases the cell's density, causing it to sink. The daily cycle of carbohydrate build-up from photosynthesis and carbohydrate catabolism during dark hours is enough to fine-tune the cell's position {{in the water column}}, bring it up toward the surface when its carbohydrate levels are low <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to photosynthesis, and allowing it to sink away from the harmful UV radiation when the cell's carbohydrate levels have been replenished. An extreme excess of carbohydrate causes a significant change in the internal pressure of the cell, which causes the gas vesicles to buckle and collapse and the cell to sink out.|$|E

The restriction cooperated and angled votes in favor of each other to reinforce their energy. Furthermore, PKR has exited from the shadow of Anwar while Anwar demonstrated his charm that effectively transformed the gathering into an ordinary political gathering and another constrain. Malaysia would have another face after the political tidal wave. The energy of BN coalition has declined <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to depend on Sabah, Sarawak and Southern Malaysia to keep up its decision control. There will be real authority changes in UMNO, MCA, MIC and Gerakan. What's more, the belief systems of BN coalition's segment parties must be balanced. Relinquishing racial segment would be an exit plan. With respect to the resistance, they won't not {{have the capacity to}} deal with to sudden triumph in the decisions, particularly for DAP and Keadilan who won control of states and extended their impacts in the Parliament ought to.|$|E

After completing the score for The Day After Tomorrow, Kloser was chosen by Anderson as he {{is a fan of}} the franchises. It was recorded in London, and was primarily orchestral as Anderson commented, [...] "this is a terrifying movie <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> a terrifying, classic movie score to go with it; at the same time it's got huge action so it needs that kind of proper orchestral support." ...|$|E
500|$|As a young man, Kubrick {{was fascinated}} by the films of Soviet filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. Kubrick read Pudovkin's seminal {{theoretical}} work, Film Technique, which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to be employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest. Kubrick recommended this work to others for many years. Thomas Nelson describes this book as [...] "the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [...] private aesthetics". Kubrick also found the ideas of Konstantin Stanislavski to be essential to his understanding the basics of directing, and gave himself a crash course to learn his methods.|$|E
500|$|Many politicians, {{mostly from}} the Labor {{government}} of New South Wales, reacted to the security breach with concern and unease. Police Minister David Andrew Campbell expressed disappointment and concern over the stunt, arguing that there were [...] "21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to be taken seriously". Then New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma said {{that while he was}} a fan of the show, those involved would have to face the full force of the law.

500|$|The Punk Goes Acoustic {{version of}} [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] {{attracted}} little attention from fans, and McIlrath {{believed that the}} song had [...] "died out". When Rise Against signed with Dreamworks Records in late 2003, a Dreamworks executive told the band that they should rerecord the song for their upcoming album, Siren Song of the Counter Culture, to which the band agreed to. When brought to producer Garth Richardson, {{he felt that the}} song was incomplete, commenting: [...] "It's just too short. It's almost like a jingle <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> another part." [...] McIlrath decided to elaborate on the song, and used one of Sheryl Crow's guitars he found in the studio to add an instrumental bridge. This version of the song was included in Siren Song of the Counter Culture.|$|E
500|$|Formby's {{final year}} of work was 1960. That May he {{recorded}} his last session of songs, [...] "Happy Go Lucky Me" [...] and [...] "Banjo Boy", the former of which peaked at number 40 in the UK Singles Chart. He then spent the summer season at the Queen's Theatre in Blackpool in The Time of Your Life—a performance which was also broadcast by the BBC. One of the acts in the show was the singer Yana, with whom Formby had an affair, made easier because of Beryl's absence from the theatre through illness. His final televised performance, a 35-minute BBC programme, The Friday Show: George Formby, was aired on 16 December. Bret considers the programme to be Formby's [...] "greatest performance—it was certainly his most sincere", although reviewing for The Guardian, Mary Crozier thought it [...] "too slow". She {{went on to say}} [...] "George Formby is really a music-hall star, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> the warmth and sociability of the theatre to bring out his full appeal". Beryl's illness was worsening. Worn down by the strain, and feeling the need to escape, Formby took the part of Mr Wu in Aladdin in Bristol, having turned down a more lucrative part in Blackpool.|$|E

2500|$|Khalīl further {{argues that}} the only reason the hamza in al- is ever dropped is not that it is {{volatile}} but that it is used too much. When asked why the lām in al- was not simply given a vowel if it is so heavily used <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to be easier to pronounce, followers of Khalīl said that if the lām had been given a fatḥa, it would have been confused with the asseverative-cum-precative particle. Had it been given a kasra, it would have been confused with the genitival particle. It could not have been given a ḍamma for fear of the following vowel being a kasra or ḍamma (which would result in awkward pronunciations as in [...] *lu-ibil or [...] *lu-‘unuq).|$|E
2500|$|Ryan {{helped to}} renew the {{national}} debate on capital punishment when, as governor, he declared a moratorium on his state's death penalty in 2000. [...] "We have now freed more people than we have put to death under our system," [...] he said. [...] "There is a flaw in the system, without question, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to be studied." [...] At the time, Illinois had executed 12 people since the reinstatement {{of the death penalty}} in 1977, with one execution, that of Ripper Crew member Andrew Kokoraleis, occurring early during Ryan's term. Ryan refused to meet with religious leaders and others regarding [...] "a stay of execution" [...] in light of the impending 'moratorium' and other facts relative to the 'flawed' capital punishment system in Illinois; in fact, under Ryan's governorship, 13 people were released from jail after appealing their convictions based on new evidence. Ryan called for a commission to study the issue, while noting, [...] "I still believe the death penalty is a proper response to heinous crimes ... But I believe {{that it has to be}} where we don't put innocent people to death." ...|$|E

Bipolar means up and down and that's me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on sodium valproate for seven years.... I couldn't get to sleep and I didn't make love for seven years. My hair fell out and I couldn't pick up a book as I couldn't concentrate. I didn't write a song or pick up a guitar in that time – and piled on the weight. I {{might as well have been}} dead. I work very closely with my GP and any decisions I make are made with him". During an interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, he declared that [...] "mental health needs a great deal of attention. It's the final taboo <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to be faced and dealt with." [...] Ant is involved in the Black Dog campaign, which promotes better understanding of mental illness.|$|E
