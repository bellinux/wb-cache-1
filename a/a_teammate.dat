5|$|Bradley played {{baseball}} at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, and was <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of Chase Utley. After graduating {{high school with}} a 3.7 grade point average, he committed to California State University, Long Beach, but instead signed with the Expos on July 1, 1996 after being drafted by the team {{in the second round}} of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft.|$|E
5|$|Fred Heimach, <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of Pennock, {{once called}} him the smartest ball player he knew. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig {{included}} Pennock in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. He was inducted in the International League Hall of Fame in 1948. Noted baseball photographer Charles M. Conlon considered Pennock {{one of his favorite}} subjects to photograph.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of Jackson State University, he was <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of Walter Payton. Drafted {{in the third}} round of the 1976 NFL Draft, Slater seldom played his first few years before starting in 1979. Known as the most consistent member {{of one of the most}} potent offensive lines in NFL history, Slater was selected to seven Pro Bowls and broke a record for most seasons with one team. His jersey number was retired, and he was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.|$|E

5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume the {{following}} season, Salo signed another two-year contract with the Canucks at $1.5 million per season. He was limited to 59 games in the subsequent 2005–06 season, suffering a shoulder injury with the Finnish national team during the 2006 Winter Olympics, colliding with <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> during a line change. He recorded 10 goals and 33 points with the Canucks, second among team defencemen in scoring. His 23 assists were also a career-high.|$|E
5|$|During the Australian {{summer of}} 194748, Johnston played {{in four of}} the five Tests against the touring Indian cricket team. He was a major part in Australia's 40 series win; the second highest wicket-taker with 16 scalps, Johnston had the best bowling average of 11.37. Ray Lindwall led the wicket-takers with 18. As a result, Johnston was {{selected}} for the 1948 tour of England. During the trip, Johnston roomed with Doug Ring who was <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> in the Richmond and Victorian cricket teams. As Ring was a leg spinner, he and Johnston were in direct competition for a place in the playing XI.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>teammate</b> Christian Atsu, Kelvin {{was sent}} on loan to fellow Primeira Liga side Rio Ave F.C. for the 2011-12 campaign. He made his {{debut in the}} {{competition}} on 21 August 2011, in a 0-1 away loss against Académica de Coimbra.|$|R

50|$|Born in Arbúcies, Girona, Catalonia, to Senegalese parents, Keita came {{up through}} the FC Barcelona's youth academy. In 2010, Keita {{travelled}} with the Barcelona youth team to Qatar for a tournament, where he played a practical joke by placing an ice-cube in <b>a</b> <b>teammate's</b> bed.|$|R
5|$|Moran {{finished}} {{his career with}} the Bulldogs, retiring after the NHA's last season. He played four more seasons, during which he played 69games, winning 34 of them. Over his career, Moran's teams often had losing records, or they had a winning percentage barely over 50%. Some hockey legends often recalls that he was the best goaltender of them all. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1958, with the help of Senator Chubby Power, once <b>a</b> <b>teammate.</b> He is still the earliest goaltender in HHOF, starting his senior hockey venture in 1901.|$|E
5|$|The Bob Feller Museum {{opened in}} Van Meter, Iowa, on June 10, 1995. Designed by Feller's son Stephen, on land donated by Brenton Banks, {{the museum has}} two rooms that contain Feller memorabilia and items from his own collection. The Feller bat used by Babe Ruth {{when he made his}} last public {{appearance}} at Yankee Stadium is at the museum. Feller said <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> had stolen the bat and eventually it was purchased by the sports card company Upper Deck for $107,000. Feller later offered the company $95,000 in return for the bat.|$|E
5|$|While Smith was {{attending}} junior high school, his parents divorced. Continuing {{to pursue his}} interest in baseball, he would ride the bus {{for nearly an hour}} to reach Dodger Stadium, cheering for the Los Angeles Dodgers at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at Locke High School, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of future National Basketball Association player Marques Johnson on the basketball team, and <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player Eddie Murray on the baseball side. After high school Smith attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to walk-on to the baseball team. In addition to his academic education, he learned to switch-hit from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr. When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role. Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career at bats (754) and career stolen bases (110) before graduating in 1977.|$|E
50|$|Robinson {{attended}} McClymonds High School in Oakland, California, {{where he}} was <b>a</b> basketball <b>teammate</b> of Bill Russell. He was <b>a</b> baseball <b>teammate</b> of Vada Pinson and Curt Flood. While playing for the Reds in the late 1950s, he attended Xavier University in Cincinnati during the off-season.|$|R
500|$|Carlisle's 1912 record {{included}} a 27–6 victory over Army. In that game, Thorpe's 92-yard touchdown was nullified by <b>a</b> <b>teammate's</b> penalty, {{but on the}} next play Thorpe rushed for a 97-yard touchdown. Future President Dwight Eisenhower, who played against him that season, recalled of Thorpe in a 1961 speech: ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{his last}} season of {{significant}} productivity. Jaha played in just 33 games in 2000, fewer the following year. A popular figure in the Oakland Athletics clubhouse, he drew a standing ovation from his <b>A's</b> <b>teammates</b> when he announced his retirement on June 30, 2001. Jaha is of Lebanese descent.|$|R
5|$|At Trotwood, he was <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of Shaw and Brandon Moore {{who would}} later join him at Michigan. As a junior in 2006, he posted 48 receptions for 851 yards, and as a senior, he totalled 868 on 52 catches. His {{four-year}} totals were 165 receptions for 2,637 yards and 28 touchdowns. As a senior, he was selected to the Division II first-team all-state squad, and named Ohio's offensive player of the year. He was also chosen {{to play in the}} Big 33 Football Classic, and ranked as the number 44, 89, and 104 wide receiver in the nation by Rivals.com, Scout.com, and ESPN, respectively. In that same year, Trotwood won their first playoff game since 1981, led by Roundtree's 13 receptions, 203 yards, and game-winning touchdown. Roundtree feels that his best game in high school was a 12-reception, 221-yard, 2-touchdown performance that helped his team overcome a 210 deficit.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to <b>a</b> <b>teammate,</b> and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try {{to regain control of}} the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E
5|$|Goaltenders {{have participated}} in the offence, albeit in a limited way, since the {{earliest}} days of the sport. Before the creation of the NHL in 1917, there were some instances recorded of goaltenders rushing down the ice to participate in the play, occasionally scoring a goal. This practice has since been outlawed (goalies are not allowed to cross the centre red line to play the puck) after the Toronto Maple Leafs' Gary Smith was injured on such a rush in the 196667 NHL season. During the history of the league, there had been some near-misses by goaltenders, including attempts by Chuck Rayner by aiming at the empty net, or joining the attack. In 1977, Rogatien Vachon briefly became the first goaltender to score a goal after being credited following an own goal by the opponent, before it was given instead to <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> by later video review.|$|E
50|$|John Heisman's Georgia Tech beat NC State 128 to 0 on Grant Field. State's only {{highlight}} came in {{the third}} quarter, when Ripple recovered <b>a</b> <b>teammate's</b> fumble and returned the ball 75 yards for a touchdown. However, it was called back due to an offsides penalty. Camp attended that game.|$|R
50|$|During the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, {{in a group}} {{match between}} Ghana and Guinea, Badu flipped up <b>a</b> <b>teammate's</b> pass from just outside the penalty area and {{launched}} a mid-air volley to score a goal that was later nominated for the 2012 FIFA Puskás Award (FIFA's global Goal of the Year award).|$|R
50|$|Due to Naofumi's lack of {{charisma}} and experience, {{he ended up}} with only <b>a</b> single <b>teammate,</b> <b>a</b> beautiful woman, while others had several. Unfortunately, on his third day Naofumi was betrayed, falsely accused, and robbed by the said teammate.|$|R
5|$|Having failed as a spin bowler in a {{trial at}} Richmond in 1950, Meckiff {{switched}} to fast bowling in 1951–52 when he began his district career in Victorian Premier Cricket with South Melbourne. He started in the Fourth XI after his brother had to withdraw from a match. The following summer, aged 17, Meckiff was in the senior team and played in South Melbourne's first championship-winning side in his debut season in the First XI, although his club career was sometimes interrupted by national service in the reserves. After receiving requests from cricket administrators, the military authorities scheduled the leave of young players for weekends, so that the impact on their careers would be minimised. At the time, Australia lacked bowlers of great pace, so <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> advised Meckiff to bowl {{as fast as he}} could, without regard for accuracy—a plan he successfully adopted.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard was {{a talented}} cricketer, and played {{for a number}} of teams, {{including}} Hampshire, London County, and Marylebone Cricket Club. A right-arm fast bowler, he made his début in the first class game when he played for Hampshire against Somerset in the 1900 County Championship. He was not however a strong batsman, and would typically play in the tail of the batting order. He joined the short-lived London County in 1902, where he was <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of W. G. Grace. In 1903 he played his first of several games for The Gentlemen v The Players at Lords. He would be selected for The Gentleman three years in succession. In 1904, he joined the MCC, and took part in Lord Brackley's XI's tour of the West Indies in the 1904/5 season. In 1907, he toured the United States with the MCC.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Chandler {{pitched a}} no-hitter for Grafton, North Dakota's {{team in the}} Red River Valley League. He {{attended}} a professional baseball tryout in Saskatoon, but {{did not make the}} team. He returned to Transylvania and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in June 1921. He then signed with the Class D baseball team the Lexington Reds, where he was <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of future Hall of Famer Earle Combs. Briefly considering a career in baseball, he finally decided to study law. He entered Harvard Law School that same year, paying his way by coaching high school sports in Wellesley, Massachusetts. His former teammate Charlie Moran, then coaching the Centre College Praying Colonels football team in Danville, Kentucky, asked him to scout the national powerhouse Harvard Crimson, an upcoming opponent for Centre. Chandler took copious notes for Moran, and Centre defeated Harvard 6–0 in what {{is considered one of the}} greatest college football upsets of all time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Robots {{are added}} to human teams to {{increase}} the team’s skills or capabilities. To gain {{the acceptance of the}} human teammates, it may be important for the robot to behave in a manner that the teammates consider trustworthy. We present an approach that allows a robot’s behavior to be adapted so that it behaves in a trustworthy manner. The adaptation is guided by an inverse trust metric that the robot uses to estimate the trust <b>a</b> human <b>teammate</b> has in it. We evaluate our method in a simulated robotics domains and demonstrate how the agent can adapt to <b>a</b> <b>teammate’s</b> preferences...|$|R

5|$|In October 2013 Van Dijk {{announced}} that she signed a three-year contract with Boels Dolmans Cycling Team. She is <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of among others Lizzie Armitstead, Katarzyna Pawłowska and Christine Majerus. The time trial at the 2016 Summer Olympics will be her big goal. She will keep her focus on time trials, world cup races and flat short stage races. Due to her focus on road cycling, she will not compete on the track. Van Dijk {{was not able to}} start in the Ladies Tour of Qatar because she did not recover in time from an illness after riding mountainbikerace Egmond-pier-Egmond. She got back her shape during the first races and just missed the podium in the GP Le Samyn. At the first World Cup race of the season, the Ronde van Drenthe, Van Dijk helped teammate Lizzie Armitstead to victory by closing a massive gap in the final of the race.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> of Cody's, said: He was a {{great big}} fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously {{dedicated}} fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{up to the}} {{national}} junior team, Getzlaf made his first of two appearances at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 2004. He recorded six points in six games for a Canadian squad that scored 25 goals in its four round-robin games and surrendered only four {{en route to a}} gold medal showdown with the United States. With Canada leading 3–1 early in the third period of the final, both Getzlaf and Sidney Crosby failed to capitalize on opportunities to add an extra goal that may have sealed a victory. Instead, Canada surrendered the lead, and Getzlaf and his teammates were forced to settle for the silver medal after goaltender Marc-André Fleury accidentally sent a clearing pass off <b>a</b> <b>teammate</b> and into his own net for the game-winning goal.|$|E
