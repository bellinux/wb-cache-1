40|$|Abstract. Nitric acid {{production}} plants emit {{small amounts}} of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the environment. As the regulatory authorities demand {{the reduction of the}} resulting air pollution, existing plants are looking for economical ways to comply with this demand. Several Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models were trained from several months of operating plant data to predict the NOx concentration in the tail gas, and their total amount emitted the environment. The training of the ANN model was done by the Guterman-Boger algorithm set that generates a non-random initial connection weights, suggests a small number of hidden neurons, avoids, and escapes from, local minima encountered during the training. The ANN models gave small errors, 0. 6 % relative error on the NOx concentration prediction and 0. 006 kg/hour on daily emission in the 20 - 45 kg NOx/hour range. Knowledge extraction from the trained ANN models revealed the underlying relationships between the plant operating variables and the NOx emission rate, especially the beneficial effect of cooling the absorbed gas and reticulating liquids in the <b>absorption</b> <b>towers.</b> Clustering the data by the patterns of the hidden neurons outputs of auto-associative ANN models of the same data revealed interesting insights...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to study a {{proposed}} air pollution control (APC) system designed to treat flue gases produced during the combustion of waste derived syngas. In order to achieve this objective, a literature study was done to gain insight into the pollution formation during gasification and combustion of syngas, and {{a model of the}} APC system was built using the Aspen Plus software. This model was used in four different case studies aimed at optimizing the water and chemical requirements throughout the system. Several different types of wastes were considered; municipal solid waste (MSW) representing that which is normally generated in developed countries, MSW representing that which is normally generated in developing countries, a waste composition representing that of the plastic fraction of MSW, and a waste composition representing that of the biomass fraction of MSW.   Based on the results of the literature study, a few conclusions could be drawn. Sulfur compounds could be expected {{to be found in the}} form of H 2 S in the syngas and SO 2 in the flue gases. Chlorine compounds could be expected to be found in the form of HCl and the nitrogen compounds in the form of NH 3, HCN and N 2 after gasification and NO after combustion. The amount of research done in the area of MSW gasification, and combustion of MSW based syngas, is, however, small, and more research is needed.   Based on the results of the case studies, the amount of NaOH varied greatly depending on flue gas composition and negligibly depending on recirculation setup. The total amount of water required varied notably between the different cases studied and no case stood out clearly as the optimal case for all four waste compositions. The case studies seemed to indicate a trend towards an increased total water requirement with an increase in the amount recirculation.

The plate liquid desiccant air-conditioning system (LDACS) is a promising dehumidification alternative to traditional air-conditioning system for lower energy consumption and less pollution. The shrinkage of the falling film on working plates critically influences the dehumidification performance by affecting the wetting area and film thickness. This paper developed {{a new model of}} plate dehumidifier concerning the shrinkage shape and the variable film thickness of falling film. The new model was validated by experiments and compared with existing models. The results indicated that the effect of contact angles on dehumidification performance can be accurately predicted. The moisture removal rates increased rapidly from 2. 0 g/kg to 2. 56 g/kg as the contact angles decreased from 85 ° to 5 °, while the wetting area increased from 0. 145 m 2 to 0. 176 m 2. The distribution of the humidity ratio of process air along flow direction with different contact angles was also simulated. Besides, the average film thickness decreased from 0. 952 mm to 0. 889 mm as the contact angles decreased from 85 ° to 5 °. The annual electricity consumption of plate LDACS with different contact angles for a typical building in Hong Kong was estimated and analysed by using the newly developed model.

40|$|The {{cooling system}} with liquid {{desiccant}} dehumidification is an energy-efficient and eco-friendly {{solution for the}} ever-increasing energy consumption and environmental impact of modern buildings. By significantly influencing the wetted area, the contact angle of the liquid-air interface {{is critical to the}} performance of desiccant dehumidification. In this study, to enhance heat and mass transfer performance, a new approach was developed with a titanium dioxide superhydrophilic self-cleaning coating on the dehumidifier surfaces that was made of a highly dispersed paste with nanoscale titanium dioxide particles and activated with ultraviolet light. We first tested the effect of the coatings on samples made of three commonly used materials, SUS 304, SUS 316, and SUS 410, with a 30 % LiBr solution and deionized water. Results show that the contact angle on the coated samples dramatically decreased to only 1 / 7 for water and 1 / 6 for the LiBr solution compared to uncoated samples. The durability of the coatings was studied experimentally by repeatedly immersing the samples in 30 % LiBr, exposing them for 2 months, and reactivating them. It was found that the angle changed slightly for SUS 304 / 316 samples with good anticorrosion performance, whereas the angle increased by 10 °- 20 ° for SUS 410 samples due to the accelerated catalytic oxidization of the Titanium dioxide coating, which could possibly be solved by precoating an SiO 2 compact layer. Furthermore, we found numerically that the wetted area during desiccant dehumidification could be effectively increased by 5 - 7 times with the coating. Accordingly, the heat exchange rate and moisture removal rate between the air and the desiccant could be increased by 1. 2 and 2 times, respectively. Therefore, by dramatically reducing the desiccant contact angle on dehumidifier surfaces and enlarging the wetted area accordingly, the titanium dioxide self-cleaning coating could significantly improve the heat and mass transfer performance of liquid desiccant dehumidification, especially the mass transfer performance. The coatings' manufacture is cheap and facile for industrialization. This measure can be considered an effective and economic way to improve the performance of a dehumidifier and also has other applications in heat exchangers, evaporators, and <b>absorption</b> <b>towers.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
