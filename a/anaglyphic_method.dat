40|$|Stereoscopy is a {{technique}} that can create an illusion of depth in a flat image. There are many different methods to do this, and here is explained {{some of the most}} common and popular ways, with a bigger focus on the <b>anaglyphic</b> <b>method.</b> Since stereoscopy is an old technique, the discovery of it by Charles Wheatstone is explained briefly. In Autodesk Maya 2009, a new stereoscopic plug-in was included which makes the creation of stereoscopic imagery easier. An animated project is made {{during the course of this}} research which takes advantage of and tests the functions of the new plug-in. The main purpose of the project is to create a stereoscopic movie which utilized the anaglyph stereoscopic technique. The result is rendered stereoscopic material that is edited with Adobe Premiere Pro to create anaglyphic imagery and a full color alternative using the Infitec technique...|$|E
40|$|The microsurgical {{anatomy of}} {{cerebellar}} peduncles and {{their relationships with}} neighbouring fasciculi were investigated by using a fibre dissection technique. As the dissection progressed, photographs of each progressive layer were obtained and stereoscopic images were created using the 3 D <b>anaglyphic</b> <b>method.</b> These findings provided the anatomical basis for a conceptual division of cerebellar peduncles into segments. The middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) was divided into two segments: cisternal and intracerebellar segments. The inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) was divided into three segments: cisternal, ventricular and intracerebellar segments. The superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) was divided into three segments: intracerebellar, intermediate and intrategmental segments. The fibre dissection technique disclosed a constant course of peduncular fibres inside the white core of the cerebellum. The pontocerebellar fibres of the MCP pass over and laterally to the bundles of the ICP and SCP. The centripetal fibres of the ICP wrap around the radiation of the SCP and the dentate nucleus, directed towards the cortex of the vermis. The centrifugal bundle of the SCP ascends towards the mesencephalon where it sinks passing below the fibres the lateral lemniscus. The knowledge gained by studying the intrinsic anatomy of the cerebellum is useful to accomplish appropriate surgical planning and, ultimately, to understand the repercussions of surgical procedures on the white matter tracts in this region.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of macro biomolecular {{structure and function}} is veryimportant in the biological and biochemical system. Because of macrobiomolecular complexity, {{it is difficult to}} observe and analyze their threedimension conformations and quaternary structures. In order to solve theseproblems, we can use picture presentation to study and compare the structuresof macro biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive of the Brookhaven National Laboratory(BNL) is a computer-based archival file for macromolecular structures. The Bankstores in a uniform format atomic coordinates and partial bond connectivities,as derived from crystallographic and NMR studies. For a number of years, thePDB has been available on the internet for access via FTP, more recentlythrough Gopher, and now via WWW. These tools provided access to the individualentries of PDB and allowed limited searches of the data bank. We develop a personal computer based program which can read in molecularcoordinate files in PDB formats and interactively displays the molecule on themonitor screen. This program is written in the Visual Basic language and usesthe Windows graphics user interface. The Program can run on IBM PC compatiblepersonal computers under Microsoft Windows 3. X, Windows 95 and Windows NTsystems. This program uses chromatic anaglyph method to display stereo macrobiomolecular structures. Using this program, each macro biomolecule can beviewed in three dimensional model and can be moved, scaled and rotated aboutthree orthogonal axes. 在分子生物以及生物化學廣大的範疇中，一項頗為重要的課題便是研 究生物組成分子構造與功能間的相關性。由於生物分子非常的複雜，不論 研究與觀察均相當不易，利用圖形的展現，將可以方便研究人員﹑教師以 及學生進行研究﹑教學﹑學習以及表達展示。 運用計算機圖學（ computer graphics ）技術，我們可以將生物分子視覺化，以三維圖形表 示方式顯示生物分子於電腦螢幕上供使用者觀察。 為了達到此一目的， 首先必須獲得生物分子構造的相關資料，另外還需要能將這些資料視覺化 的電腦軟硬體設備。 蛋白質資料庫（ protein data bank, PDB ）是一個利用電腦存取檔案為基礎所建立之生物巨分子（ macro biomolecules ）結構及相關資料的資料庫， 此資料庫並提供網際網路（ Internet ）檢索服務， 利用檔案傳輸功能可以方便的將檢索獲得資 料下載（download ）以利進一步的分析。 本研究便是利用蛋白質資料庫格式檔案（ PDB file ）做為資料來源製 作一套可以呈現生物巨分子的應用軟體。 此軟體是以 Visual Basic 語 言撰寫而成，為一套可使用於個人家用電腦，以 Windows 3.

40|$|Many cartographers {{are making}} an effort to depict mountainous steep relief on {{classical}} maps. There are many techniques that enable achieving this goal effectively. However nowadays we notice a trend toward 3 D realistic representation of relief, using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from aerial photographs or satellite imagery. They are very useful and sufficient for visualizing and modeling various terrain features - from flat to hilly. Nevertheless the mountainous terrain is very problematic, as very steep slopes cannot be seen and depicted from bird'. That is why an alternative method should be used to gather information and visualize terrain with vertical relief, otherwise information about such areas is omitted or very poor (Butler et al. 1998; Gooch et al. 1999; Buchroithner 2002; Mergili 2007). The aper resents ossible pplication of close-range photogrammetry for mapping and visualization of steep (close to vertical) rock walls. In this way integration of photogrammetry, digital cartography and photorealism meets the needs of information systems for climbers and tourism in general. Technology and software is similar to that being used in aerial photogrammetry, but some differences in concept should be considered in order to generate spatial model in horizontal projection, so called quasi-DEM. The research object is a part of natural climbing wall situated in Krakow, Poland. The surface is approximately vertical, with some parts which are overhung. It is also very rough, so many shades appear. For the creation of quasi-DEM, quasi-orthophoto and virtual rock face, 4 overlapping photographs were taken with Nikon D 80 amateur digital camera. Object distance was about 5. 5 m, and ground resolution about 1. 8 mm. The camera was previously calibrated with ImageMaster software by Topcon and known parameters of the camera lens allowed the removal of the distortion from the images. ERDAS LPS (Leica Photogrammetry Suite) was used to perform photogrammetric processing. In order to demonstrate the potential of the technique, some steps used by climbers are marked, and <b>anaglyphic</b> <b>methods</b> facilitate a three dimensional perception. That can help inexperienced climbers to plan their route and prepare for the real experience...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The infratemporal fossa (ITF) is a {{continuation}} of the temporal fossa between the internal surface of the zygoma and the external surface of the temporal bone and greater wing of the sphenoid bone that is sitting deep to the ramus of the mandible. The principal structure to understanding its relationships is the lateral pterygoid muscle. Other important structures are the medial pterygoid muscle, the maxillary artery, the pterygoid venous plexus, the otic ganglion, the chorda tympani nerve and the mandibular nerve. In this study, we describe the microsurgical anatomy of the ITF, as viewed by step-by-step anatomical dissection and also through the perspective of three lateral approaches and one anterior surgical approach. Methods: Eight cadaver specimens were dissected. In one side of all specimens, an anatomical dissection was done in which a wide preauricular incision from the neck on the anterior border of the sternoclidomastoid muscle {{at the level of the}} cricoid cartilage to the superior temporal line was made. The flap was displaced anteriorly and the structures of the neck were dissected followed by a zygomatic osteotomy and dissection of the ITF structures. On the other side were the surgical approaches to the ITF. The combined infratemporal and posterior fossa approach was done in two specimens, the subtemporal preauricular infratemporal fossa approach in two, the zygomatic approach in two, and the lateral transantral maxillotomy in two. The anatomical dissections were documented on the three-dimensional (3 D) <b>anaglyphic</b> <b>method</b> to produce stereoscopic prints. Results: The lateral pterygoid muscle is one of the principal structures to enable understanding of the relationships into the ITF. The tendon of the temporal muscle inserts in the coronoid process at the ITF. The maxillary artery is the terminal branch of the external carotid artery that originates at the neck of the mandible and runs into the parotid gland. In our dissections the maxillary artery was lateral to the buccal, lingual, and inferior alveolar nerves. We found the second part of the maxillary artery superficial to the lateral pterygoid muscle in all specimens The anterior and posterior branches of the deep temporal artery supply the temporal muscle. In two cases we found a middle deep temporal artery. The different approaches that we used provided different views of the same anatomical landmarks and this provides not only safer surgery but also the best choice to approach the ITF according with the pathology extension. Conclusions: The ITF is a complex region on the skull base that is affected by benign and malignant tumors. The study through different routes is helpful to disclose the relationship among the anatomical structures. Although the authors have shown four approaches, there are a variety of approaches and even a combination of these can be used. This type of anatomical knowledge is essential to choosing the best approach to treat lesions in this area...|$|E
