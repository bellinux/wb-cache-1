There are 82,870 German Americans in the city, making up over one-fifth (23.1%) of the population. The Scandinavian-American population is primarily Norwegian and Swedish. There are 39,103 Norwegian Americans, making up 10.9% of the population; there are 30,349 Swedish Americans, making up 8.5% of the city's population. Danish Americans <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as numerous; there are 4,434 Danish Americans, making up only 1.3% of the population.

25|$|Although the {{strength}} of individual CNT shells is extremely high, weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes lead to significant reduction in the effective strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles down to only a few GPa. This limitation has been recently addressed by applying high-energy electron irradiation, which crosslinks inner shells and tubes, and effectively increases {{the strength}} of these materials to ≈60 GPa for multi-walled carbon nanotubes and ≈17 GPa for double-walled carbon nanotube bundles. CNTs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as strong under compression. Because of their hollow structure and high aspect ratio, they tend to undergo buckling when placed under compressive, torsional, or bending stress.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of farming in the 19th century and its continued decline {{in the state in}} the 20th century, forests spread back over much of the land. They are not the same forests, however: Chestnut trees, for instance, wiped out by a disease, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as prevalent as they once were, and the lack of their nuts affects the populations of various mammals. Stone walls, built largely in the nineteenth century, provide more welcoming homes to certain species; and mammals from Europe, including the house mouse and Norway rat, and from elsewhere (such as the coyote) can create a different competitive environment for some species and a different food source for some (the barn owl, for instance, can now feed on Norway rats).|$|E
25|$|Forced begging is a {{profitable}} practice in which exploiters {{are motivated by}} economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked {{for the purpose of}} begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise. In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer. Though family networks <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary. Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing capabilities. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families. UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.|$|E

25|$|Tests {{of general}} {{relativity}} on the largest scales <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> so stringent as Solar System tests. The earliest such test was prediction and discovery of {{the expansion of the}} universe. In 1922, Alexander Friedmann found that Einstein equations have non-stationary solutions (even {{in the presence of the}} cosmological constant). In 1927, Georges Lemaître showed that static solutions of the Einstein equations, which are possible in the presence of the cosmological constant, are unstable, and therefore the static universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist (it must either expand or contract). Lemaître made an explicit prediction that the universe should expand. He also derived a redshift-distance relationship, which is now known as the Hubble Law. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with the results of Friedmann and Lemaître. The expansion of the universe discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929 was then considered by many (and continues to be considered by some now) as a direct confirmation {{of general relativity}}. In the 1930s, largely due to the work of E. A. Milne, it was realised that the linear relationship between redshift and distance derives from the general assumption of uniformity and isotropy rather than specifically from general relativity. However the prediction of a non-static universe was non-trivial, indeed dramatic, and primarily motivated by general relativity.|$|E
500|$|The {{prevailing}} northwest winter winds also {{limit the}} lake's influence.

At [...] per year, the port city of Duluth has the highest average snowfall total of any city in Minnesota.

500|$|The hot, {{dry climate}} makes it {{difficult}} for soil to form. Mass wasting, the down-slope movement of loose rock, is therefore the dominant erosive force in mountainous area, resulting in [...] "skeletonized" [...] ranges (mountains with very little soil on them). Sand dunes in the park, while famous, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as widespread as their fame or the dryness of the area may suggest. The Mesquite Flat dune field is the most easily accessible from the paved road just east of Stovepipe Wells in the north-central part of the valley and is primarily made of quartz sand. Another dune field is just [...] to the north but is instead mostly composed of travertine sand. The highest dunes in the park, and some of the highest in North America, are located in the Eureka Valley about [...] to the north of Stovepipe Wells, while the Panamint Valley dunes and the Saline Valley dunes are located west and northwest of the town, respectively. The Ibex dune field is near the seldom-visited Ibex Hill in the southernmost part of the park, just south of the Saratoga Springs marshland. All of the latter four dune fields are accessible only via unpaved roads. Prevailing winds in the winter come from the north, and prevailing winds in the summer come from the south. Thus the overall position of the dune fields remains more or less fixed.|$|E

500|$|Turpin is {{best known}} for his {{exploits}} as a highwayman, but before his execution the only contemporary report of him as such was in June 1737, when a broadsheet entitled [...] "News news: great and wonderful news from London in an uproar or a hue and cry after the Great Turpin, with his escape into Ireland" [...] was published. [...] Although some of his contemporaries became the subject of chapbooks, names such as James Hind, Claude Duval and William Nevison, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as well-known today as the legend of Dick Turpin, whose fictionalised exploits first began to appear around the turn of the 19th century. [...] It was, however, the story of a fabled ride from London to York that provided the impetus for 19th-century author William Harrison Ainsworth to include and embellish the exploit in his 1834 novel Rookwood. [...] Ainsworth used Turpin as a plot device, describing him in a manner that makes him more lively than the book's other characters. [...] Turpin is introduced with the pseudonym Palmer, and is later forced to escape on his horse, Black Bess. [...] Although fast enough to keep ahead of those in pursuit, Black Bess eventually dies under the stress of the journey. [...] This scene appealed more to readers than the rest of the work, and as Turpin was depicted as a likeable character who made the life of a criminal seem appealing, the story came to form part of the modern legend surrounding Turpin. The artist Edward Hull capitalised on Ainsworth's story, publishing six prints of notable events in Turpin's career.|$|E

2500|$|The Court had to {{contrast}} the [...] "automobile exception" [...] with long standing court decisions which held that portable containers such as suitcases, despite their mobility, {{are not subject}} to the same warrantless search as automobiles.

Furthermore, containers are presumed to have a much higher expectation of privacy than vehicles, since their primary purpose is to transport belongings, and most are opaque (some are even locked), which suggests that the owner of a container generally does not expect the contents to be visible or accessible to others.|$|E

[...] The long shaft holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, {{to prevent them from}} unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place. [...] In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.|$|E
