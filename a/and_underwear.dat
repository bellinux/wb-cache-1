5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest <b>and</b> <b>underwear</b> cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|Swimwear <b>and</b> <b>underwear</b> {{have similar}} design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main {{difference}} is that, unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race.

The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E

25|$|Underwear as fashion {{reached its}} peak in the 1970s and 1980s, <b>and</b> <b>underwear</b> {{advertisers}} forgot about comfort and durability, at least in advertising.
