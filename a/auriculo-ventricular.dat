40|$|What is {{believed}} to be the first known case of heart-block arising in a dog as a result of an ingenerate pathological lesion is here reported. The <b>auriculo-ventricular</b> dissociation was of that degree known as relatively complete block and became apparent on section of the right vagus nerve. Stimulation of the peripheral end of the cut vagus failed to inhibit the ventricles, although complete inhibition of the auricles occurred. The same results were obtained during the ventricular acceleration produced by strophanthin, so that the failure of the vagus to inhibit the ventricles is not due to the latter's infrequent action, but more probably to a normal lack of direct chronotropic influence upon the ventricular muscle. These findings are similar to those obtained by Erlanger in experimental heart-block. To small repeated doses of strophanthin injected intravenously the heart reacted as follows: (a) irregular slowing of the auricles and conversion of the relatively complete into an absolutely complete a-v block; (b) a rise in the irritability of the cardiac muscle manifested by a rapidly progressing auricular and ventricular frequency, the ventricular frequency surpassing ultimately the auricular frequency; (c) complete arrest of the auricles, the ventricles continuing at their high rate; (d) sudden fibrillation of the ventricles and shortly afterwards arrest in diastole. There were found post mortem myxomatous-like thickenings at the free edge of the septal tricuspid leaflet and at the attached margin of the posterior aortic leaflet and along part of the right anterior aortic leaflet. There was also a grayish patch on the right side of the auricular septum above the <b>auriculo-ventricular</b> junction. The thickenings at the edge of the valves consisted of dense, circumscribed masses of what appeared to be new connective tissue. The same tissue was found pressing against the bundle along the greater part of the latter's course. There was considerable fatty infiltration of the auricular musculature immediately above the bundle and, to a slight extent, of the bundle itself. The fibers of communication between the auricular muscle and the node of Tawara were relatively few as compared with those of the normal heart.

40|$|Triple {{heart rhythm}} {{stands for the}} cadence {{produced}} when three sounds recur in successive cardiac cycles, just as two sounds compose the familiar dual rhythm of cardiac auscultation, and more rarely, four sounds a quadruple rhythm. The conflicting views on the subject have long served to discourage attempts at a clinical perception of the problem.

40|$|PAROXYSMAL {{tachycardia}} may {{be defined}} as an abnormally rapid heart action with sudden onset and offset, and is divided accord-ing {{to the site of}} origin of the impulse which may be in the auricle, <b>auriculo-ventricular</b> node, or ventricle. In general, the important point is to differentiate those examples of ven-tricular origin from others inasmuch as in them the prognosis is grave. There are several points of distinction clinically between auricular or supra-ventricular, and ventricular paroxysms, the former having a practically con-stant rate in the various attacks and being frequently stopped by vagal pres-sure, 1 especially left, the latter varying in rate between various attacks and even during the same attack, 2 and not controlled by vagus pressure. 8 A few cases of ventricular paroxysmal tachycardia have been reported as due to digitalis 4 (where the usual dosage was not exceeded), and quinidine, 5 but in the absence of medication are usual-ly due to serious myocardial disease, most commonly myocardial infarction, 0 and have frequently been produced ex-perimentally in animals by coronary li-gation. 7 Paroxysmal auricular flutter and fib-rillation are not included and can us-ually be detected by clinical means, the latter by its irregularity increased upon exercise, the former by sudden halv-ing or doubling of the previous rate, which if irregular, is usually less so upon exercise. The one positive method of identifi-cation of ventricular tachycardias is the electrocardiogram, 6 which, however, frequently offers difficulties. If the tracings show rapid rate with abnormal QRS complexes and P waves at a dif-ferent rate, or absent, or if they show onset or offset, the diagnosis may be established. As a matter of fact it is believed that P waves may not be seen or their relationship established and the showing of the onset or offset of a paroxysm would usually be purely ac-cidental. Premature contractions may be frequent between attacks and should show complexes similar to those pres-ent during them. A further point of confusion is the frequent abnormality of QRS in tachycardia of other origin. 8 One reports a case of paroxysmal •Published with the permission of th...|$|E

A fase aguda da moléstia nos cães foi seguida por frequentes exames de sangue a fresco, entre lãmina e lamínula, para a pesquisa do flagelado. Os traçados eletrocardiográficos foram obtidos antes da inoculação e até 320 dias após a mesma. Além das derivações periféricas, em alguns cães, registrou também as derivações precordiais. A interpretação dos eletrocardiogramas seriados foi feita levando-se em conta a variabilidade dos traçados em série observada em cães normais. Em todos os 6 cães estudados houve uma diminuição muito acentuada da voltagem dos complexos ventriculares, denotando lesão miocárdica. A diminuição da voltagem de QRs já se evidencia na fase aguda e de transição da moléstia, tornando-se máxima logo no inicio da fase crônica. Em dois cães, paralelamente com a diminuição da voltagem, houve uma rotação do eixo elétrico para a esquerda. Em um cão foram observadas extrasístoles ventriculares e, em dois, extrasístoles auriculares.

The Author {{has studied}} the electrocardiograms of 6 adult dogs, {{before and after the}} {{inoculation}} of a Schizotrypanum cruzi strain in these animals, which has been obtained from a human case of Chagas' myocarditis with complete aurriculoventricular block. The acute stage of the disease in these dogs has been observed through frequent examination of recent blood, for the research of the flagelate. Electrocardiogram leads were obtained from before the inoculation to 320 days after it. Beside the peripheral leads, the precordial ones have been taken in some dogs. The interpretation of the electrocardiogram series were done comparatively with the mutabilities of the lead series taken from normal dogs. In all studied dogs there was a marked lowering of voltage in the ventricular complexes, denoting a myocardial lesion. The lowering of voltage of the QRS complexes is already seen in the acute stage as well as through out the transition stage of the disease, reaching the maximum soon after the beginning of the chronic stage. Beside lowering of voltage, there was an electrical axis deviation to the left in two dogs. Ventricular premature beats occurred in one dog and auricular premature beats, in two.

Sin embargo, sus implicaciones clínicas son muy importantes ya que su aparición conlleva un elevado riesgo de muerte. El tratamiento de las arritmias ventriculares en este contexto se basa fundamentalmente en el implante de un desfibrilador automático implantable (DAI). No obstante, en los últimos años la ablación con catéter ha emergido como una terapia adyuvante de primera línea. En el segundo de los artículos que conforman esta tesis se describe la importancia de delimitar el trayecto del nervio frénico izquierdo durante los procedimientos de ablación epicárdica de TV en pacientes con MCDNI. La mayor parte de los pacientes con MCDNI presentan zonas de cicatriz epicárdica que preferentemente se localizan en la pared lateral del ventrículo izquierdo, que es justamente la zona de transcurso habitual del nervio frénico izquierdo.

Scar {{is defined}} by the presence of signals 1. 5 mV and dense scar is defined when amplitude is below 0. 5 mV. However, {{there is a lack of}} reference values for the signals obtained during epicardial mapping. Traditionally the same reference values previously described for the endocardium have been applied in the epicardium, but this assumption may be inaccurate. Epicardial fat, which is normally distributed around the coronary vessels and the <b>auriculo-ventricular</b> groove may be responsible for low voltage signals obtained in the epicardium that are not real pathologic scars. For that reason we firstly established normal criteria for the signals obtained in the epicardium of 8 patients without structural heart disease who underwent epicardial electroanatomical mapping during ablation of idiopathic VT. These reference values were then applied to the electroanatomical endo and epicardial mapping of 22 patients with NICM and VT suspected to be of epicardial origin. Detailed mapping showed the presence of substantial epicardial substrate with confluent areas of epicardial scar in 82 % of patients compared with only 54 % of patients showing confluent areas of scar in the endocardium. Moreover, the epicardial scar area was significantly larger in the epicardium when compared with endocardial scar areas. Epicardial scar areas were characterized not only by the presence of low voltage but also by the presence of wide, split and late potentials. In these patients, the ablation of the epicardial substrate was associated with a high success rate of 71 %. The second article configuring this doctoral thesis describes the significance of a proper delimitation of the left phrenic nerve curse during epicardial VT ablation in patients with NICM. Most patients with NICM show confluent epicardial scar areas typically located in the left lateral wall, which is also the typical left phrenic nerve course. High output pacing with the ablation catheter can deliniate the phrenic nerve course in order to avoid the phrenic nerve palsy during radiofrequency application in these areas...|$|E
40|$|Transmission of Chagas {{disease is}} {{realized}} through contamination of ocular conjunctiva, mucosa or skin with infected dejections eliminated by the insect vectors of Schizotrypanum cruzi (Triatoma infestans, Panstrongylus megistus and Rhodnius prolixus). The triatomid bugs live in holes and craks in the walls, in beds, behind trunks, etc. Found in primitive mud huts covered with thatched roofs, {{and so the}} human dwellers have many chances to contract the disease, reinfections being reasonably more to expect than a single inoculation. Experimental work reproducing those natural conditions is welcomed as some important features in the pathologic picture of the disease such as the extensive myocardial fibrosis seen in chronic cases are still incompletely known. Microscopic changes were studied in the heart muscle of seven Cebus monkeys infected by S. cruzi. This animal survives the acute stage {{of the disease and}} so is particularly suited to experiments of long duration in which several inoculations of S. cruzi are performed. Three different strains of S. cruzi isolated from acute cases of Chagas' disease were employed. One monkey was injected in the skin with infected blood and necropsied after 252 days. Two monkeys were three times, and one, eight times infected in skin, one of them with contaminated blood, and two with contaminated blood and dejections from infected bugs. The necropsies were performed after 35, 95 and 149 days. One monkey was three times inoculated through the intact ocular conjunctiva (one time with infected blood, two times with dejections from infected bugs), and one time through the wounded buccal mucosa, and necropsied after 134 days. Another monkey was six times inoculated, four times through the intact ocular conjunctiva (one time with contaminated blood, three times with dejections from infected bugs) and two times injected in the skin with infected blood, and necropsied after 157 days. Finally, another monkey was nine times inoculated, four times through the intact ocular conjunctiva (one time with infected blood, and three times with dejections from infected bugs), and five times injected in the skin (four times with contaminated blood, and one time with dejections from infected bugs), and necropsied after 233 days. The microscopic picture was uniform presenting, however, considerable individual variations, and was represented by diffuse interstitial myocarditis, frequently more (marked in the right ventricle base of the heart), accompanied by lymphatic stasis. The infiltration consists of macrophages, plasma cells and lymphocytes, the cellular reaction having sometimes a perivascular distribution, involving the <b>auriculo-ventricular</b> system of conduction, endocardium, epicardium and cardiac sympathetic gangliae. The loss of cardiac muscle fibers was always minimal. Leishmanial forms of S. cruzi in myocardial fibers are scanty and, in two cases, absent. Fatty necrosis in the epicardium was noted in two cases. Obliterative changes of medium-sized branches of coronary arteries (hypersensitivity reaction?) and multiple infarcts of the myocardium was found in one instance. The diffuse myocarditis induced by S. cruzi in several species of monkeys of the genus Cebus observed after 233 days (several inoculations) and 252 days (single inoculation) is not associated with disseminated fibrosis such as is reported in chronic cases of Chagas' disease. Definite capacity of reversion is another characteristic of the interstitial myocarditis observed in the series of Cebus monkeys here studied. The impression was gained that repeated inoculation with S. cruzi may influence the myocardial changes differently according to the period between the reinoculations. A short period after the first inoculation is followed by more marked changes, while long periods are accompanied by slight changes, which suggests an active immunisation produced by the first inoculation. More data are required, however before a definite statement is made on this subject considering that individual variations, the natural capacity of reversion of the interstitial myocarditis and the employement of more than a species of Cebus monkeys probably exerts influence also in the results here reported...|$|E
40|$|In {{summing up}} the {{contents}} of the preceding pages it may be stated that the action of digitalis has been divided into two stages according to the changes evinced by the ventricles under its influence; of these the first is characterized by marked inhibitory action together with modification of the cardiac muscle, while in the second the inhibitory action is less marked and the muscular action becomes the more prominent feature. The inhibitory action is due to direct stimulation by this series of the pneumogastric centrally in the medulla oblongata and peripherally in the heart. The extent to which the inhibitory mechanism is stimulated varies in different animals and with different members of the digitalis series. The muscular action of small quantities betrays itself in a tendency to increase the extent of the contraction, while in some cases the degree of relaxation reached in diastole is also lessened by it. In larger quantities the series increases the irritability of the cardiac muscle very considerably, and the spontaneous rhythm of the ventricles therefore becomes developed. Through the interaction of these two factors in the first stage the rhythm of the whole heart is slowed, the contraction of the ventricle is more complete, and the diastolic relaxation is generally increased, although it may be unchanged or lessened. The systolic pressure is increased and the fall from maximum to minimum pressure is slower than normal owing to the increased completeness and longer duration of systole (Rolleston). The auricles generally contract with less force and may relax more completely than normally. Sometimes, however, their contractions also are more complete than before the injection of the drug. This latter condition generally precedes the diminution of the force of the auricular contraction. This variation of the effects of digitalis in the auricle explains the changes in intra-auricular pressure noted by Kaufmann. The contraction volume of the ventricles is always much increased, and the output per unit of time is generally augmented, and this together with the contraction of the peripheral arterioles causes an increase in the tension in the systemic circulation, an acceleration of the circulation, and possibly a temporary increase in the pressure in the great veins and in the auricle and ventricle in diastole (Kaufmann). The pressure in the pulmonary artery is practically unaffected by some members of the series, while by others it is considerably increased. This difference in the reaction of the pulmonary circulation is due to the varying extent to which these drugs act on the peripheral arteries and not to any difference in their action on {{the two sides of the}} heart. If the inhibitory action be very strongly marked the slowing of the heart may be extreme, the ventricles assuming their own spontaneous rhythm and all connection with the auricles being lost. While the contraction volume of the ventricle is still greater than normal, their output per unit of time may become less than normal, the aortic tension therefore fall and the rapidity of the circulation be lessened. The ventricles maintain their association throughout, and probably the rhythm of the two auricles also remains equal. The ventricular rhythm, however, becomes irregular owing to the variation in the duration of the diastolic pause. The auricles may cease altogether in diastole, or may continue to beat with a slower or faster rhythm than the ventricles. During the second stage the rhythm of the heart becomes accelerated owing to the increased irritability of the heart muscle. The ventricle tends to assume a rapid spontaneous rhythm, while the auricular rhythm is also quicker than in the first stage. When these two rhythms interfere by the passage of impulses across the <b>auriculo-ventricular</b> boundary in either direction, irregularity of the heart is produced, generally bearing a distinctly periodic character. The ventricles continue to maintain their common rhythm, while the auricles and ventricles may contract at quite different rates. The two ventricles, however, do not necessarily contract with equal force, and the contractions of one may present periodic variations in strength, while those of the other may be almost perfectly uniform. The contractions of the auricles vary in the same way as regards each other and the ventricles. The inhibitory nerves are no longer able to slow the ventricular rhythm, but may affect the completeness of systole and diastole in the ordinary way. The auricular contractions can still be lessened in force and possibly be abolished by their stimulation, and the impulses passing between the auricle and ventricle may therefore be blocked and regularity of the heart produced by powerful inhibition. The irregularity of the contractions is therefore due indirectly to the increased irritability of the cardiac muscle and the acceleration must be attributed to the same cause. An extreme phase of this stage produced by the interference of the rhythms is a temporary standstill of one of the chambers, generally the auricle. The irregularity leads to a lessened efficiency of the work of the heart. The output varies extremely in successive observations and the contraction volume of every individual beat may differ. The various chambers often show a tendency to dilate during this stage. The blood pressure in the systemic arteries at first remains high, in fact may be higher than in the first stage owing to the increased rapidity of the heart rhythm, but afterwards falls continuously as the periodic variations become shorter in duration. The auricles generally cease contracting before the ventricles, but not invariably. There is no fixed order in the cessation of the ventricles or auricles. Each division comes to a standstill in a position somewhat nearer diastole than systole and then passes into delirium and dilates to the fullest extent...|$|E
