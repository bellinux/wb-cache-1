5|$|Adrian Paul {{said that}} Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as <b>a</b> <b>smoker</b> to mark her {{out as a}} {{different}} character from Tessa. Paul also said that his lovemaking scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa from that between MacLeod and Tessa. According to Paul, Lisa {{was more like a}} temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a more dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} <b>a</b> <b>smoker,</b> this {{is considered an}} opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E

50|$|Nicotine {{dependence}} {{is especially}} a concern among some populations {{such as those}} with co-occurring mental illness.

5|$|In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was {{operated}} on by Michael E. DeBakey in Houston for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, and in February 1965 a detached retina {{in his left}} eye was treated by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder. In late 1971, the Duke, who was <b>a</b> <b>smoker</b> from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors while on a state visit to France; she spoke with the Duke for fifteen minutes but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.|$|E
5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with <b>a</b> <b>smoker.</b> Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} projections are averages for {{an entire}} male population, and many medical and lifestyle factors modify these numbers. For example, {{studies have shown that}} a 40-year-old man will lose 3.1 years of life if he is overweight (BMI 25-29) and 5.8 years of life if he is obese (BMI 30 or more), compared to men of normal weight. If he is both overweight and <b>a</b> <b>smoker,</b> he will lose 6.7 years, and if obese and <b>a</b> <b>smoker,</b> he will lose 13.7 years.|$|E

50|$|There are {{effective}} treatments for nicotine dependence, {{although the majority}} of the evidence focuses on treatments for cigarette smokers rather than people who use other forms of tobacco (e.g., chew, snus, pipes, hookah, electronic cigarettes). These treatments have been shown to double or even triple <b>a</b> <b>smoker’s</b> chances of quitting successfully.|$|R

25|$|Epidemiological {{studies show}} that non-smokers exposed to {{second-hand}} smoke {{are at risk for}} many of the health problems associated with direct smoking. Most of the research has come from studies of nonsmokers who are married to <b>a</b> <b>smoker.</b> Those conclusions are also backed up by further studies of workplace exposure to smoke.|$|E

25|$|A bee smoker, {{usually called}} simply <b>a</b> <b>smoker,</b> is a device used in {{beekeeping}} to calm honey bees. It {{is designed to}} generate smoke from the smouldering of various fuels, hence the name. The first bee smoker, which incorporated a bellows with a fire pot, was invented in 1870 by the renowned American beekeeper, Moses Quinby.|$|E
25|$|The {{likelihood}} of becoming <b>a</b> <b>smoker</b> {{has also been}} linked to reward dependence. Both males and females were seen to score low in the Sentimentality-Dependence-Attachment subscale of RD, possibly accounting for indifference towards social pressures to quit. Whereas they scored high on the Persistence sub scale of RD, representing resistance to extinction of previously rewarded behavior thereby reengaging in the addictive behavior.|$|E

They later find out that she has moved and Terasawa is too slow to squeeze the salesgirl's hand.|$|E
40|$|Careers of smokers {{almost always}} start in youth, {{and as a}} result, the tobacco {{industry}} reaps large returns from each cigarette smoked by children.

25|$|Some of {{the mineral}} apatite in Florida {{used to produce}} {{phosphate}} for U.S.A. tobacco crops contains uranium, radium, lead-210 and polonium-210 and radon. The radioactive smoke from tobacco fertilized this way is deposited in lungs and releases radiation even if <b>a</b> <b>smoker</b> quits the habit. The combination of carcinogenic tar and radiation in a sensitive organ such as lungs {{increases the risk of}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the cases}} of some throat cancers, the air {{passages}} in the mouth and behind the nose may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is {{near the bottom of}} the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the lungs and interfering with the person’s ability to breathe; this is even more likely if the person is <b>a</b> <b>smoker,</b> because they are highly susceptible to lung cancer.|$|E

In a candidate's memo, Simmons remarked that he was a better choice than Remy because he is not <b>a</b> <b>smoker.</b> Remy criticized Simmons for about five minutes during the July 16, 2007 NESN broadcast of a Red Sox – Royals game.

25|$|Externalities are costs (or benefits) {{that are}} not borne by {{the parties to the}} {{economic}} transaction. A producer may, for example, pollute the environment, and others may bear those costs. A consumer may consume a good which produces benefits for society, such as education; because the individual does not receive all of the benefits, he may consume less than efficiency would suggest. Alternatively, an individual may be <b>a</b> <b>smoker</b> or alcoholic and impose costs on others. In these cases, production or consumption of the good in question may differ from the optimum level.|$|E

50|$|A {{study in}} Sweden showed that 21.5% of smokers and 3% of nonsmokers (genetic {{pigmentation}} or unknown cause) had lesions {{that could be}} classified as an oral melanin pigmentation. A gingival melanin index in 4 degrees was established. Already with a consumption of 1-3 cigarettes a day 9.3% of all 20.333 examined showed <b>a</b> <b>smoker's</b> melanosis.
