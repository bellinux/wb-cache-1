25|$|Pryce's {{race against}} Kilroy was very close, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>held</b> a lead of 3,536 votes {{after an initial}} count. Complete tallies found Pryce winning rural Madison and Union {{counties}} but losing her portion of Franklin County (urban Columbus) by several thousand votes. Pryce ended Election Night 1,055 votes ahead of Kilroy, but the difference was within a half-percentage point, which triggered an automatic recount under Ohio law.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the birth}} of her fourth child, Luke, Yates became depressed. On June 16, 1999, Rusty found her shaking and chewing her fingers. The next day, she {{attempted}} to commit suicide by overdosing on pills. She was admitted to the hospital and prescribed antidepressants. Soon after her release, she begged Rusty to let her die <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>held</b> a knife up to her neck. Once again hospitalized, she was given a cocktail of medications including Haldol, an anti-psychotic drug. Her condition improved immediately and she was prescribed it on her release. After that, Rusty moved the family into a small house for the sake of her health. She appeared temporarily stabilized.|$|E

500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>held</b> onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
2500|$|She won {{her first}} major {{marathon}} in 2010: seeing off competition including Derartu Tulu, {{she won the}} Nagoya Women's Marathon in 2:27:11, which also doubled as a national championship victory. She was happy with her second ever marathon win, saying: [...] "I have promised myself to challenge for a victory many times before but I was unable to attain my goal previously...this time I was determined to win". A victory at the Sapporo Half Marathon in July came after <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>held</b> off a challenge from Azausa Nojiri to keep {{the lead in the}} final stages.|$|E
2500|$|In its North American years, as its celebrity grew, the quartet's members {{naturally}} {{associated with}} notable musicians such as Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Mischa Elman, and—not surprisingly, given the quartet’s Belgian connections—Eugène Ysaÿe. The group also, however, had less obvious associations {{with the famous}} of its day. In one colorful incident, as the quartet toured during the 1916–1917 season, it crossed paths with the famous deafblind author, activist, and lecturer Helen Keller and her teacher and companion Anne Sullivan in Oklahoma City, where Keller was scheduled for a lecture. Keller proposed as an experiment that the quartet should play for her, to determine whether she could sense music; readily acceding to her request, the quartet played music including the celebrated second movement, andante cantabile, from Tchaikovsky’s String Quartet no. 1 in D Major, op. 11, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>held</b> her fingertips lightly on a resonant tabletop. Keller quickly sensed the musical vibrations, swaying in time, alternately crying and smiling. Afterward, Keller reacted as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing in The Independent, Neela Debnath praised Coleman's performance, {{articulating}} {{that she}} [...] "impressed again with her fury <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>held</b> the Doctor to account. This is the grown up assistant the Time Lord {{needs to keep}} him in check" [...] and ultimately closed her review by saying [...] "'Kill the Moon' was an enclosed space adventure with all the claustrophobia that an episode like this demands [...] It was hardly the strongest episode of the series but it was no car crash either.". Radio Times heavily praised the episode, awarding it a perfect 5/5. They also praised Coleman's performance, stating that [...] "Coleman expertly conveys Clara’s terrible dilemma – and later her tearful fury at the Doctor’s behaviour". They described the episode's writing as [...] "audacious, highly imaginative, and is well matched by Paul Wilmshurst’s supremely eerie, cinematic direction", and closed their review by noting [...] "Portentous dialogue, sharp direction, urgent music and a powerhouse performance from Peter Capaldi make this one of the defining moments of the season".|$|E
2500|$|She won {{a junior}} {{cross country race}} on home turf in Kericho in late 2009, but failed {{to reach the top}} three at the 2010 Kenyan Trials. Her fourth-place finish was enough to gain a place on the team for the 2010 World Cross Country Championships. Cherono rose to the {{occasion}} at the World Championships in Bydgoszcz, the same location as her 2008 World Junior win. She led with her Kenyan teammates for much of the race and she won by a margin of seven seconds, leading home a 1–2–3–4 victory for the Kenyan team. Despite the significant winning margin, she did not need to push herself to the victory, later saying: [...] "In the second lap, I had a lot left". She made her first outing on the IAAF Diamond League circuit in May, running a personal best of 14:47.13 for seventh in the 5000 metres at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. At the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics, Cherono became the first woman to retain the 3000m junior title <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>held</b> off a challenge from Emebet Anteneh to become the first gold medallist of the event. She also won a silver medal in the 5000m, finishing behind Genzebe Dibaba.|$|E
