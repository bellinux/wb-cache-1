500|$|In {{spite of}} the game's {{traditional}} friendly feel, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier highlighted in pre-match press conference the importance of winning the Shield: [...] "It {{is very important to}} me. This match is more than a friendly. It represents the start of the season. The Community Shield is like a final. There is a trophy at stake <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> holders." [...] Arsène Wenger wanted to use the match as [...] "the final preparation game for the championship" [...] and commented that Liverpool, amongst four other teams (Manchester United, Newcastle United, Chelsea and Leeds United) would challenge Arsenal in the league.|$|E
500|$|A month later, Winkelman {{offered his}} Milton Keynes stadium site to QPR, {{promising}} that the club's name and blue-and-white hooped strip {{would be kept}} in Buckinghamshire and that the fans would be represented {{on the board of}} directors. [...] "We have real resources to put behind the club," [...] said Winkelman. [...] "They are fast running out of solutions <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> answer to their problems." [...] QPR dismissed the offer, leading the developers to once again contact Wimbledon later that month. With Koppel in charge, Wimbledon were more receptive this time around—Koppel said that Wimbledon's owners were subsidising the club to the tune of £6million per year and that such action was necessary to prevent its liquidation. As talks progressed, Winkelman approached the owner of Milton Keynes City, attempting to buy the club name. It soon became clear that the bulk of Wimbledon's support strongly opposed a move of this kind.|$|E

2500|$|As in the English phrase [...] "service of God," [...] the genitive in [...] "Gottesdienst" [...] {{is arguably}} ambiguous. [...] It {{can be read}} as an {{objective}} genitive (service rendered to God) or a subjective genitive (God's [...] "service" [...] to people). [...] While the objective genitive is etymologically more plausible, Lutheran writers frequently highlight the ambiguity and emphasize the subjective genitive. [...] This is felt to reflect the belief, based on Lutheran doctrine regarding justification, that the main actor in the Divine Service is God himself and not man, and that in {{the most important aspect of}} evangelical worship God is the subject <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> objects: that the Word and Sacrament are gifts that God gives to his people in their worship.|$|E

Reborn is considered the most influential of all Living Sacrifice records and earned them a larger non-Christian fanbase. After this record, Chris and Jason left the band and Jay Stacy filled in on bass, but was later replaced by Arthur Green, formerly of Eso-Charis.

2500|$|He was {{for long}} {{a member of}} the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, {{representing}} the [...] "Red" [...] liberal tendency and, late in life, the National Liberals. In June 1876, shortly after the first concentrated National Liberal cabinet came to power, he and Nicolae Fleva spearheaded the effort to prosecute the former [...] "White" [...] Conservative ministers. In opening the case, Ghica stated: [...] "It wasn't just us who condemned those ministers, but public opinion in general, the entire country, cast a blame on them, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> expression of that blame". The effort pitted Pantazi Ghica against his main literary rival, outgoing Education Minister Titu Maiorescu, who was called in for questioning. The attempt to stage a trial was ultimately defeated by moderates in Ghica's own party, who ignored his vocal protests.|$|E
2500|$|Funeral for a Friend {{have been}} {{said to be a}} {{prominent}} influence on the British post-hardcore scene, primarily with their debut album Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation, a release which is believed by some to have set a high standard for the band to rival in future releases. James Ding of AbsolutePunk stated that: [...] "...the album still stands tall atop of many recent releases due {{to the quality of the}} music on offer, and even though FFAF may have strayed from the style that started their career, this is still a landmark album in modern British rock music". In April 2011, Rock Sound magazine inducted Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation into Rock Sound's Hall Of Fame, crediting the album as an influence on albums by bands like: Fightstar, The Blackout, Kids In Glass Houses <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>The</b> Ocean.|$|E

Gunnulfsen wrote the songs while she was [...] "in a very dark place in my mind".

She explained that the album's sound was [...] "rock mixed with electronic/pop kind of stuff", resulting in [...] "a lot of different vibes throughout the album." [...] Gunnulfsen was inspired by Saosin, Circa Survive, Ellie Goulding, Rihanna, and The Weeknd. Gavin Lloyd of Classic Rock wrote that the album featured [...] "infectious rock" [...] done by the likes of Paramore <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> In Crowd, and [...] "dark electro-pop" [...] performed by artists such as Purity Ring and Banks.
