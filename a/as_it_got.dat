Despite a strong showing, Woods placed 10th, missing out on the playoffs. In September, Woods underwent a second microdiscectomy.|$|E
25|$|England, however, {{continued}} to paste the bowlers, although skipper Michael Vaughan was lucky {{on more than}} one occasion – the most notable when he was dropped by Mohammad Rafique off Rafique's own bowling. By stumps, however, the pair had added 40, and they continued on a sunny second day – less rusty, however, than they had been on the first day. It was all too embarrassing for Bangladesh, as Vaughan raced to 120 before being caught behind off Mashrafe. Four overs later, the patient Rafique finally got his reward, Khaled Mashud coming up with a magnificent catch to get Trescothick out six short of a double century. That was as good <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> for Bangladesh, though, as Ian Bell, Warwickshire's prodigy, made 65 not out, and Graham Thorpe ran runs everywhere to score 42 not out with only two boundaries, before Vaughan decided that enough was enough and declared with seven wickets in hand and a lead of 420 runs.|$|E

Nevertheless, one and a half days of lost play prevented them from forcing a victory. HD Ackerman, Dinesh Mongia and Paul Nixon also passed fifty in the first innings, as Leicestershire declared having made 552 for 6. Derbyshire then were 62 for 3 at the close of play on day two, but were saved by rain, as the third day's play was cancelled. In 50 overs on day four, Charl Willoughby and Stuart Broad took two wickets each as Derbyshire were all out for 190, but {{there was no time for}} another innings and the match was declared a draw.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the match}} got on, Jones and Harmison {{putting on the}} {{pressure}} and eventually having Hayden lbw on 14 – after {{he had failed to}} score from the last 11 deliveries. Damien Martyn then faced five dot-balls, and Jones served up a wicket maiden, and Australia were at 46 for 2 {{at the end of the}} tenth over. However, that was as good <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> for England. Andrew Flintoff dug out skipper Ricky Ponting for 34, but it mattered little, as Martyn and Andrew Symonds took advantage of the bowling. Michael Vaughan tried to put himself on, but Symonds smashed him over midwicket for six – the first of the match, displaying the despair. With some no-balls from Gough, and Simon Jones getting smashed early on, Australia were 220 for 4 after 42 overs, and looked on course for 300. However, the run-out of Symonds for 74 changed the course of the innings. Michael Clarke departed for three, a good catch by Geraint Jones behind the stumps, and Harmison then served up a wicket-maiden in the 46th over, of all things. With Brad Hogg and Jason Gillespie giving soft catches to Gough, that redeemed his figures somewhat, but he still conceded 70 runs. The last over from Flintoff was very good, however, conceding only three runs with yorkers directed at the feet of the batsmen, and Australia had to be content with 261 for 9.|$|E
