5000|$|The {{original}} Prestel system, {{designed for}} cost effectiveness and simplicity, employed a rudimentary graphic capability known as serial mosaics. Through juxtaposition {{of the special}} mosaic characters, crude but recognizable graphic representations could {{be made on the}} screen. This graphic scheme had its limitations. To change colors between two mosaic graphic characters or between any two characters in general, a color change command was required. This command signal, however, physically occupied a blank space on the screen.The French sought to overcome this limitation when they joined the videotex world in the mid-1970s. They called their system Antiope. While based on the same mosaic graphics that were employed by the British, Antiope added a new feature, parallel attributes, or the ability to change the color from one cell to another without the need for a blank space.At approximately the same time, the Canadians adapted standard computer graphic commands into a set of functions called alphageometrics. These <b>alphageometric</b> functions did away with the block mosaic graphics used by the British and French and replaced them with drawing instructions, such as: DRAW LINE, DRAW ARC, DRAW POLYGON, etc. Through use of these geometric commands much higher resolution could be achieved than with the mosaic commands. This <b>alphageometric</b> scheme was integrated into the Canadian videotex system which the Canadians referred to as [...] "Telidon".|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, groups {{including}} TVOntario, Athabasca University, the University of Victoria, and the University of Waterloo {{participated in}} Telidon experiments {{during the late}} 70s and early 80s. Telidon, an <b>alphageometric</b> videotex information system used set-top boxes with TV sets, or subsequently software decoders running on PCs (Apple II, MAC, and PC decoders were available) to display text and graphics. The intent was to demonstrate and develop educational applications for videotex and teletext systems. This work continued until 1983, when the Telidon coding structure became a North American standard - ANSI T500 - NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax).|$|E
