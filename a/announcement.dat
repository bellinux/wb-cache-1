40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine changes in {{liquidity}} and information asymmetry around earnings and dividend <b>announcements,</b> using {{evidence from the}} Australian market. Unlike previous studies conducted, this thesis examines a market without the presence of official market makers. In Australia earnings and dividend <b>announcements</b> are released simultaneously in companies’ Preliminary Final Reports (PFR). Consequently these <b>announcements</b> {{are the focus of}} this thesis. Market participants are interested in liquidity and information asymmetry around PFR <b>announcements</b> to determine whether the release of these <b>announcements</b> provide a trading opportunity for traders with greater research and information processing skills. By partitioning the sample into anticipated and unanticipated PFR <b>announcements</b> this thesis finds that trading activity decreases around anticipated <b>announcements,</b> while trading activity increases around unanticipated <b>announcements.</b> This suggests that uncertainty increases around unanticipated <b>announcements.</b> Liquidity does not change around anticipated <b>announcements.</b> However liquidity decreases following unanticipated <b>announcements.</b> Information asymmetry is found to decrease prior to anticipated <b>announcements</b> and following unanticipated <b>announcements</b> that the market perceives to be good news.

5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public <b>announcement,</b> as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the <b>announcement</b> a few days later.|$|E
30|$|A {{question}} that may arise when results in Table 1 are observed {{is how many}} <b>announcements</b> would normally be expected within the selected timeframe. There is an average of 29 <b>announcements</b> per day with a very high standard deviation of 15.74. There is also a high variability {{in the number of}} <b>Announcements</b> across time. As it would be expected, there is a high concentration of <b>announcements</b> around dates when annual or periodic results are submitted. Aggregating <b>announcements</b> occurring each month for years 2006 and 2007 reveal that in June, for instance, there are twice as many <b>announcements</b> than in January. There are more <b>announcements</b> in June and November by approximately 40  % or more than in any other month. Furthermore, statistics for <b>Announcements</b> per day results indicates no normality in the number of <b>announcements</b> across time. Skewness and Kurtosis are both greater than one, the mode is quite different than the mean, while there are also multiple modes observed.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a model where {{the central bank}} faces a credibility problem in its <b>announcements,</b> but also cares about its credibility and, therefore, wants to make truthful <b>announcements.</b> We show that, although the central bank {{would be able to}} perfectly transmit its information to the private sector through precise <b>announcements,</b> the central bank may nonetheless prefer to make imprecise <b>announcements.</b> This choice of the central bank would be suboptimal {{from the point of view}} of society. However, if the central bank gives enough weight to making truthful <b>announcements,</b> this suboptimality disappears, because the central bank would then prefer precise <b>announcements</b> to imprecise <b>announcements.</b> central bank transparency; central bank announcements; imprecise announcements; credibility...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} U. S. Treasury debt <b>announcements</b> on interest rates from 1982 - 85. The analysis measures the <b>announcement's</b> expected component in two ways: the reported market "expected" <b>announcements</b> from the credit markets column of the Wall Street Journal {{just prior to the}} <b>announcements,</b> and time series techniques. Rate response to regular <b>announcements</b> of all maturity classes of Treasury debt appear negligible, reflecting the Treasury's ongoing efforts to keep the market informed of future financing needs. However, <b>announcements</b> of cash management bills, an irregular and residual category of Treasury debt, generate significant market responses.

40|$|A true lie is a {{lie that}} becomes true when announced. In a logic of <b>announcements,</b> where the announcing agent is not modelled, a true lie is a formula (that is false and) that becomes true when announced. We {{investigate}} true lies {{and other types of}} interaction between announced formulas, their preconditions and their postconditions, in the setting of Gerbrandy's logic of believed <b>announcements,</b> wherein agents may have or obtain incorrect beliefs. Our results are on the satisfiability and validity of instantiations of these semantically defined categories, on iterated <b>announcements,</b> including arbitrarily often iterated <b>announcements,</b> and on syntactic characterization. We close with results for iterated <b>announcements</b> in the logic of knowledge (instead of belief), and for lying as private <b>announcements</b> (instead of public <b>announcements)</b> to different agents. Detailed examples illustrate our lying concepts...|$|R
5|$|Despite initial {{indications}} otherwise, Mathias {{announced on}} September 27, 1985, {{that he would}} not seek a fourth term. His <b>announcement</b> concerned Republican party officials in the state, who feared that local Republicans had poorer election chances without Mathias {{at the top of the}} ticket. At the national level, Mathias' <b>announcement</b> came shortly after news that Republican Paul Laxalt of Nevada would be retiring as well. The departure of two Republican senators from swing or Democratic-leaning states was treated by Republican party leaders as a poor sign of the party's chances in the upcoming elections. Linda Chavez won the Republican primary for the Senate seat, and she lost the general election to Democrat Barbara Mikulski.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} intraday {{futures market}} behaviour around major scheduled macroeconomic information <b>announcements</b> on the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE). Prior literature analysing intraday price behaviour around <b>announcements</b> is extended to trading volume and quoted bid-ask spreads. The analysis of price volatility, trading volume and quoted bid-ask spreads {{indicates that the}} majority of adjustment to new information occurs rapidly, within 240 seconds of the scheduled time for major <b>announcements,</b> with some evidence of abnormal activity prior to <b>announcements.</b> Analysis of quoted bid-ask spreads suggests that they significantly widen in the 20 seconds prior to <b>announcements</b> and remain significantly wider for 30 seconds following <b>announcements.</b> The increase in quoted spreads is related to both expected and unexpected volatility, implying that market participants increase quoted spreads around information <b>announcements</b> as a consequence of adverse selection costs. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|We let {{subjects}} in a voluntary contribution experiment make non-binding numerical <b>announcements</b> about their "possible" contributions and, in some treatments, send written promises to contribute specific amounts.

We also find that adding pre-play <b>announcements</b> to treatments with punishment can increase efficiency by letting cost-free warnings substitute for costly punishment. The threat of punishing false <b>announcements</b> and promises helps reduce false signals, but only when promise statements can be sent is the effect sufficient for achieving greater efficiency.
