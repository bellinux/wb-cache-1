The criteria for individual secondary structural elements, which are divided into the same groups as those reported by DSSP, also contain statistical probability factors derived from empirical examinations of solved structures with visually assigned secondary structure elements extracted from the Protein Data Bank.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of effective personnel assignment methodologies {{has been the}} focus of research to academicians and practitioners for many years. The common theory among researchers is that improvements to the effectiveness of personnel assignment decisions are directly associated with favorable outcomes to organizations. Today, companies continue to struggle to develop high quality products in a timely fashion. This elevates the necessity to further explore and improve the decision-making science of personnel assignments. The central goal of this research is to develop a novel framework for human resource assignments in skill-based environments. An extensive literature review resulted in the identification of the following three areas of the general personnel assignment problem as potential improvement opportunities: determining <b>assignment</b> <b>criteria,</b> properly evaluating personnel capabilities, and effectively assigning resources to tasks. Thus, developing new approaches to improve each of these areas constitute the objectives of this dissertation work. The main contributions of this research are threefold. First, this research presents an effective two-stage methodology to determine <b>assignment</b> <b>criteria</b> based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Tobit regression. Second, this research develops a novel fuzzy expert system for resource capability assessments in skill-based scenarios. The expert system properly evaluates the capabilities of resources in particular skills as a function of imprecise relationships that may exist between different skills. Third, this research develops an assignment model based on the fuzzy goal programming (FGP) technique. The model defines capabilities of resources, tasks requirements, and other important parameters as imprecise/fuzzy variables. The novelty of the research presented in this dissertation stems from the fact that it advances the science of personnel assignments by combining concepts from the fields of statistics, economics, artificial intelligence, and mathematical programming to develop a solution approach with an expected high practical value...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{assigning}} individuals of unknown origin to populations, {{based on the}} genetic distance between individuals and populations, was compared to two existing methods based on the likelihood of multilocus genotypes. The distribution of the <b>assignment</b> <b>criterion</b> (genetic distance or genotype likelihood) for individuals of a given population was used to define the probability that an individual belongs to the population. Using this definition, it becomes possible to exclude a population as the origin of an individual, a useful extension of the currently available assignment methods. Using simulated data based on the coalescent process, the different methods were evaluated, varying the time of divergence of populations, the mutation model, the sample size, {{and the number of}} loci. Likelihood-based methods (especially the Bayesian method) always performed better than distance methods. Other things being equal, genetic markers were always more efficient when evolving under the infinite allele model than under the stepwise mutation model, even for equal values of the differentiation parameter F(st). Using the Bayesian method, a 100 % correct assignment rate can be achieved by scoring ca. 10 microsatellite loci (H approximately 0. 6) on 30 - 50 individuals from each of 10 populations when the F(st) is near 0. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Genetic {{variability}} at 18 microsatellites was analysed on {{the basis}} of individual genotypes in five Spanish breeds of sheep – Churra, Latxa, Castellana, Rasa-Aragonesa and Merino -, with Awassi also being studied as a reference breed. The degree of population subdivision calculated between Spanish breeds from F ST diversity indices was around 7 % of total variability. A high degree of reliability was obtained for individual-breed assignment from the 18 loci by using different approaches among which the Bayesian method provided to be the most efficient, with an accuracy for nine microsatellites of over 99 %. Analysis of the Bayesian <b>assignment</b> <b>criterion</b> illustrated the divergence between any one breed and the others, which was highest for Awassi sheep, while no great differences were evident among the Spanish breeds. Relationships between individuals were analysed from the proportion of shared alleles. The resulting dendrogram showed a remarkable breed structure, with the highest level of clustering among members of the Spanish breeds in Latxa and the lowest in Merino sheep, the latter breed exhibiting a peculiar pattern of clustering, with animals grouped into several closely set nodes. Analysis of individual genotypes provided valuable information for understanding intra- and inter-population genetic differences and allowed for a discussion with previously reported results using populations as taxonomic units. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{comparison}} of five {{state of the art}} region detectors is presented with regard to localization accuracy in position and region shape. Based on carefully estimated ground truth homographies, correspondences between frames are assigned using geometrical region overlap. Significant differences between detectors exist, {{depending on the type of}} images. Also, it is shown that localization accuracy linearly depends on region scale for some detectors, which may thus be used as a pre-selection criterion for the removal of error-prone regions. The presented results serve as a supplement to existing comparative studies, and can be used to facilitate the selection of an appropriate detector for a specific target application. When descriptor distance is used as <b>assignment</b> <b>criterion</b> instead of region overlap, a different set of correspondences results with lower accuracy. Set differences (and thus localization accuracy) are directly related to the density of regions in a local neighborhood. Based on the latter, a novel measure for the identification of error-prone regions- shape uniqueness- is introduced. In contrast to existing methods that are based on the descriptor distance of region correspondences, the new measure is pre-computed on each image individually. Thus, the complexity of the subsequent matching task can be significantly reduced. 1...|$|R
