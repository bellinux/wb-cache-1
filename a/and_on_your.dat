500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling has given us an idea. What would {{you think of a}} training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, so it would be child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs {{in the name of the}} Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of Le Vélo <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> support for organising the start? ...|$|E

2500|$|Theater {{historian}} Ethan Mordden {{points out}} that, although Oklahoma! {{has been called}} [...] "the first integrated musical, the first American folk musical", Show Boat [...] "got there first on both counts." [...] Even earlier, the Princess Theatre musicals, following Gilbert and Sullivan and French opéra bouffe, began the reintegration of song and story after decades of thinly plotted British and American musicals, {{paving the way for}} Show Boat and Oklahoma! by showing that a musical could combine popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs. [...] These Princess Theatre shows, which featured modern American settings, [...] "built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern's exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization." [...] Mordden also notes that Oklahoma! was called the first great dance musical, but other musicals had earlier focused on dance, among them Gay Divorce <b>and</b> <b>On</b> <b>Your</b> Toes. [...] He concludes: [...] "But Oklahoma! was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom." ...|$|E
