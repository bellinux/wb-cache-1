40|$|Nickel rich NiTi {{films were}} sputter {{deposited}} on p-doped Si left angle bracket 1 0 0 right-pointing angle bracket substrates maintained at 300 °C. The films were subsequently solution treated at 700 °C for 30 min followed by <b>ageing</b> <b>at</b> 400 and 500 °C for 5 h. The microstructure {{of the films}} was examined by TEM and these studies revealed that the NiTi films were mostly amorphous in the as-deposited condition. The subsequent solution treatment and ageing resulted in crystallization of the films with the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 400 °C exhibiting nanocrystalline grains and three phases viz. B 2 (austenite), R and Ni 3 Ti 2 whereas the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 500 °C shows micron sized grains and two phases viz. R and Ni 3 Ti 2. Nanoindentation studies revealed {{that the nature of}} the load versus indentation depth response for the films <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 400 and 500 °C was different. For the same load, the indenter penetrated to a much greater depth for the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 400 °C as compared to the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 500 °C. Also the ratio of the residual indentation depth (hf) to maximum indentation depth (hmax) is lower for the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 400 °C as compared to the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 500 °C. This was attributed to the occurrence of stress induced martensitic transformation of the B 2 phase present in the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 400 °C during indentation loading which results in a transformation strain in addition to the normal elastic and plastic strains and its subsequent recovery on unloading. The hardness and elastic modulus measured using the Oliver and Pharr analysis was also found to be lower for the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 400 °C as compared to the film <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 500 °C which was also primarily attributed to the same effect...|$|R

40|$|A combinative {{approach}} of microhardness testing, tensile testing, and TEM microstructural analysis {{was employed to}} study the microstructure and mechanical instability of a water-quenched U- 6 wt. % Nb (WQU 6 Nb) alloy subjected to different aging schedules including artificial <b>aging</b> <b>at</b> 200 C, 15 -year natural <b>aging</b> <b>at</b> ambient temperatures, and 15 -year natural aging followed by accelerative <b>aging</b> <b>at</b> 200 C. The changes in mechanical property {{during and after the}} aging processes were examined using microhardness and tensile-testing methods. During the early stages of artificial <b>aging</b> <b>at</b> 200 C, the microhardness of WQ-U 6 Nb alloy increased, i. e., age hardening, {{as a result of the}} development of nanoscale modulation caused by spinodal decomposition. Coarsening of the modulated structure occurred after a prolonged <b>aging</b> <b>at</b> 200 C for 16 hours, and it led to a decrease of microhardness, i. e., age softening. Phase instability was also found to occur in WQ-U 6 Nb alloy that was subjected to a 15 -year natural <b>aging</b> <b>at</b> ambient temperatures. The formation of partially ordered domains resulting from a spinodal modulation with an atomic-scale wavelength rendered the appearance of swirl-shape antiphase domain boundaries (APBs) observed in TEM images. Although it did not cause a significant change in microhardness, 15 -year natural aging has dramatically affected the aging mechanisms of the alloy isothermally <b>aged</b> <b>at</b> 200 C. Microhardness values of the NA alloy continuously increased after isothermal <b>aging</b> <b>at</b> 200 C for 96 hours as a result of the phase decomposition of partially ordered domains into Nb-depleted {alpha} phase and Nb-enriched U{sub 3 }Nb ordered phase in the alloy.
