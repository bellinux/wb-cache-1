50|$|In {{the first}} week of the Games, a {{controversy}} in the pairs' figure skating competition culminated in the French judge's scores being thrown out and the Canadian team of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier being awarded a second gold medal. <b>Allegations</b> of bribery <b>were</b> <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> many ice-skating judges, leading to the arrest of known criminal Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov in Italy (at the request of the United States). He was released by the Italian officials.|$|R
50|$|The National Command {{expelled}} Rimawi {{from the}} Ba'ath Party in September 1959, because if his opportunism and {{his failure to}} appear in a National Command meeting which was investigation him on charges of financial irregularities. On 6 September 1959 Rimawi and Gharbiyah issued a resolution which declared the National Command resolution null and void, and denied the <b>allegations</b> which had <b>been</b> <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> Rimawi. In May 1960, Rimawi had established a rival National Command, an organ which would develop into the Arab Socialist Revolutionary Ba'ath Party (ASBP), a pro-UAR party. The Revolutionary Ba'ath Party stopped its activity in either 1962 or 1963. By 1966, the Regional Branch had 1,000 members.|$|R
50|$|The {{controversy}} intensified when {{similarities between}} the Pilipinas Kay Ganda logo and that of Poland's tourism campaign <b>were</b> pointed out. <b>Allegations</b> of plagiarism <b>were</b> <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> the Department of Tourism and the agency. Two days after the controversy began, the agency released a statement describing {{the extent of their}} involvement with the project, specifying that the work was rushed into production without market testing despite the initial agreement that Campaigns' work was only to be preliminary in nature. Despite the statement, some Netizens continued to deride the agency while others took a less critical stance and instead focused on the Department of Tourism's role in the fiasco.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of gross human rights abuses allegedly perpetrated by the organisation which range from unlawful abductions, torturing of civilians at undisclosed locations among others. Some of the specific incidents in which the Intelligence organisation was fingered include the attack on Nelson Chamisa at the Harare International Airport, the brief disappearance of former ZBC News host Jestina Mukoko and the abductions of Zimbabweans living in South Africa.It is also accused for the abduction of Itai Dzamara a Zimbabwean activist. These <b>are</b> some <b>allegations</b> that have <b>been</b> <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> the organisation in the media. There were also unconfirmed reports linking the Central Intelligence Organisation to the closure of Zimweb Internet in December 2001 and the looting of Diamonds at the Marange Diamond fields among other malpractices.|$|R
5000|$|The bridge's {{full name}} commemorates Boston civic leader {{and civil rights}} activist Leonard P. Zakim who championed [...] "building bridges between peoples", and the Battle of Bunker Hill. Originally, Massachusetts Governor A. Paul Cellucci sought to name it the [...] "Freedom Bridge". In 2000, however, local clergy and {{religious}} leaders, including Cardinal Bernard Francis Law, requested the Zakim name shortly after Zakim's death from myeloma. Although Cellucci agreed to the naming, community leaders from Charlestown objected to the name as they felt that since the design reflected the nearby Bunker Hill memorial, it should be named the [...] "Bunker Hill Freedom bridge". <b>Allegations</b> of antisemitism <b>were</b> <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> members of the mostly white, Irish Catholic community as reasons for resistance to the Zakim name, based on some comments quoted in the Boston Globe. Several local neo-Nazis also complained about the honor for Zakim and launched an unsuccessful petition drive to drop his name from the Bunker Hill one (the petition needed 100 signatures to be reviewed by the Massachusetts State Legislature and only 20 people signed it). In response, several community leaders spoke out against the allegations in a press conference, stating that the claims, made by Professor Jonathan Sarna, were his alone and did not reflect the community's historical (not racial) basis of favoring the [...] "Bunker Hill" [...] name, though they dodged questions about the false claim that no Jews had fought {{in the battle of}} Bunker Hill.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedIn this {{interdisciplinary}} project, I {{argue that}} we can better understand the implicit, unofficial modes of regulation that governed the Victorian novel by studying them {{in conjunction with the}} excessively explicit, overwritten regulatory procedures of another narrative genre that is often critiqued for its seeming acquiescence to the dictates of censorship: Hays Code-era Hollywood film. These dictates were primarily moral in nature, intended to prevent the highly popular art forms of the novel and the cinema from corrupting the "susceptible" minds of their lower-class [...] and female [...] audiences. They were also, importantly, extra-legal: Hollywood filmmakers chose to embrace the directives of the Code in order to forestall legal battles at the state and Supreme Court levels, while Victorian novelists chose to censor themselves in order to appease the "Mrs. Grundy" element of their book-buying public and avoid legal confrontations altogether. Both types of narrative artists were, then, affected not by the political censorship of tyrannical governments, but by the more insidious censorship of public opinion, of middle-class morality, of the marketplace. And, in response, both sets of artists employed similar strategies of censorship resistance: strategies such as subtlety, visuality, ambiguity, and wit. "The Joy of Censorship" is in the unseemly position of defending censorship from some of the central liberal <b>allegations</b> that <b>are</b> traditionally <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> it by demonstrating that, for all its blustery self-righteousness, censorship can actually be “good” for sex, politics, feminism, and art.; My chapters are arranged thematically, each using two artists (one British novelist, one Hollywood director) to investigate the theme at hand. I consider, for example, the perverse and paradoxical role that scandal plays in the works of W. M. Thackeray and Preston Sturges, sophistication in the works of Jane Austen and George Cukor, excessive purity in the works of Charles Dickens and Frank Capra, and repression in the works of Charlotte Brontë and Elia Kazan. Ultimately, my project reveals that the allusive, subtextual style of storytelling demanded by censorship is, in many ways, precisely the style best suited to telling tales of sexually and socially subversive desire...|$|R

25|$|In 1981, a rice {{shortage}} led to {{accusations of}} corruption against the NPN government. Shortages and subsequent <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> precipitated by protectionism.
