5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E

25|$|Some {{theories}} believe many psychotic symptoms <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{with the}} perception of ownership of internally generated thoughts and experiences.

25|$|An {{artificial}} lighting system, based on technology used in Dutch rose-growing greenhouses, was tested in 2010 and purchased {{for use in}} the 2011 season. It operates 24 hours a day from October to early December to extend the growing season for the field's grass. The system is also used in some soccer stadiums where shade from stands and partial roofs <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the turf, not the cold and short growing season found in Green Bay.|$|E

The solitary tinamou is listed under Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).|$|E
25|$|Rural {{society in}} the People's Republic of China {{occupies}} less than a half of China's population (roughly 45%) and has a varied range of standard of living and means of living. Life in rural China {{differs from that of}} urban China. In southern and coastal China, rural areas are developing and, in some areas, statistically approaching urban economies. In northwest and western regions, rural society remains perceived as of a low standard and primitive. Basic needs such as running water and accessible transportation <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in these areas.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in some dogs, particularly purebreeds. For {{this reason}} {{many of the}} national kennel clubs require that dogs with certain genetic illnesses or who are deemed to be carriers cannot be registered. Some {{of the most common}} conditions include hip dysplasia, seen in large breed dogs, von Willebrand disease, a disease that affects platelets that is inherited in Doberman Pinschers, entropion, a curling in of the eyelid seen in Shar Peis and many other breeds, progressive retinal atrophy, inherited in many breeds, deafness, and epilepsy, known to be inherited in Belgian Shepherd Dogs, German Shepherd Dogs, Cocker Spaniels, and St. Bernards.|$|E

25|$|UV {{disinfection}} is {{most effective}} for treating high-clarity, purified reverse osmosis distilled water. Suspended particles <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.|$|E
25|$|Deforestation {{and forest}} fires <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in many areas, {{as is the}} continual spread of the {{eucalyptus}} tree, a species imported from Australia, actively promoted by the paper industry since the mid-20th century. Galicia {{is one of the}} more forested areas of Spain, but the majority of Galicia's plantations, usually growing eucalyptus or pine, lack any formal management. Massive eucalyptus plantation, especially of Eucalyptus globulus , began in the Francisco Franco era, largely on behalf of the paper company Empresa Nacional de Celulosas de España (ENCE) in Pontevedra, which wanted it for its pulp. Wood products figure significantly in Galicia's economy. Apart from tree plantations Galicia is also notable for the extensive surface occupied by meadows used for animal husbandry, especially cattle, an important activity. Hydroelectric development in most rivers has been a serious concern for local conservationists during the last decades.|$|E
25|$|For flights {{within the}} Schengen Area (either between Schengen member states or {{within the same}} Schengen member state), law {{enforcement}} agencies, airport authorities and air carriers are only permitted to carry out security checks on passengers and may not carry out border checks. Such security checks can be conducted through the verification of the passenger's passport or national identity card: Such a practice must only be used to verify the passenger's identity (for commercial or transport security reasons) and not his or her immigration status. For this reason, law enforcement agencies, airport authorities and air carriers cannot require air passengers flying within the Schengen Area who are third-country nationals to prove the legality of their stay by showing a valid visa or residence permit. In addition, according to European Commission guidelines, identity checks on air passengers flying within the Schengen Area should take place only either at check-in, or upon entry to the secured zone of the airport, or at the boarding gate: passengers should {{not be required to}} undergo a verification of their identity {{on more than one occasion}} before their flight within the Schengen Area. Nevertheless, the identity checks function as practical border controls anyway, and <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for illegal immigrants who arrive in Greece (which has no land border to another Schengen country) and want to go to some other Schengen country. The requirements as to which identity document to possess varies by country and airline. Normally a passport or EU national identity card is needed. Greece, Iceland and Malta do not share land borders with other Schengen member states.|$|E

500|$|The image {{analysis}} {{starts with a}} calculation of the input and output impedances (the image impedances) and the transfer function of a section in an infinite chain of identical sections. This can {{be shown to be}} equivalent to the performance of a section terminated in its image impedances.Laplante, p.341. The image method, therefore, relies on each filter section being terminated with the correct image impedance. This is easy enough to do with the internal sections of a multiple section filter, because it is only necessary to ensure that the sections facing the one in question have identical image impedances. However, the end sections <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> They will usually be terminated with fixed resistances that the filter cannot match perfectly except at one specific frequency. This mismatch leads to multiple reflections at the filter terminations and at the junctions between sections. [...] These reflections result in the filter response deviating quite sharply from the theoretical, especially near the cut-off frequency.|$|E
