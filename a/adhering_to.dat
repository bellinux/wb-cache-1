40|$|The {{ability of}} Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG- 1 <b>to</b> <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> human {{epithelial}} cells was investigated and compared with its ability <b>to</b> <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> a test hydrocarbon (hexadecane). RAG- 1, a microorganism originally isolated for growth on hydrocarbon, <b>adhered</b> <b>to</b> epithelial cells when grown under conditions which promote its adherence to hexadecane; similarly, RAG- 1 cells <b>adhered</b> poorly <b>to</b> epithelial cells when grown under conditions which cause the cells to possess low affinity towards hexadecane. A mutant derived from RAG- 1, MR- 481, deficient {{in its ability}} <b>to</b> <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> hydrocarbon, was similarly unable <b>to</b> <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> epithelial cells.

5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> the surface and makes {{mechanical}} removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E

5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} {{important}} issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> the rules binding them to a strictly religious life.

Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E

Hence, the guidelines had been flexibly applied and the PSA had not fettered its discretion by rigidly <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> a policy.
