5|$|In 2007, Lasseter renamed Walt Disney Feature <b>Animation</b> to Walt Disney <b>Animation</b> Studios, and re-positioned {{the studio}} as an <b>animation</b> house that {{produced}} {{both traditional and}} computer-animated projects. In order {{to keep costs down}} on hand-drawn productions, <b>animation,</b> design, and layout were done in-house at Disney while clean-up <b>animation</b> and digital ink-and-paint were farmed out to vendors and freelancers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Hosoda, the team included writer Satoko Okudera and character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who previously worked with Hosoda on The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. Hiroyuki Aoyama {{served as an}} <b>animation</b> director, while action <b>animation</b> direction was handled by Tatsuzo Nishida. During production, Sadamoto based Wabisuke's design on those of actor Yusaku Matsuda. Aoyama was responsible for supervising the <b>animation</b> {{of the real world}} scenes, while Nishida supervised the <b>animation</b> for the digital world, using both traditional <b>animation</b> and computer <b>animation</b> techniques. Digital <b>animation</b> studio Digital Frontier was responsible for creating the visuals of OZ and its avatars. Youji Takeshige oversaw the art direction for Summer Wars. While visiting Ueda, Hosoda thought that Takeshige, who has previously worked with Studio Ghibli, should draw traditional Japanese houses for the film. The film also features the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa, whose control center is located in the nearby city of Saku. Hosoda included the spacecraft to support Japan's contribution towards space exploration.|$|E

5|$|Aladdin and The Lion King {{had been}} the highest-grossing films {{worldwide}} in each of their respective release years. Between these in-house productions, Disney diversified in <b>animation</b> methods and produced The Nightmare Before Christmas with former Disney animator Tim Burton. With <b>animation</b> becoming again an increasingly important and lucrative part of Disney's business, the company began to expand its operations. The flagship California studio was split into two units and expanded, and ground was broken on a new Disney Feature <b>Animation</b> building adjacent to the main Disney lot in Burbank, which was dedicated in 1995. The Florida satellite, officially incorporated in 1992, was expanded as well, and one of Disney's television <b>animation</b> studios in the Paris, France suburb of Montreuil– the former Brizzi Brothers studio– became Walt Disney Feature <b>Animation</b> Paris, where A Goofy Movie (1995) and significant parts of later Disney films were produced. Also, Disney began producing lower cost direct to video sequels for its successful animated films using the services of its television <b>animation</b> studios under the name Disney MovieToons. The Return of Jafar (1994), a sequel to Aladdin and a pilot for the Aladdin television show spin-off, {{was the first of}} these productions. Walt Disney Feature <b>Animation</b> was also heavily involved in the adaptations of both Beauty and the Beast in 1994 and The Lion King in 1997 into Broadway musicals.|$|E

5|$|<b>Animation</b> work on Animaniacs was farmed out {{to several}} {{different}} studios, both American and international, {{over the course}} of the show's production. The <b>animation</b> companies included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as TMS Entertainment), StarToons, Wang Film Productions, Freelance Animators New Zealand, and AKOM, and most Animaniacs episodes frequently had <b>animation</b> from different companies in each episode's respective segments.|$|E
5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical <b>animation,</b> and this economic reality caused many <b>animation</b> studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited <b>animation,</b> which allowed television <b>animation</b> to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed <b>animation.</b> The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed <b>animation</b> to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited <b>animation</b> became the standard for television <b>animation,</b> and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E

5|$|Born in Bunkyō Ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki {{expressed}} interest in manga and <b>animation</b> from an early age, and he joined Toei <b>Animation</b> in 1963. During his early years at Toei <b>Animation</b> he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key <b>animation</b> to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon <b>Animation)</b> in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan. He joined Telecom <b>Animation</b> Film in 1979 to direct his first feature films, The Castle of Cagliostro in 1979 and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind in 1984, {{as well as the}} television series Sherlock Hound.|$|E
40|$|People {{empathize with}} fictional {{displays}} of behaviour, {{including those of}} cartoons and computer <b>animations,</b> even though the stimuli are obviously artificial. However, {{the extent to which}} other animals also may respond empathetically to <b>animations</b> has yet to be determined. <b>Animations</b> provide a potentially useful tool for exploring non-human behaviour, cognition and empathy because computer-generated stimuli offer complete control over variables and the ability to program stimuli that could not be captured on video. Establishing computer <b>animations</b> as a viable tool requires that non-human subjects identify with and respond to <b>animations</b> in a way similar to the way they do to images of actual conspecifics. Contagious yawning has been linked to empathy and poses a good test of involuntary identification and motor mimicry. We presented 24 chimpanzees with three-dimensional computer-animated chimpanzees yawning or displaying control mouth movements. The apes yawned significantly more in response to the yawn <b>animations</b> than to the controls, implying identification with the <b>animations.</b> These results support the phenomenon of contagious yawning in chimpanzees and suggest an empathic response to <b>animations.</b> Understanding how chimpanzees connect with <b>animations,</b> to both empathize and imitate, may help us to understand how humans do the same...|$|R
