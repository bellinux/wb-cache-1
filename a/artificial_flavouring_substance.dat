40|$|The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has {{conducted}} an assessment {{on the use}} of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in infant and follow-on formula and in foods for special medical purposes intended for infants and young children. In the opinion of the BfR, <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> are neither required to improve acceptance of such products nor to support development of taste sensation. […] Since infant formula is a standardised product, even the addition of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> does not provide the spectrum of flavours that breast milk offers infants. Based on the current state of knowledge, flavoured infant foods cannot, therefore, support the development of a baby’s sense of taste and smell in the way that breast milk can. Babies are especially vulnerable during {{the first few months of}} life: the body’s detoxification systems […]. Therefore, international expert committees emphasise that the ADI values derived for food additives are not to be applied to babies up to the age of 12 weeks. […] The BfR is of the opinion that the rationale behind the use of food additives in baby food should also apply to the use of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in baby foods. […] <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> should be used neither in the production of infant formula nor in balanced diets intended for babies aged less than three months. If, under exceptional circumstances, their use is however deemed necessary, the <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> intended to be used require, like any food additives, special case-by-case assessment. In addition, there are indications that sensory experience during infancy influence the development of the sense of taste and thus may have implications on subsequent dietary preferences. However, the currently available data are not sufficient to assess the consequences of the use of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in infant formula for later dietary behaviour and related health risks...|$|R

Based on these new data, the Panel concluded that the <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance</b> [FL-no: 07. 101] does not present a safety concern with respect to genotoxicity and accordingly it can be evaluated using the Procedure. On the contrary, the Panel could not conclude on the in vivo genotoxicity of [FL-no: 07. 177] and more appropriate in vivo genotoxicity tests, considering also first site of contact, should be performed. In addition, the substance 4 -methyl- 3 -hepten- 5 -one [FL-no: 07. 261] was now identified as a substance for which no representative substances could be identified in the present FGE, resulting in a need for additional data on the genotoxic potential of this <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance.</b> However, the Panel noted that the 2 -methyl substituted α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in FGE. 201 Rev 1 {{can be considered as}} structurally related to [FL-no: 07. 261].
