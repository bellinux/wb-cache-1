500|$|While {{trying to}} have a moment of silence for Li'l Sebastian in the parks {{department}} office, the staff is interrupted when a custodian playing the Shania Twain song [...] "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" [...] on his radio. This scene was actually based on something that happened in the writer's room. Ron discovers Leslie and Ben's affair after they accidentally pocket dial him while sexually role-playing with political figures. At one point, Leslie tells Ben she is going to kiss him both like former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At <b>another,</b> <b>Ben</b> impersonates former President Ronald Reagan, which prompts Leslie, pretending to be United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to say, [...] "Oh, President Reagan, my blazer popped open." [...] In a different scene, Andy seeks to write a song for Li'l Sebastian that is 5,000 times better than Elton John's [...] "Candle in the Wind", which inspires him to write the original song [...] "5,000 Candles in the Wind". Other songs played during Li'l Sebastian's memorial service include [...] "Wild Horses" [...] by The Rolling Stones and [...] "A Horse with No Name" [...] by America. In an attempt to explain to someone that she and Ben were hugging, Leslie explains she recently won a McArthur Genius Grant and that Ben was simply congratulating her. In addition, during Tom and Jean-Ralphio's eulogy presentation for Lil' Sebastian, a still of the Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius is seen. The image is more popularly recognized as the cover art for progressive rock band King Crimson's 1971 album Islands.|$|E

5000|$|The play {{begins on}} the night librarian/aspiring writer Ben rescues a {{beautiful}} naked woman, Tracy, from the ocean and brings her into his Cape Cod beach house to recuperate. Tracy claims {{it was not a}} suicide attempt but that she was dancing in the ocean. Ben doubts this but does his best to take care of her. Soon the two find that they have conflicting personalities, but try to work through them and gradually get closer to one <b>another.</b> <b>Ben</b> is fascinated and amused by her feisty behavior and eccentric sense of humor and falls for her. Tracy's first impulse is to break their connection, out of fear of the pain of loving someone and then inevitably losing them. As the story continues we see them struggling {{to find a way to}} save their difficult relationship, which is constantly threatened by Tracy's serious trust issues. After a crisis involving the possibility of an unexpected pregnancy, Tracy is finally able to reveal the origins of her fear of attachment in her childhood horror at the meaningless suffering of innocent creatures. The indifference of the universe to the suffering of the innocent is embodied for her in the eyes of the sharks in the ocean. The relationship with Ben has brought to the surface all of her deepest anxieties and fears.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{alternate}} reality shown in Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, {{an alternate}} reality was witnessed where May {{died in a}} random accident, prompting Peter to go into show business with Ben as his agent to make money. However, Peter's focus on his career with no reason to go into crime-fighting- his would-be enemies being dealt with {{by the likes of}} Thor- prompts him to eventually leave home, simply paying Ben a percentage out of respect for their old relationship rather than any actual concern. This Ben was eventually 'derailed' into the 616 reality by the Hobgoblin of 2211 as part of her plan against the Spider-Men of various eras, leaving him shocked when he witnessed his destroyed house and the still-living May Parker. Confronting her, he ended up in a fight with Jarvis, with whom she at the time has a relationship with, but wandered away in confusion. Lacking direction, Ben wandered into an alleyway where he encountered a shadowy figure who offered him a gun, telling Ben that any action he takes would simply create another universe where he took the opposite action, so he might as well do what felt good. After this Hobgoblin was erased from history by a Retcon Bomb of her own invention, the Spider-Man of 2211 met with what he presumed to be the same Ben Parker to take him back to his own timeline. In a surprise twist, deciding he rather wanted to [...] "stick around for a while", this Ben Parker shot this future Spider-Man. At the same time, <b>another</b> <b>Ben</b> Parker was shown dead in the alley, meaning one Ben Parker had killed the other and taken his place.|$|E
