China became the fourth country to have successfully developed a thermonuclear weapon after the United States, Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. It was {{dropped from a}} Hong-6(Chinese manufactured Tu-16) and was parachute-retarded for an <b>airburst</b> at 2960 meters. The bomb was a three-stage device with a boosted U-235 primary and U-238 pusher. The yield was 3.3 megatons.|$|E
25|$|In January 1950, Bell {{began to}} study what nuclear warheads were {{available}} for RASCAL. The W-5 Nuclear Warhead was initially considered. On 20 August 1950 the Special Weapons Development Board (SWDB) authorized a W-5/RASCAL integration effort. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was responsible for developing the fuzing system for the RASCAL warhead. No provision was made for surface burst at this time. In April 1952 fuze development was shifted to Bell which resulted because it was USAF policy to make airframe contractors responsible for nuclear weapons fuzing since this system needed to be integrated with the missile's guidance system. Bell developed two complete fuzing systems, <b>airburst</b> or surface burst. Then in March 1956 the W-5/RASCAL program was canceled.|$|E
25|$|During the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion, a fourth-grade {{teacher in}} Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, saved 44 {{children}} from potentially life-threatening ballistic window glass cuts by ordering them to hide under their desks {{when she saw}} the flash. Despite not knowing the origin of the intense flash of light, she ordered her students to execute a duck and cover drill. Ms. Karbysheva, who herself did not duck and cover but remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the explosion's blast wave arrived, and window glass blew in, severing a tendon in one of her arms; however, not one of her students, who she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered a cut. A follow up study {{of the effects of the}} meteor <b>airburst</b> determined that the windows most prone to breaking when exposed to a blast overpressure are those of school buildings, which tend to be large in area.|$|E

25|$|Given the low {{intensity}} of Luftwaffe air attacks, HAA {{guns in the}} bridgehead were sometimes made available to fire on ground targets for bombardment, counter-battery and anti-tank shoots. For example, 80th AA Bde's 3.7-inch guns fired in support of I Corps during Operation Charnwood on 8 July. The brigade's HAA guns stationed {{at the mouth of}} the Orne were also tasked with a role in coast defence, to fire an <b>airburst</b> high explosive barrage against enemy craft if requested by the Royal Navy. Some searchlights from 474th S/L Battery were also given a subsidiary coast defence role, while radar sets were used to plot Parachute mines being dropped by German aircraft in the anchorage (though the AA guns were forbidden to engage them for fear of causing casualties among the shipping). A roving Troop of 114th LAA Rgt was sent to protect an important ammunition ship unloading at Ouistreham.|$|E

Two MH-60K Blackhawks carrying a para jumper medical team and two MH-60L DAPs of the 160th SOAR responded and engaged the Iraqis, which allowed the Delta operators to move their casualties to an emergency HLZ and they were medevaced to H-1 escorted {{by a pair of}} A-10As, however MSG George Fernandez died. The DAPs stayed on station and continued to engage the Iraqis, destroying a truck carrying a mortar and several infantry squads, whilst Delta snipers killed Iraqi infantryman firing on the DAPs, another pair of A-10As arrived and dropped <b>airburst</b> 500lb bombs within 20m of Delta positions and killed a large number of Iraqi infantry gathering in a wadi.

Landing at Green Beach on 2 July 1945, the second day of the operation, the 2/31st went ashore unopposed and moved inland, taking up positions in the centre of the Australian line around a location called [...] "Ration". After establishing themselves on the hill, later in the day they were struck by <b>airburst</b> artillery before commencing clearing patrols and occupying a smaller feature known as [...] "Resort". The following day the battalion commenced operations along the Milford Highway, as the Japanese began to withdraw towards Batuchampar.

500|$|In May 2012, the Army's Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition System (PM MAS) {{began to}} {{emphasize}} the need for munitions suppliers to begin readying for GCV IFV ammunition needs.

[...] Specific requirements were for <b>airburst</b> capability to defeat infantry targets (with high explosive incendiary recognized as a [...] "less effective alternative"), armor-piercing rounds to defeat material threats, and training ammunition for each tactical round. [...] Potential candidates included five U.S. produced and three foreign-made rounds. [...] On 7 August 2013, a sources sought announcement was made for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for 30x173 mm ammunition: 2,700 rounds of Mk 238 Mod 1 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer (HEI-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 258 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 268 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); and 2,000 rounds of Mk 317 Target Practice Discarding Sabot-Tracer (TPDS-T).

500|$|Parsons {{witnessed}} the first explosion, Able, {{from the deck}} of the task force flagship, the command ship [...] An <b>airburst</b> like the Hiroshima blast, it was unimpressive, and even Parsons thought that it must have been smaller than the Hiroshima bomb. It failed to sink the target ship, the battleship , mainly because it missed it by a considerable distance. This made it difficult to assess the amount of damage caused, which was the objective of the exercise. Blandy then announced that the next test, Baker, would occur in just three weeks. This meant that Parsons had to carry out the evaluation of Able simultaneously with the preparations for Baker. This time he assisted with the final preparations on [...] before heading back to seaplane tender [...] for the test. The underwater Baker explosion was no larger than Able, but the dome and water column made it look far more spectacular. The real problem was the radioactive fallout, as Colonel Stafford L. Warren, the Manhattan Project's medical advisor, had predicted. The target ships proved impossible to decontaminate and, lacking targets, the test series had to be called off. For his part in Operation Crossroads, Parsons was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

2500|$|Operation Prairie Flat {{was a test}} {{involving}} the detonation of a [...] spherical surface charge of TNT to evaluate airblast, ground shock and thermal effects of nuclear weapons. Since TNT charges produce roughly double the <b>airburst</b> effect of nuclear weapons, it allowed testing {{the equivalent of a}} [...] nuclear weapon surface burst. It was a continuation of the technical co-operation (Canada, United States, Great Britain) series of tests sponsored jointly by the respective governments. Similar to previous tests, a large number of projects were carried out simultaneously due to the infrequent opportunity and cost of large explosives tests – the United States alone conducted 39 projects. The resulting airblast also allowed testing various targets at a range of overpressures to verify how structures resist effects of nuclear weapons. These included troop field shelters, fiberglass manholes, foxhole overhead covers, blast valves and electrical generators. Debris fracturing and transport were also tested as part of the effort to understand nuclear blast effects on Nike-X anti-ballistic missile sites. An additional goal of the test was to compare the blast with the previous Distant Plain Event 6 that used an equivalent but smaller [...] configuration in order to study scaling factors.|$|E
