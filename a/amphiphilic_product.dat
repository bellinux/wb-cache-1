The molecular structures of DSHPG samples are characterized by NMR, FTIR, and GPC, and the thermal behaviors are characterized by DSC and TGA. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are prepared with DSHPG as the stabilizer and surface-modification reagent. The size of Au NPs can be tuned by changing the molecular weight of HPG. It is observed that the HPG molecular weights of 1123, 3826, and 55, 075 lead to the NP diameters of 4.1  nm for Au@DSHPG- 1, 9.7  nm for Au@DSHPG- 2, and 15.1  nm for Au@DSHPG- 3, respectively. The morphology and size of Au NPs are characterized by TEM and DLS. Especially, the dispersion abilities of Au NPs in different pure solvents and co-solvent mixtures are investigated. The long alkyl chains on DSHPG give the ability of Au NPs to be well dispersed in nonpolar solvents. Hydrocarbon-based nanofluids {{can be obtained from}} the hydrophobic Au NPs dispersed into a series of hydrocarbons. The dispersion stability for Au NPs in hydrocarbons is monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy, and the relative concentration of Au NPs is observed to still maintain over 80 % after 3600  h.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of Nano Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS) is a promising approach for developing intelligent therapeutic systems, which will bring significant {{advances in the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} disease, with the challenges to maximize therapeutic activity and to minimize undesirable side effects. The aim of this thesis was focused on the design of two kind of self-assembled nanocarrier for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs: Hyaluronan based nanohydrogel and pNIPAAm based micelles that both show hydrophobic internal domains and a surrounding hydrophilic shell. To achieve such self-assembled nanostructures, amphiphilic polymers were synthesized and extensively characterized. Hyaluronan (HA) and the thermosensitive di-block copolymer of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) -b-(N-isopropylacrylamide) -co-(2 -azidoethyl) methacrylate (mPEG-b-p(NIPAAm) -co-AzEMA) constituted the starting polymers on which riboflavin 2 ', 3 ', 4 ', 5 '- tetrabutyrate (Rfv), due to its interesting chemical-physical proprieties and due to its particularly biocompatibility, was conjugated as hydrophobic moiety via azide-alkyne click chemistry reaction. The HA-Prop derivatives were synthesized in order to provide the polymer of alkyne groups and make it versatile for “click” reaction. In this way, the azido-hexyl derivative of riboflavin tetrabutyrate was synthesized and covalently coupled to the propargyl derivative of hyaluronic acid by Copper(I) -catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC), due to the high efficacy and selectivity of this kind of reaction. Sterile self-assembled NHs were obtained in one-step by thermal treatment in autoclave of the aqueous dispersion of the HA-c-Rfv polymers. Size and polydispersity of the obtained NHs resulted be influenced from the Mw and from the degrees of derivatization of the starting Hyaluronan. Micellar nano-assemblies composed of thermosensitive amphiphilic block polymers were formed by heating the aqueous solutions of the resulting poly(NIPAAm) block copolymer, in order to obtain temporal control of the release of the encapsulated drugs. For this purpose, mPEG-b-p(NIPAAm) -co-AzEMA block copolymer was synthesized by free radical polymerization and subsequently, a propargyl derivative of riboflavin (Rfv-Prop) was synthesized and covalently coupled to the azide modified diblock copolymers by Copper(I) -catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC). The nanosystems thus formed were intended to be used for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs, thus taking advantages of the lipophilic core represented by riboflavin. Moreover, the potential π-π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of the riboflavin in the core of such nanocarriers, may bring more stable nanostructures able to provide increased loading capacity. Highly hydrophilic and biocompatible nanocarriers based on polysaccharide hydrogels (nanohydrogels, NHs) were shown to be promising systems for drug delivery applications. Inspired by these emerging and promising drug carriers for therapeutic applications, in this work we aimed to develop self-assembled hydrogel nanoparticles based on amphiphilic derivative of hyaluronic acid (HA). For this purpose, new HA-Riboflavin (HA-c-Rfv) derivatives were synthetized by “click” Copper(I) -catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, requiring a previous HA derivatization with alkyne moieties and Riboflavin modification with azide groups. The resulting <b>amphiphilic</b> <b>product</b> was able to form nanohydrogels in aqueous environments by suitable treatments, in particular by an innovative method by using an autoclave cycle. Various HA molecular weights (Mw) and derivatization degrees of the starting polymers have been used in order to assess the effect of different parameters on the NHs formation. The derivative HA 220 -c-Rfv (Mw 220 kDa, 40...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{evolution of}} meteoritic organics in the primitive earth is examined experimentally with {{attention given to}} the photochemical effects of hydrocarbon/water mixtures. Also addressed are the generation of <b>amphiphilic</b> <b>products</b> by photochemical reactions and the transduction of light energy into potentially useful forms. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) absorb light and exist in carbonaceous chondrites; PAHs are therefore examined as primitive pigments by means of salt solutions with pyrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene derivatives with hexadecane. The hexadecane undergoes photochemical oxidation and yields long-chain amphiphiles with oxygen supplied by water, and acid pH shifts also occur. PAHs are also tested in lipid bilayer membranes to examine light-energy transduction. Protons are found to accumulate within the membrane-bounded volume to form proton gradients, and this reaction is theorized {{to be a good}} model of primitive photochemical reactions that related to the transduction of light energy into useable forms...|$|R
40|$|Free {{fatty acids}} {{play a vital}} role as fuel for cells and in lipid metabolism. During lipid {{digestion}} in the gastrointestinal tract, triglycerides are hydrolyzed, resulting in free fatty acid and monoglyceride <b>amphiphilic</b> <b>products.</b> These components, together with bile salts, are responsible for the transport of lipids and poorly water-soluble nutrients and xenobiotics from the intestine into the circulatory system of the body. In this study, we show that the self-assembly of digestion products from medium-chain triglycerides (tricaprylin) in combination with bile salt and phospholipid is highly pH-responsive. Individual building blocks of caprylic acid within the mixed colloidal structures are mapped using a combination of small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering combined with both solvent contrast variation and selective deuteration. Modeling of the scattering data shows transitions in {{the size and shape of}} the micelles in combination with a transfer of the caprylic acid from the core of the micelles to the shell or into the bulk water upon increasing pH. The results help to understand the process of lipid digestion with a focus on colloidal structure formation and transformation for the delivery of triglyceride lipids and other hydrophobic functional molecules. © 2014, American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{strategies}} for the synthesis of structurally complex macrocyclic glycolipids are outlined which have opened concise and highly flexible entries into various resin glycosides and sugar-based macrodiolides. The key design elements consist of either a ring-closing alkene (RCM) or alkyne metathesis (RCAM) event or a newly developed template-directed dilactonization reaction. The performance and excellent application profile of these transformations are illustrated by the total syntheses of tricolorin A and G, woodrosin I, sophorolipid lactone, cycloviracin B 1, glucolipsin A, and various analogues thereof.

40|$|Ceramide is an <b>amphiphilic</b> natural <b>product</b> {{that plays}} {{important}} roles in multiple cellular processes. Ceramide also is known to self-assemble into transmembrane pores under physiologically relevant concentrations. In order to study the role of ceramide's 1, 3 -diol functionality in the stabilization of transmembrane pores, ceramide analogs were prepared using protecting groups to block the 1, 3 -diol unit. Blocking the 1, 3 -diol with an acetal protecting group led to a drastic decrease in membrane-activity. Surprisingly, blocking the -OH groups of C 2 -ceramide 2 with simple esters yielded a C 2 -diacetate 16 analog with increased pore-forming activity. Additionally, a new function of C 2 -ceramide 2 has been discovered that has important biological implications. Working below concentrations in which it self-assembles into transmembrane pores, C 2 -ceramide 2 facilitated the transmembrane transport of biologically relevant anions such as Cl - and HCO 3 - via an anion exchange mechanism. The 1, 3 -diol functionality of the C 2 -ceramide 2 headgroup was found to play an integral role in the binding and transport of anions, as the isopropylidene C 2 -ceramide 18 analog was unable to facilitate transmembrane anion transport. D-erythro-Sphingosine 3, produced naturally by the metabolism of ceramide, lacks the amide functionality in its hydrophilic head-group. Unlike C 2 -ceramide 2, sphingosine 3 does not facilitate transmembrane Cl - /HCO 3 - exchange. Possible reasons for this failure to facilitate the transmembrane transport of anions are discussed, namely that sphingosine 3 does not bind HCO 3 - in a non-covalent manner. Instead, sphingosine 3 forms carbamates {{in the presence of}} HCO 3 - and CO 2 in a solvent dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|Monotopic {{proteins}} {{represent a}} specialized group of membrane proteins {{in that they}} are engaged in biochemical events taking place at the membrane interface. In particular, the monotopic lipid-synthesizing enzymes are able to synthesize <b>amphiphilic</b> lipid <b>products</b> by catalyzing two biochemically distinct molecules (substrates) at the membrane interface. Thus, from an evolutionary point of view, anchoring into the membrane interface enables monotopic enzymes to confer sensitivity to a changing environment by regulating their activities in the lipid biosynthetic pathways in order to maintain a certain membrane homeostasis. We are focused on a plant lipid-synthesizing enzyme DGD 2 involved in phosphate shortage stress, and analyzed the potentially important lipid anchoring segments of it, by a set of biochemical and biophysical approaches. A mechanism was proposed to explain how DGD 2 adjusts its activity to maintain a proper membrane. In addition, a multivariate-based bioinformatics approach was used to predict the lipid-binding segments for GT-B fold monotopic enzymes. In contrast, a soluble protein Myr 1 from yeast, implicated in vesicular traffic, was also proposed to be a membrane stress sensor as it is able to exert different binding properties to stressed membranes, which is probably due to the presence of strongly plus-charged clusters in the protein. Moreover, a bacterial monotopic enzyme MGS was found to be able to induce massive amounts of intracellular vesicles in Escherichia coli cells. The mechanisms involve several steps: binding, bilayer lateral expansion, stimulation of lipid synthesis, and membrane bending. Proteolytic and mutant studies indicate that plus-charged residues and the scaffold-like structure of MGS are crucial for the vesiculation process. Hence, a number of features are involved governing the behaviour of monotopic membrane proteins at the lipid bilayer interface.
