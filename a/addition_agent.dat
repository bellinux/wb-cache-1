40|$|The {{microhardness}} {{of copper}} electrodeposited from an acid sulphate bath {{with and without}} the <b>addition</b> <b>agent,</b> Benzotriazole (BTA), has been investigated. From a pure acid bath, the microhardness of deposit varies from 94 VHN to 10 VHN as cd is changed from 6. 5 mA/cm** 2 to 39 mA/cm** 2. When BTA is added, the microhardness varies from 200 VHN to 379 VHN as cd is changed from 6. 5 mA/cm** 2 to 39 mA/cm** 2. It is seen that profound increase in microhardness is {{brought about by the}} use of BTA as an <b>addition</b> <b>agent.</b> There are many factors which can affect hardness of metals, e. g. internal stress, grain size, banded structure, dispersion of fine particles etc. The role of these in hardness of electrodeposited copper is discussed in detail...|$|E

40|$|Halo-compounds of {{acetic acid}} present in small {{quantities}} in an acid copper sulphate bath {{have been found}} to modify the growth of copper deposits on a copper (111) substrate and to increase the cathodic polarization. At low d. c. densities a transition in the type of growth from triangular pyramids to twinned pyramids and finally to polycrystalline deposit was observed. At high d. c. densities triangular and hexagonal pyramids transformed to truncated hexagonal and twinned pyramids which subsequently changed to a polycrystalline deposit. These changes are attributed to adsorption of the halo-compounds of acetic acid on the substrate. The mechanism of the deposition process is discussed. Surface coverages of <b>addition</b> <b>agents</b> determined from exchange current density values were found to fit a Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The negative free energies of adsorption of the <b>addition</b> <b>agents</b> indicate strong adsorption and inhibition of the deposition process by halo-compounds of acetic acid. © 1979...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrolytic}} deposition behavior of Mo in molten salt {{has been studied}} using the equimolarNaCI-KCI molten salt, which contains Li,MoO, as a molybdenum source. In the equimolar NaCIKCImolten salt containing only Li 2 MoO" a high cathodic current corresponding to the reductionreaction of Li 2 MoO, was observed under cathodic polarization. Under this polarization, the depositionof Mo could not be observed, but the deposition of Li,Mo 20, which grew perpendicular to thesubstrate surface was observed.

On the contrary, under the cathodic polarization in the molten salt containing K 2 SiF 6 asthe second <b>addition</b> <b>agent</b> the deposition material was changed with the polarization potential. Thus, in the molten salt containing K 2 SiF 6, MoO, was deposited at high potentials, while Mo wasdeposited at low potentials.
