The Metropolis algorithm is actually a version of a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> use single-spin-flip dynamics in the Metropolis algorithm, every state {{can be viewed as}} having links to exactly L other states, where each transition corresponds to flipping a single spin site to the opposite value. Furthermore, since the energy equation Hσ change only depends on the nearest-neighbor interaction strength J, the Ising model and its variants such the Sznajd model {{can be seen as a}} form of a voter model for opinion dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} types of radio-loud active galaxies are linked by unified models. The key observation {{that led to the}} adoption of unified models for powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars was that all quasars appear to be beamed towards us, showing superluminal motion in the cores and bright jets {{on the side of the}} source nearest to us (the Laing-Garrington effect:). If this is the case, there must be a population of objects not beamed towards us, <b>and,</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> know the lobes are not affected by beaming, they would appear as radio galaxies, provided that the quasar nucleus is obscured when the source is seen side-on. It is now accepted that at least some powerful radio galaxies have 'hidden' quasars, though it is not clear whether all such radio galaxies would be quasars if viewed from the right angle. In a similar way, low-power radio galaxies are a plausible parent population for BL Lac objects.|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{discussing}} the unusually frank {{tone of the}} report, Hassan Abdi Madar states:"The report is addressed to the President of the SDR, the Minister of Defence, and Minister of Interior. The latter, Mjor-General Ahmed Suleiman Abdalla is also a son-in-law of the President, and Third Deputy Prime Minister. Since President Barre is also the Minister of Defence -- the previous holder of that portfolio, General Mohammad Ali Samatar, having been promoted Prime Minister on January 30, 1987 -- the report is seemingly confined to family members. This would explain its extreme frankness in specifying certain clans as targets for implemented and recommended punitive action." [...] Other aims of the policy included arming other clans {{in the region and}} encouraging them to fight the dominant Isaaq: [...] "Since it has become evident that the Isaaq were, by act and intent, with the SNM; <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> could not see them giving up the line they have pursued so deceptively for some time; and in order to forestall them; we arranged for the other inhabitants of the North continuous meetings and a mobilization campaign designed to rouse them to action and to raise their level of awareness. [...] This was intended to strengthen their unity and to surround Somali unity with a defensive wall. [...] Among those inhabitants are: the Awdal people, the various sections of Western Somalis , the Las Qorey people, and the Daami people, etc. There {{is no doubt that the}} unity of these people will restore the balance of the scales which are now tipped in favour of the Isaaq. [...] If they attack their tasks energetically, their unity will also undoubtedly humble those who arrogantly maintain that they own the North when the reality is otherwise." ...|$|E
