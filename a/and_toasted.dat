2500|$|Livestock {{and poultry}} are raised on animal feed, {{much of which}} is {{composed}} of the leftovers from processing crops, including GM crops. For example, approximately 43% of a canola seed is oil. What remains after oil extraction is a meal that becomes an ingredient in animal feed and contains canola protein. Likewise, {{the bulk of the}} soybean crop is grown for oil and meal. The high-protein defatted <b>and</b> <b>toasted</b> soy meal becomes livestock feed and dog food. 98% of the US soybean crop goes for livestock feed. In 2011, 49% of the US maize harvest was used for livestock feed (including the percentage of waste from distillers grains). [...] "Despite methods that {{are becoming more and more}} sensitive, tests have not yet been able to establish a difference in the meat, milk, or eggs of animals depending on the type of feed they are fed. It is impossible to tell if an animal was fed GM soy just by looking at the resulting meat, dairy, or egg products. The only way to verify the presence of GMOs in animal feed is to analyze the origin of the feed itself." ...|$|E
