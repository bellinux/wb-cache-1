50|$|<b>A</b> <b>child</b> safety <b>seat</b> (infant safety <b>seat,</b> <b>child</b> {{restraint}} system, <b>child</b> <b>seat,</b> baby seat, restraining car seat, car seat, etc.) is a seat {{designed specifically}} {{to protect children from}} injury or death during collisions.

Many jurisdictions require children defined by age, weight, and/or height to use <b>a</b> government-approved <b>child</b> safety <b>seat</b> when riding in <b>a</b> vehicle. <b>Child</b> safety <b>seats</b> provide passive restraints and must be properly used to be effective.

50|$|Children present {{significant}} {{challenges in}} engineering and producing safe vehicles, because most children are significantly smaller and lighter than most adults. Additionally, children {{far from being}} just scaled down adults, still have an undeveloped skeletal system.

In recognition of this, many medical professionals and jurisdictions recommend or require that children under a particular age, height, and/or weight ride in <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>seat</b> and/or in the back seat, as applicable.|$|E

5000|$|Back in Minnesota, Marshall {{speaks to}} Barney {{on the phone}} who {{encourages}} him to stop acting so nice but instead get more under-handed {{as it is the}} only way he'll make it back in time. Marshall refuses, however he and Daphne find out that all flights to New York are cancelled due to a storm meaning the only way he'll make it back in time is to rent a car. Daphne throws one of Marshall's bags into a restricted area (something Barney had told Marshall to do) and by the time he retrieves it and makes it to the Rent-a-Car place he finds himself at the back of a long line with Daphne near the front of an adjacent queue. Marshall prays for a miracle, and is dismayed when an old man ends up in charge of his line. The man, amazingly, is actually extremely efficient and Marshall gets ahead of Daphne and snags the last car (even if it is the environmentally unfriendly [...] "Monstrosity"). However, the Rent-a-Car place doesn't have any child seats for Marvin. Daphne tells Marshall that if he gives her the keys, she can go in the car and buy <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>seat.</b> Despite the fact she is almost certainly lying, Marshall not only gives her the keys but also money to buy a car seat. Marshall is confident that being nice has finally paid off. However, after being left waiting for a while realizes that Daphne probably isn't coming back. Just as Marshall is about to give up, Daphne returns with the child seat and the two finally head out for New York.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{integrated}} {{child safety}} seat {{is presented in}} this paper. The seat is a two-mode seat for a motor vehicle cooperable with an adult seat belt assembly to provide two modes operation including an adult seat mode and <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>seat</b> mode. The seat locates {{in the center of}} the rear seat. The structure of the seat was designed in detail. The height of the booster of the seat can be adjusted continuously according to the seated shoulder height of the child passenger. The depth of booster cushion also can be changed according to the size of the passenger. The sled test with the seat was conducted. The seat simulation models with different booster heights were developed using MADYMO software and validated. Then, these models were used to study the performance of the seat in frontal impact. Some key parameters of the seat were studied in simulation test. The results of the test and simulation show that the seat can provide effective protection for the children aged from 3 to 10 years in frontal impact...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 3 -D vision {{system based on}} a new 3 -D sensor technology for the detection and classification of occupants in a car. New generation of so-called ”smart airbags ” require {{the information about the}} occupancy type and position of the occupant. This information allows a distinct control of the airbag inflation. In order {{to reduce the risk of}} injuries due to airbag deployment, the airbag can be suppressed completely in case of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>seat</b> oriented in reward direction. In this paper we propose a 3 -D vision system based on a 3 -D optical time-of-flight (TOF) sensor, for the detection and classification of the occupancy on the passenger seat. Geometrical shape features are extracted from the 3 -D image sequences. Polynomial classifier is considered for the classification task. A comparison of classifier performance with principle components (eigenimages) is presented. This paper also discuss the robustness of the features with variation of the data. The full scale tests have been conducted on a wide range of realistic situations (adults/children/child seats etc.) which may occur in a vehicle. 1...|$|E
40|$|This anthropological study {{intends to}} {{describe}} first the morphological characteristics of 3 and 6 years old children, {{and then to}} evaluate the safety belt position regarding the children seated {{in a car with}} different Child Restraint System (CRS). This work is based on a measurement survey which allowed to acquire anthropometric data in two approaches: somatologic data, including dimensions in standing and sitting positions (14 measurements) biometric data on the same subjects seated in a car with different restraint systems (15 measurements) The survey was conducted in a school located {{in the northern part of}} France, after obtaining compulsory authorizations from the relevant authorities. 71 children have been measured (33 three year-old and 38 six yearold). The car used for the survey is a Peugeot 308 and the backseat has been measured. The two CRSs which have been used and measured are: <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>seat</b> (CRS 1) which belongs to the European standard group 1 (children weight between 9 to 18 kg) and a booster which belongs to the groups 2 and 3 (15 to 36 kg). Children of 3 years old have been measured in the CRS 1 and CRS 2. Those of 6 years old have been measured in the CRS 2 and without CRS. Standard anthropometric tools have been used: height gauge, sliding calipers, tape measure, scales. For each age, the main percentile values of all dimensions of the children morphology have been provided. Several measurements of the belt position regarding morphological anatomical points of the child in the car with the different Child Restraint Systems (CRSs) have been performed. This allows to check the suitability of the belt regarding the morphology of the child in a restraint system. The European mass classification appears as not relevant for 75 % of the 3 year-old because they can be both in CRS 1 and CRS 2 according to their weight. The 95 th percentile of the 3 year-old appears to be out of the limit and can only be in the booster seat. As for the 6 year-old, if all the children fit in the booster seat according to their weight, children between the 5 th and the 25 th percentile could also be placed in <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>seat.</b> This work has been performed within the European Project CASPER "Child Advanced Safety Project for European Roads" co-funded by the EC under the 7 th Framework Program ([URL]...|$|E
