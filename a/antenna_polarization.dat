50|$|ERP for FM {{radio in}} the United States is always {{relative}} to a theoretical reference half-wave dipole antenna. (That is, when calculating ERP, the most direct approach {{is to work with}} antenna gain in dBd). To deal with <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization,</b> the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lists ERP in both the horizontal and vertical measurements for FM and TV. Horizontal is the standard for both, but if the vertical ERP is larger it will be used instead.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, radio {{engineers}} treated natural multipath propagation as an impairment to be mitigated. MIMO is {{the first}} radio technology that treats multipath propagation as a phenomenon to be exploited. MIMO multiplies the capacity of a radio link by transmitting multiple signals over multiple, co-located antennas. This is accomplished {{without the need for}} additional power or bandwidth. Space-time codes are employed to ensure that the signals transmitted over the different antennas are orthogonal to each other, making it easier for the receiver to distinguish one from another. Even when there is line of sight access between two stations, dual <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization</b> may be used to ensure that {{there is more than one}} robust path.|$|E
30|$|Physical models {{characterize}} {{an environment}} {{by analyzing the}} propagation of electromagnetic waves between a transmitter and a receiver. Such models can be very sophisticated and usually require indicating several parameters in order to reproduce accurately the propagation in a specific scenario. Moreover, this kind of models {{does not depend on}} the characteristics of the antenna array (number of <b>antennas,</b> <b>polarization,</b> etc.) or the system bandwidth.|$|R
40|$|In Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) propagation, {{effective}} {{diversity reception}} {{can be realized}} using a dual channel receiver and a dual <b>polarization</b> <b>antenna</b> with <b>polarization</b> matched to the (left hand and right hand) circular polarization of the characteristic waves propagating in the ionosphere. This paper presents measurements on NVIS-signals received via ionospheric F-layer reflection using a dual circular <b>polarization</b> receive <b>antenna,</b> demonstrating a reduction of the fading margin by 8 - 11 dB over a single circular <b>polarization</b> <b>antenna.</b> The measurements where performed at a mid-latitude location in the Northern hemisphere, over a distance of 110 km...|$|R
50|$|Reflections {{generally}} affect polarization. For radio waves, {{one important}} reflector is the ionosphere which {{can change the}} wave's polarization. Thus for signals received following reflection by the ionosphere (a skywave), a consistent polarization cannot be expected. For line-of-sight communications or ground wave propagation, horizontally or vertically polarized transmissions generally remain in about the same polarization state at the receiving location. Matching the receiving <b>antenna's</b> <b>polarization</b> {{to that of the}} transmitter can make a very substantial difference in received signal strength.|$|R
50|$|The antenna {{includes}} two conductive spirals or arms, {{extending from the}} center outwards. The antenna may be a flat disc, with conductors resembling a pair of loosely nested clock springs, or the spirals may extend in a three-dimensional shape like a screw thread. The direction of rotation of the spiral defines the direction of <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization.</b> Additional spirals may be included as well, to form a multi-spiral structure. Usually the spiral is cavity-backed, that {{is there is a}} cavity of air or non-conductive material or vacuum, surrounded by conductive walls; the cavity changes the antenna pattern to a unidirectional shape. The output of the antenna is a balanced line. If one input or output line is desired, for example a coaxial line, then a balun or other device is added to so transform the signals.|$|E
50|$|In {{a single}} {{receiver}} residential installation {{there is a}} single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the LNB on the dish. The DC electric power for the LNB is provided through the same coaxial cable conductors that carry the signal to the receiver. In addition, control signals are also transmitted from the receiver to the LNB through the cable. The receiver uses different power supply voltages (13 / 18 V) to select <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization,</b> and pilot tones (22 kHz) to instruct the LNB to select one of the two frequency bands. In larger installations each band and polarization is given its own cable, so there are 4 cables from the LNB to a switching matrix, which allows the connection of multiple receivers in a star topology using the same signalling method as in a single receiver installation.|$|E
50|$|Diplexers {{are also}} used in the home to allow a direct {{broadcast}} satellite TV dish antenna and a terrestrial TV antenna (local broadcast channels) to share one coaxial cable. The dish antenna occupies the high frequencies (typically 950 to 1450 MHz), and the TV antenna uses lower television channel frequencies (typically 50 to 870 MHz). In addition, the satellite also gets a DC to low frequency band to power the dish's block converter and select the dish <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization</b> (e.g., voltage signaling or DiSEqC). The diplexer is useful in homes that are already wired with one cable, because it eliminates the need to install a second cable. For the diplexer to work, the existing cable {{must be able to}} pass the satellite frequencies with little loss. Older TV installations may use a solid dielectric RG-59 cable, and that cable may be inadequate. RG-6 cable is typically used for satellite feed lines.|$|E
40|$|Microwave {{polarimeter}} systems typically {{consist of}} two orthogonally polarized receiving antennas. Formulas for extracting the unknown <b>polarization</b> <b>antennas</b> with known <b>polarization</b> states are presented. Numerical results are generated showing {{the size of}} the errors made by assuming perfect orthogonal polarizations (either circular or linear) ...|$|R
50|$|Polarization is {{predictable}} from an antenna's geometry, {{although in}} some cases {{it is not at all}} obvious (such as for the quad antenna). An <b>antenna's</b> linear <b>polarization</b> is generally along the direction (as viewed from the receiving location) of the antenna's currents when such a direction can be defined. For instance, a vertical whip antenna or Wi-Fi antenna vertically oriented will transmit and receive in the vertical <b>polarization.</b> <b>Antennas</b> with horizontal elements, such as most rooftop TV antennas in the United States, are horizontally polarized (broadcast TV in the U.S. usually uses horizontal polarization). Even when the antenna system has a vertical orientation, such as an array of horizontal dipole <b>antennas,</b> the <b>polarization</b> is in the horizontal direction corresponding to the current flow. The polarization of a commercial antenna is an essential specification.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analytical}} description for the transmission between multiple antennas is developed. The method allows {{the determination of}} covariances and channel capacity with respect to physical <b>antenna</b> parameters as <b>polarization,</b> <b>antenna</b> pattern and mutual coupling.

30|$|Based on {{investigation}} and research, the technical indicator of <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization</b> isolation of Ka-band carrier can {{be higher than}} 20  dB. But in case of special weather, the polarization isolation can drop to 10  dB [18].|$|E

30|$|To {{avoid the}} {{interference}} of the antenna orientation over the experiments results, {{it is important}} to choose a unique antenna orientation for all experiments in a WUSN testbed. In our experiments, only the 0 ° orientation (Figure 6 (a)) is used in order to eliminate the effects of the antenna orientation. Naturally, for every combination of sensor node type and its <b>antenna,</b> different <b>antenna</b> <b>polarizations</b> and orientations can be adopted as the default configuration for all experiments. Accordingly, an experiment similar to the one shown in Figure 6 must be performed to maintain the accuracy of the results and also to provide the recommendation of the best configuration for the sensor deployment.|$|R

Backscatter data were acquired at frequencies from 1. 25 to 35 GHz, at incidence angles from 0 to 80 deg, and with linear <b>antenna</b> <b>polarizations.</b> The objective was to describe the scattering coefficients of the major ice types {{in the region and}} to study the winter conditions and their influence on the microwave response. Results show that multiyear and pancake ice produce strong backscatter, while returns from open water between floes and new ice are weak. First-year ice has a wide range of returns; when the surface is smooth returns are weak, and if roughened, i. e., like pancake ice, the returns increase substantially...|$|R

Backscatter data were acquired at frequencies from 1 to 17 GHz, at angles from 0 to 70 deg from vertical, and with like and cross <b>antenna</b> <b>polarizations.</b> Results show that melt-water, snow thickness, snowpack morphology, snow surface roughness, ice surface roughness, and deformation characteristics are the fundamental scene parameters which govern the summer sea ice backscatter response. A thick, wet snow cover dominates the backscatter response and masks any ice sheet features below. However, snow and melt-water are not distributed uniformly {{and the stage}} of melt may also be quite variable. These nonuniformities related to ice type are not necessarily well understood and produce unique microwave signature characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We have {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} radar-altimeter <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization</b> on European Remote-sensing Satellite and Envisat observations of the media penetrable by a radar mi-crowave such as ice sheets. This effect is due to the complex interaction between the radar wave, the subsurface backscatter, and the <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization</b> direction. It is modulated by the angle between the <b>antenna</b> <b>polarization</b> and the direction of the anisotropy of the target. Thus, it depends on both the anisotropy direction and the interaction between the radar wave and the reflecting surface. This effect leads {{to one of the most}} complex and least understood errors of radar altimetry over ice sheets and can be clearly identified when looking at the crossover differences between ascending and descending satellite tracks. The crossover differences are as large as a few decibels for a backscattering co-efficient and a few meters for height, and affect more strongly the Ku-band than the S-band. This causes limitations and difficulties for the processing of altimetric observations, for instance when comparing time series from different satellites whose polarization geometry differs. This will be the case when a new altimeter will fly on a different orbit, as planned for CryoSat. Nevertheless, the ability of both the roughness anisotropy direction and the subsurface modulation to be inverted with satisfactory precision by using simultaneous observations at crossover points between two different satellites is demonstrated here. Thus, it offers a unique way of describing this error accurately to correct for it. Index Terms—Altimetry, Antarctica, ice sheet. I...|$|E

Closed-form expressions for the induced phase difference between interferometer antennas are derived for several combinations of receiving and transmitting <b>antenna</b> <b>polarizations.</b> Errors contributed by mechanical misalignment between antennas, as well as effects of power loss attributable to polarization mismatch, are also considered. The analysis leads to the conclusion that circularly polarized interferometer and transmitter antennas are best suited for the position location application, if it is assumed that polarization tracking of the interferometer antennas is not available.
