5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999 Don King and Oscar De la Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, agreed to co-promote a mega-fight for the Lineal, WBC and IBF welterweight championships on September 18, 1999, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. Early in the fight De la Hoya {{employed}} boxing to connect combinations while avoiding Trinidad's attacks. The second round began with both boxers trading punches but De la Hoya quickly returned to his previous tactic, which he employed in the third round. In the fourth round Trinidad pressured the offense while De la Hoya tried to avoid his punches by moving, both boxers eventually exchanged punches. In the fifth round Trinidad continued in the offensive while De la Hoya attempted {{to remain on the}} outside corners of the ring, Trinidad's eye was swollen following a trade of punches, and his nose was also bleeding. Trinidad was having a lot of problems finding De La Hoya and couldn't connect as flush as usual with his punches, although he scored at times, Oscar's movement was not letting him land in combination and it was proclaimed by many to have been a lackluster fight. In the eighth round the swelling on Trinidad's eye was worsening. Oscar was scoring on Trinidad but halfway through the tenth, De La Hoya stopped sticking <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> disengaged. De La Hoya gassed out and had remained on his toes {{for the remainder of the}} bout, and Trinidad won all the final rounds.The judges gave Trinidad a very controversial majority decision, with scores of 115–113, 115–114 and 114–114.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Second World War, {{the subject}} was {{commonly}} known as radio engineering <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> was restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio, and early television.

25|$|Carson had had ambitions {{to become}} {{governor}} in 1929 and 1933, but Byrd instead selected George C. Peery of the state's southwest corner to succeed easterner Pollard. After winning election, Peery and Carson's successor would establish Virginia's state park system, although plans to relocate reluctant residents kept changing <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> failed. Carson {{had hoped to}} head that new state agency, but was not selected because of his growing differences with Byrd, over fees owed his brother and especially over the evictions that began in late 1933 against his advice but pursuant to new federal policies and that garnered much negative publicity.|$|E
25|$|These {{technologies}} {{are used to}} develop machines that can substitute for humans. Robots {{can be used in}} any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.|$|E
25|$|Reading Terminal {{served the}} railroad's inter-city and {{regional}} rail trains, {{many of which}} are still running as part of the SEPTA Regional Rail system that connects Center City with outlying neighborhoods and suburbs, especially to the north. Many of those trains would be converted to electric power in a project that began in 1928 <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> completed in 1933, with the Newtown Branch being electrified to Fox Chase in 1966. Daily traffic peaked during World War II with up to 45,000 daily passengers, then declined in the 1950s with the advance of road and air travel. The terminal buildings declined with the railroad's fortunes as maintenance budgets were cut. The Reading declared bankruptcy on November 23, 1971.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan {{and their}} {{supporters}} were delighted with such a convincing victory over a side who had recently triumphed over Australia. England, on the other hand, had some serious questions to ask of themselves, and realised that winning back the Ashes {{was by no means}} the ultimate achievement. In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they still have not fully come back from to this date. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> dominated the series from that point onwards.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{circumstances}} Augustus wanted to terminate {{his participation in}} the war and free himself from his dependence on Peter I, previously formalized under the Treaty of Thorn of 1709, but achieved only a partial success. Attempts at peace with Sweden, which would strengthen Augustus' hand in dealing with Peter, turned also elusive, as Charles XII kept making excessive demands, including high reparations for Leszczyński. Resumption of hostilities necessarily followed, because Charles, having returned from his exile, embarked on building of an army in Stralsund, threatening Saxony and Poland. A siege of Stralsund (1711–15), undertaken jointly {{by the forces of}} Saxony, Prussia and Denmark, ended in its capture <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> concluded the Saxon participation in the great war. Saxony-Commonwealth ended up as the only power in the victorious coalition with no territorial gains.|$|E
25|$|The first match saw two Slam champions between Li Na and Samantha Stosur, {{with the}} winner {{advancing}} to the semifinals. Samantha Stosur served up a barrage of kick serves and blasted some ferocious forehands to completely confound Li Na in 66 minutes, 6–1, 6–0, improving to 6–0 in the pair's head-to-head series and dealing the Chinese her most lopsided loss on the WTA in almost {{three and a half}} years. Their sixth meeting at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships on Friday was by far their quickest, as Stosur hit far more winners (15 to 4) and was cleaner on the unforced errors (22 to 32) <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> dominated every department, losing her serve from 30-0 up in the fifth game of the match but otherwise winning every game en route to her easiest victory since Dubai in February.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas of}} {{suitable}} temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This {{is the reason}} why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized bees have another advantage over European bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues including parasites such as Varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony-collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers. So despite all its negative factors, {{it is possible that the}} Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.|$|E
25|$|In 1880 Canterbury Cricket and Athletics Sports Co. Ltd was established. In 1882, Edward Stevens and Arthur Ollivier {{initiated}} {{the purchase of}} a parcel of swampy farmland (the actual cricket ground was in low-lying area <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> sitting on a large pool of saturated water) which became Lancaster Park, and Lancaster {{was the name of the}} farmer and previous landlord. For Stevens, this was a transaction through his company, Harman and Stevens, on behalf of the owner, Benjamin Lancaster. Canterbury Cricket and Athletics Sports purchased 10 acres 3 rods 30 perches (4.426 hectares) for £2,841 at £260 per acre (NZ$ 1284.95/hectare). In 1904 Canterbury cricket would become the sole owner of the ground. Then in 1911 the Canterbury Rugby Union became co-owners with the Canterbury Cricket Association over the ground. An Act of Parliament in November 1919 vested title to Lancaster Park in the Crown, and established the Victory Park Board to take responsibility for its management.|$|E
25|$|Tennessee was {{admitted}} to the Union on June 1, 1796 as the 16th state. It was the first state created from territory {{under the jurisdiction of the}} United States federal government. Apart from the former Thirteen Colonies only Vermont and Kentucky predate Tennessee's statehood, and neither was ever a federal territory. The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, Article I, Section 31, states that the beginning point for identifying the boundary is the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it, <b>and</b> <b>basically</b> runs the extreme heights of mountain chains through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee past the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (Unicoi Mountain) to the southern boundary of the state; all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line are included in the boundaries and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee. Part of the provision also stated that the limits and jurisdiction of the state would include future land acquisition, referencing possible land trade with other states, or the acquisition of territory from west of the Mississippi River.|$|E
