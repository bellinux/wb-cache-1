5000|$|MDA {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by C. Mannich and W. Jacobsohn in 1910. It was first ingested in July 1930 by Gordon Alles who later licensed {{the drug to}} Smith, Kline & French. MDA was first used in animal tests in 1939, and human trials began in 1941 in the exploration of possible therapies for Parkinson's disease. From 1949 to 1957, more than 500 human subjects were given MDA in an investigation of its potential use as an antidepressant and/or anorectic by Smith, Kline & French. The United States Army also experimented with the drug, code named EA-1298, while working to develop a truth drug or incapacitating agent. Harold Blauer died in January 1953 after being intravenously injected, without his knowledge nor consent, with 450 mg of the drug as part of Project MKUltra. MDA was patented as a cough suppressant by H. D. Brown in 1958, as an <b>ataractic</b> by Smith, Kline & French in 1960, and as an anorectic under the trade name [...] "Amphedoxamine" [...] in 1961. MDA began {{to appear on the}} recreational drug scene around 1963 to 1964. It was then inexpensive and readily available as a research chemical from several scientific supply houses. Several researchers, including Claudio Naranjo and Richard Yensen, have explored MDA in the field of psychotherapy.|$|E
30|$|Conclusions Both NRS and NSCR are {{reliable}} {{indicators of}} pain, and the correspondence between NSCR and actual pain stimulation moreover validates {{the use of}} NSCR {{as a measure of}} pain in patients. However, NRS is also sensitive to the contextual setting and anxiety, which NSCR is not. A discussion, whether to administer analgesic or <b>ataractic</b> drugs during the perioperative stage when NRS is moderate or higher, is warranted.|$|E
40|$|Physicians should {{understand}} the psychic {{as well as}} the chemical effects of <b>ataractic</b> drugs, especially since they are prescribed chiefly for illnesses of emotional origin. The patient may feel that he is “being put off with a pill;” on the other hand, both patient and physician may be encouraged (and thus able to work better together) because the prescription of a drug represents “doing something” about the disorder...|$|E
40|$|Past studies {{indicate}} that the placebo expectation established by analgesic treatment significantly relieves pain perception, while <b>ataractic</b> treatment significantly alleviates unpleasant arousal evoked by negative picture processing. But {{it is unclear whether}} the placebo effect can be transferred from one domain to the other, namely from pain to emotion. In this study we led participants to believe in the analgesic effect of magnetic treatment equipment (the placebo) by secretly reducing the intensity of pain stimulus. Then, we examined if this placebo could significantly alter participants' negative affect evoked by watching unpleasant pictures. Our results indicated a significant transferable placebo effect that alleviated negative feelings. EEG recordings showed the transferable placebo treatment induced decreased P 2 amplitude and increased N 2 amplitude, with source location near the posterior cingulate.

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{effects of}} abrupt withdrawal of <b>ataractic</b> drugs {{have been studied}} by others. Physical symptoms also occur under such circumstances and include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Forty patients were divided into four groups of 10, each group receiving {{one of the following}} drugs: chlorpromazine, thioridazine, perphenazine or chlorprothixene. This medication was then suddenly withdrawn. In each of the chlorpromazine and thioridazine groups, three patients had gastrointestinal symptoms within 48 hours, lasting one to eight days. One patient on chlorprothixene, 450 mg. daily, experienced symptoms for six days. Perphenazine withdrawal produced no such symptoms. Thioridazine has little antiemetic action but perphenazine is prescribed for vomiting; hence it seems unlikely that the reported symptoms are due to a rebound action on the vomiting centre...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{research}} of music influence on educational process. The aim of our research is to choose musical compositions and investigate their effect on students as a means of creating emotionally comfortable atmosphere during lessons, thus making educational process more efficient. The original programme proposed here is based on classical music. The main purpose of using classical compositions in classes is to regulate students’ emotions. The effect of classical music is <b>ataractic.</b> It helps to concentrate students’ attention on studying, stimulates imagination and generates good emotions. It is emotions that create positive attitude and motivate to self-education. Music is known to be the most emotional kind of arts, thus it {{can be used as a}} means of increasing work efficiency and reducing tiredness. Musical compositions offered in the article enable to produce emotional comfort and as a result make studying process more effective.   </p...|$|E
40|$|METHYLPHENIDATE is a white, {{water-soluble}} crystalline compound. It is a piperi-dine derivative {{which can}} be administered orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously and is marketed {{under the name of}} "Ritalin " by Ciba Pharma-ceuticals. It is a behaviour-alteirmg drug which is often included in the classification of tranquillizer or <b>ataractic</b> compounds (9). In contradistinction to the tranquillizers, however, its mam pharmacologic action is stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formations and accentuation of the arousal or alerting mechanism (8) This psychic stimulation of Ritalin has interested many investigators and it has been uthzed to counteract barbiturate depression (1), "(5), (6), (7), barbiturate (7) and non-barbiturate (3) poisoning and chlorpromazine (1), (4) and rau-wolfia (2), (4) lethargy in psychiatric patients.

40|$|Diazepam, a {{new drug}} with central {{sedative}} and muscle-relaxant effects, {{has been used in}} 40 neurosurgical patients as a pre-operative tranquillizer associated with belladonna drugs. Two other types of premedication, belladonna drugs without sedatives, and hydroxyzine plus belladonna drugs, were administered to a further 78 similar cases. A double blind technique was followed. A simple scoring system based on the obser-vation of the patient's behaviour and on answers to standardized questions and stimuli has been used. Results were statistically analyzed. Diazepam had a good tranquillizing effect and was devoid of undesirable hypnotic or autonomic side effects. It appeared to be at least as safe as simple belladonna drugs: its anxiolytic and tran-quillizing effects were found to be stronger and more reliable than the <b>ataractic</b> action of hydroxyzine. Diazepam (Valium; Roche) is a new compound with powerful sedative and muscle-relaxant effects on both animals and man. Undesirable side effects such as cardiovascular, respiratory and other vita...|$|E
40|$|PSYCHOTIC {{patients}} {{have been shown}} to have an excessive incidence of rheumatoid factor and lupus factor in their sera. 1 ' 2 This paper reports the electrophoretic serum protein patterns of chronically psychotic patients who had positive serologic tests for rheumatoid factor and the patterns of certain control groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS A. Patient Material: The following sera of chronically psychotic patients were examined: (1) eighty-four sera known to contain rheumatoid factor (FH-positive group); (2) forty-six sera known not to contain rheumatoid factor or lupus factor (Fll-negative group); (3) twenty-six sera, none of them containing the rheumatoid factor, obtained from a group of schizo-phrenic patients who had had the disease for from two to five years and who had definitely not received <b>ataractic</b> drugs {{during the past two years}} ("no drugs " group); (4) ten sera from male chronic schizophrenics who had had catatonic withdrawal to the point of mutism for from three months to two years in duration ("catatonic " group). The psychiatric diagnoses and medical status (where relevant) of the patients in the Fll-positive and Fll-negative groups have already been published. x B. Controls: An attempt was made to rule out long institutionalization as a factor by using as controls the sera from 50 long-term prisoners in Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. None of these sera was found to contain rheumatoid factor or lupus factor...|$|E
40|$|Although {{studies on}} placebo effect proved the placebo {{expectation}} established by pain-alleviating treatment could significantly alleviate later pain perception, or the placebo expectation established by anxiety-reducing treatment could {{significantly reduce the}} intensity of induced negative feelings, it is still unclear {{whether or not the}} placebo effect can occur in a transferable manner. That is, we still don’t know if the placebo expectation derived from pain-alleviating can significantly reduce later negative emotional arousal or not. Experiment 1 : We compared the effect of the verbal expectation (purely verbal induction and without pain-alleviating reinforcement) with the reinforced expectation (building the belief in the placebo’s <b>ataractic</b> efficiency on unpleasant picture processing by secret reduction of the intensity of the pain-evoking stimulus) on the negative emotion. The results showed that the expectation, which was reinforced by actual analgesia, was transferable and could produce significant placebo effect on negative emotional arousal. However, the expectation that was merely induced by verbal instruction did not have such power. Experiment 2 both examined the direct analgesic effect of the placebo on the sensory pain (how strong is the pain stimulus) and emotional pain (how disturbing is the pain stimulus) and the transferable <b>ataractic</b> effect of the placebo on the negative emotion (how disturbing is the emotional picture stimulus), and further proved that the placebo expectation that was established from pain-reducing reinforcement not only induced significant placebo effect on pain, but also significant placebo effect on unpleasant feeling. These results support the viewpoint that the reduction of affective pain based on the conditioning mechanism {{plays an important role in}} the placebo analgesia, but can’t explain the transferred placebo effect on visual unpleasantness. Experiment 3 continued to use the paradigm of the reinforced expectation group and recorded the EEG activities, the data showed that the transferable placebo treatment was accompanied with decreased P 2 amplitude and increased N 2 distributed, and significant differences between the transferable placebo condition and the control condition (i. e., P 2 and N 2) were observed within the first 150 - 300 ms, a duration brief enough to rule out the possibility that differences between the two conditions merely reflect a bias “to try to please the investigator. In Experiment 4, we selected the placebo responders in the pre-experiment and let them to go through the formal fMRI scan. The results found that the transferable placebo treatment reduced the negative emotional response, emotion-responsive regions such as the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex and the thalamus showed an attenuated activation. And in the placebo condition, there was an enhanced activation in the subcollosal gyrus, which may be involved in emotional regulation. In conclusion, the transferable placebo treatment induced the reliable placebo effect on the behavior, EEG activity and bold signal, and we attempted to discuss the pychophysiological mechanism based on the positive expectancy. 过去的安慰剂镇痛研究，都是通过镇痛药物强化，诱导被试建立对于特定处理能够镇痛的信念，然后研究对应的安慰剂镇痛反应；安慰剂镇静作用的研究则是在镇静药物强化之后研究对应的安慰剂镇静效应。但安慰剂预期是否能够从痛觉领域向情绪发生迁移尚不清楚。本研究尝试探讨从痛觉到情绪的安慰剂的迁移性模式，即与无治疗信念相比，从痛觉治疗中获得的治疗信念是否会使负性情绪体验及相应脑活动产生影响。实验一：比较单纯的言语预期和迁移的治疗预期两种安慰剂实施方式对被试负性情绪体验的影响有何不同。结果发现单纯的言语性安慰剂预期没有使被试的负性情绪体验发生显著变化，而迁移的安慰剂预期使被试的负性情绪体验显著降低。实验二既检验迁移性安慰剂信念对疼痛感觉（有多疼）和疼痛情绪（有多烦恼）影响，也检验其对负性情绪体验的影响，结果发现疼痛感觉的变化和疼痛情绪的变化相关显著，但二者与负性情绪的变化均无显著相关，表明负性图片情绪中诱发的安慰剂效应不能由安慰剂引起的疼痛感觉和疼痛情绪变化来解释。实验三采用实验一中强化预期组的实验范式同时记录脑电，结果发现与控制条件相比，迁移性安慰剂条件下负性情绪图片诱发更低幅度的P 2 和更高幅度的N 2 ，并进一步证明安慰剂效应在感觉信息的早期加工阶段（ 300 ms内）就已发生，不支持安慰剂效应产生于后期评价偏向的观点。实验四筛选出安慰剂反应者进入核磁实验。结果发现，迁移性安慰剂条件下与负性情绪加工密切相关的杏仁核、脑岛、腹侧丘脑和前扣带激活减弱，眶部前额叶则表现为激活增强。说明迁移性安慰剂效应确实缓解了负性情绪，这种安慰剂调控可能是通过眶部前额叶进行的。研究表明：迁移性安慰剂效应确实存在，可靠诱发了行为、脑电和Bold信号的变化，并初步探明对安慰剂疗效的积极预期可能是调控情绪的心理机制...|$|E
