5|$|Breathitt was {{a member}} of National Governors Conference Executive Committee in 1964 and 1965 and chaired its Natural Resources Committee. In the 1966 legislature, he won {{approval}} for several conservation measures, including the creation of an <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> water, soil, and forest resources. The session also tightened strip mining laws to prohibit mining on mountainsides that were too steep to be restored. In 1967, he was recognized with the U.S. Department of Interior's Distinguished Service Award and Outdoor Life magazine's Conservationist of the Year Award for his contributions to conservation.|$|E

25|$|A major Southern {{argument}} in the 1850s was that banning slavery in the territories discriminated against states that allowed slavery, making them second-class states.

50|$|The {{history of}} {{sweeping}} in the United States varies little {{from that in}} the United Kingdom. Differences arise from the nature of housing and the political pressures. Early settler houses were built close together out of wood, so when one burnt it spread quickly to neighbouring properties.

25|$|The {{thalidomide}} tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill {{to enhance}} drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962.

The FDA received <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.|$|E

The new MSRB will be composed of fifteen individuals, have the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> municipal advisors, and be permitted to charge fees regarding trade information. Also, it is mandated that the Comptroller General makes several recommendations, which must be submitted to Congress within at most 24 months of enactment of the Act.|$|E
25|$|The first federal safety {{legislation}} was enacted in the Progressive period. In 1893, Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act, {{the first federal}} statute to require safety equipment in the workplace (the law applied only to railroad equipment, however). In 1910, {{in response to a}} series of highly publicized and deadly mine explosions and collapses, Congress established the United States Bureau of Mines to conduct research into mine safety (although the Bureau had no <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> mine safety). Backed by trade unions, many states also enacted workers' compensation laws which discouraged employers from permitting unsafe workplaces. These laws, as well as the growing power of labor unions and public anger toward poor workplace safety, led to significant reductions in worker accidents for a time.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Elijah White (1806–1879) was {{a missionary}} and {{agent for the}} United States {{government}} in Oregon Country during the mid-19th century.

He would return to the region after a falling-out with mission leader Jason Lee as the leader of one of the first large wagon trains across the Oregon Trail and as a sub-Indian agent of the federal government. In Oregon he used his <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> affairs between the Natives and settlers, and even between settlers. White would leave the region in 1845 as a messenger for the Provisional Government of Oregon to the United States Congress, returning in 1850 before leaving again for California in the early 1860s.|$|E
25|$|Although {{procedures}} {{in each state}} vary slightly, the electors generally follow a similar series of steps, and the Congress has constitutional <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> the procedures the states follow. The meeting is opened by the election certification official – often that state's secretary of state or equivalent – who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is {{the selection of a}} president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches {{at this point in the}} proceedings.|$|E

The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new Terrorist Finance Tracking Program monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by The New York Times).

25|$|The Congress was {{the sole}} organ of the {{national}} government, without a national court to interpret law nor an executive branch to enforce them, in the states or on individuals. Governmental functions, including declarations of war and calls for an army, were supported in some degree for some time, by each state voluntarily, or not. These newly independent states separated from Britain no longer received favored treatment at British ports. The British refused to negotiate a commercial treaty in 1785 because the individual American states would not be bound by it. Congress could not act directly upon the States nor upon individuals. It had no <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> foreign or interstate commerce. Every act of government was left to the individual States. Each state levied taxes and tariffs on other states at will, which invited retaliation. Congress could vote itself mediator and judge in state disputes, but states {{did not have to}} accept its decisions.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Public Housing Authority {{had placed}} the {{buildings}} {{in charge of}} a manager whose duty it was to rent the houses, collect the rents, and generally to supervise operations, subject to over-all control by the Authority. He ordered Tucker to discontinue all religious activities in the village. Tucker refused. Later the manager ordered Tucker to leave the village. Insisting that the manager had no right to suppress religious activities, appellant declined to leave, and his arrest followed. At the trial the manager testified that the controlling Federal agency had given him full <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> the conduct of those living in the village, and that he did not allow preaching by ministers of any denomination without a permit issued by him in his discretion. He thought this broad authority was entrusted to him, at least in part, by a regulation, which the Authority's Washington office had allegedly promulgated. He testified that this regulation provided that no peddlers or hawkers could come into or remain in the village without getting permission from the manager.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} states without {{wetlands}} laws on their books still have other state environmental laws dealing with water quality or natural resources, and they may already provide substantial <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> wetlands. However, a comprehensive picture of states' ability to protect wetlands, under various possible authorities, is difficult to draw together. To {{fill in the gap}} left by removal of some federal regulatory jurisdiction, states could adopt more comprehensive wetlands regulatory statutes or wetland amendments to state pollution control statutes (possibly including independent water quality certification programs) and rules. The latter, for example, could integrate wetlands, water quality, and watershed management. States do not have the constitutional constraints that the federal government does in enacting legislation (whether a legislative action exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause). Also, CWA section 404(t) expressly provides that the existence of section 404 does not preempt state law governing the discharge of dredged or fill material. However, whether states will take steps to expand wetlands protection in response to the Court's decision raises difficult political and resource questions. It is quite likely that, among states, the SWANCC decision pleases some states and is opposed by others.|$|E

The term usually refers to houses built in the century before the 1875 Act, which imposed a duty on local <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> housing by the use of byelaws. Subsequently, all byelaw terraced housing was required to meet minimum standards of build quality, ventilation, sanitation and population density.
