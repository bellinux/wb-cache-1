40|$|The {{introduction}} of 13 C magnetic resonance spectros-copy (MRS) has enabled noninvasive measurement of muscle glycogen synthesis in humans. Conclusions based on measurements by the MRS technique assume that glucose metabolism in gastrocnemius muscle is representative for all skeletal muscles {{and thus can}} be extrapolated to whole-body muscle glucose metabolism. An alternative method to assess whole-body muscle glycogen synthesis {{is the use of}} [3 - 3 H]glucose. In the present study, we compared this method to the MRS technique, which is a well-validated technique for mea-suring muscle glycogen synthesis.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{analyze the}} outcome of our {{preliminary}} experience with total laparoscopic aortic repair in patients with occlusive or aneurysmal disease. Material and methodsFrom September 2002 to April 2005, we performed 95 consecutive total laparoscopic aortic repair procedures including 72 for aortic occlusive disease (group A) and 23 for abdominal aortic aneurysm (group B). ResultsIn group A, mean operating time was 216 ± 50 min with <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>clamp</b> time of 57 ± 21 min and surgical conversion was required in two cases (2. 7 %). No postoperative death occurred but there were three postoperative complications necessitating re-intervention (retroperitoneal hematoma, embolic ischemia, and early prosthetic infection). Mean duration of hospitalization was 8 days (range, 5 – 42 days). All grafts were patent at 2 months. In group B, mean operating time was 251 ± 57 min with <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>clamp</b> time of 101 ± 15 min and surgical conversion was required in seven cases (30 %). There was one postoperative death (4. 3 %) due to pulmonary embolism and one non-fatal complication (retroperitoneal hematoma). Mean duration of hospitalization was 6. 4 days (range, 4 – 12 days). All grafts were patent at 2 months. ConclusionTotal laparoscopic repair is feasible and safe for occlusive and aneurysmal aortic disease. Operators must acquire technical skills using simulators...|$|R

40|$|This article {{contains}} Supplementary Data online at [URL] vagal stimulation modifies glucose and insulin metabolism, {{but the effect}} of chronic bilateral vagal stimulation is not known. Our aim was to quantify the changes in whole body and organ-specific insulin sensitivities, 12 weeks after permanent, bilateral, vagal stimulation performed at the abdominal level in adult mini-pigs. In 15 adult mini-pigs, stimulating electrodes were placed around the dorsal and ventral vagi using laparoscopy and connected to a dual channel stimulator placed subcutaneously. Animals were divided into three groups based on stimulation and body weight i. e. lean non-stimulated, obese non-stimulated and obese-stimulated. Twelve weeks after surgery, glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity were measured using PET during <b>an</b> isoglycemic <b>clamp.</b> <b>Mean</b> whole body insulin sensitivity was lower by 34 % (P< 0. 01) and hepatic glucose uptake rate by 33 % (P< 0. 01) in obese non-stimulated, but was no different in obese-stimulated compared to lean. An improvement in skeletal glucose uptake rate was also observed in obese-stimulated compared to obese non-stimulated groups (P< 0. 01). Vagal stimulation was associated with increased glucose metabolism in the cingular and prefrontal brain areas. We conclude that chronic vagal stimulation improves insulin sensitivity substantially in diet-induced obesity by both peripheral and central mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{aeroelastic}} static {{response of}} flexible wings with arbitrary cross-section geometry via a coupled CUF-XFLR 5 approach is presented. Refined structural one-dimensional (1 D) models, with a variable order of expansion for the displacement field, are developed {{on the basis}} of the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF), taking into account cross-sectional deformability. A three-dimensional (3 D) Panel Method is employed for the aerodynamic analysis, providing more accuracy with respect to the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM). A straight wing with an airfoil cross-section is modeled as <b>a</b> <b>clamped</b> beam, by <b>means</b> of the finite element method (FEM). Numerical results present the variation of wing aerodynamic parameters, and the equilibrium aeroelastic response is evaluated in terms of displacements and in-plane cross-section deformation. Aeroelastic coupled analyses are based on an iterative procedure, as well as a linear coupling approach for different free stream velocities. A convergent trend of displacements and aerodynamic coefficients is achieved as the structural model accuracy increases. Comparisons with 3 D finite element solutions prove that an accurate description of the in-plane cross-section deformation is provided by the proposed 1 D CUF model, through a significant reduction in computational cost.

50|$|A {{crowbar circuit}} is {{distinct}} from <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> in that, once triggered, it pulls the voltage below the trigger level, usually close to ground. <b>A</b> <b>clamp</b> prevents the voltage from exceeding a preset level. Thus, a crowbar will not automatically return to normal operation when the overvoltage condition is removed; power must be removed entirely to stop its conduction.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a crowbar over <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> is that the low holding voltage of the crowbar lets it carry higher fault current without dissipating much power (which could otherwise cause overheating). Also, a crowbar is more likely than <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> to deactivate <b>a</b> device (by blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker), bringing attention to the faulty equipment.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>clamp</b> {{force sensor}} is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one clamp force sensor to another. The successful use of <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> force sensor in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> force sensor deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by friction between the clamp force sensor and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents <b>a</b> true <b>clamp</b> force to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the clamp force sensor, it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the clamp force based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> force sensor.|$|R
