He and then graduate student Kay Bidle also showed that the dissolution of diatom frustules was accelerated by bacteria, as opposed to being a strictly <b>abiotic</b> <b>process</b> as previously thought.

40|$|It {{is unknown}} when life first {{appeared}} on Earth. The earliest known microfossils (approx. 3, 500 Myr before present) are structurally complex, {{and if it is}} assumed that the associated organisms required a long time to develop this degree of complexity, then the existence of life much earlier than this can be argued. But the known examples of crustal rocks older than approx. 3, 500 Myr have experienced intense metamorphism, which would have obliterated any fragile microfossils contained therein. It is therefore necessary to search for geochemical evidence of past biotic activity that has been preserved within minerals that are resistant to metamorphism. Here we report ion-microprobe measurements of the carbon-isotope composition of carbonaceous inclusions within grains of apatite (basic calcium phosphate) from the oldest known sediment sequences a approx. 3, 800 Myr-old banded iron formation from the Isua supracrustal belt, West Greenland, and a similar formation from the nearby Akilia island that is possibly older than 3, 850 Myr. The carbon in the carbonaceous inclusions is isotopically light, indicative of biological activity; no known <b>abiotic</b> <b>process</b> can explain the data. Unless some unknown <b>abiotic</b> <b>process</b> exists which is able both to create such isotopically light carbon and then selectively incorporate it into apatite grains, our results provide evidence for the emergence of life on Earth by at least 3, 800 Myr before present...|$|E

40|$|Patterns of {{movement}} in aquatic animals reflect ecologically important behaviours. Cyclical changes in the abiotic environment influence these movements, but when multiple processes occur simultaneously, identifying {{which is responsible for}} the observed movement can be complex. Here we used acoustic telemetry and signal processing to define the <b>abiotic</b> <b>processes</b> responsible for movement patterns in freshwater whiprays (Himantura dalyensis). Acoustic transmitters were implanted into the whiprays and their movements detected over 12 months by an array of passive acoustic receivers, deployed throughout 64 km of the Wenlock River, Qld, Australia. The time of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s arrival and departure from each receiver detection field was used to estimate whipray location continuously throughout the study. This created a linear-movement- waveform for each whipray and signal processing revealed periodic components within the waveform. Correlation {{of movement}} periodograms with those from <b>abiotic</b> <b>processes</b> categorically illustrated that the diel cycle dominated the pattern of whipray movement during the wet season, whereas tidal and lunar cycles dominated during the dry season.

Contrarily to our expectations, changes in the community structures did not necessarily coincide with changes in the reactor performance on the macroscopic level nor could they always be explained by changes in the operational parameters. For instance, after the initial start-up phase, the biogas plant was stable for the first 100  days of operation in terms of biogas production/quality and <b>abiotic</b> <b>process</b> parameters, yet the microbial communities passed through phase II (23 – 58  days) and into phase III (73 – 137  days) during that time, a transition, which was thus silent on the macroscopic level.

Biotransformation is a major mechanism for drug elimination, as they undergo biotransformation after they enter the body. Biotransformation, which almost always produces metabolites that are more polar than the parent compound, usually terminates the pharmacologic action of the parent drug and, via excretion, increases removal of the drug from the body. However, other consequences are possible, including similar or different pharmacologic activity, or toxicological activity. The routes by which drugs may be biotransformed are many and varied and include oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation reactions, among others. It is important that these pathways are understood, as the route of metabolism of a drug can determine its ultimate pharmacological or toxicological activity.

40|$|While biologically {{mediated}} reductive dechlorination {{continues to}} be a significant focus of chlorinated solvent remediation, there has been an increased interest in <b>abiotic</b> reductive <b>processes</b> for the remediation of chlorinated solvents. In situ chemical reduction (ISCR) uses zero-valent iron (ZVI) –based technologies, such as nanoscale iron and bimetallic ZVI, as well as naturally occurring reduced minerals incorporating dual-valent iron (DVI), such as magnetite, green rust, and iron sulfides that are capable of dechlorinating solvents. A more recent area of development in ISCR has been in combining biological and <b>abiotic</b> <b>processes.</b> There are several ways in which biological and <b>abiotic</b> <b>processes</b> can be combined. First, the interaction between the two may be “causative. ” For example, the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment’s biogeochemical reductive dechlorination (BiRD) technology combines a mulch barrier with hematite and gypsum to create an iron-sulfide-based reducing zone. Biodegradation under sulfate-reducing conditions produces sulfide that combines with the hematite to form iron sulfides. As such, the BiRD technology is “causative”; the biological processes create reducing minerals. The biological generation of other reducing minerals such as magnetite, siderite, and green rust is feasible and is, with magnetite, observed in nature at some petroleum sites. ...|$|R

This refers to the overall level of crystalline component in relationship to its amorphous component.

Inspite of its essential nature, concerns have arising due to its toxic nature at higher concentration. Several methods of removing manganese from environment have been proposed during the last few decades. However, the most favourable option based on cost-effectiveness, performance, and simplicity is still under investigation. The current review summarizes updated information on various technical aspects on manganese, including chemical nature, speciation, toxicity and remediation strategies. The review starts with covering the major sources of manganese, its interaction with biological biomolecules causing toxicity. This is followed by its speciation in environment, describing both biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>processes.</b> The biotic processes describe the role of microorganisms in the oxidation / reduction of various oxidation states of manganese.
