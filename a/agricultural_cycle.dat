5|$|When U.S. President Andrew Jackson {{allowed the}} charter of the Second Bank of the United States to expire in 1836, the U.S. was without any sort of central bank, and the money supply in New York City fluctuated with the country's annual <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle.</b> Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were {{purchased}} and—in an effort to attract money back—interest rates were raised. Foreign investors then sent their money to New York {{to take advantage of the}} higher rates. From the January 1906 Dow Jones Industrial Average high of 103, the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year. The April 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability, prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction. A further stress on the money supply occurred in late 1906, when the Bank of England raised its interest rates, partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders, and more funds remained in London than expected. From their peak in January, stock prices declined 18% by July 1906. By late September, stocks had recovered about half of their losses.|$|E
25|$|The Torah delineates three pilgrimage festivals, Passover, Shavuot (The Feasts of Weeks) and Sukkot (Tabernacles). Each {{of these}} was tied to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle</b> of the Israelites, and was also given a {{theological}} symbolism.|$|E
25|$|According to Judaism, Rosh Hashanah {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of the year because it is held on the traditional anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman according to the Hebrew Bible, and their inauguration of humanity's role in God's world. According to one secular opinion, the holiday owes its timing to the beginning of the economic year in Southwest Asia and Northeast Africa, marking the start of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{readings}} {{reflect a}} relationship of interdependency between seasonal <b>cycles,</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycles</b> and ritual cycles. The seasonal cycles determine the Tai Dam agricultural practices which in turn initiate the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycles.</b> <b>Agricultural</b> prosperity thereby regulates the ritual cycles. These cycles are realized grammatically by material and relational clauses.|$|R

25|$|The {{return of}} Georgians to Gali {{district}} of Abkhazia was halted by the fighting which broke {{out there in}} 1998. However, from 40,000 to 60,000 refugees have returned to Gali district since 1998, including persons commuting daily across the ceasefire line and those migrating seasonally in accordance with <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|R
25|$|Paganism's public rituals are {{generally}} calendrical, although the pre-Christian festivals that Pagans {{use as a}} basis varied across Europe. Nevertheless, common to almost all Pagan religions is an emphasis on an <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle</b> {{and respect for the}} dead. Common Pagan festivals include those marking the summer solstice and winter solstice as well as the start of spring and the harvest. In Wicca, a Wheel of the Year has been developed which typically involves eight seasonal festivals.|$|E
25|$|A more {{prominent}} animal is the jaguar or ocelot, often mislabeled as a “tiger” {{in the various}} dances that feature it. This character appears in Morelos, Puebla, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas and Tabasco in dances such as Tecuanes, Tlacololeros, Tejonrones, El Calalá or El Pochó. The behavior of this tiger character varies from fighting to being pursued by hunters, but the symbolism is most often related to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle</b> and the rainy season on which it depends. Tiger masks range from small {{to the size of}} the human face with some far larger, with the dancers looking out the jaws. The mask may cover only the face or be a leather or cloth helmet and complement a full costume.|$|E
25|$|Mexico’s modern folk dance {{tradition}} is a blending of elements from its Indigenous, African and European heritage. Before {{the arrival of}} the Spanish, indigenous dance developed with strong ties to the religious practices. For the Aztecs, there were two levels of dance, one for the common people, often related to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle</b> and those for the elite. After the Conquest, the Spanish initially worked to eradicate indigenous dances, considering them “too pagan” and succeeded with a number of forms, especially those associated with the priest and ruling classes. However, they were unable to eradicate the more popular forms, especially in the rural and more inaccessible regions of New Spain. Instead, evangelizers worked to adapt dances to Christianity, giving them new meanings. For this reason, most of these dances have suffered at least some modification since the pre Hispanic era.|$|E
50|$|The 250-year-old {{tradition}} of the King’s Ball {{was brought to the}} New World by Catholic émigrés, who measured the passing of time in two ways - by <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycles,</b> and the Church’s religious calendar. Lent, the weeks preceding Easter, had special importance for them as a period of repentance and atonement.|$|R
2500|$|Other archaeologists think {{instead that}} {{the main purpose of}} the road system was a {{religious}} one, providing pathways for periodic pilgrimages and facilitating regional gatherings for seasonal ceremonies. [...] Furthermore, considering that some of these roads seem to go nowhere, experts suggest they can be linked—especially the Great North Road—to astronomical observations, solstice marking, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|R

The agricultural festival of Dree is the highlight in this cycle.|$|R
25|$|From the pre-Hispanic {{period to}} the present, {{religion}} has pervaded {{the life of}} people in this region. Since it was imposed in the early 16th century, the Catholic religion has permeated and molded popular culture. Like in other parts of Mexico, indigenous ideas and practices, such as those of the Xochimilca, were not completely eradicated. Instead, many were integrated and readapted to Catholicism. One example of this is the building of churches over former temples and other sacred sites. These churches' decoration often have indigenous elements to them as well. Despite the fact that 91% of the population self identifies as Catholic, there are still many indigenous and traditions related to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle.</b> A more important syncretism has been the many religious festivals that occur through the year, and the means by which these festivals are sponsored and organized. Much of religious practice in the borough is through symbolic processes that work to produce a kind of social cohesion. The most visible of these are the large civic/religious festivals.|$|E
25|$|After the Conquest of the Aztec Empire, {{a number}} of Spanish historians noted {{indigenous}} religious rituals and ceremonies including those that used masks. The Spanish banned pre Hispanic religion but the evangelizers used the cultures’ propensity for masks and spectacle to propagate the new faith, through plays and dance. New dances evolved from the mystery plays and allegorical dramas used by evangelists. One {{of the most important}} was a pageant that reenacted the battles between Christians and Moors, which used masks to imitate the Moors. This dance was rapidly adopted by the indigenous and performed in indigenous languages. Other masked dances developed in relation to Holy Week, Day of the Dead and the Conquest of Mexico, as well as Carnival, a European festival introduced by the Spanish. The masks for characters such as Hernán Cortés, La Malinche, shepherds, devils, kings developed and became very diverse. Little is known about masks from the colonial era, but at least some came from the same workshops that produced saint images, which had sophisticated and realistic depictions of faces. Others were mostly likely made by those who sold or rented costumes to performers. Some may have been made by the dancers themselves. The developing dances and other masked events became part of a syncretism of Catholic and native traditions and belief, especially Carnival and Holy Week, with the first coinciding with the Aztec New Year and new <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle.</b> In addition, many of the masks developed during this time mocked colonial overlords. For these reasons, a various times, masks and dances were forbidden by authorities from the 16th to 18th centuries.|$|E
500|$|The villa by {{contrast}} was {{an escape from}} the bustle of the city, and in literature represents a lifestyle that balances the civilized pursuit of intellectual and artistic interests (otium) with an appreciation of nature and the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle.</b> Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista, carefully framed by the architectural design.

[...] Once grown, Horus fought and defeated Set to become king himself. [...] Set's association with chaos, and the identification of Osiris and Horus as the rightful rulers, provided a rationale for Pharaonic succession and portrayed the Pharaohs as the upholders of order. [...] At the same time, Osiris' death and rebirth were related to the Egyptian <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle,</b> in which crops grew {{in the wake of the}} Nile inundation, and provided a template for the resurrection of human souls after death.|$|E

2500|$|Sukkot ("Tabernacles" [...] or [...] "The Festival of Booths") commemorates the Israelites' {{forty years}} of {{wandering}} through the desert {{on their way to}} the Promised Land.

2500|$|Ceres was {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} spelt wheat (Latin far), the yoking of oxen and ploughing, the sowing, protection and nourishing of the young seed, and the gift of agriculture to humankind; before this, it was said, man had subsisted on acorns, and wandered without settlement or laws. She had the power to fertilise, multiply and fructify plant and animal seed, and her laws and rites protected all activities of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cycle.</b> In January, Ceres was offered spelt wheat and a pregnant sow, along with the earth-goddess Tellus, at the movable Feriae Sementivae. This was almost certainly held before the annual sowing of grain. The divine portion of sacrifice was the entrails (exta) presented in an earthenware pot (olla). In a rural context, Cato the Elder describes the offer to Ceres of a porca praecidanea (a pig, offered before the sowing). Before the harvest, she was offered a propitiary grain sample (praemetium). Ovid tells that Ceres [...] "is content with little, provided that her offerings are casta" [...] (pure).|$|E
