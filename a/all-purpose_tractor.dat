50|$|In 1917 the International Harvester Company {{purchased}} 414 acre for {{an experimental}} farm, where it tested the world's first <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractor,</b> the Farmall. Also in 1917, the Cook County Prison Farm (also {{known as the}} Bridewell Farm) began operation {{in what is now}} Burr Ridge.|$|E
5000|$|Descriptions of {{tractors}} as [...] "general-purpose" [...] and [...] "all-purpose" [...] {{had been}} used loosely and interchangeably in the teens and early twenties; but a true <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractor</b> would be one that not only brought power to ploughing, harrowing, and belt work but also [...] the horse team entirely. This latter step is what changed the financial picture to heavily favor the mechanization of agriculture. The Farmall was so successful at total horse replacement that it became a strong-selling product. With {{the success of the}} Farmall line, other manufacturers soon introduced similar general- to all-purpose tractors with varying success.|$|E
50|$|The {{industrialization}} phase {{involved a}} continuing process of mechanization. Horse-drawn machinery {{such as the}} McCormick reaper revolutionized harvesting, while inventions such as the cotton gin reduced the cost of processing. During this same period, farmers began to use steam-powered threshers and tractors, although they were expensive and dangerous. In 1892, the first gasoline-powered tractor was successfully developed, and in 1923, the International Harvester Farmall tractor became the first <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractor,</b> marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines. Mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment were then developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms.|$|E
40|$|Farming {{without the}} use of animal power became more of a reality as the 20 th century progressed. The Farmall tractor was {{introduced}} in the early 1920 s {{as one of the first}} <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractors.</b> The tricycle design allowed for nimble maneuvering, the ability to mount implements to the front and back, and had enough ground clearance to cultivate row crops...|$|R
5000|$|Farmalls were {{general-purpose}} tractors. Their origins were as row-crop tractors, {{a category}} that they helped establish {{and in which}} they long held a large market share. During the decades of Farmall production (1920s to 1970s), most Farmalls were built for row-crop work, but many orchard, fairway, and other variants were also built. Most Farmalls were <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractors</b> that were affordable for small to medium-sized family farms and could do enough of the tasks needed on the farm {{that the need for}} hired hands was reduced and the need for horses or mules was eliminated. Thus Farmall was a prominent brand in the 20th-century trend toward the mechanization of agriculture in the US.|$|R
5000|$|In later decades, the Farmall line {{continued}} to be a leading brand of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractors.</b> Its bright red color was a distinctive badge. During the 1940s and 1950s, the brand was ubiquitous in North American farming. Various trends in farming after the 1960s—such as the decline of cultivating in favor of herbicidal weed control, and the consolidation of the agricultural sector into larger but fewer farms—ended the era of Farmall manufacturing. However, many Farmalls remain in farming service, and many others are restored and collected by enthusiasts. In these respects, the Farmall era continues. As predicted in the 1980s and 1990s, the growing public understanding of environmental protection, and of sustainability in general, have brought a [...] resurgence of interest in organic farming and local food production. This cultural development has brought a limited but notable revival of cultivating and of the use of equipment such as Farmalls.|$|R
50|$|IH's first {{effort to}} solve this problem was a motor cultivator, a class of machine that various {{companies}} were building and selling in the late 1910s and early 1920s. As the name implies, these were self-propelled cultivators in the simplest sense—little more than a horse implement with a motor added. The IH motor cultivator and another <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractor,</b> the Moline Plow Company's Universal, both sold several hundred units in the late 1910s. IH's machine was not particularly successful; the Moline Universal was more successful, but its parent company nevertheless faced dire financial straits. Both models were soon discontinued. Many farmers were content (and could afford) to keep one or two horses or mules around to do miscellaneous light work (such as cultivating).|$|E
5000|$|Around 1920, as IH's motor {{cultivator}} died, {{a team of}} IH engineers was {{experimenting with}} an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractor,</b> replacing the horse in every job including cultivating. By 1923, they settled on a configuration, and their informal name for the project, the [...] "Farmall", {{was selected as the}} product's official name. As IH management was concerned that the new high-riding, tricycle design—a rather -looking thing to eyes of the early 1920s—might turn off customers, the Farmall was initially released only in Texas, in order to minimize potential embarrassment if the design proved to be unsuccessful. However, the new tractor did its many jobs well and hence sold well, and by 1926, IH was ready for large-scale production at its new Farmall Works plant in Rock Island, Illinois. Although the Farmall never reached the per-year production numbers of the Fordson during the 1920s, it was the tractor that prevented the Fordson from completely owning the market on small, lightweight, mass-produced, affordable tractors for the small or medium family farm. Its narrow-front tricycle design, high ground clearance to clear crop plants while cultivating (helped by a portal axle gearset), power take-off (a feature on which IH was an early leader), and standard mounting points for cultivators and other implements on the tractor's frame (a Farmall first) gave it some competitive advantages over the Fordson, especially for row crops, and it became the favorite row-crop tractor of America, outselling all other competitors (such as John Deere's).|$|E
5000|$|Being an amalgamation, IH, like General Motors, {{gradually}} evolved a brand architecture {{during the}} first half of the 20th century, when the concept was still new. IH capitalized on farmers' familiarity with its older brands stretching back to individual entrepreneurs of the earliest days of agricultural mechanization (Cyrus McCormick, William Deering), which is why legacy company brands McCormick and Deering were used. The Farmall name itself began as a model name and then evolved to encompass a model line. With the success of the Farmall, other manufacturers soon introduced similar general- to <b>all-purpose</b> <b>tractors</b> with varying success. In their early years, they often included the word [...] "all" [...] in the name of the product. During the first decade of Farmall sales, IH's advertising even had to emphasize the name's correlation to IH, to protect the brand name from genericization. The shift to a bright, distinctive color scheme in 1936 helped to further strengthen the branding effort.|$|R
5000|$|The M9 {{grew out}} of the Universal Engineer Tractor- [...] "UET", a {{follow-on}} to 1958's <b>All-purpose</b> Ballastable Crawler (<b>tractor)</b> or [...] "ABC". [...] By making a small tractor/scraper, it was possible to create a lightweight vehicle that could use local material as ballast. The weight was kept low enough to allow transportation in smaller cargo aircraft, to be air-droppable, and to allow the vehicle to float and swim. Initial development was between the Engineer Laboratory at Ft Belvoir, with International Harvester and Caterpillar. Successful in testing, and exciting a good deal of interest for civilian spin-off, the concept languished after a demonstration, where key decision-makers saw the vehicle sink in front of them while demonstrating its swimming ability.|$|R
