In 1969 there was a catastrophic failure of the Hinkley Point ‘A’ turbine-generator at near normal speeds (3200 rev/min). The interaction of fragments of the burst disc and the shaft caused the adjacent disc to burst almost immediately afterwards, and in the general disruption that followed another disc disintegrated completely and the entire unit was irreparably damaged. This {{is thought to be}} the first catastrophic failure of a turbine-generator in Britain. The characteristics of the material from which the burst discs were made were a contributory factor in the failure. The 3 Cr-Mo steel made by the a.0.h. process was temper embrittled during slow furnace cooling after heat treatment and therefore had poor fracture toughness, i.e. low tolerance of very sharp crack-like defects in highly stressed regions. Such material can of course be used quite safely in highly stressed regions in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>cracks.</b> A material of higher fracture toughness would have tolerated larger cracks without succumbing to their unstable propagation, and the failure would have been postponed if not avoided. At the time of the manufacture of these discs, almost 15 years ago, {{it was not possible to}} quantify the effect of embrittlement on the material’s ability to tolerate small cracks in the most highly stressed regions. The reason for the failure was down to transport of phosphor towards the grain boundaries which embrittled the chromium steel causing it to fail ...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Er:YAG laser {{has been}} used for caries removal and cavity preparation, using {{ablative}} parameters. Its effect on the margins of restorations submitted to cariogenic challenge has not yet been sufficiently investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the enamel adjacent to restored Er:YAG laser-prepared cavities submitted to cariogenic challenge in situ, under polarized light microscopy. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Ninety-one enamel slabs were randomly assigned to seven groups (n = 13) : I, II, III-Er:YAG laser with 250 mJ, 62. 5 J/cm(2), combined with 2, 3, and 4 Hz, respectively; IV, V, VI-Er:YAG laser with 350 mJ, 87. 5 J/cm(2), combined with 2, 3, and 4 Hz, respectively; VII-High-speed handpiece (control). Cavities were restored and the restorations were polished. The slabs were fixed to intra-oral appliances, worn by 13 volunteers for 14 days. Sucrose solution was applied to each slab six times per day. Samples were removed, cleaned, sectioned and ground to polarized light microscopic analysis. Demineralized area and inhibition zone width were quantitatively assessed. Presence or <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> was also analyzed. Scores for demineralization and inhibition zone were determined. Results: No difference was found among the groups with regard to demineralized area, inhibition zone width, presence or <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>cracks,</b> and demineralization score. Inhibition zone score showed difference among the groups. There was a correlation between the quantitative measures and the scores. Conclusion: Er:YAG laser was similar to high-speed handpiece, with regard to alterations in enamel adjacent to restorations submitted to cariogenic challenge in situ. The inhibition zone score might suggest less demineralization at the restoration margin of the irradiated substrates. Correlation between the quantitative measures and scores indicates that score was, in this case, a suitable complementary method for assessment of caries lesion around restorations, under polarized light microscopy.

High stresses always exist near the growth interfaces, at the shoulder-expanding locations, the tailing locations and the sites where the diameters undergo sharp changes. The maximum stresses always occur at the interface of seeds and crystals. Cracks often form in the critical defect region and spread in the m-planes and a-planes under applied tensile stresses during crystal growth.

For polyHEMA the diffusion was found to be consistent with a Fickian model. The mass diffusion coefficient of water in polyHEMA at 37 degreesC was determined from the profiles of the diffusion front to be 1. 5 x 10 (- 11) m(2) s(- 1), which is less than the value based upon mass uptake, 2. 0 x 10 (- 11) m(2) s(- 1). The profiles of the water diffusion front obtained from the NMR images showed that stress was induced at the interface between the rubbery and glassy regions which led to formation of small cracks in this region of the glassy matrix of polyHEMA and its copolymers with mole fractions of HEMA greater than 0. 6.

In particular, glass-ceramic foams have been already obtained from a liquid silicone, filled with CaO and MgO precursors and with hydrated salts, such as sodium borate and phosphate.
