He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He demanded to talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and {{a press conference to}} make a political statement. Those demands were not met, and he surrendered after 4.5 hours after he demanded and got <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beers.</b> This was the first hijacking in Norway.|$|E
500|$|Slipknot {{recorded}} Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses with producer Rick Rubin at The Mansion in Los Angeles, California in 2003. Earlier {{there had}} been speculation regarding {{the possibility of a}} third album and the band's future, as some members worked on other musical projects. After the album was completed, the band said that these side projects [...] "saved the band" [...] and [...] "helped [...] break out of the box [...] were in". Coming back together and working out their differences hindered the writing process initially. During an interview in 2008, drummer Joey Jordison said [...] "we didn't talk to each other for three months, we just sat there wasting money in the fucking Houdini mansion." [...] Speaking retrospectively percussionist Shawn Crahan states; [...] "eventually we got sick of waiting for shit to happen. We got together, had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beers</b> and wrote a really artsy, fucked up song called 'Happy Ending'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} of Evergreen {{started at the}} beginning of 1997 when Echo & the Bunnymen entered Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames. The production of the album was undertaken by McCulloch and Paul Toogood, the band's new manager, although it was credited to the band in the liner notes to the album. With Oasis in the next studio, Liam Gallagher contributed backing vocals to the track [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever". McCulloch said, [...] "We just hit it off right away, and after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beers</b> he ended up singing on the record." [...] McCulloch also said that Gallagher [...] "insisted we put tambourine on [...] " [...] which [...] "took [...] to another level". Adam Peters, who had previously worked on the band's 1984 album Ocean Rain, was brought in to provide string arrangements for the album. Using musicians from the London Metropolitan Orchestra, Peters recorded string passages for seven tracks from the album at Abbey Road Studios in London. With Clif Norrell, who had previously worked with R.E.M., finishing the mixing of the album, the recording was completed by the end of March 1997.|$|E

500|$|Later, Andy helps Leslie {{clean the}} parks office and, after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beers,</b> {{they decide to}} toilet paper Greg's house. Dave arrives in his police car and tells them he had been called to stop them. When an {{unfamiliar}} woman {{comes out of the}} house, Leslie thinks she has toilet papered the wrong house. However, the woman reveals she is Greg's actual mother, and that Greg hired a [...] "fake mother" [...] off of Craigslist {{to get him out of}} trouble. When she realizes Greg is not home, Leslie believes he is vandalizing the mayor statue. They go to the statue and catch Greg in the process; although Leslie wishes to have him [...] "locked up," [...] Dave points out he is still a minor and will likely only receive probation. Later, Leslie wonders how Greg managed to trash the parks department. The episode ends with a flashback showing Greg sneaking into the department disguised as a janitor, hiding in a dumpster until everybody leaves, then vandalizing the office.|$|E
500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beers</b> with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 1995, Simms' jersey was {{retired in}} a halftime {{ceremony}} {{of a game}} versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated {{that he wanted to}} don his jersey one final time, and throw [...] "one more pass" [...] to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beers</b> and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm {{going to be able to}} stay in that stadium'." [...] Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval. Since he has been retired for more than five years, Simms is eligible for selection into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he has yet to be inducted, however.|$|E
50|$|Before {{founding}} the company, self-taught home brewers Bjergsø and Keller experimented on brewing, {{first by}} trying to clone existing beers. After success in blind tastings, the two started creating their own recipes and entered many home brewing competitions in Denmark, eventually winning many of them. The brewery's activity was small, with {{a low level of}} public visibility, as the brewing was kitchen-based and the beer was only served at <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beer</b> enthusiast meetings and in small local bars. Bjergsø's brother founded a beer shop in 2005 and began to distribute the pair's beer to select destinations in numerous countries. In 2006, encouraged by wider appeal, Bjergsø and Keller founded the Mikkeller brewing company, named after their home brewery operation.|$|R

500|$|After {{his career}} ended, Taylor worked in several regular {{television}} jobs. He first {{worked as a}} football analyst for the now defunct TNT Sunday Night Football. In a one-off show, Taylor also appeared as a wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. He also worked as a color commentator on an amateur fighting program entitled Toughman on the FX channel. On September 4, 1995, the Giants retired Phil Simms' jersey during halftime of {{a game against the}} Cowboys (Taylor had his number retired the year before). Simms celebrated the moment by throwing an impromptu ceremonial pass to Taylor. Simms recalled, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beers</b> and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass."

Roche said, [...] "It's great. I'd compare it to a Davis Cup team effort. We started off with a lousy record. Something like 2 and 8. Everybody felt team pressure.

He {{borrowed}} one from the brother-in-law of another competitor and, prior to the starting gun, threatened the pack {{that he was going to}} drop them all at their own front doors on the way to victory. Van Lerberghe hadn't had, and would never have, an impressive career, and all the cyclists laughed as he pulled away immediately– never to be caught. Just prior to entering the velodrome for the finish, van Lerberghe stopped off at a pub to take in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>beers.</b> His manager, worrying that he would miss a chance at victory, had to track him down and get him back on the bike.

50|$|Historically, the {{restriction}} on ingredients {{led to the}} extinction of many brewing traditions and local beer specialties, such as North German spiced beer and cherry beer, {{and led to the}} domination of the German beer market by pilsener style <b>beers.</b> Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> regional <b>beer</b> varieties, such as Kölner Kölsch, Gosler Gose, or Düsseldorfer Altbier, survived its implementation. However, modern versions of the law have contained significant exceptions for different types of beer (such as top-fermented beers), for export beers, and for different regions.
