5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had <b>all</b> <b>season</b> (13 lost <b>all</b> <b>season</b> – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created <b>all</b> <b>season</b> (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E

In {{his second}} season as manager, Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion to the top flight of English football {{for the first time}} in the club's history. Starting the 1988–89 season strongly, Millwall topped the league on 1 October 1988 having played six games (winning four and drawing two) and rarely slipped out of the top five before Christmas. This was mainly due to Tony Cascarino and Teddy Sheringham, who scored 99 goals between them in three seasons playing together. Millwall's first top division season ended with a tenth-place finish, which was the lowest place occupied by the club <b>all</b> <b>season.</b> The following season, they briefly led the league for one night in September 1989 after beating Coventry City 4–1, but won only two more games <b>all</b> <b>season</b> and were relegated in 20th place at the end of the 1989–90 season.|$|E
