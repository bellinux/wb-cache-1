The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E

5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not <b>advisable</b> <b>to</b> follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{exchange}} {{project of the}} late 1980s, activity to export the Finnhorse has been minimal. However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and demand for the Finnhorse was <b>advisable</b> <b>to</b> ensure {{the survival of the}} breed. To this end, the objectives of the national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreational and educational uses such as in Pony Club; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Queensland at 17 against Victoria in December 1933, having never previously attended a first-class match as a spectator. He conceded only six byes {{and took a}} catch in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance, and made 17 and three in an innings defeat, but was dropped after the match. Queensland officials had ruled {{that it was not}} <b>advisable</b> <b>to</b> take such a young player on away trips to Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games and from then on was the first-choice wicket-keeper for the state. He played in only one other first-class match for the 193334 season, scoring 13 and taking a catch and a stumping in an eight-wicket win over South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Species {{identification}} using scales {{requires a}} fair {{degree of knowledge}} about snakes, their taxonomy, snake-scale nomenclature as well as familiarity with and access to scientific literature. Distinguishing by using scale diagrams whether a snake is venomous or not in the field cannot {{be done in the}} case of uncaught specimens. It is not <b>advisable</b> <b>to</b> catch a snake to check whether it is venomous or not using scale diagrams. Most books or websites provide an array of traits of the local herpetofauna, other than scale diagrams, which help to distinguish whether a snake in the field is venomous or not.|$|E

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is <b>advisable</b> <b>to</b> conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the morning}} of 1 September had passed, reports coming into US 2nd Division {{headquarters}} {{made it clear that}} North Koreans had penetrated to the northâ€“south Changnyong-Yongsan road and cut the division in two; the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser decided that this situation made it <b>advisable</b> <b>to</b> control and direct the divided division as two special forces. Accordingly, he placed the division artillery commander, Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes, in command of the northern group. Southward, in the Yongsan area, Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, Assistant Division Commander, in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, most of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and other miscellaneous units of the division. This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley.|$|E
5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is <b>advisable</b> <b>to</b> consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
