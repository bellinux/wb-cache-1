5|$|At {{home that}} night, Scrooge is visited by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth, entwined by heavy chains and money boxes, forged during a {{lifetime}} of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> listen to them or be cursed to carry chains of his own, much longer than Marley's chains.|$|E
5|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer sneaks out of {{work early}} and accompanies Barney {{on a tour of}} the Duff brewery. After the tour, Homer refuses to let the {{extremely}} drunk Barney drive home and forces him to hand over his keys. On their way out of the parking lot, their car is pulled over by police Chief Wiggum, along with Eddie and Lou. They administer a breathalyser test to Homer, which he fails. He is arrested, his license is revoked, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> attend traffic school and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.|$|E

25|$|On 7 June 2016, {{after the}} {{campaign}} for the local elections, Berlusconi was hospitalized to the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan because of heart problems. After two days, on 9 June, his personal doctor Alberto Zangrillo announced that the stroke could have killed him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have a heart surgery to replace a defective aortic valve.|$|E
6000|$|... “In as {{few words}} as possible,” he began, “Spencer puts it {{something}} like this: First, a man must act {{for his own}} benefit—to {{do this is to}} be moral <b>and</b> good. Next, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> act for the benefit of his children. <b>And</b> third, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> act for the benefit of his race.” ...|$|R

25|$|The prime {{minister}} is the President of the Council of Ministers—which holds effective executive power— <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is {{similar to those in}} most other parliamentary systems, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the Parliament of Italy.|$|E
25|$|Respect, but not familiarity. Not {{to permit}} {{her to talk}} about matters of his ministry. What you say to a servant should {{not be able to}} be said to other women. She must avoid excesses of language, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> not trust in her age or her piety too easily. She is not to enter the bedroom when he is in bed, except in case of illnesses.|$|E
25|$|Single wicket {{was popular}} in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches {{generally}} qualify as important. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, {{there is only one}} batsman in at a time <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.|$|E
60|$|Philammon winced {{somewhat}} at the hint; {{which seemed}} to have an ugly verisimilitude in it: but still, philosophy <b>he</b> <b>must</b> learn, <b>and</b> bread <b>he</b> <b>must</b> eat; so <b>he</b> submitted.|$|R
60|$|THE {{stranger}} who would form a correct {{opinion of the}} English character, must not confine his observations to the metropolis. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> go forth into the country; <b>he</b> <b>must</b> sojourn in villages <b>and</b> hamlets; <b>he</b> <b>must</b> visit castles, villas, farm-houses, cottages; <b>he</b> <b>must</b> wander through parks and gardens; along hedges <b>and</b> green lanes; <b>he</b> <b>must</b> loiter about country churches; attend wakes and fairs, and other rural festivals; and cope {{with the people in}} all their conditions, and all their habits and humors.|$|R
60|$|Thus also it {{was with}} the fool first mentioned; his ground did bring forth plentifully, {{wherefore}} <b>he</b> <b>must</b> of necessity forget his soul, <b>and,</b> as <b>he</b> thought, all the reason of the world he should. Wherefore, he falls to crying out, What shall I do? Now, had one said, Mind the good of thy soul, man; the answer would have been ready, But where shall I bestow my goods. If it had been replied, Stay till harvest; he returns again, But I have no room where to bestow my goods. Now, tell him of praying, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> answers, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> go to building. Tell him, he should frequent sermons, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> replies, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> mind his workmen. 'He cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?' (Isa 44:20).|$|R
25|$|There is a {{persisting}} local oral legend {{that the}} Cromwell family once lived {{briefly in the}} Black Griffin Inn, and also that Oliver Cromwell stayed there prior to the Battle of St Fagans in May 1648. There is no actual evidence to support this, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have lodged somewhere, {{but it is more}} likely that the Inn's only Cromwellian association is with soldiers of Cromwell's Model army. Cromwell was, however, of Welsh ancestry (his real name was Williams) and his great-grandfather came from this area.|$|E
25|$|Many London booksellers in {{the early}} nineteenth century were book publishers. Richard's father had {{published}} extensive catalogues and books over the years <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have assisted his father in the publication of these once he was old enough. In 1818 he published the third edition of An Essay on the Antiquities of the Irish Language by Charles Vallancey which had originally been published in 1772. He took the opportunity to add a catalogue section at the back of the book with more than 100 listings of Works relative to the History, Antiquities, and the Language of Ireland on sale in his bookshop.|$|E
25|$|Low's biggest {{challenge}} as a club maker occurred in March 1909 when Baltusrol's original clubhouse burned down. Low's repair shop was saved, but some 400 sets of members' clubs were destroyed. In those days {{there were no}} standardized sets of clubs, and each golfer's assortment of clubs was highly individualized. Low must have suffered the tortures of the damned as he responded to each replacement order, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have earned a pretty penny as he did so. But, as one newspaper observed, Low suffered large losses to his own account in the fire so that what he made in sales was partially offset by his losses in the fire.|$|E
60|$|Sam could 'ardly {{believe his}} ears, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> stood there 'oldin' his glass o' ginger-beer and {{watching}} Peter's teetotal uncle drink whiskey, <b>and</b> thought <b>'e</b> <b>must</b> be dreaming.|$|R

25|$|Four years later, a graduating Sae {{is unable}} to find a job in Tokyo. She met Junichi, who asks her to go to New York City {{together}} with him. Kouhei was also told by his father that their fishing boat was about to be repossessed by the bank, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> find another job. Kouhei then contacts Sae, telling her that he plans to go to Tokyo to find her. However, on the fishing boat's last trip, Kouhei's father had a heart attack and died. Kouhei is then unable to leave for Tokyo, as he {{had to take care of}} his mother and younger sister.|$|E
25|$|Afterward, Falcone calls Shank {{about an}} {{important}} hit: the deputy mayor {{is in town}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> be eliminated. By taking him out, the mob {{will be able to}} gain control. Shank and Falcone kill the deputy's final bodyguard, and are about to take the deputy out when Eva is taken hostage. Suddenly Shank is full of doubt, and is not able to pull the trigger. Rudy (voiced by David Goldstein), Cesar's personal assistant, kills the deputy mayor, threatening to kill Eva since she's deemed as a nuisance. Shank quickly dives {{in front of her and}} kills him. Realizing they must flee, Eva and Shank drive off into the sunset. The player then hears the voice of Cesar who tells his assassins to find and kill them.|$|E
25|$|In Hennedige Oliver v. Singapore Dental Council (2007), the High Court {{held that}} members of the Disciplinary Committee ("DC") of the Council had not acted in a biased manner towards Hennedige even though they had interjected a number of times during Hennedige's testimony, and had treated the person who had lodged a {{complaint}} against Hennedige gently but had cross-examined Hennedige robustly and strongly challenged his evidence. This was because the members of the DC were entitled to seek clarifications from Hennedige. Furthermore, his evidence covered much wider ground than the complainant's, and part of Hennedige's oral evidence at the inquiry did not feature in his written explanation. The nature of the Hennedige's answers at the inquiry warranted the additional questions, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have expected his peers in the DC to question him thoroughly on his many assertions.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{five minutes}} {{he had learned to}} speak softly, and to speak only once--a low, mellow, bell-like bark of a single syllable. Also, in this first five minutes, he had learned to [...] "sit down," [...] as {{distinctly}} different from [...] "lie down"; <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> sit down whenever <b>he</b> spoke, <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> speak without jumping or moving from the sitting position, and then must wait until the piece of food was passed to him.|$|R

25|$|One of Cassini's first {{projects}} {{at his new}} post in Paris was to send Frenchman Jean Picard {{to the site of}} Tycho Brahe's old observatory at Uraniborg, on the island of Hven near Copenhagen. Picard was to observe and time the eclipses of Jupiter's moons from Uraniborg while Cassini recorded the times they were seen in Paris. If Picard recorded the end of an eclipse at 9hours 43minutes 54seconds after midday in Uraniborg, while Cassini recorded the end of the same eclipse at 9hours 1minute 44seconds after midday in Paris – a difference of 42minutes 10seconds – the difference in longitude could be calculated to be 10°32'30". Picard was helped in his observations by a young Dane who had recently completed his studies at the University of Copenhagen – Ole Rømer – <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have been impressed by his assistant's skills, as he arranged for the young man to come to Paris to work at the Royal Observatory there.|$|E

500|$|According to Marbury v. Madison, [...] "appointed" [...] {{means at}} the moment of {{nomination}} for civil office, not at the time of approval. Although Chief Justice John Marshall stated that appointments by the President are completely voluntary, there are restrictions on his statutory authority.
