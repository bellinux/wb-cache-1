He later eloped {{with her and}} on 1 March 1752 they married in the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh; her father never forgave her for marrying an artist. Ramsay already had to maintain a daughter from his previous marriage and his two surviving sisters, but told Sir Alexander that he could provide Margaret with an annual income of £100. He said it would increase ‘as my affairs increase, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> God, {{they are in a}} way of increasing’ and that his only motive for the marriage was ‘my love for your Daughter, who, I am sensible, is entitled to much more than ever I shall have to bestow upon her’. Three children survived from their long and happy marriage, Amelia (1755–1813), Charlotte (1758–1818?), and John (1768–1845).|$|E
500|$|Merson's {{introduction}} in the 74th minute was cheered by the Arsenal supporters, as was {{his every}} touch of the ball. He admitted he was overwhelmed by the occasion, adding post-match: [...] "It was a great feeling to be in action again <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> all those who've {{made it easier for}} me.

500|$|For Mercury's 65th {{birthday}} in 2011, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. It included an animation {{set to the}} Mercury penned song, [...] "Don't Stop Me Now". Referring to [...] "the late, great Freddie Mercury" [...] in their 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, Guns N' Roses quoted Mercury's lyrics from his song [...] "We Are the Champions"; [...] "I've taken my bows, my curtain calls, you've brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you all." ...|$|E

500|$|.....I {{began to}} read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which workingmen, however organized, could be {{shattered}} and battered and splintered at a single stroke. The writings of Bellamy and Blatchford early appealed to me. The Cooperative Commonwealth of Gronlund also impressed me, but the writings of Kautsky were so clear and conclusive that I readily grasped, not merely his argument, but also caught the spirit of his socialist utterance – <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> him and all who helped me out of darkness into light." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Schmirler {{worked as}} colour {{commentator}} for CBC during Canada's national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 Osbourne was honoured at {{the second}} annual VH1Rock Honors, along with Genesis, Heart, and ZZTop. In addition, that year a bronze star honouring Osbourne was placed on Broad Street in Birmingham, England while Osbourne watched. On 18 May Osbourne had {{received}} notice {{that he would be}} the first inductee into The Birmingham Walk of Stars. He was presented the award by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham. [...] "I am really honoured", he said, [...] "All my family is here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> everyone for this reception—I'm absolutely knocked out".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the past}} (1991) however, MacArthur commended Chuck Smith (1927 – 2013), {{founder of the}} Calvary Chapel movement, for writing [...] "a {{straight}} forward critique of charismatic extremism," [...] and stated that [...] "there are many like him who have taken their stand <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical." [...] In response to MacArthur's “Strange Fire” conference, Calvary Chapel expresses a fundamental disagreement with MacArthur's understanding of spiritual gifts among God's people today, but affirms [...] "charisma, not charismania," [...] and commends Chuck Smith’s book [...] "Charisma versus Charismania" [...] as {{being one of the}} best short, popular works on the subject.|$|E
2500|$|Behold This Dreamer was {{followed}} by the publication of Poetry Concerto, also in 1961. Meanwhile, Bartlett had published more than 200 poems in literary reviews and anthologies, and felt encouraged to bring out a collection of her poetry. She sent the manuscript of the new work to Moore, who wrote: [...] "You have here what is indeed a conspectus of experience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you for the book. It seems an anomaly that it is not in 'hard covers,' in shops where all might buy. This must be corrected. As I may have said before, you must not be acquiescent under neglect, nor deterred by polite evasion or any kind of inability to make headway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Olympio {{broke his}} silence, {{which was the}} subject of much speculation, in a letter {{published}} on 21 February. In that letter, he expressed confidence in Fabre and told his supporters: [...] "I will never forget the moments of enthusiasm and confidence you have always shown in all circumstances, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you forever." [...] In a radio interview on 23 February, however, he stressed that he was still in charge of the UFC. Regarding his delayed and arguably unenthusiastic endorsement of Fabre, he said that it had been necessary to consult with other political actors before backing Fabre, and he pointed to his health as the reason he was unable to accompany Fabre on the campaign trail.|$|E
60|$|Kate {{said this}} with feeling, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> her with my eyes, {{but could not}} have spoken, and did not speak, until we had ridden some distance. After this pause, I renewed the {{discourse}} with some of its original spirit.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> her heartily, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thanked</b> him heartily, {{but said}} I could not yet {{make sure of}} joining him as he so kindly offered.

2500|$|In 2013, Hillary Clinton, former United States Secretary of State, {{took part}} in the {{academic}} celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the founding of the University of St Andrews. Clinton received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and provided the graduation address, in which she said, [...] "I do take comfort from knowing there is a long tradition of Americans being warmly welcomed here at St Andrews. Every year I learn you educate more than one thousand American students, exposing them to new ideas and perspectives as well as according them with a first class education.

2500|$|At age eight, Crosby {{wrote her}} first poem which {{described}} her condition. She later remarked: [...] "It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> {{him for the}} dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me." [...] She also once said, [...] "when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior". According to biographer Annie Willis, [...] "had {{it not been for}} her affliction she might not have so good an education or have so great an influence, and certainly not so fine a memory".|$|E
2500|$|Military forces {{increasingly}} {{joined the}} opposition, and Nasheed resigned that day. His statement read: [...] "I believe if I continue as the President of the Maldives, {{the people of}} the country would suffer more. I therefore have resigned as the President of Maldives.

My wish is for the progress and prosperity of the people. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you all for your support and contributions to achieve success for the past three years." [...] He also stated his hope that his resignation might avoid international pressure on the Maldives over the unrest. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan, who claims to have opposed Abdulla Mohamed's arrest, was then sworn in as the new president, and a warrant was issued for Nasheed's arrest.|$|E

2500|$|Cohan {{started as}} a child {{performer}} at age 8, first on the violin {{and then as a}} dancer.

[...] He and his sister made their Broadway debut in 1893 in a sketch called The Lively Bootblack. [...] Temperamental in his early years, Cohan later learned to control his frustrations.

2500|$|Celine Dion {{said while}} {{introducing}} him during her Christmas Special for These Are Special Times, in 1998, that [...] "if God {{would have a}} singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli," [...] and David Foster, a producer of the album, often describes Bocelli's voice as the most beautiful in the world. Similarly, Jazz singer, Al Jarreau, who performed with Bocelli on the [...] "Night of the Proms" [...] tour in Europe, in 1995, described him as [...] "the most beautiful voice in the world," [...] and American talk show host Oprah Winfrey commented on her talk show that, [...] "when I hear Andrea sing, I burst into tears."

2500|$|On 31 March 2005 {{following}} a urinary tract infection, he developed septic shock, {{a form of}} infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was monitored {{by a team of}} consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican. Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz. The day before his death, one of his closest personal friends, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka visited him at his bedside. During {{the final days of the}} pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace. Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St. Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: [...] "I have searched for you, and now you have come to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Notably, in {{a famous}} oration given in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the {{attitude}} of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and held that religious ministers committed a blasphemy when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. He considered that a law passed to support slavery was [...] "one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty" [...] and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church [...] "stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form," [...] and [...] "an abomination {{in the sight of}} God." [...] Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, Ichabod Spencer, and Orville Dewey, he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that [...] "we ought to obey man's law before the law of God". He further asserted, [...] "in speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States,... Henry Ward Beecher, of Brooklyn, Samuel J. May, of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend [...]" [...] He maintained that [...] "upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains." [...] In addition, he called religious people to embrace abolitionism, stating, [...] "let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds." ...|$|E
