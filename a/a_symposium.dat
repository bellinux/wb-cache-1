5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, {{prominent}} {{individuals and organizations}} have recognized the seminal importance of Engelbart's contributions. In December 1995, at the Fourth WWW Conference in Boston, {{he was the first}} recipient of what would later become the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award. In 1997 he was awarded the Lemelson-MIT Prize of $500,000, the world's largest single prize for invention and innovation, and the ACM Turing Award. To mark the 30th anniversary of Engelbart's 1968 demo, in 1998 the Stanford Silicon Valley Archives and the Institute for the Future hosted Engelbart's Unfinished Revolution, <b>a</b> <b>symposium</b> at Stanford University's Memorial Auditorium, to honor Engelbart and his ideas.

5|$|In {{addition}} to Adaptive Coloration in Animals, Cott wrote two essays on camouflage: “Camouflage {{in nature and}} in war” in the Royal Engineers Journal (December 1938), pp501–517; and ”Animal form in relation to appearance” in Lancelot Law Whyte, ed. Aspects of form: <b>a</b> <b>symposium</b> on form in nature and art (London: Percy Lund Humphries, 1951). As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: Zoological photography in practice (1956); Uganda {{in black and white}} (1959); and Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with their role as warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being skinned while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of ferrets, rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg tasters. In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the kittiwake eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.|$|E
