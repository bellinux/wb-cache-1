Results showed that additive effects were major in all of QTLs for GD, PH and PN detected by the two methods, and the epistatic effects explained {{a small proportion of}} phenotypic variation. No interactions were detected between additive QTL and environment, and between epistatic QTL pairs and environment. After growth duration was adjusted to an identical level, RM 80 - 160 bp was detected <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>applicable</b> elite allele for PN, with an additive effect of 0. 71. When effective panicle number per plant was adjusted to an identical level, RM 448 - 240 bp was detected <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>applicable</b> elite allele for GD, with an additive effect of 4. 64. After plant height was adjusted to an identical level, RM 80 - 160 bp was detected <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>applicable</b> elite allele for PN, with an additive effect of 0. 62, and RM 448 - 240 bp was detected <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>applicable</b> elite allele for GD, with an additive effect of 3. 89.

40|$|Evolutionary models such as genetic {{algorithms}} and cellular automata {{have been well}} adopted by composers. A challenge still remains in practice, how to convey the dynamics of evolution that can be perceivable through performance realization. This challenge becomes more explicit when adopting an agent model such as swarms in which temporality is implicit in their behavioral patterns governed by self-organizational and social dynamics. In this work a compositional approach and system architecture undertake some paradigmatic shift by situating the evolutionary dynamics at the locus of tone production through an ongoing engagement with a performer. Essentially, swarm agents are given sounds to play with, and performers play with these agents. By articulating a kinesthetic framework in performance, Performance Gestural Articulation Unit is introduced <b>as</b> <b>a</b> generalizable action repertoire with implicit and relative duration. The kinesthetic framework of performance factors is proposed in 6 categories <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abstraction <b>applicable</b> <b>as</b> design requirements for interactive performance. This articulation aspires to AI modelling for human-machine performance with kinesthetic evolution.
