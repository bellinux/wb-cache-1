Stem cell technology provides unprecedented opportunities not only for investigating new ways to prevent and treat <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> diseases but also for changing the way we identify new molecular targets, discover and develop new drugs, as well as test them for safety. Because stem cells are a self-renewing population of cells, they can be continuously cultured in an undifferentiated state and give rise to more specialized cells of the human body, such as heart, liver, bone marrow, blood vessels, pancreatic islets and nerve cells. Therefore, stem cells offer an important new tool to develop unique in vitro model systems for testing drugs an...|$|R

5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E

This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate {{for a set of}} enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E

Many of the drugs in use today were originally uncovered in microbes; recent progress in mining the rich genetic resource of non-culturable microbes has led to the discovery of new genes, enzymes, and natural products.

5|$|Invertebrates {{constitute}} <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> {{living organisms}} {{ranging from the}} simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. They constitute about 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.|$|E
