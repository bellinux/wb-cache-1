40|$|The {{risk level}} of the <b>Aids</b> <b>to</b> Navigation (AtoNs) can reflect the ship {{navigation}} safety level in the channel to some extent. In order to appreciate the risk {{level of the}} <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation (AtoNs) in a navigation channel and to provide some decision-making suggestions for the AtoNs Maintenance and Management Department, the risk assessment index system of the AtoNs was built considering the advanced experience of IALA. Under the Formal Safety Assessment frame, taking {{the advantages of the}} fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, the fuzzy-FSA model of risk assessment for <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation was established. The model was implemented for the assessment of <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation in Shanghai area based on the <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation three-dimensional simulation system. The real-time data were extracted from the existing information system of <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation, and the real-time risk assessment for <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation of the chosen channel was performed on platform of the three-dimensional simulation system, with the risk assessment software. Specifically, the deep-water channel of the Yangtze River estuary was taken as an example to illustrate the general assessment procedure. The method proposed presents practical significance and application prospect on the maintenance and management of the <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation...|$|R

5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced his budget. The budget anticipated a surplus of $258million, of which $100million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensioners—effective after the election. Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments, more <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the poorer provinces, and <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> farmers.|$|E

40|$|The United States Coast Guard {{administers the}} U. S. <b>Aids</b> <b>to</b> Navigation system. The system {{consists}} of Federal <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation {{operated by the}} U. S. Coast Guard, <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation operated by the other armed services, and private <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation operated by other persons. <b>Aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation (ATON), is vital to guide commercial mariners {{in and out of}} U. S. ports to ensure commerce, as well as people, can move safely in and out of those ports. In addition to our commercial vessels, recreational boaters also depend on ATON for safe navigation throughout all the waterways of the United States. Private <b>Aids</b> <b>to</b> Navigation (PATON) are those <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation which are used to guide mariners into public marinas, private associations, county and state facilities and, they are used to regulate private anchorages or mooring fields. Simply put, PATON includes all marine <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation operated in the navigable waters of the United States other than those operated by the Federal Government. Title 33 Code of Federal Regulations Part 66 provides basic provisions and grants delegation authority to U. S. Coast Guard District Commanders. The authorization of PATON does not authorize any invasion of private rights, nor grant any exclusive privileges, nor does it obviate the necessity of complying with any other Federal, State or local laws and regulations. To apply for a U. S. Coast Guard PATON permit, an application must be completed and submitted to the appropriate U. S. Coast Guard District describing the nature of the project, position of the proposed aids, characteristics of the aids, and include a copy of all required permits issued by any pertinent agency...|$|R

5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing {{what was going on in}} the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E
