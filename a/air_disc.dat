40|$|The present {{annual report}} summarises {{the purpose of}} the project and the ongoing {{investigations}} performed at the Institut für Industrielle Fertigung und Fabrikbetrieb Universität Stuttgart (IFF) on the numerical study of paint drop impacting onto dry solid surfaces. Both Newtonian and yield-stress viscous droplets were applied. Detailed numerical observations of the drop impact dynamics with the focus of air entrapment were obtained. It has been found that at the early stage of the droplet spreading there is no contact line movement, but only direct contact of the droplet outline with the substrate, which results in the formation of an <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> under the impact point. The maximum <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> is reached, when the drop spreading is driven by the movement of the fully wetted contact line. Numerical results showed much more bubble entrapment at the interface between liquid and solid for Newtonian droplets. For shear thinning non-Newtonian fluids the created <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> and air bubbles during drop spreading are reduced tremendously because of the quite low liquid viscosity. The effects of the drop properties, impact velocity and static contact angles on the maximum <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> and on the air bubble release from the droplet film were analysed...|$|E
40|$|Drops {{impacting}} {{on solid}} surfaces entrap small bubbles under their centers, {{owing to the}} lubrication pressure which builds up in the thin intervening air layer.

Both the radius and {{the thickness of the}} <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> become smaller with reduced air pressure. Furthermore, we find the radial extent of the <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> bifurcates, when the compressibility parameter exceeds similar to 25. This bifurcation is also imprinted onto some of the impacts, as a double contact. In addition to the central <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> inside the first ring contact, this is immediately followed by a second ring contact, which entraps an outer toroidal strip of air, which contracts into a ring of bubbles.

40|$|When a drop {{impacts on}} a solid surface, its rapid {{deceleration}} is cushioned {{by a thin}} layer of air, which leads to the entrapment of a bubble under its centre. For large impact velocities the lubrication pressure in this air layer becomes large enough to compress the air. Herein we use high-speed interferometry, with 200  ns time-resolution, to directly observe the thickness evolution of the air layer during the entire bubble entrapment process. The initial disc radius and thickness shows excellent agreement with available theoretical models, based on adiabatic compression. For the largest impact velocities the air is compressed by as much as a factor of 14. Immediately following the contact, the <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> shows rapid vertical expansion.

The physical forces driving the deposition of airborne material are: (1) sedimentation, (2) diffusion, (3) electrical forces and (4) inertial impaction when using a very small flow through the module to avoid an evaporation of the cultivated cells. The geometry of the aerosol inlet and the culture with the cell culture surface is schematically shown in Figure S 1. Figure S 1 : Schematic drawing of the geometry of the aerosol inlet of the CULTEX ® RFS module guiding the test atmosphere directly above the cultivated cells in the cell culture insert. There is a central air inlet, from where the air is blown onto the cell cultures, and the air moves in a radial direction to a circular outlet. The diameter of the inlet is 5 mm, the height of the flow parallel to the cell culture is h = 2. 5 mm and the outer radius of the air exit is 12. 3 mm. The flow rate Q = 30 ml/min.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesSciatica is {{a common}} disease; between 13 % and 40 % of the general {{population}} will experience at least one episode of sciatica due to spinal disc herniation and nerve root irritation. In some specialist centres, percutaneous intradiscal techniques can be applied as an intermediate measure between conservative treatment and surgery, with a view to avoiding the adverse events associated with surgical discectomy. Discogel® is a percutaneously implanted medical device for the treatment of lumbar sciatica due to a herniated disc. We performed an open, prospective, observational study in order to (a) determine whether the prior use of <b>air</b> <b>disc</b> manometry could limit the risk of nerve root irritation reportedly associated with nucleolysis and administration of Discogel® and (b) investigate the technique's efficacy and safety. MethodA total of 79 Discogel®-treated patients were systematically reviewed. A nurse anaesthetist evaluated each patient's pain levels during the procedure itself. The therapist assessed the patient on inclusion and 8 weeks after the Discogel® procedure. A third assessment was based on a telephone interview (by an independent assessor) at least 4 months after the procedure. ResultsPain levels immediately after the Discogel® procedure (1. 7 ± 2. 0) were markedly lower than before the procedure (5. 5 ± 2. 3). There were no complications. Two months after Discogel® administration, the initial pain level had fallen by an average of 74 ± 34 %. The outcome was quite stable over time (mean follow-up: 8 months). At the end of the follow-up period, 60. 7 % of the patients were free of pain, 76 % considered the treatment outcome to be good or very good, 74 % had returned to work and 76 % would recommend the treatment to a friend.
