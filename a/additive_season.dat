An overview of suitable long-term Earth Observation (EO) based datasets for assessment of global dryland vegetation trends is provided and a status map of contemporary greening and browning trends for global drylands is presented. The vegetation metrics suitable for per-pixel temporal trend analysis is discussed, including seasonal parameterisation and the appropriate choice of trend indicators. Recent methods designed to overcome assumptions of long-term linearity in time series analysis (Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend(BFAST)) are discussed.

40|$|Abstract – Continuous global {{time series}} of {{vegetation}} indices, {{which are available}} since early 1980 s, are of great value to detect changes in vegetation status at large spatial scales. Most change detection methods, however, assume a fixed change trajectory – defined by the start {{and end of the}} time series – and a linear or monotonic trend. Here, we apply a change detection method which detects abrupt changes within the time series. This Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) approach showed that large parts of the world are subjected to trend changes. The timing of the breakpoints could in some cases be related to satellite changes, but also to large-scale natural influences like the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. Shifts from greening to browning (or vice versa) occurred in 15 % of the global land surface, which demonstrates the importance of accounting for trend breaks when analyzing long-term NDVI time series...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the breeding programmes of Asian water buffalo, the aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the influence of genetic effects in the stayability of Murrah dairy buffaloes. The stayability trait (ST) was defined as the female’s ability to stay in the herd for one (ST 1), two (ST 2), three (ST 3), four (ST 4), five (ST 5) or six years (ST 6) after the first calving. The same trait was also considered as continuous and was designated stayability in days up to one (STD 1), two (STD 2), three (STD 3), four (STD 4), five (STD 5) or six years (STD 6) after the first calving. Data from 1016 females reared in nine herds located in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, were analysed. Statistical models included the additive genetic effect of the animal and the fixed effects of the buffalo breeding herd, birth year and birth <b>season.</b> <b>Additive</b> effects for ST were estimated by approximate restricted maximum likelihood using a threshold model, while for STD, the additive effects were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood.

Kudzu (Pueraria montana) is a fast-growing vine native to Asia that has invaded regions in the United States making management of this species an important issue. Estimated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values for the years 2000 to 2015 were calculated using data collected by Landsat and MODIS platforms for three infestation sites in Kentucky. The STARFM image-fusing algorithm was used to combine Landsat- and MODIS-derived NDVI into time series with a 30 m spatial resolution and 16 day temporal resolution. The fused time series was decomposed using the Breaks for <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) algorithm.

40|$|The {{performance}} of Landsat time series (LTS) of eight vegetation indices (VIs) was assessed for monitoring deforestation across the tropics.

In this paper two satellite data sources were used for automated forest cover change detection. Annual ALOS PALSAR backscatter mosaics (2007 – 2010) were used for yearly forest loss monitoring. Time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI, 2000 – 2014) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were integrated in a web-based data middleware system to assess the capabilities of a near-real time detection of forest disturbances using the break point detection by <b>additive</b> <b>season</b> and trends (Bfast) method. The SAR-based average accuracy of the forest loss detection was 70 %, whereas the MODIS-based change assessment using breakpoint detection achieved average accuracies of 50 % for trend-based breakpoints and 43. 4 % for season-based breakpoints. It was demonstrated that SAR remote sensing is a highly accurate tool for up-to-date forest monitoring. Web-based data middleware systems like the Earth Observation Monitor, linked with MODIS time series, provide access and easy-to-use tools for on demand change monitoring in remote Siberian forests...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The spatial {{distribution}} of forest disturbance is commonly calculated using a satellite imagery-driven bi- or tri-temporal change analysis. Working in Colombia’s Cordillera de los Picachos National Natural Park – a region of consistent cloud cover and dramatic topographic relief – a change assessment with such infrequent observations cannot capture long-term trends of vegetative decline (browning) or improvement (greening) nor the drivers associated with these changes. In recognition {{of the importance of}} spatio-temporally explicit information for assessing the effects of socio-environmental change and conservation strategy implementation, I developed a rigorous assessment of vegetation change using MODIS and Landsat time-series data and the Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) algorithm to identify the timing, trends, and locations of change as well the associated drivers. First, I measured long-term vegetation trends from 2001 - 2015 using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) -based 250 m resolution Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) time-series, and mapped short-term disturbances using all available Landsat images (149 dates from Landsat 5, 7, and 8).

40|$|AbstractJombang {{is one of}} the regency in East Java {{province}} {{which is}} dominated by agricultural lands. This is caused by high levels of soil fertility due to volcanic eruption in the past. Recently, conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural land has been increasing as accelerated by the growth of industrial sector. If this conversion occurs continuously, it will lead to decreasing of the agricultural production in Jombang. Therefore, it is an urgent to provide accurate and up-to-date information of agricultural land use changes. This research will investigate the temporal vegetation dynamics in paddy fields and to detect their changes in Jombang Regency. The Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) method was used to identify the change pattern events in this study. This method can estimate the time and amount of the abrupt change in the time series datasets. Based on the temporal vegetation pattern, the agriculture land use in Jombang could be categorized into ten typical cropping patterns, namely: paddy-paddy-paddy, paddy-paddy-secondary crops, paddy-paddy-bareland, paddy-secondary crops-bareland, paddy-secondary crops-paddy, paddy-bareland-paddy, forest, sugarcane, non-agriculture, and mixed vegetation. Moreover, the results show that by the BFAST change detection, the change distribution of agriculture land use from the past ten years can be detected...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{availability}} of long-term satellite imagery enables change modeling with advanced spatio-temporal statistical methods. Multidimensional arrays naturally match {{the structure of}} spatio-temporal satellite data and can provide a clean modeling process for complex spatio-temporal analysis over large datasets. Our study case illustrates the detection of breakpoints in MODIS imagery time series for land cover change in the Brazilian Amazon using the BFAST (Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend) change detection framework. BFAST includes an Empirical Fluctuation Process (EFP) to alarm the change and a change point time locating process. We extend the EFP {{to account for the}} spatial autocorrelation between spatial neighbors and assess the effects of spatial correlation when applying BFAST on satellite image time series. In addition, we evaluate how sensitive EFP is to the assumption that its time series residuals are temporally uncorrelated, by modeling it as an autoregressive process. We use arrays as a unified data structure for the modeling process, R to execute the analysis, and an array database management system to scale computation. Our results point to BFAST as a robust approach against mild temporal and spatial correlation, to the use of arrays to ease the modeling process of spatio-temporal change, and towards communicable and scalable analysis. </p...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the methods}} for {{detecting}} structural changes in time series have been adapted for forest disturbance monitoring using satellite data. The BFAST (Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend) Monitor framework, which detects forest cover disturbances from satellite image time series based on empirical fluctuation tests, is particularly used for near real-time deforestation monitoring, {{and it has}} been shown to be robust in detecting forest disturbances. Typically, a vegetation index that is transformed from spectral bands into feature space (e. g. normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)) is used as input for BFAST Monitor. However, using a vegetation index for deforestation monitoring is a major limitation because it is difficult to separate deforestation from multiple seasonality effects, noise, and other forest disturbance. In this study, we address such limitation by exploiting the multi-spectral band of satellite data. To demonstrate our approach, we carried out a case study in a deciduous tropical forest in Bolivia, South America. We reduce the dimensionality from spectral bands, space and time with projective methods particularly the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), resulting in a new index that is more suitable for change monitoring. Our results show significantly improved temporal delay in deforestation detection. With our approach, we achieved a median temporal lag of 6 observations, which was significantly shorter than the temporal lags from conventional approaches (14 to 21 observations) ...|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing data play an {{important}} role in the monitoring of forest changes. Methods are needed to provide objective estimates of forest loss to support monitoring efforts at various scales, and with increasing public availability of remote sensing data, accurate deforestation measurements at high temporal resolution are becoming more realistic. While several time series based methods have recently been described in the literature, there are few studies focusing on tropical forest areas, where low data availability and complex change processes present challenges to forest disturbance monitoring. Here, we present a robust data-driven method to track tropical deforestation and degradation based on Landsat time series data. Based on the previously reported Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend Monitor (BFAST Monitor) method (Verbesselt etal., 2012), we show that BFAST Monitor, when applied to Landsat NDVI time series data using sequentially defined monitoring periods, can be used to track small-scale forest disturbances annually in an Afromontane forest system in southern Ethiopia. Using an ordinal logistic regression (OLR) approach, change magnitude, calculated based on differences between observed and expected values in a monitoring period, was found to be an essential predictor variable for disturbances. After applying a NDVI change magnitude threshold of - 0. 065, overall accuracy was estimated to be 78 %, and both producer's and user's accuracy of the disturbance class were estimated to be 73 %. The method and results presented here are relevant to tropical countries engaged in REDD + for whom data availability and complex forest change dynamics limit the ability to reliably track forest disturbances over time...|$|E
40|$|Researchers who use {{remotely}} sensed {{data can}} spend {{half of their}} total effort analysing prior data. If this data preprocessing does not match the application, this time spent on data analysis can increase considerably {{and can lead to}} inaccuracies. Despite the existence of a number of methods for pre-processing Landsat time series, each method has shortcomings, particularly for mapping forest changes under varying illumination, data availability and atmospheric conditions. Based on the requirements of mapping forest changes as defined by the United Nations (UN) Reducing Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation (REDD) program, the accurate reporting of the spatio-temporal properties of these changes is necessary. We compared the impact of three fundamentally different radiometric preprocessing techniques Moderate Resolution Atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN), Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6 S) and simple Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) on mapping forest changes using Landsat time series data. A modification of Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) monitor was used to jointly map the spatial and temporal agreement of forest changes at test sites in Ethiopia and Viet Nam. The suitability of the pre-processing methods for the occurring forest change drivers was assessed using recently captured Ground Truth and high resolution data (1000 points).

40|$|Tropical environments {{present a}} unique {{challenge}} for optical time series analysis, primarily owing to fragmented data availability, persistent cloud cover and atmospheric aerosols. Additionally, {{little is known}} of whether the performance of time series change detection is affected by diverse forest types found in tropical dry regions. In this paper, we develop a methodology for mapping forest clearing in Southeast Asia using a study region characterised by heterogeneous forest types. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series are decomposed using Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) and breakpoints, trend, and seasonal components are combined in a binomial probability model to distinguish between cleared and stable forest. We found that the addition of seasonality and trend information improves the change model performance compared to using breakpoints alone. We also demonstrate the value of considering forest type in disturbance mapping {{in comparison to the}} more common approach that combines all forest types into a single generalised forest class. By taking a generalised forest approach, there is less control over the error distribution in each forest type. Dry-deciduous and evergreen forests are especially sensitive to error imbalances using a generalised forest model i. e., clearances were underestimated in evergreen forest, and overestimated in dry-deciduous forest. This suggests that forest type needs to be considered in time series change mapping, especially in heterogeneous forest regions. Our approach builds towards improving large-area monitoring of forest-diverse regions such as Southeast Asia. The findings of this study should also be transferable across optical sensors and are therefore relevant for the future availability of dense time series for the tropics at higher spatial resolutions...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of disturbances in Andean tropical forests and protected areas has commonly been calculated using bi or tri-temporal analysis because of persistent cloud cover and complex topography. Long-term trends of vegetative decline (browning) or improvement (greening) have thus not been evaluated despite their importance for assessing conservation strategy implementation in regions where field-based monitoring by environmental authorities is limited. Using Colombia’s Cordillera de los Picachos National Natural Park as a case study, we provide a temporally rigorous assessment of regional vegetation change from 2001 – 2015 with two remote sensing-based approaches using the Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) algorithm. First, we measured long-term vegetation trends using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) -based Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) time series, and, second, we mapped short-term disturbances using all available Landsat images. MAIAC-derived trends indicate a net greening in 6 % of the park, but in the surrounding 10 km area outside of the park, a net browning trend prevails at 2. 5 %. We also identified a 12, 500 ha area within Picachos (4 % of the park’s total area) that has shown at least 13 years of consecutive browning, a result that was corroborated with our Landsat-based approach that recorded a 12, 642 ha (± 1440 ha) area of disturbed forest within the park. Landsat vegetation disturbance results had user’s and producer’s accuracies of 0. 95 ± 0. 02 and 0. 83 ± 0. 18, respectively, and 75 % of Landsat-detected dates of disturbance events were accurate within ± 6 months. This study provides {{new insights into the}} contribution of short-term disturbance to long-term trends of vegetation change, and offers an unprecedented perspective on the distribution of small-scale disturbances over a 15 -year period {{in one of the most}} inaccessible national parks in the Andes...|$|E
40|$|Mapping {{deforestation}} using medium {{spatial resolution}} satellite data (e. g. Landsat) is increasingly shifting from decadal and annual scales to sub-annual scales in recent years, but this shift has brought new challenges {{on how to}} account for seasonality in the satellite data when detecting deforestation. A seasonal model is typically used to account for seasonality, but fitting a seasonal model is difficult when {{there are not enough}} data in the time series. Here, we propose a new approach that reduces seasonality in satellite image time series using spatial context. With this spatial context approach, each pixel value in the image is spatially normalised using the median value calculated from neighbouring pixels whose pixel values are above the 90 th percentile. Using Landsat data, we compared our spatial context approach to a seasonal model approach at a humid tropical forest in Brazil and a dry tropical forest with strong seasonality in Bolivia. After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation from the same data using the Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) method. We show that, in dry tropical forest, deforestation events are detected much earlier when the spatial context approach is used to reduce seasonal variations in Landsat data than when a seasonal model is used. In the dry tropical forest, the median temporal detection delay for deforestation from the spatial context approach was two observations, seven times shorter than the median temporal detection delay from the seasonal model approach (15 observations). In the humid tropical forest, the difference in the temporal detection delay between the spatial context and seasonal model approach was not significant. The differences in overall spatial accuracy between the spatial context and seasonal model were also not significant in both dry and humid tropical forests. The main benefit for using spatial context is early detection of deforestation events in forests with strong seasonality. Therefore, the spatial context approach we propose here provides opportunity to monitor deforestation events in dry tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a method to}} reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect {{the capacity of the}} forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984 – 2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0. 25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90 s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond...|$|E
30|$|The {{vegetation}} growth presents {{dynamic characteristics}} due to complex changes of external environmental factors. The time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), {{which are used}} to reflect the vegetation growth status, can effectively record their dynamic process, and their time spectrum meticulously depict the land-use evolution information and {{make it possible to}} identify dynamic vegetation information [5]. Compared with the traditional two-phase image classification, the image time-series analysis can improve the accuracy of information extraction [6]. Huang et al. [7] used Landsat historical data to express the specific spectral index of a disturbance state to construct a time series and proposed the Landsat time-series stacks-vegetation change tracker algorithm (LTSS-VCT) for automatic mapping of forest disturbances. Kennedy et al. [8] proposed that the LandTrends time segmentation method was considered to be able to identify the mutation points and trends in the time series of the interannual time series. Verbesselt et al. [9] proposed the breaks for <b>additive</b> <b>season</b> and trend algorithm (BFAST) for real-time remote sensing of ecological disturbance information. For the highly disturbed coal mining area, Lei et al. [10] analyzed, with the MODIS-NDVI time series, the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of vegetation under mining action in Shendong Mining area. With the deepening of research, many machine learning methods, such as C 5.0 decision tree [11], random forest algorithm (RF) [12], support vector machine (SVM) [13, 14], and fuzzy c-means clustering [15], are used for extracting dynamic information of the time-series images. Due to big amount of image time-series data, the time spectrum information is susceptible to noise interference, so that the data is subject to high uncertainty and is characterized in seasonality, space-time autocorrelation, etc. [16, 17], which limits the application of many time-series mathematical models, and the effective mining and classification methods of image time-series information is still faced with many challenges [18, 19]. The extraction of existing time-series information is mostly based on the pixel time series [20], but further studies are required for the disturbance of vegetation phenological difference in different years, the statistical dependence of neighborhood pixel and category marking probability, the sensitivity of similarity measurement, and how to improve generalization ability of fuzzy classification.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a rapid change in forest and land cover globally, {{especially}} in tropical forests due to heavy deforestation. The highest rate of deforestation is found predominantly in the developing world. Tropical deforestation {{is a process of}} transforming forests into cleared land for other uses. Tropical deforestation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for about 17 - 30 % of global emissions of CO₂ to the atmosphere, causing global warming. Precise and up to date information on the distribution and rate of forest cover change, especially in tropical regions, is required urgently for government policies aiming to control and manage forests and land development. Information on deforestation in tropical regions has been unavailable or inconsistent, including in the Lao PDR, due to socio-economic deficits, political interests and geographical constraints. Remote sensing technology has {{played a crucial role in}} providing the information required for reliable mapping and monitoring of forest cover changes at local, regional and global levels, but its application in tropical regions has been lagging. The overall goal of this research was to demonstrate and evaluate remote sensing methods for assessing and monitoring forest cover changes in tropical environments, particularly in the context of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR). The first aim of the research was to understand phenology of tropical forests and related vegetation types, which has been little studied. Improved understanding of the phenology of tropical forests and other land covers involved in forest clearance and land use change is an important step towards the use of remote sensing to identify and track changes in forest cover. Long-term averages of land surface temperature (LST) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) 16 -day time series of MODIS over the seven-year period from 2006 to 2012 were calculated and their monthly transitions compared for forests, and for land covers that commonly replace forests. The findings showed the complex interrelationship of LST and EVI and their monthly transitions for the different land covers: they each showed distinctly different intra-annual LST and EVI variations. Secondly, the research evaluated whether the combined use of these indices (LST and EVI) can classify these land covers. It was found that there was high overall accuracy of separation of land covers by long-term means of these indices (86 %). This knowledge can be potentially useful for further broadscale mapping of land cover and detection of deforestation in tropical forests. For the third objective, the use of remote sensing time series data for detecting spatial and temporal changes in forest cover in tropical environments was tested. The disturbance index (DI) model was applied to detect spatial changes in different forest cover types, whilst the Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend (BFAST) approach was used to examine temporal changes in these land covers. Results showed that the DI was capable of detecting vegetation changes during a seven-year period with high overall accuracy (82 %); however, it showed low accuracy in detecting forest clearance (42 %). The BFAST analysis detected abrupt temporal changes in vegetation in the tropical forests, especially in large conversions of mixed wooded/cleared area into plantation (from 2004 to 2007). From these two approaches, it was found that MODIS time series data may be suitable for continental and national monitoring of land cover, although it may not provide the level of geographic detail and accuracy required for local assessments. As a result of these findings, further analysis of forest cover changes at a finer resolution was required to improve monitoring approaches. Therefore, the fourth aim was to detect and map vegetation cover changes at a higher spatial resolution over a period of ten years between 2003 and 2012. Landsat ETM+ imagery from 2003 and 2012 was used in principal component analysis (PCA). This technique detected areas of vegetation cover change (both vegetation increase and loss) with high overall accuracy (87 %). The results of these four studies provided new information on where and when recent forest cover changes have occurred in southern Lao PDR. The final step was to analyse the reasons underlying these changes. Thus, the final research task was to investigate potential factors associated with forest cover change in the study area, by using logistic regression analysis. The results of the analysis suggested that particular socio-economic and physical factors have a significant association with forest cover change. Forest clearance was associated strongly with elevation, distance to main roads and shifting cultivation practices. Meanwhile, vegetation increase was more likely to correlate with rubber plantations. Native forest and shifting cultivation lands were vulnerable to being converted into rubber plantations. This final research component contributes to a better understanding of ongoing land cover change processes to inform land use management. This is key information for policy and decision makers, and may be used to minimize deforestation and deal with potential risks associated with land cover changes. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Tropical forests cover a {{significant}} portion of the earth&# 39;s surface and provide a range of ecosystem services, but are under increasing threat due to human activities. Deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics are responsible for a large share of global CO 2 emissions. As a result, there has been increased attention and effort invested in the reduction of emission from deforestation and degradation and the protection of remaining tropical forests in recent years. Methods for tropical forest monitoring are therefore vital to track progress on these goals. Two data streams in particular have the potential to play an important role in forest monitoring systems. First, satellite remote sensing is recognized as a vital technology in supporting the monitoring of tropical forests, of which the Landsat family of satellite sensors has emerged as one of the most important. Owing to its open data policy, a large range of methods using dense Landsat time series have been developed recently which have the potential to greatly enhance forest monitoring in the tropics. Second, community-based monitoring is supported in many developing countries as a way to engage forest communities and lower costs of monitoring activities. The development of operational monitoring systems will need to consider how these data streams can be integrated for the effective monitoring of forest dynamics. This thesis is concerned with the monitoring of tropical forest dynamics using a combi- nation of dense Landsat time series and community-based monitoring data. The added value conferred by these data streams in monitoring deforestation, degradation and re- growth in tropical forests is assessed. This goal is approached from two directions. First, the application of econometric structural change monitoring methods to Landsat time series is explored and the efficacy and accuracy of these methods over several tropical forest sites is tested. Second, the integration of community-based monitoring data with Landsat time series is explored in an operational setting. Using local expert monitoring data, the reliability and consistency of these data against very high resolution optical imagery are assessed. A bottom-up approach to characterize forest change in high the- matic detail using a priori community-based observations is then developed based on these findings. Chapter 2 presents a robust data-driven approach to detect small-scale forest disturbances driven by small-holder agriculture in a montane forest in southwestern Ethiopia. The Breaks For <b>Additive</b> <b>Season</b> and Trend Monitoring (BFAST Monitor) method is applied to Landsat NDVI time series using sequentially defined one-year monitoring periods. In addition to time series breakpoints, the median magnitude of residuals (expected versus observed observations) is used to characterize change. Overall disturbances are mapped with producer&# 39;s and user&# 39;s accuracies of 73 %. Using ordinal logistic regression (OLR) models, the extent to which degradation and deforestation can be separately mapped is explored. The OLR models fail to distinguish between deforestation and degradation, however, owing to the subtle and diffuse nature of forest degradation processes. Chapter 3 expands upon the approach presented in Chapter 2 by tracking post-disturbance forest regrowth in a lowland tropical forest in southeastern Peru using Landsat Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) time series. Disturbance between 1999 and 2013 are mapped using the same sequential monitoring method as in Chapter 2. Pixels where disturbances are detected are then monitored for follow-up regrowth using the reverse of the method employed in Chapter 2. The time of regrowth onset is recorded based on a comparison to defined stable history period. Disturbances are mapped with 91 % accuracy, while post-disturbance regrowth is mapped with a total accuracy of 61 % for disturbances before 2006. Chapter 4 and 5 explore the integration of community-based forest monitoring data and remote sensing data streams. Major advantages conferred by community-based forest dis- turbance observations include the ability to report on drivers and other thematic details of forest change and the ability to detect low-level forest degradation before these changes are visible above the forest canopy. Chapter 5 builds on these findings and presents a novel bottom-up approach to characterize forest changes using local expert disturbance reports to calibrate and validate forest change models based on Landsat time series. Using random forests and a selection of Landsat spectral and temporal metrics, models describ- ing forest state variables (deforested, degraded or stable) at a given time are produced. As local expert data are continually acquired, the ability of these models to predict forest degradation are shown to improve. Chapter 6 summarizes the main findings of the thesis and provides a future outlook, given the prospect of increasing availability of satellite and in situ data for tropical forest mon- itoring. This chapter argues that forest change methods should strive to utilize satellite time series and ground data to their maximum potential. As “big data" emerges in the field of earth observation, new data streams need to be accommodated in monitoring methods. Operational forest monitoring systems that are able to integrate such diverse data streams can support broader forest monitoring goals such as quantitative monitoring of forest dynamics. Even with a wealth of time series based forest disturbance methods developed recently, forest monitoring systems require locally calibrated forest change esti- mates with higher spatial, temporal and thematic resolution to support a variety of forest monitoring objectives.    ...|$|E
