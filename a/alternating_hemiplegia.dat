25|$|FHM signs overlap {{significantly}} {{with those of}} migraine with aura. In short, FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with hemiparesis and, in FHM1, cerebellar degeneration. This cerebellar degeneration can result in episodic or progressive ataxia. FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) and <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of childhood. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked nystagmus and coma. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes, but can last for weeks and months. An attack resembles a stroke, but unlike a stroke, it resolves in time. These signs typically first manifest themselves in {{the first or second}} decade of life.|$|E
2500|$|Familial hemiplegic {{migraine}} (FHM) is an autosomal dominant type of {{hemiplegic migraine}} that typically includes weakness {{of half the}} body which can last for hours, days or weeks. It can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as ataxia, coma and paralysis. There is clinical overlap in some FHM patients with episodic ataxia type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, benign familial infantile epilepsy, and <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of childhood. There are 3 known loci for FHM. FHM1, which accounts for approximately 50% of FHM patients, is caused by mutations in a gene coding for the P/Q-type calcium channel α subunit, CACNA1A. FHM1 is also associated with cerebellar degeneration. FHM2, which accounts for <25% of FHM cases, is caused by mutations in the /-ATPase gene ATP1A2. FHM3 is a rare subtype of FHM and is caused by mutations in a sodium channel α-subunit coding gene, SCN1A. These three subtypes do not account for all cases of FHM, suggesting the existence {{of at least one}} other locus (FHM4). Many of the non-familial cases of hemiplegic migraine (sporadic hemiplegic migraine) are also caused by mutations at these loci. A fourth gene that has been associated with this condition is the proline rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) - an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex. [...] A fifth gene associated with this condition is SLC4A4 which encodes the electrogenic NaHCO3cotransporter NBCe1.|$|E

50|$|First, the {{symptoms}} must be observed before {{the patient is}} 18 months of age. Second, there must be frequent episodes of hemiplegia, involving {{either side of the}} body. Third, other paroxysmal disorders including tonic attacks, dystonia, nystagmus, strabismus, dyspnoea, and other uncontrollable disorders are noticed to occur. Although common, the paroxysmal disorders involving the eye, nystagmus and strabismus, may not be apparent in older children and may not have been remembered in childhood so a lack of these symptoms does not rule out <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b> Fourth, all symptoms clear up directly after falling asleep and usually come back after waking during an attack. This occurrence is very indicative of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> and as such those who display this are usually diagnosed with probable <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b> Fifth, indications of developmental delays, learning disability, or neurological irregularities are present. These issues may not be obvious in very young patients; however, it appears in almost all older patients. The final criteria before a diagnosis of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> can be made is that all of these symptoms must not be due to another disorder. If {{the symptoms}} can be attributed to another disease or disorder, then a definitive diagnosis is difficult to make.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>{{hemiplegia}}</b> {{is a form}} of hemiplegia {{that has}} an ipsilateral and contralateral presentation {{in different parts of the}} body. The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis on one side of the body. There are multiple forms of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> Weber's syndrome, middle <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> and inferior <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b> This type of syndrome can result from a unilateral lesion in the brainstem affecting both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. The muscles that would receive signals from these damaged upper motor neurons result in spastic paralysis. With a lesion in the brainstem, this affects the majority of limb and trunk muscles on the contralateral side due to the upper motor neurons decussation after the brainstem. The cranial nerves and cranial nerve nuclei are also located in the brainstem making them susceptible to damage from a brainstem lesion. Cranial nerves III (Oculomotor), VI (Abducens), and XII (Hypoglossal) are most often associated with this syndrome given their close proximity with the pyramidal tract, the location which upper motor neurons are in on their way to the spinal cord. Damages to these structures produce the ipsilateral presentation of paralysis or palsy due to the lack of cranial nerve decussation (aside from the trochlear nerve) before innervating their target muscles. The paralysis may be brief or it may last for several days, many times the episodes will resolve after sleep. Some common symptoms of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> are mental impairment, gait and balance difficulties, excessive sweating and changes in body temperature.|$|E
50|$|Weber's {{syndrome}} (superior <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia)</b> {{is a form}} {{of stroke}} characterized by the presence of an ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> is the {{mutation}} of ATP1A3 gene. In {{a study of}} fifteen females and nine males’ patient with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> a mutation in ATP1A3 gene was present. Three patients showed heterozygous de-novo missense mutation. Six patients were found with de-novo missense mutation and one patient was identified with de-novo splice site mutation. De novo mutation is a mutation that occurs in the germ cell of one parent. Neither parent has the mutation, but it is passed to the child through the sperm or egg.|$|E
50|$|Many {{children}} {{affected by}} <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> also suffer from epilepsy. Seizures may occur during an attack {{but more often}} occur between attacks. Anti-epilepsy drugs are given to prevent or lessen the seizures, but the drugs often don’t work and have severe side effects that require the patient to discontinue use. Flunarizine, which blocks calcium channels, is an antiepilepsy drugs used in 50% of patients, and {{has been shown to}} shorten the duration of attacks as well as reducing the severity of the attacks. While Flunarizine does not stop the attacks, it is most common drug prescribed to treat those suffering from <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Flunarizine {{may help}} to reduce the {{severity}} and duration of attacks of paralysis associated with the more serious form of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> {{as well as being}} effective in rapid onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP). Both these conditions arise from specific mutations in the ATP1A3 gene.|$|E
50|$|Inferior <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> (also {{known as}} medial {{medullary}} syndrome) typically involves a “weakness of the extremities accompanied by paralysis of muscles on the ipsilateral {{side of the}} tongue (seen as a deviation of the tongue on that side on protrusion). These symptoms indicate a lesion in the medulla involving the corticospinal fibers in the pyramid and the exiting hypoglossal nerve roots.|$|E
50|$|Middle <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> {{typically}} constitutes {{weakness of}} the extremities accompanied by paralysis of the extraocular muscle specifically lateral rectus, {{on the opposite side}} of the affected extremities, which indicates a lesion in the caudal and medial pons involving the abducens nerve root (controls movement of the eye) and corticospinal fibers (carries motor commands from the brain to the spinal cord).|$|E
50|$|Weber's {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} superior <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia)</b> {{has a few}} distinct symptoms: contralateral hemiparesis of limb and facial muscle accompanied by weakness {{in one or more}} muscles that control eye movement on the same side. Another symptom that appears is the loss of eye movement due to damage to the oculomotor nerve fibers. The upper and lower extremities have increased weakness.|$|E
50|$|Sleep is {{also used}} as a {{management}} technique. An early indication of an episode is tiredness so medication such as melatonin or Buccal midazolam can be administered to induce sleep and avoid the episode.Those suffering from <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> are often underweight {{and with the help}} of dietitians, a meal plan should be developed for times of attack when consumption of food may be difficult.|$|E
50|$|FHM signs overlap {{significantly}} {{with those of}} migraine with aura. In short, FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with hemiparesis and, in FHM1, cerebellar degeneration.

50|$|Weber's {{syndrome}} {{is the only}} form of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> that is somewhat easy to diagnose beyond the general criteria. Although Weber's {{syndrome is}} rare, a child born with the disorder typically has a port-wine stain on the face around the eye. While the port-wine stain {{does not necessarily mean}} the child has Weber's syndrome, if the port-wine stain involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve than the likelihood of it being weber's syndrome greatly increases. If a port-wine stain around the eye is found, the patient should be screened for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)can be used to determine the presence and severity while computed cranial tomography can be used to determine the effect. MRI is the preferred diagnostic test on children presenting with port-wine stain. Other imaging techniques can be used in addition to further determine the severity of the disorder. The initial diagnosis is made based on the presence of neurologic and ophthalmic disease but the disease progresses differently in each patient so after initial diagnosis the patient should be monitored frequently in order to handle further complications resulting from the syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of {{childhood}} is so rare, {{there is no}} increased risk of AHC {{for the children of}} siblings of someone with AHC, but it is believed to be autosomal dominant, by which a person with AHC has a 50% change of passing the disorder on to their children. AHC is questionably a progressive disease, because cognitive abilities do appear to decline over time. This cannot be completely determined however, because the mechanism of AHC's progression is unknown. It is likely that it is caused by a generalized cellular dysfunction caused by a mitochondrial disorder. However, studies involving mechanisms of AHC have been inconclusive. Experts currently researching this disorder believe that the cause of AHC is a mutated ion channel. This would make the cause difficult to find because one disrupted channel may be represented differently in different tissues. This mutation is suspected because the most closely related disease, FHM, is also caused by a mutated ion channel. A small number of genes which were suspected to carry a mutation for AHC have been screened for sodium channel protein mutations, ATP pump mutations, and excitatory amino acid transmitter mutations. None of these have yet been successful in determining the underlying cause of AHC.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of {{childhood}} (AHC) {{is a rare}} neurological disorder of uncertain cause, though growing evidence strongly supports mutation of the ATP1A3 gene as {{the primary cause of}} this disease. AHC is named for the [...] episodes, often referred to as attacks or episodes, of hemiplegia from which those with the disorder suffer. These hemiplegic attacks can cause anything from mild weakness to complete paralysis on one or both sides of the body, and they can vary greatly in duration. Attacks may also alternate {{from one side of the}} body to the other, or alternate between affecting one or both sides during a single attack. AHC is associated with many symptoms besides hemiplegia, and the majority of these become apparent in early infancy. AHC typically presents before the age of 18 months. Normally, hemiplegia and other associated symptoms cease completely with sleep, but they may recur upon waking. The disorder was only recently discovered, having first been characterized in 1971. AHC is also extremely rare - approximately 1 in 1,000,000 people have this disorder. Besides hemiplegia, symptoms of the disorder include an extremely broad range of neurological and developmental impairments which are not well understood. Much of the literature about AHC is purposefully vague in this respect due to a lack of information on the disorder.|$|E

There are 3 known loci for FHM. FHM1, which accounts for approximately 50% of FHM patients, is caused by mutations in a gene coding for the P/Q-type calcium channel α subunit, CACNA1A.

40|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of {{childhood}} {{is a rare}} disorder caused by de novo mutations in the ATP 1 A 3 gene, expressed in neurons and cardiomyocytes. As affected individuals may survive into adulthood, we use the term 'alternating hemiplegia'. The disorder is characterized by early-onset, recurrent, often alternating, hemiplegic episodes; seizures and non-paroxysmal neurological features also occur. Dysautonomia may occur during hemiplegia or in isolation. Premature mortality can occur in this patient group and is not fully explained. Preventable cardiorespiratory arrest from underlying cardiac dysrhythmia may be a cause. We analysed ECG recordings of 52 patients with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> from nine countries: all had whole-exome, whole-genome, or direct Sanger sequencing of ATP 1 A 3. Data on autonomic dysfunction, cardiac symptoms, medication, and family history of cardiac disease or sudden death were collected. All had 12 -lead electrocardiogram recordings available for cardiac axis, cardiac interval, repolarization pattern, and J-point analysis. Where available, historical and prolonged single-lead electrocardiogram recordings during electrocardiogram-videotelemetry were analysed. Half the cohort (26 / 52) had resting 12 -lead electrocardiogram abnormalities: 25 / 26 had repolarization (T wave) abnormalities. These abnormalities were significantly more common in people with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> than in an age-matched disease control group of 52 people with epilepsy. The average corrected QT interval was significantly shorter in people with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> than in the disease control group. J wave or J-point changes were seen in six people with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b> Over half the affected cohort (28 / 52) had intraventricular conduction delay, or incomplete right bundle branch block, a much higher proportion than in the normal population or disease control cohort (P = 0. 0164). Abnormalities in <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> were more common in those 16 years old, compared with those < 16 (P = 0. 0095), even with a specific mutation (p. D 801 N; P = 0. 045).

MethodsWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of triheptanoin, at a target dose corresponding to 30 % of daily calorie intake, in ten patients with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of childhood due to ATP 1 A 3 mutations. Each treatment period consisted of a 12 -week fixed-dose phase, separated by a 4 -week washout period. The primary outcome was {{the total number of}} paroxysmal events. Secondary outcomes included the number of paroxysmal motor-epileptic events; a composite score taking into account the number, severity and duration of paroxysmal events; interictal neurological manifestations; the clinical global impression-improvement scale (CGI-I); and safety parameters. The paired non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to analyze treatment effects. ResultsIn an intention-to-treat analysis, triheptanoin failed to reduce the total number of paroxysmal events (p[*]=[*] 0. 646), including motor-epileptic events (p[*]=[*] 0. 585), or the composite score (p[*]=[*] 0. 059).
