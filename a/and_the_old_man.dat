5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) is {{approached}} at her new job by a colleague, who {{reveals that}} the company is part of the Odessa network. Meanwhile, Black visits Catherine's boss Clear Knight (Kimberly Patton), experiencing visions of Nazi Germany after seeing a watercolour painting in her office. Later that night Black is visited by Means <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> (R. G. Armstrong), another high-ranking Group member. They explain to Black that the Group has, throughout history, been privy to scientific discoveries of which the public has no knowledge. Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades; his death may be connected to this theory. The Old Man also explains that the Group has been infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it, by members of the Odessa network—a faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously been known for its anti-communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group.|$|E

In his attempts to capture them and their data, however, Brown is instead fed disinformation through the old man's intricate schemes.|$|E

25|$|The main ridge {{continues}} southward, {{stepping down}} Great and Little How Crags to the depression of Levers Hawse. From here it rises again to Brim Fell with Dow Crag <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> Of Coniston beyond. To {{the west of}} the Hawse is the valley of Tarn Head Beck, the main feeder of Seathwaite Tarn, a reservoir in a side valley of the Duddon system. This was originally a much smaller waterbody, but was dammed early in the 20th century to provide drinking water for the Barrow-in-Furness area. The dam is almost 400yards long and is concrete cored with slate buttresses, the resulting depth of the tarn being around 80ft. Water is not abstracted directly from the tarn, but flows some distance downriver to an off-take weir. To the east of Levers Hawse is Levers Water. This smaller tarn has also been raised by damming, but in this case the original user was the Coniston Copper Mines. Following the decline of mining in the late 19th century a water treatment plant was eventually built and the tarn now supplies drinking water for Coniston village.|$|E

Tom, unable to stand this, tries to announce himself, but only succeeds in stumbling over and breaking a valuable vase. Bessie's pa has the 'armor' thrown out. Dick's conscience makes him tell Bessie that Tom was in the armor and they started the rescue.

500|$|The game {{opens with}} an adventurous youth named Benjamin {{climbing}} the Hill of Destiny. While exploring, his village is destroyed in an earthquake.
