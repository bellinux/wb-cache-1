50|$|In the United States, <b>acetylmethadol</b> and its {{individual}} isomers are all Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, except LAAM, which is Schedule II {{and was used}} clinically until 1993. <b>Acetylmethadol</b> has an ACSCN of 9601. The isomers have individual ACSCNs, which are as follows: Alphacetylmethadol 9603, Betacetylmethadol 9607, LAAM 9648. All of the above have annual manufacturing quotas of 2 grammes as of 2013, except LAAM, which is 4 grammes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acetylmethadol</b> (INN), {{also known}} as methadyl acetate (USAN), is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is a racemic mixture of alphacetylmethadol (α-acetylmethadol) and betacetylmethadol (β-acetylmethadol), which are in turn racemic mixtures of levacetylmethadol (LAAM; L-α-acetylmethadol) and D-α-acetylmethadol and L-β-acetylmethadol and D-β-acetylmethadol, respectively. Hence, <b>acetylmethadol</b> has four possible optical isomers. All of these isomers {{have been shown to}} partially or fully substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of heroin in rats, and thus it can be inferred that, in addition to LAAM which is used clinically as such, they are all likely to be active opioid analgesics in humans.|$|E
50|$|Noracymethadol is an acetyl ester of methadol {{and it can}} be {{said with}} some {{precision}} that it is either the heroin or 6-monoacetylmorphine analogue of methadol, and being a methadol it exhibits optical isomerism. The other methadols (<b>acetylmethadol,</b> methadol &c) have at least four optical isomers (see Orlaam).|$|E
40|$|<b>Acetylmethadol,</b> a new {{narcotic}} substitute, has {{a longer}} duration of action than methadone. Seventeen subjects, former heroin users currently under methadone treatment, entered {{a study of}} the toxicity and efficacy of this drug. Only nine subjects completed the assessment phase of the study and began the <b>acetylmethadol</b> phase, and only one completed the 8 -week study phase. Hence, no conclusions can be drawn about acetylmethadol's efficacy. The high attrition rate was unrelated to pharmacologic factors; the subjects were concerned that if this drug was effective there would be no methadone to take home and hence no opportunity to trade, sell or "play with" (that is, combine with other drugs) the latter. This study emphasizes the difficulty in determining the efficacy of specific drug treatments for opiate-dependent patients...|$|E
40|$|Methadone and <b>acetylmethadol,</b> {{although}} possessing {{almost all}} of morphine's pharmacological properties, differ from other morphine-like drugs in their longer action, more gradual and less intense withdrawal syndrome, and blockade of euphoric effect of other opiates in addicts. A high percentage of patients maintained on methadone {{are better able to}} hold employment or to be otherwise socially productive than when dependent on heroin or morphine...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of cytochrome P 450 metabolic-intermediate (Ml) complexes from amine-containing drugs unrelated to macrolide antibiotics {{was investigated in}} hepatic microsomes from rifampi-cm-induced rabbits. Rifampicin treatment doubled the amount of total cytochrome P 450 present. As evidenced by increased rates of erythromycmn N-demethylation and Ml complex formation from troleandomycin without increases in other isozyme selectmve oxi-datlon reactions, the increase was predominately in the cyto-chrome P 4503 A subfamily. Fluoxetmne, benzylamphetamine, propoxyphene, and norpropoxyphene formed Ml complexes at rates similar to that for troleandomycin. Rates for l-a-acetylmeth-adol and SKF 525 A were 2 - to 3 -fold higher, and rates for the secondary amine derivatives of these two compounds, nor-I-a-acetylmethadol and SKF 8742 A, were- 5 -fold higher than with troleandomycin. For the SKF and <b>acetylmethadol</b> compounds, th...|$|E
40|$|Patients with heroin {{dependence}} frequently {{present to}} internists and other physicians for heroin-related medical, psychiatric, and behavioral {{health problems and}} often seek help with reducing their heroin use. Thus, physicians should {{be familiar with the}} identification and diagnosis of heroin dependence in their patients and be able to initiate treatment of heroin dependence both di-rectly and by referral. Recent research has provided much infor-mation concerning effective pharmacologically based treatment approaches for managing opioid withdrawal and helping patients to remain abstinent. Methadone maintenance and newer ap-proaches using L-a <b>acetylmethadol</b> and buprenorphine seem to be particularly effective in promoting relapse prevention. Although these treatments are currently provided in special drug treatment settings, recent and ongoing research indicates that the physician’s office may be an effective alternative site for these treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{agonists}} buprenorphine and L [...] <b>acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM) {{were introduced}} as alternatives to methadone {{for treatment of}} the adult opiate addict. The direct and indirect effects of these drugs on normal fetal growth and development are currently under investigation in our laboratory. The goal of this report is to provide part of the data necessary to assess the safety of LAAM in treatment of the pregnant opiate addict. To achieve this goal, the technique of dual perfusion of placental lobule was utilized to determine the kinetics for transplacental transfer of LAAM {{and its effects on}} the viability and functional param-eters of the tissue. LAAM is rapidly metabolized to the phar-macologically active norLAAM that was also included in this investigation. The two opiates were transfused at their plasma levels in patients under treatment, a concentration of 35 ng/ml...|$|E
40|$|Methadone is {{currently}} {{the most widely used}} agent to manage opioid dependence, but clinical experience has highlighted some limitations with its use. In particular, a relatively high proportion of patients complain of breakthrough withdrawal symptoms (non - holding) at apparently adequate methadone doses. Levo - alpha - <b>acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM) is a long acting opioid that is likely to benefit methadone non - holders; however, relatively little is known about its pharmacology at steady state. The primary aim of this thesis was to evaluate LAAM as an alternative maintenance pharmacotherapy to methadone for the treatment of non - holders; subsidiary aims were to elucidate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of LAAM and its active metabolites (nor - and dinor - LAAM), and to examine the in vitro activity of LAAM, nor - and dinor - LAAM. Sixteen methadone maintenance patients (non - holders = 8) were recruited to participate in a randomised, crossover trial of LAAM and methadone. At steady state there were two testing sessions (24 h for methadone and 48 h for LAAM) that featured the concurrent measurement of plasma drug concentrations and both subjective and physiological indices of opioid effect. Cognitive and psychomotor functions were also assessed once during each inter - dosing interval study. Ten age - and gender - matched controls were also tested. The peak magnitude of methadone ' s and LAAM ' s effects were similar. Compared to methadone, LAAM was associated with more stable and less severe withdrawal and mood disturbance. The general pattern of symptom complaints and cognitive function was similar for both drugs. Severity of mood disturbance and withdrawal was similar in holders on methadone and LAAM, but was greater in non - holders when they were taking methadone than LAAM. In comparison to plasma (R) - (-) methadone, plasma nor - and dinor - LAAM concentrations fluctuated little over the dosing interval. Furthermore, nor - and dinor - LAAM were both more potent in the guinea - pig ileum bioassay, and had greater affinity for mu opioid receptors in receptor binding studies, than LAAM. In conclusion, LAAM converted methadone non - holders into LAAM holders. It is proposed that it is the relatively flat plasma concentration - time profile for nor - and dinor - LAAM that confer stability of opioid effect, minimising withdrawal. Therefore, LAAM may have a role in selected patients, whose response to methadone is suboptimal. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Medical Sciences, 2006...|$|E
