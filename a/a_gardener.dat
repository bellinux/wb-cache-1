5|$|An {{apprentice}} boilermaker {{before the}} war, Maxwell returned to Australia in 1919 {{and worked as}} <b>a</b> <b>gardener.</b> In 1932, he published Hell's Bells and Mademoiselles, a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his war experiences. Attempting to enlist for service during the Second World War, Maxwell was rejected {{on the grounds of}} his age before enlisting under an alias in Queensland; his identity was discovered, and after a short period in a training position, he sought discharge. In 1967, aged 71, he died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Close to Lakefield and off {{the road}} in their own {{enclosure}} were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, <b>a</b> <b>gardener</b> and caretaker at Lakefield, lived {{in one of the}} cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and could sit up with a lump of sugar balanced on her nose.|$|E

5|$|Following on closely {{from the}} Baroque period, Rococo came into fashion in the 1740s under the {{leadership}} of Nicolai Eigtved. Originally <b>a</b> <b>gardener,</b> Eigtved spent many years abroad where he became increasingly interested in architecture, especially the French Rococo style. On his return to Denmark, he built Prinsens Palæ (1743–44) in Copenhagen as a residence for Crown Prince Frederick (later Frederick V). It is now the National Museum.|$|E
5|$|Siwiec {{was born}} in Dębica on 7 March 1909, under the Austrian Partition of Poland, then part of Austria-Hungary. He {{graduated}} from the Lwów University {{with a degree in}} philosophy. Siwiec worked as an accountant since the 1930s in Przemyśl, where he moved shortly after graduation. During World War II he escaped forced labour for the Germans by taking employment as <b>a</b> <b>gardener</b> and joined the Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the Polish resistance movement. Ryszard Siwiec married in 1945 and had five children.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1929, Maxwell {{attended}} the New South Wales Dinner for {{recipients of the}} Victoria Cross in Sydney, and 1932 saw the publication of Hell's Bells and Mademoiselles, a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his experiences in the war. At the time, Maxwell was working as <b>a</b> <b>gardener</b> with the Department of the Interior in Canberra. The book was a success, but Maxwell soon spent what money he made from it. In the late 1930s, he wrote the manuscript for a second book entitled From the Hindenburg Line to the Breadline. The book was never published and the manuscript was lost when it was lent to someone to read.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to <b>a</b> <b>gardener</b> and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He writes of a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E
5|$|Bramshill {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most haunted houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, {{although}} another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton, according to the author Penny Legg). The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of <b>a</b> <b>gardener</b> who drowned there. The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance, with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, and smelling of the lilies of the valley; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room. The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house. A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century.|$|E
