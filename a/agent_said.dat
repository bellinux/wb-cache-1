Garland's connections with Berkowitz helped him get to know trainer Kendrick Williams and get an endorsement deal with Under Armour. He had hopes of playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA), regardless of whether he had to compete in Europe before reaching that level. In mid-October 2014, Garland planned on entering the 2014 NBA Development League Draft.

The CIA agents acknowledged there was another possible use for the tubes - as artillery rocket casings, but argued that the specifications sought by Iraq were far greater than they'd need for rockets.|$|R

500|$|A U.S. {{intelligence}} {{official said the}} danger of using informants was inherent but unavoidable. Intelligence agencies {{have to rely on}} unsavory individuals to penetrate terrorist groups because no one else has the access. Those hazards would be neither denied nor ignored by the CIA officers. Former {{intelligence official}}s said they were deeply troubled about al-Balawi's ability to get close to so many CIA officers. A former agency case officer expressed surprise that [...] "a potential hostile" [...] was able to be in immediate proximity to a large number of CIA operatives. [...] "Why the officers would show a source all their faces, that alone was a terrible decision," [...] said one former senior CIA paramilitary operative who served in Afghanistan. Larry C. Johnson, a former CIA officer and counter-terrorism <b>agent,</b> <b>said</b> that a source supposedly as significant as al-Balawi should never have been brought inside the base, because it risked exposing him.|$|E
500|$|On September 22, 1851, Minot was in {{a parked}} {{passenger}} train at Turner Station. He glanced {{out the window of}} the train and saw the new telegraph wires. Departing the train, Minot ran into the station, got on the new telegraph, and wired the next station along the line, Monroe, to see if the eastbound train to Piermont-on-Hudson had gone past. The station <b>agent</b> <b>said</b> no. At that point, Minot ordered the engineer of the train to proceed on their way to Goshen. The engineer refused to take Minot's order, and instead, Minot got into the cab car himself and drove the train himself to Port Jervis, hours ahead of the planned scheduled time of arrival. This was the second of the several [...] "firsts" [...] the Erie Railroad created in its time, along with the shipment of milk by rail at Chester station in 1842. The use of the telegraph and Minot's system remained until 1888, when a new system of block signaling, developed by the competitor Pennsylvania Railroad, helped expand Minot's use of telecommunications to control rail traffic.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of GoldenEye in {{reviving}} the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the film's follow-up production. This pressure came from MGM along with its new owner, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, both of whom wished for the film's release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer Michael G. Wilson also expressed concern regarding the public's expectations subsequent to {{the success of}} GoldenEye, commenting: [...] "You realize that there's a huge audience and I guess you don't want to come out with a film that's going to somehow disappoint them." [...] This was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, who had previously been involved with the series' production since its beginning. The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $110 million. The producers were unable to persuade Martin Campbell, the director of GoldenEye, to return; his <b>agent</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row." [...] Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. Spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a Bond film while Timothy Dalton was still in the leading role.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Brett Goldstein contacted Vincent D'Onofrio's agent {{about playing}} {{the part of}} John Lange, but the <b>agent</b> <b>said</b> D'Onofrio would never work in television and refused to even suggest the part to the actor. Goldstein remained convinced the actor was right for the role, and mailed the script directly to D'Onofrio; the actor liked the script and agreed to play the part. The agent later contacted Goldstein a second time, and they got into a dispute over how much money D'Onofrio would be paid. Yoshimura said that D'Onofrio {{was not the kind}} of actor he originally envisioned for the part, although he later praised his performance. D'Onofrio said he was attracted to the part based on the strength of the script and the reputation of Homicide: Life on the Street, although he had never seen the show himself. Fleder, D'Onofrio and Andre Braugher had only between two and three hours to read the script, discuss the characters and rehearse the material. Braugher said his first reaction to the episode premise was that it was a [...] "horrifying idea" [...] because he thought it would be sensational and end with a clichéd moral, which Braugher said [...] "frankly, nauseated me, the idea of that". But Braugher said that he was extremely satisfied with Yoshimura's final script.|$|E
