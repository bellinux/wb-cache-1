Although they had enjoyed working on those projects, Schooley and McCorkle were becoming interested in contributing to [...] "something original". At the same time, the writers learned that Disney Channel had become interested in developing a show featuring ordinary children in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the network commissioned Schooley and McCorkle to create an animated series geared towards the nine to 14 year-old demographic that was also capable of entertaining older audiences at the same time. While traveling in an elevator {{on their way back}} to their office from their lunch break, McCorkle said to Schooley, [...] "Kim Possible.

50|$|By 1839 {{the opium}} trade was causing great {{tension between the}} British Empire and the Qing dynasty. The Chinese were {{concerned}} {{with the effects of}} opium on the general population and as such banned the substance. This <b>action</b> <b>lead</b> to the destruction of opium at Humen, an event which caused relations between Britain and China to deteriorate further. Charles Elliot, Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China, ordered British ships trading in opium to avoid Chinese ports or face sanction. However, when the Qing government issued a bond that required foreign merchants to not deal in opium if they wanted to do business in China, Elliot ordered all British shipping out of Chinese waters. Many merchants (especially those who did not participate in the opium trade) reacted negatively to Elliots decision, feeling that the decree infringed upon their rights to trade freely. One merchant ship, the Quaker owned Thomas Coutts, arrived in China and successfully unloaded its cargo at Canton. The Chinese allowed the merchant ship to conduct its business as it was known that the Quakers refused to deal in opium. In response to this violation, Elliot ordered a blockade of the Pearl River.|$|E
5000|$|The FCC {{took over}} {{regulation}} in 1934 and changed {{many of the}} structural characteristics of the original agency, although its goal of reducing interference remained the same. The original FRC had 5 members who were each responsible for representing one geographical area of the United States. Congress also planned for the 5-member agency to become a quasi-judicial body which would only have to meet when necessary. Their jobs were to alleviate [...] "noise" [...] from the airwaves and they were given the power to license and regulate radio stations. The Federal Radio Commission's lack of regulatory <b>action</b> <b>lead</b> to the more permanent Federal Communication Commission. Much like the FRC, the FCC consists of commissioners who are appointed by the President {{and approved by the}} Senate. Each Commissioner can only serve for a five-year term, even the one chosen to be the Chairperson. Originally there were 7 commissioners with 7 year terms, but this was changed to 5 commissions with 5 year terms in 1986. [...] Though there are only five commissioners, there are several offices and departments, made up of hundreds and staff members that carry out different duties. For example, the Mass Media Bureau processes license applications and renewals. These divisions of administrative duties differentiate the FRC from the FCC.|$|E
5000|$|Producer Larry Gordon later {{reflected}} on the film's poor critical and box office response in the US:If we'd had Clint Eastwood in the film, we'd have been forgiven everything and they'd have said, 'It's another Eastwood film about driving cars'." [...] If we'd had Steve McQueen, we'd have been compared to Bullitt or The Getaway. We were treated as an art film rather than an action film. We took a unique approach to standard material. We'd go the same way again, but with a different cast we might have attracted an audience. I believe in returning investors' money - and if I could make The Driver again I'd try to rectify it for a commercial market. When you're writing this kind of script... naturally you think of an <b>action</b> <b>lead</b> like Bronson or Eastwood... and certainly Fox wanted a name. But when we got Ryan, I suggested we make changes to suit his character. This is always the director's prerogative.Isabelle Adjani later complained she felt the film hurt her career. [...] "Afterwards the only American offers I got were bad ones," [...] she said. [...] "I did it, really because after The Story of Adele H everyone urged {{me to make a}} Hollywood film. I turned down several, and felt I couldn't continue to do that. And I liked Walter Hill. Only later did I realize I'd made a terrible mistake." ...|$|E
