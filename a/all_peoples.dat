5|$|Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and a German {{battalion}} from Banja Lukaabout 10,000 soldiersattacked the Partisan-held {{territory in}} Kozara on 18August 1941. The enemy troops {{broke through the}} Partisan front line and penetrated into the area. They burnt houses and looted cattle and grain in the villages. Some of the villagers became demoralised, and blamed the Partisans for their losses; some placed white flags on their houses. The Partisan units retreated deeper into forested areas in the mountains. Stojanović led the Kozara Detachment toward Lisina, the highest peak of Kozara. In the evening, he assembled his men {{and told them that}} they were in the army of the KPJ and <b>all</b> <b>peoples</b> of Yugoslavia, so they could not allow themselves to be attached to any specific village or area. He advised those who could not detach themselves from their homes to lay down their weapons and leave. Several men left the detachment, which then moved toward Lisina where they organised a camp and spent some time in military training and political indoctrination. The attack of 18August was the first counter-insurgency operation in Kozara, and the Partisans emerged from it without significant losses.|$|E

By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of <b>All</b> <b>Peoples.</b> It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos.|$|E
