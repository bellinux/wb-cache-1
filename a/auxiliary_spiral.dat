30|$|In orb-weaver spiders, web {{building}} behaviour follows {{three distinct}} phases: {{construction of the}} frame and radii, weaving of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spiral</b> and weaving of the sticky or capture spiral (Foelix 2011). To weave the capture spiral, the spider starts at the periphery and uses the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spiral</b> as a guide. During this phase, the spider's legs {{play an important role}} (Vollrath 1987 a). The spider advances step by step to produce the sticky spiral while maintaining the distance between successive turns equally (Vollrath and Mohren 1985). Thus, completion of the capture spiral results from successive and repetitive actions, which is the definition of stereotyped behaviour.|$|E
40|$|Most orb webs are {{vertically}} asymmetric {{with larger}} lower than upper parts, {{even though the}} basic structure of orb webs with concentric sticky spiral loops implies a round shape with the hub in its geometric centre. Spiders are known to modify the basic, round web structure to achieve asymmetric webs by placing the sticky spiral loops eccentrically around the hub and by inserting additional sticky spiral threads below the hub. In addition, spiders could increase asymmetry by building larger meshes below than above the hub. In the present paper, I analyzed these web modifications quantitatively in webs of Araneus diadematus Clerck 1757. In addition, I assessed the influence of gravity on the different web modifications during web building by laying some webs horizontally during auxiliary and/or sticky spiral building, and I also assessed how the web modifications influenced each other during web building. I found that web orientation during <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spiral</b> building influenced <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spiral</b> eccentricity, which in turn influenced sticky spiral eccentricity and overall web asymmetry. Web orientation during sticky spiral building only influenced – together with web asymmetry and spiral ratio – mesh size asymmetry. I conclude that A. diadematus uses the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spiral</b> as a guiding line during sticky spiral building and that it employs different rules to build the two spirals...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a virtual}} spider robot, we studied {{hypotheses}} about the weaving behaviour of orb spiders. Our model spiders built virtual webs that mimicked perfectly the visual architecture of real webs {{of the garden}} cross spider Araneus diadematus. The matching of capture spiral and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spiral</b> pitch was an apparently emergent property in both types of web. This validated our interpretation of the garden spider's web-building decision rules, which use strictly local interactions with previously placed threads to generate global architecture...|$|E
40|$|Spider silk {{includes}} seven protein based {{fibers and}} glue-like substances produced by glands in the spider’s abdomen. Minor ampullate silk {{is used to}} make the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spiral</b> of the orb-web and also for wrapping prey, has a high tensile strength and does not supercontract in water. So far, only partial cDNA sequences have been obtained for minor ampullate spidroins (MiSps). Here we describe the first MiSp full-length gene sequence from the spider species Araneus ventricosus, using a multidimensional PCR approach. Comparative analysis of the sequence reveals regulatory elements, as well as unique spidroin gene and protein architecture including the presence of an unusually large intron. The spliced full-length transcript of MiSp gene is 5440 bp in size and encodes 1766 amino acid residues organized into conserved nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains and a central predominantly repetitive region composed of four units that are iterated in a non regular manner. The repeats are more conserved within A. ventricosus MiSp than compared to repeats from homologous proteins, and are interrupted by two nonrepetitive spacer regions, which have 100 % identity even at the nucleotide level...|$|E
