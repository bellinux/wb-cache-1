Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black nightshade in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory.

The down-regulation of systemin was associated with increased root mass but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing the plant to tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. Tomato roots were also affected by tomato systemin, with root growth increasing at high tomato systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{small-scale}} fragmentation on the <b>above-ground</b> plant <b>biomass</b> was examined in nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands {{in the northern}} Swiss Jura mountains in three successive years. In the same field experiment, the fragmentation effect on the below-ground plant biomass was evaluated in I year. Additionally, species richness and abundance of plants were recorded. The experimental set-up consisted of 12 blocks with 48 fragments (24 small, 12 medium and 12 large) and 48 corresponding control plots distributed over three study sites. Fragmentation was maintained by frequently mowing the area between the fragments. Three to 5 years after {{the beginning of the}} experiment, plant biomass was harvested in all fragments and control plots in late autumn every year. In general, fragments contained more above- and below-ground plant biomass than control plots. The increase in <b>above-ground</b> plant <b>biomass</b> was partly due to an increased density of plants, and partly due to a change in species composition in fragments. In particular, a competitive shift of dominance towards tall grasses and forbs at the expense of smaller forbs was observed. Beside the main fragmentation effect on <b>above-ground</b> plant <b>biomass,</b> interactive effects with year of investigation, study site and plot size were found. This indicates that the observed fragmentation effect is a combined result of various factors acting to a different extent at different sites and plot sizes. The fragmentation-related increase in plant productivity could affect higher trophic levels such as herbivore and predator communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|One such {{program is}} the [...] "Retire Livestock and Restore Pastures" [...] initiative, which {{requires}} the use of special enclosure fencing. The purpose of this protective fencing is to prevent the grazing activity of large livestock, like sheep, yaks, and goats, in an attempt to restore the degraded biomass, and maintain ecosystem function. [...] Often these effects can best be seen by the changes they produce in the biogeochemical properties of the soil. The overall goal is to improve ecosystem carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage, by increasing both vegetation and soil pools of these elements. This effect is crucial because even a small percent change in carbon storage can have a huge positive impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide and global carbon levels, as well as ecosystem sustainability. But carbon is not the only important factor. Low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus have also been found to limit plant growth and net primary productivity. In one study, exclusion fencing was found to increase the carbon stored in the biomass, as well as the nitrogen and phosphorus in the <b>above-ground</b> <b>biomass.</b> However this effect was minor, and not enough to compensate for the considerable loss of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools from the soil surface layer. Another study found exclusion fencing to be a beneficial tool in lowering carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing methane consumption, which improves both the soil carbon and nitrogen stores. Although findings are controversial, enclosure fencing remains a common practice in China because of the sensitivity of these grassland areas.|$|E

However, basal ground cover is only 50 % of that in the open. Compari-son with other savanna studies as a whole does not show any significant effect of rainfall on the relationship between under-canopy and outside-canopy grass production.

40|$|This work aims to {{estimate}} soil moisture and vegetation height from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) data using direct and reflected signals by the land surface surrounding a ground-based antenna. Observations are collected from a rainfed wheat field in southwestern France. Surface soil moisture is retrieved based on SNR phases {{estimated by the}} Least Square Estimation method, assuming the relative antenna height is constant. It is found that vegetation growth breaks up the constant relative antenna height assumption. A vegetation-height retrieval algorithm is proposed using the SNR-dominant period (the peak period in the average power spectrum derived from a wavelet analysis of SNR). Soil moisture and vegetation height are retrieved at different time periods (before and after vegetation's significant growth in March). The retrievals are compared with two independent reference data sets: in situ observations of soil moisture and vegetation height, and numerical simulations of soil moisture, vegetation height and <b>above-ground</b> dry <b>biomass</b> from the ISBA (interactions between soil, biosphere and atmosphere) land surface model. Results show that changes in soil moisture mainly affect the multipath phase of the SNR data (assuming the relative antenna height is constant) with little change in the dominant period of the SNR data, whereas changes in vegetation height {{are more likely to}} modulate the SNR-dominant period. Surface volumetric soil moisture can be estimated (R 2  [*]=[*]  0. 74, RMSE [*]=[*]  0. 009  m 3  m− 3) when the wheat is smaller than one wavelength (∼[*] 19  cm). The quality of the estimates markedly decreases when the vegetation height increases. This is because the reflected GNSS signal is less affected by the soil. When vegetation replaces soil as the dominant reflecting surface, a wavelet analysis provides an accurate estimation of the wheat crop height (R 2  [*]=[*]  0. 98, RMSE [*]=[*]  6. 2  cm). The latter correlates with modeled <b>above-ground</b> dry <b>biomass</b> of the wheat from stem elongation to ripening.

Leaf height, leaf den-sity, biomass and nutrient content of the mature leaves of E. crassipes were measured and related to water level fluctuation and the hydrologic connectivity.

We sought to investigate {{the relative importance of}} three major types of interactions: competition, herbivory, and mutualism in a field experiment using bergamot (monarda fistulosa) and ox-eye (Heliposis helianthoides). These plants were chosen because Monarda produces qualitative secondary compounds for defense, whereas Heliopsis relies on quantitative secondary compounds. The experiment employed a 3 x 2 factorial design examining above-ground competition (with/without competitors), herbivory (with/without pesticide) and mycorrhizal symbionts (with/without fungicide) within a larger grassland restoration experiment. Herbivore damage was assessed bimonthly as percent of leaves damaged. After 90 days, <b>above-ground</b> plant <b>biomass</b> was harvested and weighed, and leaf chlorophyll was measured. Herbivore damage did not differ between species and was reduced 3 X and 1. 5 X in pesticide and fungicide treatments, respectively. The sole factor affecting <b>above-ground</b> plant <b>biomass</b> was competition, with competitor-free plants having 90 % more biomass. By contract, herbivores caused a 2 -fold reduction in leaf chlorophyll whereas competition had no significant effect. The next step will be to assess how plant functional traits and herbivore assemblage structure respond to the factors of competition, herbivory, and mutualism. To date our results suggest that competition and herbivory may each be important for determining plant fitness, but their effects may manifest themselves in different ways.

40|$|Abstract – A ground-based, scanning, {{near-infrared}} (1064 nm) lidar, the Echidna ® validation instrument (EVI), {{built by}} CSIRO Australia, retrieves structural parameters of forest stands rapidly and accurately, and by merging multiple scans {{into a single}} point cloud also provides 3 -D stand reconstructions. Scans and field work in the USA (New England in 2007 and the Sierra Nevada of California in 2008) show that retrievals of mean tree diameter, stem count density (stems/ha), basal area, <b>above-ground</b> woody <b>biomass,</b> and leaf area index for 1 -ha plots match conventional field measurements very well. Three-D forest reconstructions provide {{the ability to make}} virtual structural measurements that also match field measurements very well...|$|R
