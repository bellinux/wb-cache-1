To {{broaden the}} {{application}} {{scope of the}} controllable overrunning clutch, a novel type Separable-Control Overrunning Clutch (SCOC) used in vehicle system has been designed by {{the authors of this}} paper.

In order to analysis and compare the bidirectional engaging characteristics of the clutch, a nonlinear dynamics model taking into <b>account</b> <b>clearance</b> and elastic contact has been established by ADAMS. Through the simulations, a series of comprehensive summary on the bidirectional engaging characteristic has been drawn and it could provide theoretical guidance for further prototype design and experimental research...|$|R

Because path transforms guide the search for a 3 -DOF path where solution paths are likely to lie, the computational burden of the new approach is low compared with that in previously reported results.

40|$|The Topaz Bridge {{is located}} in eastern Idaho on U. S. Route 30 between Lava Hot Springs and McCammon. It spans over the Union Pacific Railroad and the Portnuef-Marsh Valley Canal. The {{existing}} five span truss-style bridge is structurally deficient and functionally obsolete due to heavy traffic bypass. The replacement of the existing Topaz Bridge and its approaches are to be redesigned to better accommodate heavy commercial traffic, projected growth and overall safety. The chosen design features an expansion from two-lanes to four-lanes that will accommodate the 53 % increase in daily traffic that is expected by 2024. The new steel-girder bridge will be designed taking into <b>account</b> <b>clearance</b> and easement requirements of the expanding Union Pacific Railroad that passes beneath the bridge.

Thus, R 0, {{the average number}} of secondary infections one typical infected individual will produce during his or her infectious period is not necessarily the same as {{the average number of}} secondary cases (infected persons).

The two new reproduction numbers were derived for a deterministic pair model with serial monogamous partnerships using infection parameters for Chlamydia trachomatis, an example of a curable STI.

No significant differences were seen in the dose-normalized area under the curve when the 100 - and 200 -mg 30 -min administrations were compared. Differences that approached statistical significance were seen when data from either of these trials were compared with data from the constant-infusion arm.

40|$|Abstract—Simplified coupled engine block-crankshaft models {{based on}} beam theory provide an {{efficient}} substitute to engine simulation {{in the design}} process. These models require accurate definition of the main bearing stiffness. In this paper, an investigation of this stiffness is presented. The clearance effect is studied using a smooth bearing model. It is manifested for low shaft displacement. The hydrodynamic assessment model shows that the oil film has no stiffness for low loads and it is infinitely rigid for important loads. The deformation stiffness is determined using a suitable finite elements model based on real CADs. As a result, a main bearing behaviour law is proposed. This behaviour law takes into <b>account</b> the <b>clearance,</b> the hydrodynamic sustention and the deformation stiffness.

To this were built three-dimensional sectors (as the compressor axisymmetric) blade impeller and the diffuser of the centrifugal compressor on the basis of which they were created two grid models. The dimension of the grid model for the calculation models of turbulence komega and SST was 1. 4 million. Elements and the dimensionless parameter y + does not exceed 2. turbulence model family k-epsilon model grid was also 1. 4 million. Elements, and the dimensionless parameter y + was greater than 20, which corresponds to recommended values. The next part of the work was the task of boundary conditions required for the correct ca lculation. When the impeller inlet pawned pressure working fluid and the total temperature at the outlet and the gas flow rate through the stage. On the side faces sectors pawned boundary cond ition «Periodic», allowing everything except the wheel, but only axisymmetric part, which significantly reduces the required computational time and resources. <b>Accounting</b> <b>clearance</b> in addition to the meridional geometry construction additionally taken into account boundary condition «Counter Rotating Wall», which allows you to leave the domain in the rotating disc fixed coa ting.

40|$|For the {{calculation}} of multi-stage turbines it is common practice to use inviscid duct-flow and through-flow methods which make an attempt to acquire frictional influences by appropriate models for taking into <b>account</b> the <b>clearance</b> and secondary flows as well as losses.

Each pathogenic hantavirus is naturally hosted by a principal rodent species without conspicuous dis-ease and infection is persistent, perhaps for life. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are the natural reservoirs of Sin Nombre virus (SNV), the etiologic agent of most HCPS cases in North America. Deer mice remain infected despite a helper T cell re-sponse that leads to high-titer neutralizing antibodies. Deer mice are also susceptible to Andes hantavirus (ANDV), which causes most HCPS cases in South America; however, deer mice clear ANDV. We infected deer mice with SNV or ANDV to identify dif-ferences in host responses that might account for this differential outcome.

We measured blood-to-tissue albumin clearance and changes in plasma volume in isoflurane-anaesthetized mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J) pre-treated with rolipram (8 mg kg− 1 i. p., 30 min). Rolipram significantly reduced albumin permeability, measured using a dual-label fluorescence method, in skin and skeletal muscle compared with ANP alone (500 ng kg− 1 min− 1). Skin and muscle tissue accounted for 70 % of the reduction in whole body albumin <b>clearance</b> taking into <b>account</b> albumin <b>clearance</b> in gastrointestinal (GI) tissue, heart and kidney. The action of ANP and rolipram to modify albumin clearances in duodenum and jejunum could {{be accounted for by}} local increases in vascular perfusion to increase surface area for exchange. ANP increased haematocrit from 40. 6 % to 46. 8 %, corresponding to an average loss of 22 % plasma fluid volume (227 μl), and this was almost completely reversed with rolipram. Renal water excretion accounted for less than 30 % of plasma fluid loss indicating that reduced albumin permeability and reduced filtration into vasodilated GI tissue were the predominant actions of PDE 4 inhibition. Similar fluid retention was measured in mice with endothelial-restricted deletion of the guanylyl cyclase-A receptor for ANP. Stabilizing the endothelial barrier to offset ANP-induced increases in vascular permeability may be part of a strategy to maintain plasma volume...|$|R
40|$|Diversity of prion strains was {{attributed}} to an elusive nucleic acid, yet a search spanning nearly two decades has failed to identify a prion-specific polynucleotide. In our search for a prion-specific nucleic acid, we analyzed nucleic acids in purified fractions from the brains of Syrian hamsters infected with Sc 237 prions. Purification of Sc 237 prions removed nucleic acids larger than 50 nucleotides as measured by return refocusing electrophoresis (RRGE). To determine {{the size of the}} largest polynucleotide present in purified fractions at an abundance of one molecule per infectious (ID 50) unit, we measured prions present after inoculation. In order to account for the rapid clearance of prions after intracerebral inoculation, we determined the number of PrPSc molecules and ID 50 units of prions that were retained in brain. Factoring in clearance after inoculation, we estimate that the largest polynucleotide present in our purified fractions at one molecule per ID 50 unit is ≈ 25 nucleotides in length. In the same fractions, there were ≈ 3, 000 protease-resistant PrPSc molecules per ID 50 unit after <b>accounting</b> for <b>clearance</b> of PrPSc following inoculation. We compared the resistance of Sc 237 and 139 H prions to inactivation by UV irradiation at 254 nm. Irradiation of homogenates and microsomes diminished prion infectivity by a factor of ≈ 1, 000 but did not alter the strain-specified properties of the Sc 237 and 139 H prions. The data reported here combined with the production of synthetic prions argue that the 25 -mer polynucleotides found in purified prion preparations are likely to be host encoded and of variable sequence; additionally, these 25 -mers are unlikely to be prion specific...|$|R
