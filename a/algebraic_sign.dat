He entitled the volume Unto This Last, and his central point was this: [...] "It is impossible to conclude, of any given mass of acquired wealth, merely by the fact of its existence, whether it signifies good or evil to the nation in the midst of which it exists. Its real value depends on the moral sign attached to it, just as strictly as that of a mathematical quantity depends on the <b>algebraic</b> <b>sign</b> attached to it. Any given accumulation of commercial wealth may be indicative, on the one hand, of faithful industries, progressive energies, and productive ingenuities: or, on the other, it may be indicative of mortal luxury, merciless tyranny, ruinous chicanery."

5000|$|... (1) Aberration of {{the third}} order of axis points is dealt with in all text-books on optics. It is very {{important}} in telescope design. In telescopes aperture is usually taken as the linear diameter of the objective. It {{is not the same as}} microscope aperture which is based on the entrance pupil or field of view as seen from the object and is expressed as an angular measurement. Higher order aberrations in telescope design can be mostly neglected. For microscopes it cannot be neglected. For a single lens of very small thickness and given power, the aberration depends upon the ratio of the radii r:r', and is a minimum (but never zero) for a certain value of this ratio; it varies inversely with the refractive index (the power of the lens remaining constant). The total aberration of two or more very thin lenses in contact, being the sum of the individual aberrations, can be zero. This is also possible if the lenses have the same <b>algebraic</b> <b>sign.</b> Of thin positive lenses with n=1.5, four are necessary to correct spherical aberration {{of the third}} order. These systems, however, are not of great practical importance. In most cases, two thin lenses are combined, one of which has just so strong a positive aberration (under-correction, vide supra) as the other a negative; the first must be a positive lens and the second a negative lens; the powers, however: may differ, so that the desired effect of the lens is maintained. It is generally an advantage to secure a great refractive effect by several weaker than by one high-power lens. By one, and likewise by several, and even by an infinite number of thin lenses in contact, no more than two axis points can be reproduced without aberration of the third order. Freedom from aberration for two axis points, one of which is infinitely distant, is known as Herschel's condition. All these rules are valid, inasmuch as the thicknesses and distances of the lenses are not to be taken into account.|$|E

However, the level of reduction strongly depends on the plan-wise distribution of supplemental damping. Nearly optimal reduction in demands on the outermost flexible-side element, an element {{generally considered to be}} the most critical element, was realized when damping was distributed unevenly in the system plan such that the damping eccentricity was equal in magnitude but opposite in <b>algebraic</b> <b>sign</b> to the structural eccentricity of the system.

Note that not all high harmonics ñ have {{to be taken into account}} as their contribution is either comparatively low or near zero as they cause high orders of the Bessel function (see Eq. 4). With respect of a high number of blades (N), the field distribution of the discretized spiral axicon resembles the not discretized spiral axicon, as the second contribution does not influence the contribution of the first harmonic ñ= 1. Therefore, for high N, the resulting field distribution near the optical axis solely consists of a Bessel beam with the TC l= 1.|$|E

This study re-examines simple models for the effects due to finite beamwidth and vertical shear of the horizontal wind. Analytic solutions of 1 - and 2 -dimensional models are presented. Comparisons of the simple 2 -dimensional model with numerical integrations of a 3 -dimensional model with a symmetrical Gaussian beam show that the 2 -dimensional model is usually adequate. The solution of the 2 -dimensional model gives a formula {{that can be applied}} easily to large data sets. Analysis of the analytic solutions of the 2 -dimensional model for off-vertical beams reveals a term that has not been included in mathematical formulas for spectral broadening in the past. This term arises from the simultaneous effects of the changing geometry due to curvature within a finite beamwidth and the vertical wind shear. The magnitude of this effect can be comparable to that of the well-known effects of beam-broadening and wind shear, and since it can have either <b>algebraic</b> <b>sign,</b> it can significantly reduce (or increase) the expected spectral broadening, although under typical conditions it is smaller than the beam-broadening effect.
