5|$|The United Nations {{had tried}} {{several times to}} {{reconcile}} {{the government of the}} Congo with the State of Katanga, which had declared independence under Moïse Tshombe with Belgian support in 1960. Though initially limiting its actions, the United Nations Operation in the Congo became increasingly impatient towards Katanga and Tshombe and drew up plans to resolve the situation through force. Tshombe continuously violated agreements he had made with the United Nations and the Congolese government by building up his forces and bringing foreign mercenaries into the conflict. The situation came to <b>a</b> <b>breaking</b> point in December 1962 when Katangese gendarmes attacked peacekeeping forces in Katanga.

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Paul Brown and Modell reached <b>a</b> <b>breaking</b> point when Brown traded star halfback Bobby Mitchell {{for the rights}} to Ernie Davis, a Heisman Trophy-winning running back who broke all of Jim Brown's rushing records at Syracuse. Paul Brown did not inform Modell of the move, and Modell only heard about it after getting a call from Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall. Davis, however, was diagnosed with leukemia before the 1962 season. He came to Cleveland to train after the cancer went into remission, but Brown would not allow him to play. Modell, however, wanted to give Davis a chance to play before he succumbed to the disease. Ultimately, the relationship between coach and owner was never repaired, and Ernie Davis never played in a professional game, dying on May 18, 1963.|$|E

40|$|Perron (1989) {{introduced}} {{a variety of}} unit root tests that are valid when <b>a</b> <b>break</b> in the trend function of a time series is present. The motivation was to devise testing procedures that were invariant to {{the magnitude of the}} shift in level and/or slope. In particular, if a change is present it is allowed under both the null and alternative hypotheses. This analysis was carried under the assumption of <b>a</b> known <b>break</b> date. The subsequent literature aimed to devise testing procedures valid in the case of <b>an</b> unknown <b>break</b> date. However, in doing so, most of the literature and, in particular the commonly used test of Zivot and Andrews (1992), assumed that if <b>a</b> <b>break</b> occurs, it does so only under the alternative hypothesis of stationarity. This is undesirable since a) it imposes an asymmetric treatment when allowing for <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> so that the test may reject when the noise is integrated but the trend is changing; b) if <b>a</b> <b>break</b> is present, this information is not exploited to improve the power of the test. In this paper, we propose a testing procedure that addresses both issues. It allows <b>a</b> <b>break</b> under both the null and alternative hypotheses and, when <b>a</b> <b>break</b> is present, the limit distribution of the test is the same {{as in the case of}} <b>a</b> known <b>break</b> date, thereby allowing increased power while maintaining the correct size.
