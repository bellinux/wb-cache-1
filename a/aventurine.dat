Passing through yet another room, where the finished mosaic-works--of course not the pictorial mosaics--are polished by machinery, we enter the store-room, where the crowded shelves display blocks of smalts and glass of endless variety of color. By far the greater number of these colors are discoveries or improvements of the venerable mosaicist Lorenzo Radi, who has found again the Byzantine secrets of counterfeiting, in vitreous paste, <b>aventurine</b> (gold stone), onyx, chalcedony, malachite, and other natural stones, and who has been praised by the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice for producing mosaics even more durable in tint and workmanship {{than those of the}} Byzantine artists.|$|E
5000|$|The words <b>aventurine</b> and aventurescence {{derive from}} the Italian [...] "a ventura," [...] meaning [...] "by chance." [...] This is an allusion to the chance {{discovery}} of <b>aventurine</b> glass or goldstone {{at some point in}} the 18th century. Goldstone is still manufactured today as an artificial imitation of later discoveries <b>aventurine</b> quartz and <b>aventurine</b> feldspar (sunstone).|$|E

5000|$|The name <b>aventurine</b> {{derives from}} the Italian [...] "a ventura" [...] meaning [...] "by chance". This is an allusion to the lucky {{discovery}} of <b>aventurine</b> glass or goldstone {{at some point in}} the 18th century. Although it was known first, goldstone is now a common imitation of <b>aventurine</b> and sunstone. Goldstone is distinguished visually from the latter two minerals by its coarse flecks of copper, dispersed within the glass in an unnaturally uniform manner. It is usually a golden brown, but may also be found in blue or green.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} colour of <b>aventurine</b> is green, {{but it may}} also be orange, brown, yellow, blue, or gray.

Because <b>aventurine</b> is a rock, its physical properties vary: its specific gravity may lie between 2.64-2.69 and its hardness is somewhat lower than single-crystal quartz at around 6.5.|$|E
