5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general were {{beginning}} to change. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted less than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E

While many of her texts were for children, some of her works, such as The Œconomy of Charity, were also for specific adult audiences. Still others were written for both children and adults, such as The Servant’s Friend (1786–7), which was meant to instruct servants of all ages.|$|E

Original Stories begins with a frame story that sketches out the education of two young girls by their maternal teacher Mrs. Mason, followed {{by a series of}} didactic tales. The book was first published by Joseph Johnson in 1788; a second, illustrated edition, with engravings by William Blake, was released in 1791 and remained in print for around <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} Roman rule in Britain, {{the region}} now known as East Anglia was settled by a North Germanic group known as the Angles, {{although}} {{there is evidence of}} early settlement of the region by a minority of other peoples, for instance the Swabians, who settled in the area around the modern town of Swaffham. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the territories of southern Britain conquered by the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. The ruling dynasty of East Anglia was the Wuffingas, named from Wuffa, an early king. The first king known to have ruled is Rædwald, whose reign spanned <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> from about 599.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

He was succeeded by Jack Renshaw, whose tenure was {{perceived to be the}} last days of a party which, after almost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> in government, was tired. At the May 1965 election, Askin led the Coalition to its first ever state electoral victory, gaining eight seats and a swing of 5.6% to achieve a majority of two. Askin became the first Liberal Premier. Morton was re-elected with 82.30%.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant for more than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> Manning's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; arthritis increasingly affected her, leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in The Levant Trilogy, The Sum of Things, in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, but having said goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet's travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy's supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet's ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone's injury {{during the battle of}} El Alamein and recovery.|$|E
5|$|The El Badi Palace flanks {{the eastern}} side of the Kasbah. It was built by Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur after his success against the Portuguese at the Battle of the Three Kings in 1578. The lavish palace, which took around <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> to build, was funded by {{compensation}} from the Portuguese and African gold and sugar cane revenue. This allowed Carrara marble to be brought from Italy and other materials to be shipped from France, Spain and India. It is a larger version of the Alhambra's Court of the Lions. Although the palace is now a ruin with little left but the outer walls, the site has become the location of the annual Marrakech Folklore Festival and other events.|$|E

5|$|The Mad Hermit is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The story focuses on Harry Willard, who becomes a hermit after {{his wife and daughter}} leave him. He spends <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> in isolation, but he stumbles across a runaway carriage and the woman tosses her baby to him. He runs into the wilderness and prepares to kill it, but he stays his hand when he sees the baby's locket. The parents survive the carriage crash and seek out the hermit, and it is revealed that the baby's mother is the daughter of Harry Willard. Created by a staff of twenty, it was the first film to be {{produced by}} the Thanhouser Company. The film was released in August 9, 1910, after the success of the company was ensured, and met with positive reception by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release in December 1939, although some reviewers found it overlong. The casting was widely praised and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to {{her role as}} Scarlett. At the 12th Academy Awards, it received ten Academy Awards (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for Best Picture, Best Director (Fleming), Best Adapted Screenplay (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), Best Actress (Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, becoming the first African-American to win an Academy Award). It set records for {{the total number of}} wins and nominations at the time. The film was immensely popular, becoming the highest-earning film made up to that point, and retained the record for over <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> When adjusted for monetary inflation, it is still the most successful film in box-office history.|$|E
5|$|After {{one long}} run in The Heiress, Richardson {{appeared}} in another, RCSherriff's Home at Seven, in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears {{he may have}} committed murder. He later recreated the part in a radio broadcast, and in a film version, which was his sole venture into direction for the screen. Once he had played himself into a role in a long run, Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: Outcast of the Islands, directed by Carol Reed, and David Lean's The Sound Barrier, released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his characteristic liking for switching between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in Three Sisters in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with Renée Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin. He did not attempt Chekhov again for more than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Western Chalukya art {{evolved in}} two phases, the first lasting {{approximately}} <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> {{and the second}} {{from the beginning of}} 11th century until the end of Western Chalukya rule in 1186 CE. During the first phase, temples were built in the Aihole-Banashankari-Mahakuta region (situated in the early Chalukya heartland) and Ron in the Gadag district. A few provisional workshops built them in Sirval in the Gulbarga district and Gokak in the Belgaum district. The structures at Ron bear similarities to the Rashtrakuta temples in Kuknur in the Koppal district and Mudhol in the Bijapur district, evidence that the same workshops continued their activity under the new Karnata dynasty. The mature and latter phase reached its peak at Lakkundi (Lokigundi), a principal seat of the imperial court. From the mid-11th century, the artisans from the Lakkundi school moved south of the Tungabhadra River. Thus the influence of the Lakkundi school can be seen in some of the temples of the Davangere district, and in the temples at Hirehadagalli and Huvinahadgalli in the Bellary district.|$|E
