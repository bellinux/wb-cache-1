40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the present study}} is to provide an insight on the role played by {{non-volatile}} molecules on the different in-mouth attributes, particularly astringency. For achieving such goal, the main in-mouth sensory attributes of 34 oaked Spanish red wines were measured by a trained panel. The wine content in 30 sensory-active molecules was analysed by different HPLC based methodologies together with classical enological parameters and two proanthocyanidin indexes. Fourteen compounds (<b>aconitic</b> <b>acids,</b> polymeric proanthocyanidins, caftaric, caffeic and coutaric acids and seven quercetins) were found to be at concentrations above reported taste thresholds and to have a reasonably high range of occurrence. Two highly statistically significant models for astringency were built with those compounds. Even if the models could not be fully validated by sensory addition experiments, the research has demonstrated that wine astringency is driven by polymeric proanthocyanidins and by certain phenolic acids, the rate trans/cis-aconitic acid and flavonol profiles. The research has highlighted the existence of extremely complex interactions between non-volatile compounds on the in-mouth sensory perception. Particularly remarkable is the lack of additivity and potential antagonism found between the pairs cis/trans-aconitic <b>acids,</b> between <b>aconitic</b> and caffeic <b>acids</b> and between quercetin- 3 -O-galactoside and quercetin- 3 -O-glucoside. Also remarkable was the sweetness × astringent interaction and the matrix-dependence of the sensory responses elicited by flavonols. These results suggest the need for new paradigms and experimental procedures for fully decoding the real sensory relevance of individual non-volatile compounds in the overall wine flavour. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to study the evolution of organic acids content during ensiling process of whole plant maize in three different conditions: inoculation of Lactobacillus buchneri, control and disinfection with sodium hypochlorite. Chopped whole crop maize was ensiled in vacuum polyethylene bags (0. 9 - 1. 0 kg per bag) with inoculation of L. buchneri, without it and disinfected with sodium hypochlorite. Three silos per treatment were frozen until analysis at - 20 °C after 0, 12, 24, 48 hour and after 4, 8, 16 and 30 days (72 samples). Immediately after defrosting simultaneous determination of lactic, acetic, propionic, butyric aconitic, malic, citric and fumaric acids was performed. Data were analyzed by using the GLM procedure of SPSS. Plant organic <b>acids</b> (<b>aconitic,</b> malic, citric and fumaric) lowered their concentration during ensiling process but malic, starting from 8 days after ensiling, kept on increasing until 30 days. Major organic acid found {{at the end of}} the process was lactic acid but its faster accumulation rate was recorded on first 48 hours in inoculated and control thesis when pH dropped under value 4. In disinfected samples pH lowered more slowly and its decrease was clear only after 24 hours when also lactic acid began to increase. After 8 days, in inoculated samples, lactic acid concentration decreased while acetic acid increased. We concluded that major cause of lactic acid production was not bacterial fermentations but enzymatic glycolysis by plant cell enzymes. Treating whole-plant corn with L. buchneri resulted in increased concentrations of acetic acid and decreased concentration of lactic acid when compared with untreated corn silage. Sodium hypochlorite did not blocked only fermentations but retard also enzymatic glycolysis. Interesting is the rise of malic acid content which was ascribed to a new production during ensiling process despite preservation of initial cell plant content. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|The {{substitution}} of human serum albumin with negatively charged molecules, such as succinic acid (Suc-HSA) or <b>aconitic</b> <b>acid</b> (Aco-HSA), resulted in proteins with potent anti-HIV activities, by binding to viral gp 120 (V 3 loop). The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate whether the distribution of negative charges on the albumin backbone influences the anti-HIV activity. Therefore, we prepared albumins with clusters of negatively charged groups by coupling of heparin. The effects of this substitution on anti-HIV activity, in vivo distribution and the protein structure as compared to random succinylation were assessed. In vitro studies indicated that HSA-modified with heparin 6 or 13 kD displayed anti-HIV activity (IC 50 = 660 and 37 nM, respectively) and exhibited affinity for gp 120 -V 3 loop, although the activity was lower than that of Suc-HSA. Combined derivatization of HSA with heparin 13 kD and <b>aconitic</b> <b>acid</b> groups resulted in significantly increased inhibitory actions (IC 50 = 2. 8 nM). Structural analysis showed that modification of HSA with heparin did not lead to extensive unfolding of the protein, meaning that these modified proteins were still globular in structure. In contrast, succinylation of HSA resulted in a highly randomly coiled conformation. Dynamic light scattering experiments revealed that, at neutral pH, the heparin fragments attached to the protein were wrapped around the molecule rather than sticking out into the solution. In conclusion, coupling of sufficient clustered negative charges, by coupling of Hep-fragments, on HSA resulted in a clear anti-HIV activity of the protein. Yet, random distribution of anionic groups in the albumin seemed more optimal for in vitro anti-HIV activity. The higher plasma and lymphatic concentrations of Hep-HSA compared to Suc-HSA seemed more favorable for an anti-HIV activity in vivo. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserve...|$|E
