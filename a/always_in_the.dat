5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic fatigue and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{graduated}} from Chorrillos in 1962 with a specialization in engineering. He returned to Panama {{and joined the}} Panama National Guard. Posted to Colón, {{he was given a}} commission as a second lieutenant in September 1962. His commanding officer in Colón was Omar Torrijos, then a Major in the National Guard. Torrijos became a patron and mentor to Noriega, protecting him when he ran into trouble. In a 1962 incident, according to journalist John Dinges, Torrijos helped Noriega avoid legal problems after a prostitute accused Noriega of beating and raping her. Soon after, Noriega's drinking and violence obliged Torrijos to confine him to his quarters for a month. Despite Noriega's problems, Torrijos maintained their relationship, ensuring they were <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same command; he also brought Díaz Herrera into the same unit. Díaz Herrera and Noriega became both friends and rivals for Torrijos's favor. In 1966, Noriega was again involved in a violent incident, allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl and beating her brother. After this Torrijos transferred Noriega to a remote posting.|$|E
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{also stated}} that the flag was once held in an iron chest, within Dunvegan Castle. The key to the chest was then <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession of the hereditary flag bearers. The c.1800 manuscript related how, {{on the death of}} the MacLeod chief Tormod, son of lain Breac, the succession to the chiefship nearly fell to the family of the MacLeods of Talisker. The young widow of the last chief refused to give up Dunvegan Castle to the next heir, knowing herself to be pregnant (although she had only been married six weeks previous to her widowhood). In time, she gave birth to Tormod, the next chief. The c.1800 manuscript stated that at around this time, a man who wished to curry favour with the expectant heir (MacLeod of Talisker) attempted to steal the flag. Even though the Fairy Flag was later found, both the staff and iron chest were never seen again. Historically, the old chief, Tormod (son of Iain Breac), died in the autumn of 1706, and his son, Tormod, was born in July 1705.|$|E

5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. One {{of the advantages of}} working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} only Mario at the journey's beginning. Ultimately, {{the player}} will gain {{a party of}} five characters, though only three members can be used during a battle at any given time. Mario is <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> player's party, but the other two characters can be selected before battles. Each of the five characters has {{a unique set of}} attacks and techniques. For example, Princess Toadstool's abilities are primarily healing techniques, whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage. The combat is based on a traditional turn based battle system with the addition of action commands that amplify a move's effects. The player starts each turn by choosing to attack, defend, run, use an item, or perform magic from the combat menu. The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack, special move, defense, or item usage. This {{is one of the more}} innovative features of gameplay, becoming a mainstay of later Mario RPGs.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of items {{scattered}} around the castle, of which the player may carry up to three at a time. Some of these are <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same place {{at the start of the}} game, whereas others are distributed randomly. Items include differently-coloured keys which will unlock their respective doors, the three pieces of the ACG key, and other items that affect certain enemies or are mere red herrings. Common enemies appear in each room upon entering and will attack the player on sight. Collision with these enemies destroys them but drains a portion of the player's health. There are also stationary poisonous fungi which will drain health constantly if the player is in contact with them, and enemies that require special items in order to either distract, repel or kill them, otherwise they remain invulnerable to conventional attacks. Bosses guard pieces of the ACG key, and contact with them will rapidly drain away the player's health.|$|E

5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go {{off the side of}} the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E
5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{thick of}} the action during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present {{near the city of}} Troyes. Negotiations for an {{armistice}} were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging into the streets of the village where the negotiations were taking place. The French envoy to the armistice talks, Monsieur de Flahaut saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking place there, but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Blücher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of Prince of Schwarzenberg's Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and clearing his way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Château-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000-4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of Berry-au-Bac, over the Aisne, despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer platoons, Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarin.|$|E

5|$|Space Travel is a spaceflight {{simulation}} video game, {{presented in}} a two-dimensional top-down view, with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines on a black background. In it, the player controls a spaceship as it flies through {{a representation of the}} solar system. The game has no specific objectives, other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system. The planets and most of the moons in the solar system are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other, though the orbits are simplified to be circles. To land on a body, the player's ship must cross the line representing the surface while moving at a low enough speed. The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn. The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen, which the player can control; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the solar system in seconds, though they risk overshooting their target and becoming unable to find the solar system again, and scaling down allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land. The ship is <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the screen, facing the top; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the solar system around the ship instead.|$|E
