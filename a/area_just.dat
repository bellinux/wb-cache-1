Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly {{along the}} eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the Arch Rock viewing <b>area</b> <b>just</b> beyond the mile1 marker. The next two miles (3.2km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur's Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile3 is the Lake Shore Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile3, Scott's Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods {{on one side and the}} beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.|$|E
5|$|Born in Braco in Perthshire, Scotland, McGregor {{first became}} {{interested}} in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at Ardoch. He served an apprenticeship as a draper in Perth, and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to Birmingham, and opened his own drapery business in Aston, an <b>area</b> <b>just</b> outside the city. Upon his arrival in the English Midlands he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe, which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr. McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays {{to allow him to}} watch matches, and he later sold football kits at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.|$|E

5|$|By the 1940s, {{the castle}} {{structures}} were mostly covered with rubble and debris, interwoven with pathways {{created by the}} movement of visitors over the years. During the Second World War, the castle {{was used by the}} British Army, possibly as an early warning site fitted with anti-aircraft searchlights. In an <b>area</b> <b>just</b> {{to the north of the}} castle, the Starfish and Naval decoy sites were created to distract incoming German bombers from the town of Rye itself. Trenches were dug in the north bastion, and military training may have been conducted around the outskirts of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Extensive but {{superficial}} {{damage was}} caused by an IRA bomb that exploded close to a snack bar at approximately 1:10pm on 10 September 1973, injuring eight people. A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the <b>area</b> <b>just</b> before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 January 1963, unaware that their battle plans had been leaked to the enemy, the South Vietnamese Civil Guards spearheaded the attack by marching toward Ap Tan Thoi from the south. However, {{when they reached the}} hamlet of Ap Bac, {{southeast}} of Ap Tan Thoi, they were immediately pinned down by elements of the Viet Cong 261st Battalion. Shortly afterwards, three companies of the 11th Infantry Regiment were committed into battle in northern Ap Tan Thoi, but they too could not overcome the NLF soldiers who had entrenched themselves in the <b>area.</b> <b>Just</b> before midday, further reinforcements were flown in from Tan Hiep. The 15 US helicopters ferrying the troops were riddled by NLF gunfire and five helicopters were lost as a result.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August, two VRS {{air force}} jets {{attacked}} {{a village in}} the Nova Gradiška <b>area,</b> <b>just</b> north of the Sava Riverthe international border in the area. The CAF bombed an ARSK command post, a storage facility and several tanks near Bosanski Petrovac. CAF jets also struck a column of Serb refugees near Bosanski Petrovac, killing nine people, including four children. On 8 August, the CAF performed its last combat sorties in the operation, striking tanks and armoured vehicles between Bosanski Novi and Prijedor, and two of its MiG-21s were damaged. The same day, UN military observers deployed at Croatian airfields claimed that the CAF attacked military targets and civilians in the Dvor area, where refugee columns were mixed with ARSK transporting heavy weapons and large quantities of ammunition. Overall, the CAF performed 67 close air support, three attack helicopter, seven reconnaissance, four combat air patrol and 111 transport helicopter sorties during Operation Storm.|$|E
5|$|On the bird's {{forehead}} was a {{naked and}} pale chalky-blue frontal shield. This {{was surrounded by}} short, velvety black feathers that extended {{from the base of}} the bill to the <b>area</b> <b>just</b> below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash. The bird's chin and throat were sparsely covered with black, velvety feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish-grey breast. The abdomen and undertail-coverts were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey. The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown. The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail-coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and rounded, was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper mandible was chalky-blue with a black tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The bird's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the iris was a dark brown.|$|E

5|$|Small Heath Alliance Football Club, {{founded in}} 1875, played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green {{district}} of Birmingham, {{very near the}} site where the club's St Andrew's stadium would be built some thirty years later. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with a capacity estimated at 3,000; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. A year later they moved again, to a field in Small Heath, rented for an initial £5 a year from the family of Sam Gessey, a Small Heath player. The field had a capacity of 10,000 spectators, and was situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up <b>area,</b> <b>just</b> north of the main road to Coventry. It was bordered on two sides by developed streets, Muntz Street on the western side, Wright Street to the south; the other two sides of the enclosure adjoined farmland.|$|E
5|$|The academy grounds {{are home}} to {{numerous}} monuments and statues. The central cadet parade ground, the Plain, hosts the largest number, and includes the Washington Monument, Thayer Monument, Eisenhower Monument, MacArthur Monument, Kosciuszko Monument, and Sedgwick Monument. Patton Monument was first dedicated {{in front of the}} cadet library in 1950, but in 2004 it was placed in storage {{to make room for the}} construction of Jefferson Hall. With the completion of Jefferson Hall, Patton's statue was relocated and unveiled at a temporary location on 15 May 2009, where it will remain until the completion of the renovation of the old cadet library and Bartlett Hall. There is also a statue commemorating brotherhood and friendship from the École Polytechnique in the cadet central <b>area</b> <b>just</b> outside Nininger Hall. The remaining campus area is home to 27 other monuments and memorials.|$|E
5|$|The town's name {{derives from}} a {{corruption}} of the Celtic word bol and the Old English word pool meaning a place near a pool or creek. Variants include Pool, Pole, Poles, Poll, Polle, Polman, and Poolman. The area around modern Poole has been inhabited for the past 2,500years. During the 3rd century BC, Celts known as the Durotriges moved from hilltop settlements at Maiden Castle and Badbury Rings to heathland around the River Frome and Poole Harbour. The Romans landed at Poole during their conquest of Britain in the 1st century and took over an Iron Age settlement at Hamworthy, an <b>area</b> <b>just</b> west of the modern town centre. In Anglo-Saxon times, Poole {{was included in the}} Kingdom of Wessex. The settlement was used as a base for fishing and the harbour a place for ships to anchor {{on their way to the}} River Frome and the important Anglo-Saxon town of Wareham. Poole experienced two large-scale Viking invasions during this era: in 876, Guthrum sailed his fleet through the harbour to attack Wareham, and in 1015, Canute began his conquest of England in Poole Harbour, using it as a base to raid and pillage Wessex.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular <b>area</b> <b>just</b> behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the initial silver rush, a town site was platted {{and the town}} was built. The first permanent business building established in Silver Reef was a store {{at the intersection of}} the roads from the Buckeye, White, and East reefs. By 1878, the town's business district consisted of a hotel, boarding houses, nine stores, six saloons, five restaurants, a bank, two dance halls, a newspaper called The Silver Echo (which later became the Silver Reef Miner), and eight dry goods stores. Two cemeteries, one Catholic and one Protestant, were located south of Silver Reef's business district. Most of the businesses in Silver Reef were situated along a mile-long Main Street. The mining district consisted of 37 mines and five stamp mills: the Christy, Stormont, Leeds, Buckeye and Barbee & Walker mills. Although it was surrounded by settlements with large Mormon populations, the town never had a Mormon meeting house. A Catholic church was the only church located within the town. After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, many of the Chinese workers who had been hired to build it were out of work. Some returned to China, but others remained in Utah. A group of 250 of these workers set up a Chinatown in a level <b>area</b> <b>just</b> south of Silver Reef. Silver Reef's Chinatown had a Chinese mayor and several businesses. By 1879, Silver Reef's population had reached 2,000, and the town also had a horse race track, a brewery, and a brass band. Shooting matches among members of the Silver Reef Rifle Club and sometimes residents of nearby towns took place on the horse race track.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{one-third of}} the world's {{tropical}} cyclones form within the western Pacific. This makes this basin the most active on Earth. Pacific typhoons have formed year round, with peak months from August to October. The peak months correspond {{to that of the}} Atlantic hurricane seasons. Along with a high storm frequency, this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record. One of the most recent busy seasons was 2013. Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean, and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean. The <b>area</b> <b>just</b> northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist. Across the Philippines themselves, activity reaches a minimum in February, before increasing steadily through June, and spiking from July through October, with September being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago. Activity falls off significantly in November, although Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest Philippine typhoon on record, was a November typhoon. The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central Luzon and eastern Visayas. A ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receive less than 10percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. The genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency.|$|E
