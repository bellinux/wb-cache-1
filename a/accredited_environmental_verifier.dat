40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} climate change and carbon dioxide emissions from the built environment is resulting in the need to visualize the environmental performance of buildings. One of the recent drivers in the UK has been the tightening of building regulations relating to energy consumption in buildings, mandating all buildings to be performance evaluated by <b>accredited</b> <b>environmental</b> simulation tools to test their carbon dioxide emission against set targets. Currently there is major confusion on all levels from architects to building control officers and contractors on how to engrain energy consciousness principles {{in the design and}} construction of buildings. Within this context, ‘Building Information Modelling’ that is linked to ‘Building Performance Modelling’ is increasingly being looked upon as a tool to facilitate the communication between the design team and contractors and to provide a transparent information model on the specification and targeted energy consumption of all new/ refurbished buildings to all parties involved. In this paper, analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of current efforts to combine those two comprehensive databases will be investigated. A sample of main software development companies, architects and contractors, using semi-structured interviews is undertaken to find out how Building Integrated Modelling (BIM) and Building Performance Modelling (BPM) can support the design and construction teams to deliver energy conscious buildings...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper will}} explore the University of the West of England, Bristol’s {{progress}} over a 20 -year period in embedding sustainable development {{into the whole}} institution mission. The University of the West of England, Bristol is committed to ensuring that all its students, irrespective of their programme of study, are introduced to the ideas of sustainable development during their undergraduate or postgraduate degree programme. The university recognises that a typical graduate will have some 50 - 60 years of life post-graduation in which the pro sustainability knowledge, skills and attributes developed at university can play out positively in both their professional and private lives. Hence, UWE considers it {{a key part of}} its mission to provide an opportunity for all students to consider sustainability within their degree programme. In the most recent year of analysis the university has confirmed that each UG and PG taught programme within the portfolio provides this opportunity for disciplinary consideration of sustainability. The University’s award winning Sustainability Plan sets out our policy commitments and strategy to support sustainable development and describes their implementation these into the business of the University both in our educational role and in the management of our estate. (See [URL] Progress with the aims of the Plan are reported publicly and enhancement actions are identified and prioritised by the use of an <b>accredited</b> <b>environmental</b> management system, certified to the international standard BS:EN ISO 14001 : 2004, covering the entirety of the institution’s endeavours. In 2016 the university became the first in the UK to have its Education for Sustainable Development work accredited under the full NUS Responsible Futures certification scheme. The paper will provide a range of examples to illustrate the University ongoing commitment to ensuring that current and future student are able to develop the knowledge, skills and attributes that will enable them to be responsible 21 st Century citizens contributing {{to the development of a}} sustainable future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a macro- and micro-level {{comparison of the}} citation resources Web of Science (WOS), Scopus and Google Scholar (GS) for the environmental sciences scholarly journals in South Africa during 2004 - 2008. The macro-level measuring instruments consisted of 26 evaluation criteria with the following broad categories: content, access, services, interface, searching, search results, cost, citation and analytical tools, and linking abilities. The micro-level measuring instrument’s evaluation criteria represented the data fields of the journal records to establish comprehensivity. The macro-level evaluation results indicated that Scopus surpassed both WOS and GS whereas the micro-level evaluation results indicated that WOS surpassed both Scopus and GS. Based on the macro- and micro-level evaluation results the study was able to establish that GS {{is not yet a}} substitute but rather a supplementary citation resource for the fee-based WOS and/or Scopus for the South African international <b>accredited</b> scholarly <b>environmental</b> sciences journals during the period 2004 - 2008...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of time use and contribution to the household income of men, women, and children in 12 households in a fishing village in Panay Island, central Philippines. The study highlights the differential impact of poverty on men and women and provides a glimpse of the intrahousehold dynamics within poor fishing households. Findings in previous studies in both industrialized and developing countries that women work longer hours than men were corroborated. Women contribute at least 22 % to the household cash income and 40 % of the value of unpaid labour. Their contribution to the household cash income becomes larger than that of men's when the value of livestock is computed. Women's daily participation in productive activities, such as fish vending and shucking oyster and mussel, unwittingly puts them in a position of being <b>environmental</b> recorders and <b>verifiers</b> of the state of fishery resources. Because they are burdened with the responsibility of making ends meet, they are also confronted with the challenge of realizing the dream of sending their children to university to enable them to escape poverty. This alone makes women one of the strongest stakeholders in the sustainable development of fishery resources...|$|R
50|$|Western Black Rhinos {{and other}} {{subspecies}} were conserved in National Conservative parks and live species are still there. They live there {{under the protection}} of the government and all conditions are made for their survival. To monitor and protect white rhinos WWF focuses on better-integrated intelligence gathering networks on rhino poaching and trade, more antipoaching patrols and better equipped conservation law enforcement officers. WWF is setting up an Africa-wide rhino database using rhino horn DNA analysis (RhoDIS), which contributes to forensic investigations {{at the scene of the}} crime and for court evidence to greatly strengthen prosecution cases. WWF supports <b>accredited</b> training in <b>environmental</b> and crime courses, some of which have been adopted by South Africa Wildlife College. Special prosecutors have been appointed in countries like Kenya and South Africa to prosecute rhino crimes in a bid to deal with the mounting arrests and bring criminals to face swift justice with commensurate penalties.|$|R

VKTA {{is responsible for}} fissile material and waste management, environmental and radiation protection and runs an <b>accredited</b> laboratory for <b>environmental</b> and radionuclide analytics. The Rossendorf research site is located east {{of the city of}} Dresden. The period from 1982 to about 1997 was mainly characterized by obtaining the necessary licenses for decommissioning and developing a new infrastructure (i. e. waste treatment facility, interim storages for fissile material and waste, clearance monitoring facility). The decommissioning work has been in progress since that time. The decommissioning projects are concentrated on three complexes: (1) the reactors and a fuel development and testing facility, (2) the radioisotope production facilities, and (3) the former liquid and solid waste storage facilities. The status of decommissioning progress and treatment of the residues will be demonstrated. Finally an outlook will be given on the future tasks of VKTA based on the ''Conception VKTA 2000 plus'', which was confirmed by the Saxonian government last year...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{development}} {{has had a}} major role in creating the situation where bio-diverse materials and services essential for sustaining business are under threat. A key contributory factor to biodiversity decline comes from the cumulative impacts of extended supply chain business operations. In order to contribute to stopping this decline, the industrial world needs to form {{a better understanding of the}} way it utilizes the business and biodiversity agenda in its wider operations. This thesis investigates the perceptions and attitudes to biodiversity from government, society and a wide cross-section of industry. The research includes the extent of corporate attention to and use of environmental business tools and guidelines in reporting on biodiversity issues. A case study of three companies from different industrial sectors is undertaken to observe procurement and related environmental management of their supply chains. The use of <b>accredited</b> and non-accredited <b>environmental</b> management systems (EMS) are analysed as frameworks for introducing biodiversity aspects into supply chain management. The outcome is a methodology, which can be used either as a bespoke in-house biodiversity management system or within an accredited ISO 14001 EMS, for incorporating the assessment and management of the potential risks and opportunities involving environmental impacts on biodiversity of supply chain companies.

40|$|Existing {{research}} {{dealt with}} thermal comfort and daylighting independently, but these subjects {{are affected by}} building design strategies, cohesively. Hence, the application of passive design strategies {{which is achieved by}} designing building elements to be climate-responsive, is seen as a rational action. A passive house should attain optimum thermal comfort and daylighting that alleviate the need of mechanical cooling/ventilation and artificial lighting, respectively. This in turn, reduces operational energy demand. Having said that, {{there was a lack of}} research on the economic benefit of passive design strategies. Therefore, this study intends to demonstrate thermal comfort and daylighting, collectively, in a Passive Terraced House and assess the related economic benefits, especially when applied with Energy Efficient (EE) appliances and Renewable Energy (RE) system as multi-intervention. This research was carried out in comparison with a Conventional Terraced House so that the outcome could be assessed with the status quo. The methodology began with establishing a Conventional Terraced House and a Passive Terraced House. The former was deduced from the residential market, and later applied passive design strategies as listed in the Malaysian Standard (MS) 1525 to evolve into a proposed Passive Terraced House. Both types of house had the same conventional floor plans and rectangular building form but the party walls in the proposed Passive Terraced House were on the shorter sides, thus the longer sides became the wide frontage of the house creating shallow floor plan that facilitated daylighting and cross ventilation. Both houses were simulated using internationally <b>accredited</b> Indoor <b>Environmental</b> Solutions Virtual Environment (IES) programme, specifically ‘Apache’ and ‘Radiance’ software to ascertain the indoor air temperature and daylighting illuminance, respectively. When bench-marked against the standards, it was found that the proposed Passive Terraced House provided three months thermal comfort but the Conventional Terraced House was in thermal discomfort throughout the year. Similarly, the proposed Passive Terraced House offered plenty of daylighting in all rooms during the day time hours; but the Conventional Terraced House offered limited daylighting in bedrooms only. The economic assessment by means of 30 -year Total Multiintervention Cost (TMC) that includes house price, operational energy and capital costs of appliances, showed that the proposed Passive Terraced House was a cheaper option in the long term compared with the Conventional Terraced House. Each house was also simulated as a mass housing development on a one-hectare site (± 10 %). Despite the low number of the proposed Passive Terraced Houses, the return on Gross Development Cost (GDC) was competitively positive (about 30 %) when 10 % sales premium is assigned due to the wide frontage. The findings of the research demonstrated that the proposed Passive Terraced House was a credible housing alternative, especially in the context of pressing energy issue...|$|R
