40|$|Long term <b>air</b> and {{snowfall}} <b>chemistry</b> measurements {{have been}} performed at the three coastal Antarctic stations Dumont d'Urville (66 ° 40 ′S, 140 ° 1 ′E), Neumayer (70 ° 39 ′S, 8 ° 15 ′W), and Halley (75 ° 35 ′S, 26 ° 19 ′W). The results have to be interpreted and compared {{with respect to the}} regional meteorological conditions. In this study the 3 -hourly synoptic surface observations taken at the three stations between 1991 and 1995, as well as the daily upper air soundings from 1993, are analyzed to describe the aspects of station climatologies relevant for the <b>air</b> and snowfall <b>chemistry</b> measurements discussed in the papers of this special section. Although the three stations are comparable, being situated close to the coastline of Antarctica, the meteorological conditions differ. While at Dumont d'Urville katabatic winds cause predominant strong and relatively dry surface winds from the interior of Antarctica, Neumayer and Halley are frequently influenced by easterly winds associated mostly with eastward moving cyclones. From April through October the wind field above 5 km is governed by a circumpolar vortex with westerly winds increasing in intensity with height. Dumont d'Urville represents a station at the edge of this vortex with extreme stratospheric wind velocities up to above 50 m s− 1. Neumayer and Halley are mostly situated within the vortex and isolated from air masses advecting from lower latitudes into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere during the Austral winter...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen oxides (NOx =NO+NO 2) are {{important}} {{atmospheric trace constituents}} that impact tropospheric <b>air</b> pollution <b>chemistry</b> and <b>air</b> quality. We have developed a new NASA algorithm for the retrieval of stratospheric and tropospheric NO 2 vertical column densities using measurements from the nadir-viewing Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite. The new products rely on an improved approach to stratospheric NO 2 column estimation and stratosphere-troposphere separation and a new monthly NO 2 climatology based on the NASA Global Modeling Initiative chemistry-transport model. The retrieval does not rely on daily model profiles, minimizing {{the influence of a}} priori information. We evaluate the retrieved tropospheric NO 2 columns using surface in situ (e. g., AQS/EPA), ground-based (e. g., DOAS), and airborne measurements (e. g., DISCOVER-AQ). The new, improved OMI tropospheric NO 2 product is available at high spatial resolution for the years 200 S-present.

This cross-disciplinary study involves linking together models of mesoscale meteorology, <b>air</b> pollution <b>chemistry</b> and deposition, urban runoff and stormwater transport, water quality, and wetland chemistry and biology. The authors are focusing on the transport and fate of nitrogen species because (1) they track through both air and water pathways, (2) the physics, chemistry, and biology of the complete cycle is not well understood, and (3) they have important health, local ecosystem, and global climate implications. The authors will apply their linked modeling system to the Los Angeles basin, following the fate of nitrates from their beginning as nitrate-precursors produced by auto emissions and industrial processes, tracking their dispersion and chemistry as they are transported by regional winds and eventually wet or dry deposit on the ground, tracing their path as they are entrained into surface water runoff during rain events and carried into the stormwater system, and then evaluating their impact on receiving water bodies such as wetlands where biologically-mediated chemical reactions take place.
