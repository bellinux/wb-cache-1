The Fermi level is pinned <b>at</b> <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) for full coverage by NH 3 molecules and NH 2 radicals, respectively. For the crossover content of ammonia of about 25 % monolayer (ML), the Fermi level is unpinned.

Surface structure thermodynamic and mechanical stability criteria are defined and compared. Mechanical stability of the coverage of such surfaces was checked by determination of the desorption energy of hydrogen molecules. Thermodynamic stability analysis indicates that initally equilibrium hydrogen vapor partial pressure steeply increases with NH 3 content to attain the crossover NH 3 /NH 2 coverage, i. e. the unpinned Fermi level condition. For such condition {{the entire range of}} experimentally accessible pressures belongs showing that vapor growth of semiconductor crystals occurs predominantly for unpinned Fermi level at the surface, i. e. for flat bands.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ab initio {{calculations}} {{are used}} to determine the basic physical properties of hydrogen adsorption at the N-terminated GaN(0001 ̅) surface. It was shown that the Fermi level is pinned <b>at</b> the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> (VBM) for hydrogen coverage θH = 0. 75 ML above which the Fermi level is shifted to the conduction band minimum (CBM). Application of the electron counting rule (ECR) indicates that for θH = 0. 75 ML, the Fermi level is not pinned, located in the bandgap. Ab initio calculations confirmed that hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the Fermi level at the surface as predicted and explained earlier (Krukowski et al. J. Appl. Phys. 2013, 114, 143705 and Krukowski et al. J. Appl. Phys. 2013, 115, 043529). The adsorption energy contains electron transfer contribution, below θH = 0. 75 ML to VBM and above that coverage to CBM; thus it is ΔEads(H) ≅ 5. 8 eV and ΔEads(H) ≅ 3. 1 eV for a single H atom for these coverage ranges, respectively. Accordingly, the H 2 equilibrium pressure at the GaN(0001 ̅) surface varies from very low for θH 0. 75 ML.

The impurity-atom concentrations when the Fermi level was located either at the VBM or the CBM were as follows: (i) the B concentration was 0. 27 at. % in B-doped diamond, (ii) the N concentration was 0. 25 at. % in N-doped diamond, (iii) the concentration of Be substituting B was 0. 88 at. % in cBN, (iv) the concentration of Si substituting B was 0. 06 at. % in cBN, (v) the concentration of C substituting B was 0. 07 at. % in cBN, (vi) the concentration of C substituting N was 0. 88 at. % in cBN, and (vii) the concentration of Be substituting B was 1. 80 at. % in hBN.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} summarizes my work on {{the study}} of topological insulators, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides, especially on the electrical transport studies. There are mainly two parts in this dissertation. The first part is the study on topological insulators. Bi 2 Se 3 and Bi 2 Te 2 Se single crystals are synthesized and characterized. Calcium dopants are introduced to Bi 2 Se 3 to compensate for the excess electrons generated by selenium vacancies in the as-grown single crystals. An n- to p-type transition is then realized. The bulk insulating state is achieved. In Bi 2 Te 2 Se bulk samples, extremely high low-temperature resistivity (> 2 Ohm cm) is achieved. Nanodevices of Bi 2 Se 3 and Bi 2 Te 2 Se are then fabricated. A lithography-free technique is developed for device fabrication in order to well maintain the pristine state of bulk samples. Electron beam irradiation is performed to manually adjust the Fermi levels in the devices. Further control of the Fermi level is realized with the application of gate voltages. The insulating temperature behavior is achieved in devices upon electron beam irradiation. And the gate modulation grows as the electron beam irradiation dosage increases. The field-effect mobility is greatly enhanced and a ten-fold increase is obtained. The second part is focused on graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. Graphene is expected to exhibit ferromagnetism induced by the magnetic proximity effect when it is placed on a magnetic material. With enhanced spin-orbit coupling, the anomalous Hall effect can be realized in graphene. Meanwhile, a topological gap is opened at the Dirac point, making it possible to realize the quantized anomalous Hall effect when the Fermi level is in the gap. In this dissertation, graphene devices are transferred to yttrium iron garnet thin films, a ferrimagnetic material. At low temperatures, anomalous Hall effect is observed.

Published only in printed form, {{availability}} see BibidBecause of {{the growing}} awareness of environmental and energy-related issues, harvesting waste heat by thermoelectric materials is getting increasing attention. A decent thermoelectric material is typically a heavily doped semiconductor with high thermopower and low thermal conductivity. To simultaneously achieve these characteristics, a complex structure is an essence. Inspired by the artificial superlattices various multi-layered compounds with a repetitive stacking of conducting and blocking layers which enables to decouple electrical and thermal transport are currently investigated as candidates to approach the ideal "phonon glass, electron crystal" scenario. Metal oxides feature advantages like availability and thermal stability in air at elevated temperatures yet poor carrier mobility without appropriate doping. Replacing oxygen with less electronegative anions, for instance chalcogens, would turn the framework more covalent and lead to readily improved electrical conduction. This dissertation presents several layered misfit cobalt oxides and oxyselenides as thermoelectrics. To begin with, double-interlayered phases [Sr 2 O 2] 0. 52 CoO 2 and [Ca 1. 7 (OH) 2] 0. 58 CoO 2 were successfully made under compression and investigated by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and thermogravimetry (TG) which unveil subtle local geometry, electronic structure and defects embedded in the lattice. Given that a mixed-anion oxide-chalcogenide framework might effectively benefit the electrical transport, some layered oxyselenides, such as BiOCuSe, Bi 2 MO 4 Cu 2 Se 2 (M = Y or early rare earth element) and AE 2 CoO 2 Cu 2 Se 2 (AE = alkaline earth element) which in common possess an anti-fluorite-type [Cu 2 Se 2] sub-layer, were then investigated. Temperature-dependent extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) {{is found to be}} a powerful probe to resolve the lattice characteristics of BiOCuSe upon finite doping. Meanwhile, Cu vacancies and alkaline-earth dopants are found to affect distinctively in the BiOCuSe matrix. Bi 2 MO 4 Cu 2 Se 2 compounds, unfortunately, are metals with poor thermopower. The origin of metallicity is readily evidenced in the XAS analysis. Lastly the Sr 2 CoO 2 Cu 2 Se 2 p-type semiconductor was visited. Computational work suggests {{there is no way to}} overlook the contribution from the oxide sub-layer <b>at</b> the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> (VBM). Replacing Sr with Ba, in contrast to the Ca-for-Sr substitution case, would more efficiently raise the thermoelectric power factor.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is a theoretical investigation {{of the effects of}} band structure, strain, pressure, and growth orientation on the performance of semiconductor quantum well lasers. The effect of degenerate light- and heavy-hole bands on the carrier and current density and the differential gain are studied and compared with the non-degenerate case in semiconductor quantum well (QW) lasers. It is demonstrated that the presence of two degenerate <b>bands</b> <b>at</b> the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> will always lead to an increased threshold radiative current density compared to the case where only one band is significantly populated. When the two <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> are separated by an energy E 5, the current density decreases rapidly with increasing E 5, with greater reductions being achieved for a given tensile than compressive strain. The effect of the second subband becomes less important with increasing E 5, and the radiative current density reverts to that of the one <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> case, demonstrating the importance of maximising the subband energy separation to optimise laser characteristics. We investigate different formulations of the envelope function method and show that the accuracy of the calculated zone-centre confinement energies can be simply predicted by plotting the equivalent bulk band structure using the various formulations. We show how coupling to the conduction and spin-split-off bands can decrease the light-hole zone-centre energies and lead to significant differences in the calculated subband dispersion, with the effects being most pronounced for systems having a narrow band gap and small spin-orbit splitting energy. Since the loss mechanisms in a semiconductor laser are often strongly wavelength dependent and hydrostatic pressure can vary the band gap, the pressure dependence of the threshold current can then provide a clear picture of the dominant loss mechanisms in a given laser structure. The pressure dependence of the optical confinement factor, band structure, transparency and threshold carrier density, and the combined effect of these on both radiative- and non-radiative current contributions have been evaluated for lasers operating at a range of wavelengths. We investigate in particular the predicted pressure dependence of several Auger processes in long wavelength (1. 5 mum) lasers. It is found that the rate of decrease of phonon-assisted Auger recombination with pressure is close to that observed experimentally, implying that phonon-assisted Auger is the dominant loss mechanism. It is shown that although the transparency carrier density increases with pressure in all laser structures, the threshold carrier density, nth, can decrease in long wavelength single quantum well (SQW) lasers due to the pressure dependent parameters. The decrease of nth in the long wavelength SQW case results in a quicker decrease in the threshold current of a SQW laser compared to that of a multiple quantum well (MQW) laser, in agreement with experimental measurements. The optical properties of quantum well structures can also change with crystal orientation, and, therefore, the substrate orientation is an additional parameter which can be used in engineering the band structure. The effects of orientation on critical thickness and material parameters are reviewed for (001) and (111) oriented strained InGaAs QWs grown on GaAs substrates and their consequences for laser emission wavelength are investigated. Calculations are presented which show that a significant fraction of the piezoelectric field remains unscreened at laser threshold in (111) lasers, which, together with decreased HH 1 -HH 2 separation, adversely affect the laser threshold characteristics in comparison to (001) oriented strained lasers...|$|R

40|$|Being {{insulating}} in the bulk, topological insulators (Tis) possess topologically protected surface {{states with}} a helical spin texture within the bulk band gap. Unfortunately, conventional binary TIs exhibit high intrinsic defect densities, pushing the Fermi level in the bulk conduction or <b>valence</b> <b>band,</b> making them metallic. Therefore, the intrinsic disorder makes the utilization of the pure topologically protected surface states difficult. New methods will be presented in order to counteract the disorder and tune the TI, especially the Dirac point. Two different approaches are used. The first employs the intrinsic electrical field of p- and n-type TIs in a heterostructure resulting {{in the creation of}} a topological p-n junction. Thus the electrical field of the buried p-n junction tunes the band structure at the surface, depending on the thickness of the top TI layer in the heterostructure. The second approach uses the alloying of n- and p-type doped TIs, leading to a TI with a Dirac point coinciding with the Fermi energy within 5 meV and being well apart from each bulk band. For both methods, the band structure is mapped by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In PCMs disorder plays also an important role. The highly disordered phase, i. e. the amorphous phase, can be switched within nano-seconds into the more ordered crystalline phase, accompanied by a change of the optical and electrical contrast. The second part of this thesis describes the electrical properties and the atomic structure of p-type PCMs. Firstly the PCM GeTe is investigated, exhibiting bulk bands with a giant Rashba-type spin splitting. The fact that this splitting results from ferroelectricity, leads to the possibility of changing the helicity of the Rashba-split bands by electric fields in a non-volatile fashion. Piezo force microscopy experiments on GeTe validate the ferroelectric behavior and determine the as-grown polarization. The Rashba-split bands are resolved in (spin polarized) ARPES measurements, confirming the existence of giant Rashba-split surface and bulk bands. The second investigated PCM is the technologically relevant PCM, Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST 225) in its meta-stable rock-salt phase. The 3 D structure of the upper <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> of GST 225 is mapped by ARPES with variable photon energy. An M-shaped top <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> revealing little dispersion in (111) direction and a hexagonal band shape in the k plane perpendicular to (111) is found being clearly distinct from the usually assumed isotropic, parabolic <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> centered <b>at</b> Γ. The <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> is about 100 meV below the Fermi level, but the disorder broadened tails of the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> cut the Fermi energy. These results are compared with magneto-transport experiments of the same type of epitaxial samples. It is shown that a simple band model can describe the main effects with an accuracy of about 50 %. Indications of a topological surface state are found by using spin analysis and two-photon excitation. Finally, STM and STS experiments are conducted on the surface of meta-stable GST 225, which are compared with DFT calculations of the relaxed surface structure. DFT and STM reveal an intact Te layer and detect the disordered subsurface layer made of Ge, Sb and vacancies. In addition, STS experiments find fluctuations of the electrostatic potential within the Te layer, which agrees with simulations of the fluctuation at the surface, using independently measured acceptor density of the material. DFT calculations observe tetrahedral and octahedral Ge-Te bonding configurations at the surface layers which is not yet observed in experiments...|$|R

Energy level alignment {{is an important}} factor in efficient charge transfer at an interface between two semiconductors. This topic is explored in model systems that are relevant to quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, inorganic semiconductor nanoparticles adsorbed on single crystal wide band gap oxide substrates, using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Cadmium selenide quantum dots are assembled on a ZnO (10 - 10) surface using 3 -mercaptopropionic acid linkers. The <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> of the CdSe quantum dots is found to be located at 1. 1 ± 0. 1 eV above the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> of ZnO, nearly independent of the size of the quantum dots (2. 1 - 4. 2 nm). This finding suggests that, upon adsorption, there is strong electronic interaction between CdSe quantum dots and the ZnO surface. As a result, varying the quantum dot size mainly tunes the alignment of the conduction band minimum of CdSe with respect to that of the ZnO surface. Sub-monolayer films of PbSe quantum dots are prepared on single crystal substrates, ZnO (10 - 10) and TiO 2 (110), and exposed to ligand solutions, either hydrazine or 1, 2 -ethanedithiol (EDT) in acetonitrile. Interfacial energy alignment is measured as a function of quantum dot size, substrate and ligand treatment. The affect of the ligand treatments on the energy alignment is substrate-dependent. The <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> of the dots is size-independent on ZnO due to strong electronic interactions with the substrate; in particular, EDT-treated films show significant enhancement of quantum dot <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> intensity due to electronic coupling with the ZnO surface. In contrast, the quantum dot <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> <b>maximum</b> is size-dependent and shows a smaller shift between ligand treatments for films on TiO 2, suggesting weaker quantum dot-substrate interactions. In most cases the measured alignment predicts that electron injection from a photoexcited PbSe quantum dot to either ZnO or TiO 2 will necessitate the involvement of higher-lying levels above the first excitonic transition...|$|R
