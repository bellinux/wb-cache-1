5|$|September 15, 2016 - Tropical Storm Julia {{passes to}} the south of the state and erratically drifts offshore. Parts of the state receive up to <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> rain. A state of {{emergency}} is declared in 11 counties.|$|E
5|$|Damage in the United States was considerable. California {{received}} record rainfall, {{with over}} <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> rain falling in some areas. Flooding caused catastrophic destruction to Ocotillo, and six people drowned. Flooding extended west; railway tracks were destroyed in Palm Desert and high winds and severe flooding {{were recorded in}} Arizona. Overall, the damage total was $160 million (1976 USD) and 12 deaths were attributed to the storm.|$|E

5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
5|$|As a disorganized {{tropical}} cyclone {{in the northeastern}} Caribbean, Rafael produced major flooding across the region. As much as <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> rain fell across portions of the Lesser Antilles, causing mudslides, landslides, and river flooding. In addition, the heavy rains led to significant crop loss. Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin, while tropical storm-force gusts occurred widespread. Lightning activity {{as a result of}} heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages. One fatality occurred when a woman in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to drive her car across a flooded roadway. As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane, light rainfall was recorded. Gusts over 50mph (85km/h) left hundreds of houses without electricity. Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia, while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris, but overall, damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|In the Summer of 1999, a {{group of}} volunteers worked to restore and clean up the {{cemetery}} {{that led to a}} ceremony in October 1999 with more than 60 people in attendance. The article in The Day highlighted the difficulty in finding the cemetery which is located {{on the banks of the}} Pachaug River, in the village of Glasgo, located in the town of Griswold. Iva Arpin said that the town would repair the stone walls and that the Children of the American Revolution would return in the spring to continue their work on the cemetery. In 2002, the cemetery had undergone a significant restoration which included the unearthing and accounting for all the burial markers that had been strewn about the grounds. Arpin noted that some of the stones showed signs of vandalism. The Day described how some of the marker stones and monuments were covered in nearly <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> pine needles and that the roots had uprooted the anchor stones causing the headstones to fall and break.|$|E

60|$|What, then, are the {{comparative}} weights of these substances? I have a table here which will shew you the proportion which their weights bear to each other. I {{have taken a}} pint and <b>a</b> cubic <b>foot</b> as the measures, and have placed opposite to them the respective figures. A pint measure of this hydrogen weighs three-quarters of our smallest weight (a grain), and <b>a</b> cubic <b>foot</b> weighs one-twelfth <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ounce; whereas a pint of water weighs 8,750 grains, and <b>a</b> cubic <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> water weighs almost 1,000 ounces. You see, therefore, what a vast difference there is between the weight <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cubic <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> water and <b>a</b> cubic <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen.|$|R
5|$|October 29, 2012– Hurricane Sandy makes {{landfall}} {{north of}} the state. However, due to the tremendous size of the storm, its effects were felt all over Maryland. During {{the peak of the}} storm, 60mph sustained winds were felt from Frederick, Maryland eastward. However, power outages were not widespread and any problems were solved quickly due to better preparation. Heavy rain affected the state, with up to <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> rain falling in some spots. Storm surge was also a large factor along the beaches, washing out many piers and some boardwalks along Ocean City. Hurricane Sandy is the deadliest tropical cyclone to affect the state, causing 11 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its effects}} in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, only one person was directly killed from the storm there; a man drowned off the coast when he fell off his sailboat near Fort Morgan, Alabama. One indirect casualty also occurred in the area, when a man {{had a heart attack}} while trying to secure a boat off the Alabama coast during the storm. Numerous roads became flooded and impassable for several days, south and along I-10 in Mobile, south and central Choctaw, and Baldwin counties. Along the Fowl and Fish rivers, in Mobile and Baldwin counties respectively, significant damage to homes occurred due to flooding. Most roads on Dauphin Island were flooded in over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> water. A few homes were close to falling into Mobile Bay, and one home had to be moved backwards towards land to prevent its destruction. At the peak of the storm in Alabama, at least 44,000people were without power in Mobile and Baldwin counties. In rural Choctaw County, north of Mobile, several families were rescued from flooded roads and trapped cars. The majority of houses and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings from the western shore of Mobile Bay, and from Fort Morgan east to Orange Beach, had roof damage. $ (1997USD, $ USD) in total property damage occurred in Alabama, in addition to pecan and pine tree damage costing $ (1997USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached {{to the inside of the}} exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E

25|$|The {{heaviest}} snow in Maryland {{fell from}} the northern suburbs of Washington, D.C., to the Baltimore area. These areas overwhelmingly saw over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> snow. Snowfall rates of 2–3inches (5–8cm) per hour were common, and thundersnow occurred. Snowfall amounts of up to 21inches (53cm) were reported in Columbia, 13.1inches (33.3cm) in Baltimore, 17inches (43cm) in Catonsville, and a foot (30.5cm) in Potomac. This was the area's heaviest snow since the North American blizzard of 2003. Lesser amounts occurred in western and southern parts of the state.|$|E
25|$|The North American Blizzard of 2006 was a nor'easter {{that began}} {{on the evening of}} February 11, 2006. It dumped heavy snow across the Mid-Atlantic and New England states, from Virginia to Maine through the early evening of February 12, and ended in Atlantic Canada on February 13. The major cities from Baltimore to Boston {{received}} at least <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> snow, with a second-highest amount of 26.9inches (68.3cm) in New York City, the (at the time) most since at least 1869, the start of record keeping, only broken by the January 2016 United States blizzard nearly 10 years later.|$|E
25|$|As {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} Northeastern United States and {{portions}} of Ontario and Quebec on December 2, six inches (152mm) of snow fell in portions of central New York, while three inches (76mm) of snow fell across New Jersey with a dusting in several other areas. A second band of precipitation during the late hours produced areas of rain and freezing rain (of up to four-tenths of an inch of ice) across several valley areas from New York to Pennsylvania, with rain further {{to the east and}} south, while locally over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> snow fell across parts of Upstate New York, Vermont and New Hampshire, causing several accidents which forced the shutdown of northbound Interstate 89.|$|E

25|$|As {{the storm}} redeveloped off the Atlantic Coast on December 3 and 4, it gave {{another round of}} heavy and mixed {{precipitation}} for New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Areas of northern and eastern New Brunswick received over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> snow, causing the city of Moncton to shut down all services, while several flights from airports in Moncton, Saint John, Fredericton and Halifax were cancelled. In Fredericton, a unique phenomenon consisting of blowing and heavy snow along with winds produced several giant snowballs, called snowrollers, across several front lawns. About 24,000 homes in New Brunswick, 8,000 in Nova Scotia and 14,500 in Prince Edward Island were without power due to the snow, mixing and strong winds.|$|E
25|$|On November 19, 1981, a rapid {{accumulation}} of over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> snow caused {{the roof to}} collapse, requiring it to be re-inflated. It deflated the following winter on December 30, 1982, again because of a tear caused by heavy snow. This was {{four days before the}} Vikings played the Dallas Cowboys in the last regular-season game of the 1982 NFL season. In the spring following that same winter, on April 14, 1983, the Metrodome roof deflated because of a tear caused by a late-season heavy snow, and the scheduled Twins' game with the California Angels was postponed. On April 26, 1986, the Metrodome roof suffered a slight tear because of high winds, causing a nine-minute delay {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning versus the Angels; however, the roof did not deflate.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} rainfall {{in the history of}} the United States has occurred in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. On April 5, 1926, a rain gauge in the San Gabriels collected one inch in one minute. In January, 1969, more water fell on the San Gabriels in nine days than New York City sees in a year. In February 1978, almost <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> rain fell in 24 hours, and, in one blast, an inch and a half in five minutes. This storm caused massive debris flows throughout the region, one of them unearthing the corpses in the Verdugo Hills Cemetery and depositing them in the town below.
