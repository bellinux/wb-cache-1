Although comparable in many aspects, IFRS and US GAAP still differ in accounting for some transactions.

The results show that firms prefer that <b>accounting</b> <b>regime</b> that offers them the largest flexibility (i. e. less disclosure or more measurement options) on relevant accounting items (e. g.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the {{exchange}} rate regime and the capital <b>account</b> <b>regime</b> are among the core macro economic policy decisions for developing countries, with important repercussions for a country's macro economic stability, ability to attract foreign capital, and international trade. Existing literature has considered the determinants of these decisions, taking the capital <b>account</b> <b>regime</b> as given when considering the exchange rate regime and vice versa. This paper provides an empirical analysis {{of the interaction between}} the two regime choices treating both as simultaneously endogenous. Using a panel data set for developing countries in the 1980 s and 1990 s, we estimate a simultaneous-equations panel mixed logit model for the joint determination of both choices. We find strong influences from the official, de jure exchange rate <b>regime</b> on capital <b>account</b> policies, but only weak feedback effects.

40|$|Purpose: Recently, magic {{has been}} given {{increasing}} attention by psychologists for what it can reveal about how the human cognitive system works. This paper examines whether these same cognitive processes are at play in another arena, specifi cally, the presentation of financial accounting� information. Approach: The authors reviewed the fi ndings of cognitive scientists from their studies of magicians and applied these to the activities of professional accountants. Findings: Specifi c cognitive processes which magicians and accountants take advantage of, explicitly for one and implicitly for the other, are the same: good continuation, habituation, and attentional capture. Value: Further research regarding such interactions between accounting and cognition has potential for {{enhancing our understanding of}} both. Certainly at this particular point in accounting history, as standard setters seem to be moving ever closer to implementing some version of a principles-based <b>accounting</b> <b>regime</b> versus our current rules-based <b>accounting</b> <b>regime,</b> it is worthwhile to contemplate the conscious and subconscious effects of cognitive processes on how individuals perceive financial information...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} aims {{to describe}} the Kosovo’s <b>accounting</b> <b>regime</b> by comparing its previous and present status which is developed a lot during recent years. The developments occurred {{because of the need}} to track and record accounting information in an efficient way toward the purpose of decreasing the violation of government regulations and increasing the consciousness of accountants in this field. Therefore it is crucial for the accounting system to function in an appropriate way, because it {{is directly related to the}} economical development and good organization of the financial market in the state of Kosovo. Since the state is still passing through the period of transition, many changes have occurred on the principles of the accounting system. The methodology used while making this research is the semi-structured interviewing. By this method the literature of Kosovo was reviewed and the results and findings are based on consultations with business firms, professionals at the field of accounting and also books related to accounting development. The final results obtained through this research clarify the situation of development of the accounting system in Kosovo and it explains that there is a huge difference between the previous and current accounting performance which is highly noticeable and that the present status is satisfactory.

We show that, for any network and any shock, the flow of losses generated with the mark-to-market rule is larger than the one generated by accounting at historical cost. This implies that a financial network is more exposed to default contagion, both in terms of scope and threshold of contagion, under the marking-to-market <b>accounting</b> <b>regime,</b> than with the historical cost regime. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} has implemented a reform of public financial management in {{a realm of}} government accounting. The current government <b>accounting</b> <b>regime</b> has met requirements of budget management. However, it provides very little information of financial position and performance. Furthermore, {{in the context of}} the increasing international integration and requirements of public sector management reform, the Vietnamese government accounting needs to be improved with applying full accrual accounting based on IPSAS standards. The IPSAS are encouraged by the IPSAS Board as well as international financial organizations. And many countries have adopted the IPSAS or are in a progress adapting them. The questions are that whether or not the Vietnamese government accounting should apply the IPSAS, and to what extent apply them in current conditions of Vietnam so as to make use of advantages and overcome challenges of the IPSAS. So the research aims to evaluatecomprehensively the usefulness and feasibility of the IPSAS for the Vietnamese government accounting and financial statements. The research uses qualitative methodology with research instruments namely data analysis and questionnaire. Types of documents will be analyzed including articles, papers, books of public financial management, public sector accounting and IPSAS standards, the current Vietnamese legislation involving public finance management, accounting regimes, reports of public financial management reform, and minutes of seminar. Questionnaire will be sent to regulators and lecturers relating the realm of government accounting in order to get data of opinions, perceptions of applying the IPSAS to the Vietnamese government accounting and financial reporting.
