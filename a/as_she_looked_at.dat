Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have}} been an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all."

60|$|This time he {{does not}} touch her. But his face looks so wicked and menacing, as he stands leaning against the sun-dial-setting, as it were, his black mark upon the very face of day—that her flight is arrested by horror <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
