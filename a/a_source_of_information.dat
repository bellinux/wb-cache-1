5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived, because of the destruction of its monasteries and the disappearance of the two East Anglian sees that occurred as the result of Viking raids and settlement. The main primary sources for information about Anna's life and reign are the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), completed in Northumbria by Bede in 731, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, initially written in the ninth century, which mentions Anna's death. The mediaeval work known as the Liber Eliensis, written in Ely in the twelfth century, is <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about Anna's daughters Æthelthryth and Seaxburh, and also describes Anna's death and burial.|$|E
5|$|In general, Geographia Neoteriki, {{was welcomed}} with enthusiasm by western {{intellectual}} circles. Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, {{used it as a}} textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and used it as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> The book also enjoyed some popularity in the non Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks used it as a model.|$|E
5|$|Recuerdos de Provincia (Recollections of a Provincial Past), 1850. In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book is substantial. The accounts, whether all true or false against him, are <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to write Recuerdos as he is then able to object and rectify into what he creates as a 'true account' of autobiography.|$|E

5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Greek {{gazetteer}}s {{are known}} to have existed since the Hellenistic era.

The geographer Stephanus of Byzantium wrote a geographical dictionary (which currently has missing parts) in the sixth century which influenced later European compilers.

25|$|Various RuneScape fansites {{have been}} {{established}} by players, which are <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about the game. In {{the early days of}} RuneScape, the official website had a page which listed links to several fansites, but has since been removed. In order to provide players with an alternative, Jagex introduced the Knowledge Base, which offers information on gameplay, the main RuneScape rules, and account security. On 22 November 2011, the Knowledge Base was converted into a community-editable wiki. For account security reasons, Jagex discourages the discussion of fansites within the game or the official forums – and a rule specifically prohibits sharing web addresses. A major fansite has criticised Jagex for not recognising fansites' contributions to the development of its game. However, as a result of announcements made in 2009, Jagex has promised to increase communication with fansites.|$|E

500|$|Chetro Ketl's {{purpose is}} widely debated but many archeologists believe the {{building}} {{was a place of}} large-scale ceremony that held an important position within the larger Chacoan system. It may have been occupied primarily by groups of priests and, during times of ritual, pilgrims from outlying communities. Archeologist Stephen H. Lekson believes Chetro Ketl was a palace inhabited by Chacoan royalty, and the scale of its construction was motivated by what architects call [...] "massing": building imposing structures with the intent to impress onlookers. The building has deteriorated significantly since its rediscovery in the early 19th century, and its usefulness as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about Chacoan culture is slowly diminishing.|$|E
