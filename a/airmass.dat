5|$|On June21, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. It entered the eastern Pacific on July10, and shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase {{a day later}} as a result. Tracking westward, the wave gradually became better organized; by 1200UTC on July14, the disturbance acquired enough organization to be upgraded to {{a tropical}} depression. Within an environment of moderate wind shear, the low-level center quickly became poorly defined as convection dissipated. Turning west-northwest on July15, the depression entered cooler waters and an increasingly stable <b>airmass,</b> causing the system to degenerate into a remnant low by 0000UTC the following day.

5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist <b>airmass,</b> so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa and moved westward across the Atlantic before entering the eastern Pacific on October8. Despite strong easterly wind shear, the system acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression at 0000UTC on October15. Within a broad cyclonic gyre, the system moved erratically, first drifting south then east-northeast and eventually northwest. Early on October16, the system briefly intensified into a tropical storm as a convective band wrapped around the circulation, but continued strong shear caused associated convection to dissipate and the system weakened to a tropical depression by 1800UTC. After intensifying back to a tropical storm the following day, a brief reprieve in harsh upper-level winds allowed Kiko to reach its peak intensity with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 991mb (hPa; 29.27inHg). An increase in southerly shear and entrance into a more stable <b>airmass</b> caused the system to weaken to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on October23; the system degenerated into a remnant low 24 hours later. The remnant low tracked west before turning north and eventually dissipated early on October27.|$|E

Tropospheric ozone was determined from GOME data using the Tropospheric Excess Method (TEM). In the tropical Pacific a significant seasonal variation is detected. Tropospheric excess ozone is enhanced during the biomass burning season from September to November due to outflow from the continents. In September 1999 GOME data reveal an episode of increased excess ozone columns over Tahiti (18. 0 ° S; 149. 0 ° W) (Eastern Pacific) compared to Am.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of unusually high values of ozone and N 2 O {{in the middle}} stratosphere that were observed by the airborne submillimeter radiometer ASUR in the Arctic. The observations {{took place in the}} meteorological situation of a major stratospheric warming that occurred in mid-January 2003 and was dominated by a wave 2 event. On 23  January 2003 the observed N 2 O and O 3 mixing ratios around 69 ° N in the middle stratosphere reached maximum values of ~ 190  ppb and ~ 10  ppm, respectively. The similarities of these N 2 O profiles in a potential temperature range between 800 and 1200  K with N 2 O observations around 20 ° N on 1  March 2003 by the same instrument suggest that the observed Arctic <b>airmasses</b> were transported from the tropics quasi-isentropically. This is confirmed by 5 -day back trajectory calculations which indicate that the <b>airmasses</b> between about 800 and 1000  K had been located around 20 ° N 3 – 5 days prior to the measurement in the Arctic. Calculations with a linearized ozone chemistry model along calculated as well as idealized trajectories, initialized with the low-latitude ASUR ozone measurements, give reasonable agreement with the Arctic ozone measurement by ASUR.

25|$|The {{tropical}} maritime <b>airmass</b> (MT) {{is responsible}} for Nigeria's rainy season. This wind (the tropical maritime <b>airmass)</b> invades the country from February {{in the southern part}} of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country, reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June. Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat, of the tropical continental <b>airmass</b> (CT) known as the harmattan. The northward retreat of the tropical continental <b>airmass</b> (CT), is caused by the sun's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere.

The Tropical continental <b>airmass</b> (CT) begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental <b>airmass</b> (CT) which constitutes the main layer of air above the land.

40|$|Values of the tritium {{concentration}} in precipitation collected at Ottawa in 1961 fluctuate {{by as much}} as a factor of 3 from one measurement to the next a few days later. The first attempt to determine what meteorological factors could be responsible for these fluctuations was to sort the storms for April and May 1961 into two categories; those predominantly continuous and those predominantly showery precipitation, using both constant altitude radar pictures and hourly precipitation records. There was a slight tendency for the higher tritium concentrations to occur in continuous precipitation. Height/time diagrams showing the positions of the various <b>airmasses</b> over Ottawa revealed that the highest tritium concentrations occurred when maritime arctic air extended from the ground to the tropopause. On occasions with mA air at the ground and other <b>airmasses</b> above it, the measured tritium concentration was approximately proportional to the depth of mA air traversed by the precipitation. The lowest tritium concentration was measured in a storm wholly contained in mT air. Air mass trajectories confirmed that the higher concentrations were measured in precipitation which had fallen through air of arctic origin with an arctic trajectory than through air of tropical origin...|$|R

In São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the identification of layers for which ozone enhancements were due to stratospheric intrusions was performed based on potential vorticity (PV). Layers with absolute PV above 2 PVU were considered, allowing a 15 hPa threshold.

Observations were made during approximately 85 h of flying time between 17 July and 17 August 2006, above an area between 4 ° N and 18 ° N and 3 ° W and 4 ° E, encompassing ocean, mosaic forest, and the Sahel desert. High time resolution observations of counts at mass to charge (m/z) ratios of 42, 59, 69, 71, and 79 were used to calculate mixing ratios of acetonitrile, acetone, isoprene, the sum of methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein, and benzene respectively using laboratory-derived humidity-dependent calibration factors. Strong spatial associations between vegetation and isoprene and its oxidation products were observed in the boundary layer, consistent with biogenic emissions followed by rapid atmospheric oxidation. Acetonitrile, benzene, and acetone were all enhanced in <b>airmasses</b> which had been heavily influenced by biomass burning. Benzene and acetone were also elevated in <b>airmasses</b> with urban influence from cities such as Lagos, Cotonou, and Niamey.

The central focus of the experiment was a two-week deployment of the UK BAe- 146 - 301 Atmospheric Research Aircraft (ARA) over eastern Canada. The planned July 2010 deployment of the ARA was postponed by 12 months because of activities related to the dispersal of material emitted by the Eyjafjallajokull volcano. However, most other planned model and measurement activities, including ground-based measurements at the Dalhousie University Ground Station (DGS), enhanced ozonesonde launches, and measurements at the Pico Atmospheric Observatory in the Azores, went ahead and constituted phase A of the experiment. Phase B of BORTAS in July 2011 included the same measurements, but included the ARA, special satellite observations and a more comprehensive measurement suite at the DGS. Integrating these data helped us to describe pyrogenic plumes from wildfires on {{a wide spectrum of}} temporal and spatial scales.
