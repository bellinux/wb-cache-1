5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
25|$|However, {{they were}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> their account was showing losses. McNulty {{reassured}} them, but their misgivings increased. When they closed the account early in 1983, {{it was nearly}} empty. Their trading losses reached $350,000 ($ in modern dollars) and commissions accounted for the rest.|$|E
25|$|This {{coalition}} against radicalism lasted until 1868, when insurmountable financial difficulties, {{turmoil in the}} streets and Parliament, and a succession of incompetent governments once again forced Saldanha to impose his will. Along with the army, he established a supra-party dictatorship in 1870 in order to impose political reforms, but he was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they had failed.|$|E

I thought that perhaps it might suit your views, {{and it would have}} {{simplified}} your future arrangements. But as to that, of course, while you are in New Zealand, I shall be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> By-the-way, it is understood that you come to stay with us for a few months at Government House, before you hunt up your cousin." ...|$|R

25|$|One {{study done}} in Shanghai had {{two types of}} hippocampal {{neuronal}} cultures: In one culture, the neuron was grown from a layer of astrocytes and the other culture was not in contact with any astrocytes, but they were instead fed a glial conditioned medium (GCM), which inhibits {{the rapid growth of}} cultured astrocytes in the brains of rats in most cases. In their results they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> astrocytes had a direct role in Long-term potentiation with the mixed culture (which is the culture that was grown from a layer of astrocytes) but not in GCM cultures.|$|E

But unlike {{so many of the}} Brethren, he was flexible and adaptable, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the future for Jamaica lay not in plunder or pillage but in peaceful trade.... He was also an adept politician and held office longer than any of the governors of his time.|$|E
50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century trained {{judgment}} supplemented mechanical objectivity as scientists began to recognize that, in order for images or data to be of any use, scientists needed <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> scientifically; <b>that</b> is, <b>to</b> interpret images or data and identify and group them according to particular professional training, rather than to simply depict them mechanically. Objectivity now came to involve a combination of trained judgment and mechanical objectivity.|$|R

500|$|In a twist from expectation, Eliot's poem {{suggests}} that old men {{should go out}} and explore. He warns that people should trade wisdom for pointless experience and argues that men should explore human experience itself. This concept is hinted of in The Waste Land and draws from the ideas within Dante's Convivio. Dante argues that old men are supposed to return to God and describes the process in a way similar to the travels of Odysseus. Unlike Homer's hero, Dante argues that men should not travel in the material world but in the spiritual world. Both Dante and Eliot put forth a similar view to St. Augustine when they focus on internal travels. Through these travels, mankind is able to have faith in salvation and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{there is more to}} the world than darkness. Eliot explains within the poem that we are all interconnected through time and that we must realize this. Only through this realization is mankind able to understand the truth of the universe. This, in turn, would allow humanity to break free from the burden of time. As Russel Kirk explains: [...] "That end, for those who apprehend a reality superior to 'birth, copulation, and death'—a reality transcending the rhythms of physical nature—is to know God and enjoy Him forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're not going to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantages}} of this nomination were obvious and, as this system operated for some time, {{those who were}} endowed with insight and wisdom were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Mirza Yahya was only a figurehead, {{and that it was}} the guiding hand of Bahá'u'lláh alone that was unobtrusively directing the affairs of the Bábí community after the martyrdom of the Báb." ...|$|E
50|$|In July 2005 a defence witness, General Božidar Delić, {{claimed to}} {{demonstrate}} with a topographical {{map of the}} area that Ashdown {{could not have been}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the areas <b>that</b> he claimed <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> as hills, mountains and thick woods obstructed his view.|$|R
2500|$|On June 8, 2008, {{days before}} the first few reviews for the film came online, Shyamalan told the New York Daily News: [...] "We're making an {{excellent}} B movie, that's our goal". Some critics enjoyed it because of this. Glenn Whipp said, [...] "Tamping down the self-seriousness in favor of some horrific silliness, M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening plays as a genuinely enjoyable B-movie for anyone inclined (or <b>able)</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it <b>that</b> way".|$|R
5000|$|Rather {{than being}} a {{conventional}} narrative, Selected {{is presented as a}} set of notes and discussion questions from an art museum's posthumous exhibition of the paintings of Theresa Rosenberg Latimer — a woman who was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> things <b>that</b> other people were not. Schneyer has stated that Selected is about ghosts, and that the narrator is intended to be a [...] "curator who (...) entirely misunderstand(s) the story that was being told by the paintings." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Hauerwas, a “good {{death is}} a death that we can prepare for through living because we are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> death is but a {{necessary}} correlative to a good life." [...] A long life may give a person more {{of a chance to}} have a good death because he {{may be able to get}} himself morally in line during that time period, but it is also possible to die well quickly if you have lived morally. A good death also requires that the death be morally in proportion with the way one lived and was sustained, and occurs in a way that allows those caring for us to see that they are sustaining us.|$|E
2500|$|In the chase, Robyn {{was injured}} after {{stepping}} on a rake and Lofty {{had to decide}} to either [...] "leave her and run, or do the right thing"; Lofty chose to help Robyn and Barry explained {{that it was in}} Lofty's nature to stay and help Robyn. Mead said Lofty stayed because he was [...] "a good guy". Because he helped Robyn, Lofty missed an interview at a local hospital. After discovering this, Robyn speaks to management about Lofty and he is offered a vacant nursing position at the hospital. Mead explained that Robyn is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Lofty is a good person and so, as well as helping him receive a job, she offers him a place to live.|$|E
2500|$|Monday 25 September, {{was bright}} and cloudless, with a ground haze but reports from {{observers}} in contact patrol aircraft were notably accurate, as the infantry advanced to their objectives on the Fourth Army front, from Morval to Gueudecourt and around Flers. Observers in reconnaissance aircraft located [...] artillery batteries; [...] engaged and [...] by zone calls. At [...] observers watched the advance to the final objective and after twenty-one minutes, {{almost all of it}} was reported captured. A map compiled from air reports was later shown to be more accurate than infantry progress reports. The ground not taken near Morval fell in the evening, completing the capture of the ground on the main ridge, making Combles untenable, although British balloon observers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the French advance from the south had been delayed. There was extensive German air activity during the day but most aircraft flew above , which few British aircraft could reach.|$|E
5000|$|The {{end of this}} verse closely {{parallels}} the end of Matthew 6:4. This verse adds {{the mention of the}} omnipresent God being in secret, as well as being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all <b>that</b> is in secret. As with Matthew 6:4, most scholars feel that [...] "openly" [...] is an erroneous addition {{at the end of this}} verse. It is included in the 1599 Geneva Bible, but omitted from the English Standard Version and the New International Version.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that is {{something}} anyhow," [...] Jim said as Arthur leapt down again. [...] "We shall be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any men-of-war <b>that</b> come in, and form some idea {{as to what is}} going on. How thick is the wall?" [...] Jim went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{fence is}} enchanted," [...] said the turtle, {{as if he}} knew she was looking at it; [...] "and no fairy can pass it, because the power to prevent it has been given to the giant. But a mortal has never been {{forbidden}} to pass the fence, for no one ever supposed that a mortal would come here or be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. <b>That</b> is the reason I have brought you to this place, and the reason why you alone are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help me." ...|$|R
2500|$|In such cases, {{there are}} strong policy {{considerations}} supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair {{if a person is}} kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts {{to be sure that the}} disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, [...] "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust".|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the film's denouement, {{we realize}} that the real {{kidnapper}} was Jack's new wife, Amaya, {{with the help of}} her cousin, the Sheriff in Del Rio (who throughout the film appeared as if he was trying to help Jack and that he believed Jack's innocence). [...] We learn that the flashback we have seen throughout the film—of Jack/Roberto strangling a man at Katie's behest as she looks on in delight—has new meaning. [...] The man Roberto strangled was Amaya's father. [...] Worse still, Amaya was in the room with Roberto and Katie when they strangled her father, hiding under the bed. [...] Amaya's father was a degenerate gambler who owed a large debt to Katie and the Mexican Mob, and when he could not pay, Katie had Roberto kill him. [...] Amaya witnessed all of this. [...] We realize that she then set in motion an elaborate plan to emigrate to the United States and marry Jack/Roberto in order to punish him for murdering her father. [...] It was Amaya and the Sheriff who kidnapped Toby. [...] Amaya and the Sheriff set fire to the room where Jack is (the same room where he killed Amaya's father many years ago). [...] But Jack is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Toby is tied up on the bed in the room. [...] He manages to free her and they escape the fire unhurt.|$|E

50|$|Investors in {{the program}} {{selected}} the Trade Leaders they wanted to invest in, allocate their funds, and build Trade Leader portfolios. Whenever a Trade Leader executed a trade, it was mirrored in the investor’s own brokerage account. The investors were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> every trade <b>that</b> was made. The model {{was similar to that}} of a stock mutual fund.|$|R
50|$|The game {{centers around}} Tommynaut, a space {{explorer}} who crash-lands {{on a planet}} called Spiro 5 and ends up locked inside a fortress called Armikrog. Tommynaut is accompanied by his talking, sometimes flying, dog Beak-Beak, who is color blind, so the environment turns black-and-white when he’s selected, but he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> special wavelengths <b>that</b> Tommynaut can’t.|$|R

6000|$|... "Come along, then," [...] she said, {{and picking}} him up she {{placed him in}} the pocket of her apron, for she knew he would be unable to walk down the flight of stairs that led to the laundry. He was very {{comfortable}} in the pocket, which was just deep enough to allow his head and shoulders to project from the top. Therefore he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all <b>that</b> was going on while the lady was at work. He watched her wash and rinse the clothes, and was greatly interested in the operation, as it was all new to him.|$|R
6000|$|He submitted, and {{she went}} to meet the intruder. Her quiet, {{authoritative}} voice could be heard saying: [...] "Mrs. Ollnee is not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any one. <b>That</b> cruel and false article of yesterday has completely upset her.--No, I am only her friend and nurse. I have nothing to say except that the article in the Star was false and malignant." ...|$|R
5000|$|Foley stated: [...] "Once I saw Anton {{lying there}} dead, {{it was like}} {{everything}} had changed. The whole world has changed. I don't even know that I felt some of the blows." [...] Gillis said, [...] "We all glanced down at him as we were being taken by, and I saw him just lying {{in a pool of}} blood. And then we were put into the truck and our heads were pushed down. We weren't <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> anything <b>that</b> happened after that to him."
