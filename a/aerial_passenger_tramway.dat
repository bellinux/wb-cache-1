The original tramway was replaced by a new 80-passenger tram in 1979. Construction and testing of the new tram were completed in February 1980, and the red and yellow tram cars are still running year-round today.|$|R

2500|$|Cannon Mountain was {{the site}} of the first <b>passenger</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>tramway</b> in North America. From its {{construction}} in 1938 to its 1980 retirement, the first tram carried 6,581,338 passengers up the [...] route to near the summit of Cannon Mountain. On May 24, 1980, the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway II was dedicated. Alexander Bright, a skier involved in developing the sport in the area, conceived the idea of building a tramway in New Hampshire during his trip to Europe {{as a member of the}} US Olympic Ski Team in 1933. In Europe, Bright had seen passenger-carrying tramways and recognized that building one in New Hampshire could foster the growth of skiing and summer tourism in the White Mountains. Bright persuaded L.R. Batemen of the American Steel and Wire Company to conduct a preliminary survey to locate a suitable site for a tramway and to estimate construction costs. In November 1933, the first physical survey of Franconia Notch was made by Batemen, E.J. Lloyd and Roland Peabody of Franconia, who was called in as an advisor because of his knowledge of the area and his enthusiasm for recreation development in the White Mountains. Bright's idea appealed to an increasing numbers of people and groups associate with winter sports, and Peabody, through his enthusiasm, aroused the support of the New Hampshire legislature.|$|R

25|$|In {{the twentieth}} century street <b>passenger</b> <b>tramways</b> built up in Newcastle and Gateshead, and in 1920 {{agreement}} was reached to connect the two systems by running across the High Level Bridge. This was implemented in 1923.|$|R
50|$|The last train ran on 31 May 1997 and {{the line}} closed on 2 June 1997. Most of the route was {{incorporated}} into the Tramlink network, a street <b>passenger</b> <b>tramway</b> and light rail system in Croydon and the surrounding area, opening in May 2000.|$|R
50|$|In {{most cases}} the early designs were {{unsuccessful}} technically, {{but in the early}} years of the twentieth century, street-running <b>passenger</b> <b>tramways</b> started to use small steam engines to draw tramcars, replacing the customary horse traction. In many cases the tramways soon adopted electric traction instead, and the attractiveness of the cheap and frequent conveyance abstracted business from the railways in urban areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{sections were}} laid {{without the need}} for a Parliamentary Act, as a private venture, {{and the name of the}} lines is not defined; some writers refer to them as Treffry's Railway and other variants of the title. The word tramway here refers to a lightly constructed and informally operated railway, and is not to be confused with urban street-running <b>passenger</b> <b>tramways.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>passenger</b> ropeways {{were known}} in Asia {{well before the}} 17th century for {{crossing}} chasms in mountainous regions. Men would traverse a woven fiber line hand over hand. Evolutionary refinement added a harness or basket to also transport cargo.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the Colorado <b>Passenger</b> <b>Tramway</b> Safety Board began to {{question}} the safety of Yan’s lifts. They learned that Mr. Kunczynski, in his drive to build affordable ski lifts, regularly sent steel parts to be welded together in ski area parking lots. The Board alleged that Mr. Kunczynski’s lifts were unsafe. The ski industry blasted the Board and continued to install Yan lifts.|$|R
50|$|A <b>passenger</b> <b>tramway</b> began {{operating}} on 16 June 1909, making Rockhampton the only provincial city in Queensland {{to have a}} street tramway. Purrey steam trams ran {{on a number of}} routes throughout South Rockhampton, totalling 10 km of track. The discomfort of passengers riding in steam trams in a tropical climate in part led to their demise in 1939, replaced by a bus network run by the City Council.|$|R
50|$|The {{very first}} {{passenger}} tram (streetcar) was the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, in Wales, UK. The Mumbles Railway Act {{was passed by}} the British Parliament in 1804, and this first horse-drawn <b>passenger</b> <b>tramway</b> (which acted like streetcars in the US some 30 years later) started operating in 1807. It was worked by steam from 1877, and then, from 1929, by very large (106-seater) electric tramcars, until closure in 1960.|$|R
50|$|In 1911 the {{question}} of passenger operation on the line was revived, stimulated by {{the opening of a}} street-running <b>passenger</b> <b>tramway</b> in Llanelly. Now it was considered feasible, and indeed the L&MMR had been running workmen's trains north of Sandy for some time. However once again nothing was done. In 1920 a GWR steam railmotor, no 75, was run in clearance trials over the line, but again this led to no progress. The workmen's trains continued as before.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of <b>passenger</b> <b>tramways</b> in the Edinburgh conurbation {{in the early}} years of the twentieth century eroded the suburban railway business, and when economies were required during World War I, Powderhall and Leith Walk stations were closed at the beginning of 1917. Powderhall never reopened, but Leith Walk opened again on 1 February 1919. The tramways were electrified and unified in 1920, and the competition from them assumed new levels, further reducing the ridership of suburban lines.|$|R
25|$|To {{build the}} final <b>passenger</b> <b>tramway</b> {{it was first}} {{necessary}} to construct a freight tramway to carry materials. Carrying cement and materials by backpack, four dozen men completed the formidable task in December. Construction of the tramway continued through the winter, with almost all the work, pouring 32 carloads of cement, assembling 232 tons of steel and four miles (6km) of cable, done by hand. It was considered an outstanding engineering feat of the period. On June 28, 1938, after nine months of construction and {{one year after the}} passage of legislation, North America’s first aerial tramway was dedicated.|$|R
