Elevation of phase II detoxification enzymes {{might be one}} of the mechanisms leading to cancer prevention. We investigated the effects of dietary <b>anticarcinogens</b> and NSAIDs on rat gastrointestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diets of Wistar rats were supplemented with oltipraz, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), sulforaphane analogue compound- 30, indole- 3 -carbinol, D-limonene, relafen, indomethacin, ibuprofen, piroxicam, acetyl salicylic acid or sulindac. Hepatic and intestinal UGT enzyme activities were quantified by using 4 -nitrophenol and 4 -methylumbelliferone as substrates. RESULTS: Compound- 30, D-limonene, indomethacin, ibuprofen or sulindac enhanced proximal small intestinal UGT activities. Only compound- 30 was able to induce mid- and distal small intestinal UGT activities. Large intestinal UGT activities were increased by ibuprofen and sulindac, whereas oltipraz, PEITC and D-limonene gave enhanced hepatic UGT activities. CONCLUSION: Mainly rat proximal small intestinal and hepatic UGT enzyme activities were induced by dietary <b>anticarcinogens</b> or NSAIDs.

40|$|Carcinogenesis {{is blocked}} by an {{extraordinary}} variety of agents belonging to many different classes [...] e. g., phenolic antioxidants, azo dyes, polycyclic aromatics, flavonoids, coumarins, cinnamates, indoles, isothiocyanates, 1, 2 -dithiol- 3 -thiones, and thiocarbamates. The only known common property of these <b>anticarcinogens</b> is {{their ability to}} elevate in animal cells the activities of enzymes that inactivate the reactive electrophilic forms of carcinogens. Structure-activity studies on the induction of quinone reductase [NAD(P) H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC 1. 6. 99. 2] and glutathione S-transferases have revealed that many anti-carcinogenic enzyme inducers contain a distinctive and hitherto unrecognized chemical feature (or acquire this feature after metabolism) that regulates the synthesis of these protective enzymes. The inducers are Michael reaction acceptors characterized by olefinic (or acetylenic) bonds that are rendered electrophilic (positively charged) by conjugation with electron-withdrawing substrates. The potency of inducers parallels their efficiency in Michael reactions. Many inducers are also substrates for glutathione S-transferases, which is further evidence for their electrophilicity. These generalizations have not only provided mechanistic insight into the perplexing question of how such seemingly unrelated <b>anticarcinogens</b> induce chemoprotective enzymes, but also {{have led to the}} prediction of the structures of inducers with potential chemoprotective activity...|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{components}} {{express a}} wide range of activities that can affect carcinogenesis. Naturally occurring substances in foods have been shown in laboratory experiments to serve as dietary antimutagens, either as bioantimutagens or as desmutagens. Dietary desmutagens may function as chemical inactivaters, enzymatic inducers, scavengers, or antioxidants. Dietary components may also act later in the carcinogenic process as tumor growth suppressors. Examples of dietary factors acting in each of these stages of carcinogenesis are presented, and potential <b>anticarcinogens</b> such as the carotenoids, tocopherols, phenolic compounds, glucosinolates, metal-binding proteins, phytoestrogens, and conjugated linoleic acid are discussed. Individual foods typically contain multiple potential <b>anticarcinogens.</b> Many of these substances can influence carcinogenesis through more than one mechanism. Some substances exhibit both anticarcinogenic and carcinogenic activity in vitro, depending on conditions. Epidemiologic research indicates that high fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with lower cancer risk. Little research has focused on the effects of single substances or single foods in man. Realization of the potential of foodborne substances to reduce the human burden of cancer will only be achieved with better measurement of dietary exposures and funding of multidisciplinary research in this area commensurate with it...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{selenium}} (Se) is a known <b>anticarcinogen,</b> {{little is}} known regarding how Se affects other nutritional qualities in crops. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) was supplied with 0 − 50 μM selenate and analyzed for elemental composition and antioxidant compounds. When supplied at low doses (5 and 10 μM) via the roots, Se stimulated the synthesis of phenolic compounds in leaves and reduced the levels of Mo, Fe, Mn, and Cu in roots. At higher doses (25 and 50 μM Se) leaf glutathione levels were 3 − 5 -fold enhanced. Supply of selenate via foliar spray (0, 2, or 20 mg Se plant − 1) resulted in Se-biofortified tomato fruits, with Se levels low enough not to pose a health risk. The Se-biofortified fruits showed enhanced levels of the antioxidant flavonoids naringenin chalcone and kaempferol and a concomitant decrease of cinnamic acid derivatives. Thus, tomato fruits can be safely enriched with Se, and Se biofortification may enhance levels of other neutraceutical compounds...|$|E

40|$|Chemical and {{physical}} carcinogens, present in our environment and encountered {{in a variety}} of occupations, produce damage to DNA. X-rays produce direct ionizations and indirect hydroxyl radical attack. UV light in the short wavelength is specifically absorbed by unsaturated bonds in DNA, RNA, and proteins.

The development of a fully malignant tumor involves the activation or altered expression of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes that control normal cellular development. Mutations in the p 53 tumor-suppressor gene are common in diverse types of cancer and could perhaps provide clues to the etiology of some cancers and to the effect of various environmental and occupational carcinogens in cancer development.
