His rap appears at the {{three and a half}} minute mark {{of the song}} as he sings about [...] "how he loves it when his lady gives it to him dirty when no one is around" [...] and [...] "lives out his fantasy with candlelight (for a little ambiance), lingerie and Louis Vuitton". He later adds, [...] "I just want to watch the moon glisten off your body... I really just want to peel you out dem clothes <b>and</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how excited I am to lay you down right now." [...] The remix was well received by music critics. A writer of Vibe magazine commented that it [...] "is sultry and will steam up any club, bedroom or wherever you like to get dirty".

Alexander of the website Idolator praised the remix, writing that T.I.'s vocals make the [...] "smooth, bedroom-ready R track that much sexier".|$|E

This section of Dover Street, between Breadalbane and Claremont streets, was {{demolished}} in the 1970s. Connolly refers to this in his 1983 song [...] "I Wish I Was in Glasgow" [...] with the lines [...] "I would take you there <b>and</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> but they've pulled the building down" [...] and [...] "They bulldozed it all to make a road". The flat had only two rooms: a kitchen-living room, with a recess where the children slept and another room for their parents.

2500|$|After having reluctantly {{given up}} the chase, the Essex and the St Louis {{returned}} to Cairo to replenish and begin ammunition runs, and were relieved by two other vessels which took up guarding Fort Holt. In the days following, Porter used a buoy to float towards the Confederate positions a challenge: [...] "Hollins: Why don't you accursed, cowardly rebels bring out your gunboats and fight us. Porter." [...] Confederate Captain Miller sent his reply in the same medium: [...] "Sir: The ironclad steamer Grampus will meet the Essex at any point and time your Honor may appoint <b>and</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that the power is in our hands. An early reply will be agreeable." [...] The ships would meet in the coming weeks, however the Confederate vessels proved speedier than the Union ironclads. Porter's later account of the engagement was syndicated in the New York Times, where it was well received for their [...] "lucid and graphic manner".|$|E
