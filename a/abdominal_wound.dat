500|$|After {{learning}} {{that the first}} assassination attempt had been unsuccessful, Princip thought about a position to assassinate the Archduke on his return journey, and {{decided to move to}} a position in front of a nearby food shop (Schiller's delicatessen), near the Latin Bridge. At this point the Archdukes' motorcade turned off the Appel Quay, mistakenly following the original route which would have taken them to the National Museum. Governor Potiorek, who was sharing the second vehicle with the Imperial couple, called out to the driver to reverse and take the Quay to the hospital. Driver Lojka stopped the car close to where Princip was standing, prior to backing up. The latter stepped forward and fired two shots from a distance of about one and a half metres (5 feet) using a Belgian-made 9×17mm (.380 ACP) Fabrique Nationale model 1910 semi-automatic pistol. Pistol serial numbers 19074, 19075, 19120 and 19126 were supplied to the assassins; Princip used #19074. According to Albertini, [...] "the first bullet wounded the Archduke in the jugular vein, the second inflicted an <b>abdominal</b> <b>wound</b> on the Duchess." [...] Princip was immediately arrested. [...] At his sentencing, Princip stated that his intention had been to kill Governor Potiorek, rather than Sophie.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{management}} and outcome of 138 <b>abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wounds</b> were examined over a 5 -year period. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: It {{has been proposed}} that exploratory laparotomy may be unnecessary and even overused in a subset of patients with <b>abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wounds.</b> METHODS: Data on shotgun wound patients from October 1987 through March 1992 from a statewide trauma registry were examined. Patients with <b>abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wounds</b> were identified and compared with patients with nonabdominal shotgun wounds. RESULTS: Of 516 shotgun wound patients, 138 (26. 7 %) had <b>abdominal</b> <b>wounds</b> and 88 (63. 8 %) had exploratory laparotomies. <b>Abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wounds</b> resulted in significantly longer number of intensive care unit days (4. 3 vs. 2. 5, p < 0. 05), {{a greater number of}} blood units transfused (7. 8 vs. 2. 4, p < 0. 05), and a higher mortality (15. 9 % vs. 4. 8 %, p < 0. 05) when compared with nonabdominal shotgun wounds. When stratified for trauma score, the mortality for <b>abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wounds</b> always was significantly greater than for nonabdominal shotgun <b>wounds.</b> All <b>abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wound</b> patients with trauma scores less than ten died. The negative laparotomy rate for <b>abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wound</b> patients with normal trauma scores was 9. 4 %. No patient with a negative laparotomy died. CONCLUSION: <b>Abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wounds</b> are a particularly lethal subset of shotgun <b>wounds.</b> Although some <b>abdominal</b> shotgun <b>wound</b> patients can be managed without laparotomy, the morbidity and mortality for these injuries are substantial, even in patients with normal trauma score. Clinical judgment is an excellent predictor of the need for laparotomy...|$|R

Comparisons {{were made of}} wound pain and discomfort, wound infection, discharge, redness, width, and skin reaction. The causes of peeling of the tapes were assessed. The results showed that tapes were significantly more comfortable and that patients preferred them to sutures (P less than 0. 01), but wide scars occurred more often. There {{was no difference in}} rates of wound infection and no case of allergy to the tapes was seen.

40|$|Background: <b>Abdominal</b> <b>wounds</b> {{following}} {{surgery for}} typhoid perforation {{are classified as}} dirty, with an infection rate of over 40 &#x 0025;. To date, the optimal method for closure of these wounds remains controversial. Delayed primary closure which was conventionally recommended as standard practice, is now considered to be of no value in preventing surgical site infection (SSI). This study evaluates the outcome of primary closure of this class of wounds in children in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, and advocates a multidisciplinary wound management protocol. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective study of children aged < 1 - 15 years who had had surgery for typhoid perforation in a teaching hospital in south western Nigeria, {{over a period of}} ten years. Results: Thirty-two patients, 18 males and 14 females, in the ratio of 1. 3 : 1 were managed for typhoid perforation during the ten year period. All 32 patients had primary closure of their <b>abdominal</b> <b>wounds.</b> There was primary wound healing in six (18. 8 &#x 0025;) patients, while 19 (59. 4 &#x 0025;) patients had surgical site infections. Wound dehiscence, intraabdominal abscess, and faecal fistulas were the other complications documented in the study. Conclusion: <b>Abdominal</b> <b>wounds</b> of typhoid perforation, though classified as being dirty, can be closed primarily with good healing outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach to wound management will reduce the incidence of wound sepsis and its associated morbidity and costs...|$|R

Compared to the standard closed-abdomen technique, the LE-HIPEC technique allows the surgeon to open the abdominal compartments to let the inflow of the heated perfusion fluid. Moreover, it allows the identification and division of the early intra-abdominal adhesions that can hamper the circulation of the perfusion fluid during a standard closed-abdomen perfusion. In a further study, Lotti M et al showed that after CRS early intra-abdominal adhesions occur in 70% of the patients, soon after the closure of the wound [...]|$|E

Bursting strength of <b>abdominal</b> <b>wounds</b> as determined in all groups at intervals. Wounds of the group treated with the mesh exhibited significantly greater (P less than 0. 01) bursting strength. Clinical trial consisted of 100 consecutive adult patients in which an onlay graft of Mersilene mesh was used in the hernioplasty. Mesh was used as an adjunct in patients with: 1) large ventral hernias; 2) direct hernias resulting from severely attenuated transversialis fascia; 3) indirect hernias associated with a large internal ring and a weak posterior inguinal wall; or 4) combined direct and indirect hernias. All were followed for a minimum of one year to determine the incidence of complication and rate of recurrence.
