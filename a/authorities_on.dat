5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Black Osprey, still registered in the neutral-United States, was seized by British <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> 6 September and detained at Weymouth. After carefully inspecting the ship for any contraband, the British released the ship after a week. However, on 31 October, the British again seized Black Osprey, and had not yet released her by 8 November, when the U.S. State Department released a list of 40 American ships that had been detained by belligerents.|$|E

5|$|At a {{press conference}} {{arranged}} by Cuban <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the Washington Post, Carromero denied this version of events, stating {{that he had been}} drugged and threatened by Cuban authorities who had forced him to make a false statement. He stated instead that the car had been rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing the fatal crash.|$|E
5|$|Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas {{fragmented}} {{the market}} for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area {{to the south of}} the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> both sides in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Piłsudski started medical {{studies at}} Kharkov University (now Kharkiv, Ukraine), {{where he became}} {{involved}} with Narodnaya Volya, part of the Russian Narodniki revolutionary movement. In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations. He {{was rejected by the}} University of Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation. On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> a charge of plotting with Vilnius socialists to assassinate Tsar Alexander III. In fact, Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was his elder brother Bronisław's involvement in it. Bronisław Piłsudski was sentenced to fifteen years' hard labor (katorga) in eastern Siberia.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, the old shop house {{buildings}} were torn down, resulting in street peddlers displaying their wares on canvas sheets along the empty {{roads in the}} area. The peddlers did not pay rent, but the Singapore government forbade them from selling brand-new items. To {{keep up with the}} times, some of the peddlers put up their wares to sell on websites and eBay, especially those hard to sell items such as old photographs, badges, medals and other collector's items. The market remained until its final closure by the <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> 10 July 2017.|$|E

The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction. <b>Authorities</b> <b>on</b> {{both sides of the border}} believe that he was succeeded by his younger brother Omar Treviño Morales, a man who was also on the most-wanted list.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> the subject of God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|Ripken's mother, Violet Ripken, {{was kidnapped}} at gunpoint and safely {{returned}} on July 24, 2012.

5|$|The {{governments of}} the islands in the {{predicted}} path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured their boats {{in preparation for the}} storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in Anguilla enacted a plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50mph (80km/h). As a precaution, <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs.|$|E

5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand {{was one of}} the pioneers ofan emerging style, the work was criticised by several <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those who were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Croatia {{launched}} several small-scale {{military operations}} against the RSK to seize significant local objectives and capture international attention; it was worried {{the situation on}} the ground might become permanent. In response, the RSK military retrieved their weapons from the UN/RSK-controlled storage sites, reversing the only major success of UNPROFOR. In March 1995, the UNPROFOR mission was terminated following the efforts of U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke; the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation was deployed to Croatia with a new mandate. Later that year, most of the territory controlled by the RSK was captured by the HV during Operations Flash and Storm, which was foreseen by Babić when he opposed the Vance plan in 1991. The rest of the RSK-held areas were regained by Croatia following the Erdut Agreement negotiated between Croatian and Serbian <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> 12 November 1995 during peace talks that also produced the Dayton Agreement.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian <b>authorities</b> <b>on</b> manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E
5|$|Information about Wallenberg {{after his}} {{detention}} is mostly speculative; {{there were many}} witnesses who claim to have met him during his imprisonment. Wallenberg was transported by train from Debrecen, through Romania, to Moscow. The Soviet authorities may have moved him to Moscow {{in the hope of}} exchanging him for defectors in Sweden. Vladimir Dekanozov notified the Swedish government on 16 January 1945 that Wallenberg was under the protection of Soviet <b>authorities.</b> <b>On</b> 21 January 1945, Wallenberg was transferred to Lubyanka prison and held in cell 123 with fellow prisoner Gustav Richter, who had been a police attaché at the German embassy in Romania. Richter testified in Sweden in 1955 that Wallenberg was interrogated once for {{about an hour and a}} half, in early February 1945. On 1 March 1945, Richter was moved from his cell and never saw Wallenberg again.|$|E
5|$|Long's {{strategy}} of proclaiming {{himself as a}} royal descendent or claiming to have supernatural powers in order to rally support for political ends was not new; it has been repeatedly used throughout Vietnamese history. In 1516, a man calling himself Trần Cảo rebelled against the Lê Dynasty, claiming to be a descendant of the deposed Trần Dynasty and a reincarnation of Indra. During the 19th century, there was a Buddhist revival and many people masqueraded as monks claiming to have supernatural powers. These false monks were frequently able to start new religious movements and secret societies based on millenarianism. Quickly gathering large numbers of disciples, they staged rebellions against Vietnamese imperial and French colonial armies alike. However, these uprisings were typically incoherent and caused minimal disruption to the ruling <b>authorities.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the French were often troubled by resistance movements in southern Vietnam that were led by more conventionally motivated nationalist militants, such as the guerrilla outfits of Trương Định and Nguyễn Trung Trực.|$|E
