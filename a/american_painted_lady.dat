50|$|The {{leaves are}} {{host to the}} {{caterpillars}} of the <b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> butterfly (Vanessa virginiensis).|$|E
50|$|In <b>American</b> architecture, <b>painted</b> <b>ladies</b> are Victorian and Edwardian {{houses and}} {{buildings}} painted {{in three or}} more colors that embellish or enhance their architectural details. The term was first used for San Francisco Victorian houses by writers Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen in their 1978 book <b>Painted</b> <b>Ladies</b> - San Francisco's Resplendent Victorians.|$|R
25|$|The Australian {{painted and}} the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> have very similar lifestyles and behaviours, but the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> {{lives in an}} arid and {{stressful}} environment. Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> colouration could be induced in <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> butterflies by injecting the larvae with stress-inducing hormones and subjecting them to lowered temperatures. This demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity, or the tendency for visible traits to vary with changing environmental conditions, of the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> butterflies. It also suggests that the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> is the ancestral form, and environmental stress slowly drove speciation by adaptation into the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady.</b> In other words, the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> most likely evolved from the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> due to the environmental conditions in Australia.|$|R
25|$|The Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> {{belongs to}} the family Nymphalidae and genus Vanessa, which compromises 22 species, which are {{strongly}} migratory. The Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> {{is similar to the}} near-cosmopolitan <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> (V. cardui), so it considered by some to be a subspecies of that. However, throughout its range, the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> does not exhibit much variation, but the male genitalia of the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> is distinct from that of the <b>painted</b> <b>lady,</b> which suggests that it is a separate species. The Australian species' four ventral eyespots are less clearly defined, and it always sports at least three (often four) conspicuous blue pupil spots on each dorsal hindwings' eyespots. V. cardui has either a few tiny pupil spots, or more often, none at all.|$|R
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> or American lady (Vanessa virginiensis) is a {{butterfly}} found throughout North America.|$|E

50|$|Antennaria {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Vanessa virginiensis (<b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady),</b> Coleophora pappiferella (which feeds exclusively on A. dioica), Schinia verna (which feeds on several Antennaria species).|$|E
2500|$|The Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> (Vanessa kershawi) {{butterfly}} {{is mostly}} confined to Australia, although westerly winds have dispersed it to islands east of Australia, including New Zealand. Debate surrounds the taxonomy of this species. Some {{believe that the}} Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> should be a subspecies to the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> (Vanessa cardui) due to the similarity in lifestyle and behaviour. Furthermore, the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> is found around the globe, but Australia is the only location in which it varies enough {{to be considered a}} separate species.|$|R
5000|$|Equally {{important}} for the reproduction of the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> butterflies is the males' exhibition of polygynous mating behavior, in which they often mate {{with more than one}} female. [...] This is {{important for}} <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> butterflies because the benefits may supersede the costs of polygyny since no permanent breeding ground is used. Upon mating, which typically occurs in the afternoon, female <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> butterflies lay eggs one by one in their desired breeding locations. The variety of eclosion locations ultimately dictates the male <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> behavior.|$|R

50|$|Most conspicuously, {{it lacks}} obvious ventral eyespots on the hindwings; {{there are two}} large ones on V. virginiensis and four small ones on V. cardui. Like the latter, it also lacks a white dot in the pinkish-orange subapical field of the ventral and dorsal forewings. Its upperwing {{coloration}} has the purest orange of the three; the <b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> is usually quite reddish.|$|E
50|$|V. cardui {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} of all butterflies, found on every continent except Antarctica and South America. In Australia, V. cardui has a limited range around Bunbury, Fremantle, and Rottnest Island. However, its close relative, the Australian painted lady (V. kershawi, sometimes considered a subspecies) ranges over half the continent. Other closely related species are the <b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> (V. virginiensis) and the West Coast lady (V. annabella).|$|E
5000|$|The West Coast lady (Vanessa annabella) is one {{of three}} North American species of brush-footed {{butterflies}} known colloquially as the [...] "painted ladies". V. annabella occurs throughout much of the western US and southwestern Canada. The other two species are the cosmopolitan Vanessa cardui (painted lady) and the eastern Vanessa virginiensis (<b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady).</b> This species has also been considered a subspecies of the South American, Vanessa carye, and is frequently misspelled as [...] "anabella".|$|E

50|$|Vanessa is a genus of brush-footed butterflies. It has a near-global {{distribution}} and includes conspicuous {{species such as}} the red admirals (e.g., red admiral, Indian red admiral, New Zealand red admiral), the Kamehameha, and the painted ladies of subgenus Cynthia: painted lady, <b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady,</b> West Coast lady, Australian painted lady, etc. For African admirals see genus, Antanartia. Recently, several members traditionally considered {{to be in the}} genus Antanartia have been determined to belong within the genus Vanessa.|$|E
5000|$|A less {{reliable}} indicator is {{the row of}} black eyespots on the dorsal submarginal hindwing. In the <b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady,</b> those on the {{opposite ends of the}} row are often larger and have blue [...] "pupils". In V. annabella, this applies to the inner two spots, while in V. cardui some of the black eyespots may have tiny blue pupils in the summer morph, but usually have none at all, and the eyespots themselves are all roughly the same size. The size of the wings are about 5 cm (2 in) across.|$|E
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> (V. virginiensis) is {{most easily}} {{distinguishable}} by its two large hindwing eyespots on the ventral side. V. virginiensis {{also features a}} white dot within the subapical field of the forewings set in pink on the ventral side, and often as a smaller clean white dot in the orange of the dorsal side too. A less reliable indicator is the row of eyespots on the dorsal submarginal hindwing; V. virginiensis often has two larger outer spots with blue pupils. The black forewing tips have four to five white spots; usually the largest is whitish orange.|$|E
