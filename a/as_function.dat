5|$|Vector {{spaces are}} the subject of linear algebra and are well {{characterized}} by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, <b>as</b> <b>function</b> spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.|$|E

Designed to mimic the building's original style, the lobby contains stainless-steel columns that replicate the ones found on the mezzanine, and the walls are of wood and marble.

25|$|Windows Vista aims {{to simplify}} the detection, configuration, and {{installation}} of external displays and projectors by introducing a standardized setup procedure and interface. The WDDM architecture in Windows Vista enables hot plug detection of external displays and alerts the new Transient Multimon Manager (TMM) when an external display is connected to a system, which then presents an Aero Wizard interface for the configuration and setup of the display. In previous versions of Windows, installation routines for displays often varied based on hardware configurations such <b>as</b> <b>function</b> keys and specific manufacturer requirements, and typically required separate software interfaces. When possible, the TMM also saves user preferences for individual displays to improve mobility scenarios as these preferences can then be restored when a display is reconnected at a different time or location. The aforementioned improvements are intended to enable a display connectivity experience that provides the ease of use observed with plug and play peripherals.|$|E

2500|$|Mathematicians {{began to}} search for axiom systems {{that could be used}} to formalize large parts of mathematics. In {{addition}} to removing ambiguity from previously naive terms such <b>as</b> <b>function,</b> it was hoped that this axiomatization would allow for consistency proofs. [...] In the 19th century, the main method of proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it. Thus, for example, non-Euclidean geometry can be proved consistent by defining point to mean a point on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere. The resulting structure, a model of elliptic geometry, satisfies the axioms of plane geometry except the parallel postulate.|$|E
