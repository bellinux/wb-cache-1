5|$|The road {{followed}} by Alboin to reach Italy {{has been the}} subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the Poetovio – Celeia – Emona – Forum Iulii route, while the wagons <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting Venetia, but it was probably only in 569 that the Julian Alps were crossed at the Vipava Valley; the eyewitness Secundus of Non gives the date as May 20 or 21. The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void of difficulties however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.|$|E

2500|$|Between 2:50 and 2:55p.m. the South Fork Dam breached. [...] A LiDAR {{analysis}} of the Conemaugh Lake basin reveals that it contained 14.55 million cubic meters (3.843 billion gallons) of water {{at the moment the}} dam collapsed. [...] Modern dam-breach computer modeling reveals that it took approximately 65 minutes for most of the lake to empty after the dam began to fail. [...] The first town to be hit by the flood was South Fork. The town was on high ground, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> escaped by running up the nearby hills when they saw the dam spill over. Some 20 to 30 houses were destroyed or washed away, and four people were killed.|$|E
2500|$|Salvador Allende is {{mentioned}} {{in a book}} written by the official historian of the British Intelligence MI5 Christopher Andrew. According to SIS and Andrew, the book {{is based on the}} handwritten notes of KGB archivist defector Vasili Mitrokhin. The book also named several Italians of the left as informants or KGB agents, and the right wing Prime Minister of the time, Silvio Berlusconi, opened an investigation to target his opponents. As Mitrokhin's information was very old, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in his files were dead or retired, he failed to find any evidence that any of the accused by the book were KGB agents or informants. Some Italian Ministers dismissed the archive as [...] "not a dossier from the KGB but one about the KGB constructed by British counter-espionage agents based on the confession of an ex-agent, if there is one, and 'Mitrokhin' is just a codename for an MI5 operation". The Indian Congress party referred to the book as [...] "pure sensationalism not even remotely based on facts or records" [...] and pointed out that the book is not based on any official documents from the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|Suddenly, Sisko {{transitions}} entirely {{into his}} vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s New York City. Russell {{writes for the}} science fiction magazine Incredible Tales, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. On the way to work, Russell buys the latest edition of Galaxy, their competitor, from a local newsboy (Aron Eisenberg/Nog). He then runs into his coworker Albert Macklin (Colm Meaney/O'Brien), and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff (Armin Shimerman/Quark) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst (René Auberjonois/Odo) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K.C. Hunter, (Nana Visitor/Kira) and Julius Eaton (Alexander Siddig/Bashir) banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse (J. G. Hertzler/Martok) then arrives {{with a stack of}} sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay [...] "sleep late" [...] that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell realizes he also will not be included, which Pabst confirms. Rossoff objects, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.|$|E

60|$|That half, however, {{was still}} {{a source of great}} danger, the walls being {{intensely}} hot and the fallen beams a mass of glowing charcoal, which the least breath of wind blew into a flame.

60|$|It was now midnight, {{and the men}} {{on board}} both vessels {{required}} rest. A watch was set in each, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were permitted to turn in. Of course, proper look-outs were had, but {{the light of the}} moon was not sufficiently distinct to render it safe to make any final efforts under its favour. No great alarm was felt, there being nothing unusual in a vessel's being embayed in the ice; and so long as she was not nipped or pressed upon by actual contact the position was thought safe rather than the reverse. It was desirable, moreover, for the schooners to communicate with each other; for some advantage might be known to one of the masters that was concealed by distance from his companion. Without concert, therefore, Roswell and Daggett came to the same general conclusions, and waited patiently.|$|E

There was plenty to eat and little to do, and the Frog tribe increased very fast. In fact, the Frogs increased so fast that after a while there wasn't plenty to eat. That is, there wasn't plenty of the kind of food they had been used to, which was mostly water plants, and water bugs and such things.|$|E
60|$|Mulford had a {{profound}} respect for Spike's seamanship, whatever he might think of his principles. The order was consequently obeyed. The mate was then directed to send down various articles out of the top, {{and to get the}} top-gallant and royal yards on deck. Spike carried his precautions so far, as to have the mainsail lowered, it ordinarily brailing at that season of the year, with a standing gaff. With this disposition completed, the captain seemed more at his ease, and went below to join Se¤or Montefalderon in a siesta. The Mexican, for such, in truth, was the national character of the owner of the schooner, had preceded him in this indulgence; <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of the brig having laid themselves down to sleep under the heat of the hour, Mulford soon enjoyed another favourable opportunity for a private conference with Rose.|$|E
