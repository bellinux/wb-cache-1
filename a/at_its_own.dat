5|$|Scent plays a {{significant}} role in olfactory communication. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than the males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.|$|E
5|$|Starting <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> 10-yard line, Virginia Tech ran three {{straight}} running plays {{in an effort}} to run the clock down and prevent Boston College from having enough time to conduct another offensive drive. After the third run was stopped for no gain, however, the Hokies were forced to punt the ball. Boston College now had 28seconds to score a touchdown and either tie the game with an extra point or win it with a two-point conversion.|$|E

5|$|After the missed field goal, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> 27-yard line. Running back Kenny Lewis, Jr., {{replacing}} the suspended Branden Ore, {{ran for a}} first down, and Tyrod Taylor connected on an 11-yard pass to Eddie Royal for another first down. Now inside Kansas territory, Taylor attempted another pass. Kansas All-American cornerback Aqib Talib jumped between Taylor's throw and the receiver, intercepting the ball. Talib returned the interception 60yards to the end zone for a Kansas touchdown—the first points of the game. An extra point kick by Scott Webb made the score 70 Kansas with 5:15 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{possession}} of the game began <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> 32-yard line after Louisville's post-touchdown kickoff. Tech running back Cedric Humes gained 12yards and a first down on the Hokies' first play of the game, and quarterback Marcus Vick completed a 24-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Hyman three plays later to get another first down and drive the Hokies into Louisville territory. After Vick was stopped for losses on two consecutive rushing plays, he completed another long pass to Hyman for a first down. Subsequent plays saw Tech advance into the Louisville red zone but fail to gain another first down. Kicker Brandon Pace entered the game to attempt a 36-yard field goal kick, which was successful. With six minutes remaining in the first quarter, Tech cut Louisville's lead to 7–3.|$|E
5|$|After a {{scoreless}} third quarter, with 8:08 to go, Alabama took possession <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> 32 {{following a}} Gamecock punt. Taking direct snaps {{out of the}} wildcat formation, Ingram rushed for 64 yards on five carries, then took a pitch from Greg McElroy {{for the last four}} yards and the touchdown, sealing Alabama's 20–6 victory. The Alabama offense turned the ball over four times in this game after committing only two turnovers in the first six games. Mark Ingram's 246 yards rushing marked his third consecutive career-high effort and the third highest single game total in Alabama history. For their performances, Ingram was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week and Rolando McClain was named the Lott Trophy IMPACT Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gamecocks to 10–3 (12–2 before NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|After {{the opening}} kickoff, Michigan drove 80 {{yards for a}} {{touchdown}} on a 2-yard run by quarterback Denard Robinson. On its second possession, Michigan drove the ball 88 yards and took a 14–0 lead on a 47-yard run by Robinson. Michigan began its third possession <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> 9-yard line. Robinson ran 46 yards on the first play of the drive, but he injured his knee and did not return to the game. Devin Gardner substituted for Robinson and concluded the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon. Michigan led 21–0 {{at the end of the}} first quarter, but Bowling Green scored 14 unanswered points in the second quarter on a 1-yard run by Jordan Hopgood and a 71-yard reception by Tyrone Pronty. With Michigan's lead cut to 7 points, Tate Forcier entered the game late in the second quarter. Forcier completed all 6 of his passes in leading the team on 69-yard touchdown drive to give Michigan a 28–14 lead at halftime.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{began work}} at its 30-yard line, again needing to just {{run down the}} clock to ensure victory. As before, however, Drew Weatherford took to the air, {{throwing}} a two-yard pass. Two rushing plays followed, but were stopped for little gain. Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two {{and a half minutes}} had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two previous drives, however, Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory {{was not simply a}} matter of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money in one of two outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, defense {{continued}} to dominate as Tech built a lead. The Hokies scored the only points {{of a third}} quarter as running back Lee Suggs ran {{into the end zone}} from one yard out, allowing Tech to take a 17–10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Falcons didn't give up easily, however. Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft cut into the Tech lead with a 21-yard field goal. Tech matched the score later in the quarter to restore the one-touchdown lead. As time ran down, Air Force had one final chance to tie the game and send it into overtime. Beginning <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> 18-yard line with 4:11 left to play, the Falcons drove deep into Tech territory. With seven seconds remaining, Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge tried to scramble into the end zone, but was stopped before the goal line by Tech cornerback Ronyell Whitaker. The defensive stop preserved the 20–13 Hokie victory, and Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the passage}} of the Bland–Allison Act in 1878, there had been little {{discussion}} of gold versus silver coinage. Silver had been hardly mentioned in the 1888 campaign, and Harrison's exact position on the issue was initially unclear, but his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, William Windom, encouraged the free silver supporters. Silver supporters' numbers had grown in Congress with the addition of new Western states. The drop in agricultural prices, which made farmers' debts harder to pay, broadened their cause's appeal. Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> value, not at a fixed ratio to gold. This served only to disappoint both factions. Windom suggested keeping the Bland–Allison system, but doubling the amount of silver allowed to be coined. The intrinsic value of the silver dollar had fallen to 72.3 cents, but Windom believed (though gold supporters doubted) that coining more silver would increase demand and raise its value. Harrison was willing to sign whatever bill would satisfy the largest group of people, as long as it did not make the currency unsound.|$|E
5|$|The game {{kicked off}} under {{comfortable}} temperatures and moderate wind. An estimated 41,100people {{came out to}} watch the Falcons take on the Hokies. Air Force scored first with a 35-yard field goal, but the Hokies struck back with a touchdown off a 10-play, 72-yard drive, putting Virginia Tech ahead 73. That score would remain until halfway through the second quarter, when Virginia Tech fumbled the ball <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> three-yard line. Air Force recovered the ball and scored a touchdown on the next play, regaining a 107 lead. After halftime, Virginia Tech's defense began to break down under Air Force's rushing offense. The Hokies and Air Force battled defensively throughout the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, Air Force's offense broke free for 13unanswered points, clinching the victory. Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss was named the game's most valuable player on offense, while Virginia Tech linebacker Vince Daniels was named the game's most valuable player on defense.|$|E
5|$|The silver coinage issue had {{not been}} much {{discussed}} in the 1888 campaign and Harrison {{is said to have}} favored a bimetallist position. However, his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, William Windom, encouraged the free silver supporters. Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> value, not at a fixed ratio to gold. This failed to facilitate a compromise between the factions. In July 1890, Senator Sherman achieved passage of a bill, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, in both houses. Harrison thought that the bill would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply, a problem that would persist until the second Cleveland administration resolved it.|$|E
