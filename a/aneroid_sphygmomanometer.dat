Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study performed at the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran-Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital from March to April 2015. Thirty five elderly subjects aged 60 – 74 years {{were included in the}} study. The subject handgrip strength was measured using an <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> and a Jamar dynamometer. Results: All data were analyzed statistically using Pearson correlation test to examine the distributed data and Spearman test to examine the non distributed data. A significant correlation was found between hand width, age, and sex and the handgrip strength values using Jamar dynamometer (p< 0. 01) using multiple linear regression (p< 0. 01). A normality test using the Shapiro-Wilk test resulted normal residue with p value 0. 000.

40|$|Background- The craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) is {{generally}} undertaken using a pressure biofeedback unit. However, {{the high costs}} of the device limits its availability in poorly resourced healthcare settings. The use of alternate measures such as the <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> to undertake CCFT need to be investigated. Objective- The objective {{of this study was to}} establish the concurrent validity, intra- and inter-rater reliability of the <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> using a paediatric size cuff for CCFT in asymptomatic adults. Methods- This cross-sectional observational study involved 300 asymptomatic participants randomly allocated to either validity (n[*]=[*] 100), intra-rater (n[*]=[*] 100) or inter-rater (n[*]=[*] 100) testing. Participants were asked to perform CCFT to assess craniocervical flexors performance using the pressure biofeedback unit and the <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> with a paediatric cuff. Inter-rater reliability test was performed by two different raters on the same day with rest of 30 [*]min between tests. An independent observer checked and recorded the pressures noted on the pressure dial thus ensuring blinded outcome measurement.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{precision}} {{and integrity of}} all <b>aneroid</b> and mercury <b>sphygmomanometers</b> regularly used by family physicians practising outside hospitals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Private medical clinics and local community health centres in Bas-Saint-Laurent, QuÃ©. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 151 of the 166 physicians in this administrative region. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Precision of the mercury sphygmomanometers was measured using {{the difference between a}} reading in the absence of pressure and level 0. Precision of the <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers</b> was measured using variations at pressures of 140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg compared with those on a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer. Integrity of sphygmomanometers, arm cuffs, and inflating bulbs was also assessed. RESULTS: In all, 258 sphygmomanometers met the inclusion criteria (111 mercury <b>sphygmomanometers</b> and 147 <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers).</b> Discrepancies of > or = 4 mm Hg were found in 15. 5 % of these instruments (12. 6 % and 17. 7 % of the mercury and <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers,</b> respectively). In 31. 0 % of the instruments (52. 3 % and 15. 0 % of the mercury and <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers,</b> respectively), one component was malfunctioning. CONCLUSION: Sphygmomanometers that measure patients' blood pressure inaccurately could result in an incorrect diagnosis of hypertension or in a normal blood pressure reading in a hypertensive patient...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the sphygmomanometers calibration accuracy {{and the physical}} conditions of the cuff-bladder, bulb, pump, and valve. METHODS: Sixty hundred and forty five <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers</b> were evaluated, 521 used in private practice and 124 used in hospitals. Aneroid manometers were tested against a properly calibrated mercury manometer and were considered calibrated when the error was <= 3 mm Hg. The physical conditions of the cuffs-bladder, bulb, pump, and valve were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers</b> tested, 51 % of those used in private practice and 56 % of those used in hospitals {{were found to be}} not accurately calibrated. Of these, the magnitude of inaccuracy ranged from 4 to 8 mm Hg in 70 % and 51 % of the devices, respectively. The problems found in the cuffs - bladders, bulbs, pumps, and valves of the private practice and hospital devices were bladder damage (34 % vs. 21 %, respectively), holes/leaks in the bulbs (22 % vs. 4 %, respectively), and rubber aging (15 % vs. 12 %, respectively). Of the devices tested, 72 % revealed at least one problem interfering with blood pressure measurement accuracy. CONCLUSION: Most of the manometers evaluated, whether used in private practice or in hospitals, were found to be inaccurate and unreliable, and their use may jeopardize the diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{prediction}} of Jamar grip strength value by using <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> cuff method in adults. Methods: This study involved 120 subjects, aged 20 – 59 years old. The grip strength of subjects were measured using Jamar dynamometer and <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> cuff method. Spearman {{analysis was used to}} evaluate the correlation between variables and grip strength. Forward stepwise was used to analyze the regression of Jamar dynamometer using <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> cuff method. Results: There was a weak correlation (r< 0. 4) between grip strength with age and BMI, moderate correlation (r = 0. 4 – 0. 6) for grip circumference, and also strong correlation r= (0. 6 – 0. 8) for sex, hand length, and hand width. Jamar grip strength value can be predicted using spyghmomanometer with the formula of (0. 1157 x Sphygmomanometer grip strength value) – (5. 696 x sex) + (0. 0824 x age) (female = 1, male= 0). Conclusions: Grip strength correlates with physiological variables. The variables to predict Jamar grip strength using sphygmomanometer are sex and age.

40|$|Background: Blood {{pressure}} and pulse are crucially vital {{in health care}} especially in medical sphere, since both of those sections are factors {{that can be used}} as indicator to assess a person’s cardiovascular system. Blood pressure is measured in millimeter of mercury (mmHg), and recorded as two different measurements such as systolic blood {{pressure and}} diastolic. Sphygmomanometer can be used to measure blood pressure. The congruence of sphygmomanometer is fundamental to prevent an error in measuring blood pressure. Aim: This research is aimed to prove that there is an agreement between <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> and digital sphygmomanometer in measuring blood pressure. Methods: This study was an observational study with cross-sectional design. Samples were obtained by simple random sampling from March to April 2016. Samples were obtained from 50 subjects with three times of observation in each subject. Then, the data will be analyzed by using Cohen’s Kappa. Results: Result of the research shows that the measure of kappa systolic blood pressure using manual and digital sphygmomanometer is κ= 0. 855, it indicates the existent of congruence consistency between devices is excellent or sufficiently high. The measure of kappa as a result of sphygmomanometer manual and digital usage in diastolic blood pressure is κ= 0. 737, it indicates the existent of congruence consistency between devices is well.

40|$|Background: The manual {{recording}} of {{blood pressure is}} widely accepted to be more accurate than the {{recording of}} blood pressure using an automated device. Despite this many western healthcare systems have moved almost entirely to the automated recording of this important vital sign using oscillometric devices. Such devices may either fail to record the patient’s blood pressure in persistent hypotension or may give inaccurate readings in people with arteriosclerotic or atherosclerotic changes. This paper explores the importance of manual blood pressure recording, the availability of <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers</b> in UK hospitals {{and the maintenance of}} the skills of the workforce following initial nurse education. Methods: Using a survey of nursing students to explore what opportunities they have to practice manual blood pressures in the clinical setting, the paper explores the maintenance of skills following initial nurse education. The paper also describes the results of data collection, using unobtrusive methods, regarding the availability of <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers</b> in general and specialist hospital facilities in Northern England (UK). Data using both methods were collected in the spring of 2014. Results: The results suggest that despite most hospitals having some aneriod sphygmomanometers available (mean was 1 device for every 6 beds in acute, 1 device for every 3 beds in specialist hospitals and 1 device for every 12 beds in mental health) they were rarely used in clinical practice with only 35 % of students reporting that they had undertaken a manual blood pressure in a clinical setting {{during the first year of}} their course. In addition, some hospitals had no aneroid devices and several others had n...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of mild hypertension {{and the treatment}} of hypertension require accurate measurement of blood pressure. Blood pressure readings are altered by various factors that influence the patient, the techniques used and {{the accuracy of the}} sphygmomanometer. The variability of readings can be reduced if informed patients prepare in advance by emptying their bladder and bowel, by avoiding over-the-counter vasoactive drugs the day of measurement and by avoiding exposure to cold, caffeine consumption, smoking and physical exertion within half an hour before measurement. The use of standardized techniques to measure blood pressure will help to avoid large systematic errors. Poor technique can account for differences in readings of more than 15 mm Hg and ultimately misdiagnosis. Most of the recommended procedures are simple and, when routinely incorporated into clinical practice, require little additional time. The equipment must be appropriate and in good condition. Physicians should have a suitable selection of cuff sizes readily available; the use of the correct cuff size is essential to minimize systematic errors in blood pressure measurement. Semiannual calibration of <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers</b> and annual inspection of mercury sphygmomanometers and blood pressure cuffs are recommended.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{agreement}} between conventional measurement of {{blood pressure and}} measurements obtained using two automated devices; and to compare how comfortable {{each of the three}} methods of measurement were for patients. METHODS: Blood pressure measurements and patient comfort scores were recorded using three different devices in 125 -surgery and 40 -community patients. The devices used were a conventional <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer,</b> an automated device that measured blood pressure on the upper arm and an automated device that measured blood pressure at the wrist. In each patient, the difference between the conventional and automatic measurement was calculated. The limits of agreement of each device were then calculated as the mean difference +/- 1. 96 standard deviations. RESULTS: In surgery patients, the width of limits of agreement of wrist measurement were 20. 0 mm Hg and 12. 1 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively, compared with 26. 4 mm Hg and 27. 7 mm Hg for automatic arm measurement. In community patients, the width of limits of agreement of wrist measurement were 11. 6 mm Hg and 11. 0 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively, compared with 19. 5 mm Hg and 12. 1 mm Hg for automatic arm measurement. Surgery patients also reported that wrist measurement of blood pressure was significantly more comfortable than either manual or automatic arm measurement (mean comfort scores 4. 03 for automatic wrist and 2. 13 for automatic arm measurement, Friedman's Test, P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure measurements taken using the wrist device agreed more closely with those obtained using a conventional <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> than the arm device. The wrist device was also more comfortable for patients than two other methods of blood pressure measurement. Public Health (2000) 114, 165 - 16...|$|E

The correct detection of hypertension is essential, where this health problem is considered {{as one of the}} greatest health risks factors that affect the heart and circulatory system. This paper presents the importance of the application of metrological criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension using a sphygmomanometer aneroid. Methods 72 mechanical aneroid sphygmomanometers were calibrated using a standard manometer and the indication error, hysteresis, air leakage and rapid exhaust were determined; readings of these sphygmomanometers were compared to a properly calibrated and adjusted <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> to carry out pressure measurements as those made during the hypertension diagnosis; the uncertainty of measurement associated with the sphygmomanometers calibration, and pressure values was assessed according to the recommendations of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, defined by the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology. Results The results obtained have shown that about 61 % of the evaluated aneroid sphygmomanometers did not meet the specifications. The variable that most contributed to the final calibration uncertainty was the hysteresis of the standard manometer, with 53 % of contribution, followed by the sphygmomanometer resolution with 27 %. Conclusion The periodic verifications are essential to evaluate the performance of these devices. It was shown that uncertainty of measurement influences the final diagnosis of hypertension and the application of metrological criteria can increase the reliability of the final diagnosis...|$|E

A total of 157 normotensive subjects aged 18 to 35 years, selected at random in a cross-sectional population-based survey, answered a structured questionnaire. They were classified as strongly predisposed to hypertension when two or more first-degree relatives had a diagnosis of hypertension. Anthropometric parameters were obtained and sitting blood pressure was determined with <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometers.</b> Sodium and potassium excretion was measured by flame spectrophotometry in an overnight urine sample. A positive correlation between blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion was detected only {{in the group of}} individuals strongly predisposed to hypertension, both for systolic blood pressure (r = 0. 51, P< 0. 01) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0. 50, P< 0. 01). In a covariance analysis, after controlling for age, skin color and body mass index, individuals strongly predisposed to hypertension who excreted amounts of sodium above the median of the entire sample had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure than subjects classified into the remaining conditions. The influence of familial predisposition to hypertension on the association between salt intake and blood pressure may be an additional explanation for the weak association between urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure observed in within-population studies, since it can influence the association between salt consumption and blood pressure in some but not all inhabitants...|$|R

50|$|The blood {{pressure}} is recorded as two readings: a high systolic pressure, which occurs during the maximal contraction of the heart, and the lower diastolic or resting pressure. A normal {{blood pressure}} would be 120 being the systolic over 80, the diastolic. Usually the {{blood pressure is}} read from the left arm unless there is some damage to the arm. The difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure is called the pulse pressure. The measurement of these pressures is now usually done with an <b>aneroid</b> or electronic <b>sphygmomanometer.</b> The classic measurement device is a mercury sphygmomanometer, using a column of mercury measured off in millimeters. In the United States and UK, the common form is millimeters of mercury, whilst elsewhere SI units of pressure are used. There is no natural 'normal' value for blood pressure, but rather a range of values that on increasing are associated with increased risks. The guideline acceptable reading also takes into account other co-factors for disease. Therefore, elevated blood pressure (hypertension) is variously defined when the systolic number is persistently over 140-160 mmHg. Low blood pressure is hypotension. Blood pressures are also taken at other portions of the extremities. These pressures are called segmental blood pressures and are used to evaluate blockage or arterial occlusion in a limb (see Ankle brachial pressure index).|$|R

MÉTODOS: O rastreômetro foi desenvolvido a partir de um esfigmomanômetro aneróide convencional, no qual se cobriu o visor do aneróide com um adesivo, cujo desenho tem uma faixa vermelha, indicativa de pressões > 140 mmHg e uma faixa amarela, indicativa de pressões OBJECTIVE: To test a {{simplified}} blood pressure device called Rastreometro {{that could be}} used by the Health Agents. METHODS: The Rastreometro has been developed from an ordinary <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer,</b> in which the numeric display is covered by an adhesive with a red zone, indicating pressures equal or above 140 mmHg and a yellow zone indicating pressures below 140 mmHg. The onset of oscillations of the aneroid needle is taken as an indication of the systolic pressure value. The measurements made by the Rastreometro were compared with those made by the auscultatory method, and were carried out in 268 patients, by two operators. The influence on the results of confounding variables such as age, gender, BMI, arm length, upper arm circunference, skin colour and antihypertensive treatment were taken into consideration, as well as intra and interobserver variation. RESULTS: In the whole group, sensitivity was 95. 1 %, specificity was 63. 1 %, positive preditive value was 62. 4 % and negative preditive value was 95. 3 %. Hypertensive treatment significantly affected specificity, 32. 7 % as compared to 77. 8 % for the non-treated group. Both operators improved their results over time. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the Rastreometro technique, as a screener for hypertension, has good sensitivity. Concerning specificity, it is acceptable, provided the patient is not on regular antihypertensive treatment. In this latter situation, it can be improved by a proper standardization of the method to read the systolic pressure by needle oscillations. Furthermore, the use of this technique requires well trained operators...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{monitoring}} of {{blood pressure and}} heart activity via ECG in prehospital emergency care. So the thesis deals with {{a necessary part of}} a patient´s examination that precedes effective treatment. In the theoretical part the prehospital emergency care is defined and the emergency medical service, which provides this care, is characterized. Anatomy and physiology of heart is outlined there. Also blood pressure and its measurement is discussed there. Electrocardiography is described and information needed to basic orientation in ECG recording is introduced. The practical part was carried out using mixed methods research. The first method was a quantitative research {{in the form of a}} standardized anonymous questionnaire. Employees of the Emergency Medical Service of the South Bohemia Region who work as paramedics became the respondents of this questionnaire. The qualitative research strategy consisted in observation of paramedics when they were monitoring blood pressure and heart activity via ECG in the prehospital emergency care. The aims of the research part were these: mapping of states and situations that lead paramedics to monitor patient´s blood pressure and heart activity, description of different methods of blood pressure and heart activity monitoring and finding the paramedics´ experience with available apparatuses. The last aim was a detailed introduction to monitoring of blood pressure and heart activity via ECG. The results show the following information. Paramedics measure every or nearly every patient´s blood preasure. They begin to monitor heart activity via ECG when the patient suffers from chest pain, is unconcsious, when there is a risk of arrhythmias or when the patient is circulatory unstable. Auscultatory method mediated via <b>aneroid</b> <b>sphygmomanometer</b> is the most frequent way of blood pressure monitoring in prehospital emergency care.

40|$|Objectives: The International Society of Hypertension (ISH) {{surveyed}} {{trends in}} the management of hypertension worldwide, as reported by its affiliated societies. Methods: A formal questionnaire was emailed in December 2011 to 90 national and regional societies affiliated with the ISH, from 77 countries. Responses received by June 2012 were analysed. Results: Thirty-one societies responded (nine high-income, 17 upper-middle-income, five lower-middle/low-income countries). Twenty-one reported use of national guidelines, three used regional and 17 used ‘international guidelines’, two-thirds used mercury, <b>aneroid</b> and semi-automatic <b>sphygmomanometers</b> and half used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Exercise, salt restriction and weight reduction were recommended by 31, 27 and 26 nations, respectively, but less for other diets, smoking cessation and alcohol restriction. Almost all nations used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers and diuretics. β Blockers were only recommended for patients with coronary disease. ACEI and ARB were preferred for patients with diabetes, renal disease and metabolic syndrome. Combination treatment was recommended by all, for initiation of treatment by most, and in fixed-dose formulation by half. Most used a threshold of 140 / 90  mmHg to initiate drug treatment in uncomplicated patients but only half retained the threshold of 130 / 80  mmHg for high-risk patients. Differences in treatment patterns across regions or across high, middle and low-income countries were minimal. Conclusion: There was surprising consistency across countries from different regions and with varying degrees of affluence. There was a trend towards more conservative thresholds and targets than those recommended by JNC 7 or ESH/ESC 2007. Combination therapy was favoured by all, but β blockers were restricted to patients with coronary heart disease. </p...|$|R
