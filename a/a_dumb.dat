Concerning the latter, he wrote that the cast was filled with [...] "actors hamming it up". VanDerWerff did note that the episode was better [...] "than its reputation" [...] suggested, but that it still was [...] "undone by some very strange story choices and <b>a</b> <b>dumb</b> monster". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris bluntly wrote, [...] "if you're looking for a suspenseful, bite-your-nails, monster-of-the-week X-Files episode… this isn't it."

Aly Barchi of Complete Music Update said, of the song, [...] "‘Pink And Blue’ {{is at once}} ‘just <b>a</b> <b>dumb</b> pop song’ and also a highly smart bit of manufacturing. And so, so good… infuriatingly good." [...] Jamie Milton of DIY honored the song as [...] "THE BIG NEU THING", and called the song [...] "one of the most insanely addictive tracks of the year [...] ". Without giving a personal opinion on [...] "Pink and Blue", Brendan Klinkenberg of Pigeons and Planes noted that Diamond's [...] "childlike" [...] vocal delivery, persona, and its focus on falling in love, has caused the general response to the song to be divided.|$|E

In late June, Warner announced its exclusive worldwide rights to market coin-operated and console games based on the movie. Although the exact details of the transaction were not disclosed in the announcement, it was later reported that Atari had paid US$20–25 million for the rights, a high figure for video game licensing at the time. [...] When asked by Ross {{what he thought about}} making an E.T.-based video game, Atari CEO Ray Kassar replied, [...] "I think it's <b>a</b> <b>dumb</b> idea.

500|$|After filming for The Seven Year Itch {{wrapped in}} November, Monroe began a new battle for control over her career and left Hollywood for the East Coast, {{where she and}} {{photographer}} Milton Greene founded their own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP)– an action that has later been called [...] "instrumental" [...] {{in the collapse of}} the studio system. Announcing its foundation in a press conference in January 1955, Monroe stated that she was [...] "tired of the same old sex roles. I want to do better things. People have scope, you know." [...] She asserted that she was no longer under contract to Fox, as the studio had not fulfilled its duties, such as paying her the promised bonus for The Seven Year Itch. This began a year-long legal battle between her and the studio. The press largely ridiculed Monroe for her actions and she was parodied in The Seven Year Itch writer George Axelrod's Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?

500|$|Burke and Hare murdered two lodgers in June, [...] "an {{old woman}} and <b>a</b> <b>dumb</b> boy, her grandson", as Burke later {{recalled}} in his confession. While the boy {{sat by the}} fire in the kitchen, his grandmother was murdered in the bedroom by the usual method. Burke and Hare then picked up the boy and carried him to the same room where he was also killed. Burke later said that this was the murder that disturbed him the most, as he was haunted by his recollection of the boy's expression. The tea-chest that was usually used by the couple to transport the bodies was found to be too small, so the bodies were forced into a herring barrel and taken to Surgeons' Square, where they fetched £8 each. According to Burke's confession, the barrel was loaded onto a cart which Hare's horse refused to pull further than the Grassmarket. Hare called a porter with a handcart to help him transport the container. Once back in Tanner's Close, Hare took his anger out on the horse by shooting it dead in the yard.|$|E

The next day, Brian goes out with Jillian, where he meets her equally unintelligent friends. [...] Stewie tells Brian that the {{relationship}} will not succeed. Brian visits Jillian's apartment to end the relationship (with Stewie waiting in his car), but he is distracted by her naked body when she answers the door and he has sex with her instead.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews.

[...] Lyons also complimented a number of changes in the series the episode seemed to indicate, including shifting allegiances, goodwill where there used to be bad and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode, [...] "started off seeming like <b>a</b> <b>dumb</b> and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to be a fun, and even welcome, diversion." [...] Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones, but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together, and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond, [...] "even as he treated her like a racehorse". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, described the episode as [...] "a wacky and wonderful little gem, one of those rare ones where it was just wall-to-wall happy, giddy fun, with not a drop of pathos, except for maybe Michael whining about having to eat lunch by himself." [...] McAuliffe also said he was glad to see Erin's [...] "cheerful, appealingly goofy personality" [...] continue to emerge.|$|E
500|$|Zenna, Chancer and Kyte were {{occasional}} {{targets of}} professional jealousy from their human co-stars, and some television critics {{have suggested that}} Wellard was a better character than his owner, Robbie. When Michael Greco commented in 2002 that Wellard received better scripts than his character, Beppe di Marco, the Sunday Mirror Ian Hyland wrote: [...] "He should try being Robbie Jackson. Wellard gets better scripts and better girls than him." [...] Similarly, Garry Bushell of The People compared EastEnders with rival soap Coronation Street following a 2003 scheduling clash, observing: [...] "ITV had Richard Hillman's heavyweight murder confession. BBC1 gave us Robbie Jackson's heart-to-heart with Wellard. (Don't scoff– it's tough to play moving scenes with <b>a</b> <b>dumb</b> and soppy creature, but Wellard rose to the occasion.)". Derek McGovern of The Mirror criticised Gaffney's acting ability, observing: [...] "Outside of Lassie movies I haven't seen a dog consistently steal scenes off a human the way Wellard used to pinch them from Dean." [...] Gemma Bissix appeared in the show as a child actor from 1993 to 1998, playing Clare Bates. She commented on her return in 2008 that as a child, the dogs playing Wellard were better paid than she was. When Emma Barton, who played Honey Mitchell, was axed from the soap later that year, she spoke of her dismay that Wellard's death was being marketed as a bigger storyline than her character's exit. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury called it [...] "particularly galling" [...] that Barton's exit was upstaged by Wellard's death.|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, Buckman said that in the episode [...] "she delivered her lines capably" [...] and that her role as Liz was with [...] "admirable gusto." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker noted that the singer's appearance was [...] "one of the worst, if most fascinating, celebrity cameos I've ever witnessed." [...] Tucker said that [...] "Madonna-as-TV-actress" [...] defeated [...] "Madonna-as-movie-actress" [...] primarily because [...] "she was paired with a pro like [...] Mullally and had less screen time than she did in her most recent movie dud, Swept Away. According to David Kronke for the Whittier Daily News, [...] "Madonna may have put the kibosh on her video, but not on her guest appearance as Karen's... new best bosom buddy." [...] While Charleston Daily Mails Kevin McDonough reported that Madonna appearing on Will & Grace was [...] "clearly a reprise" [...] of singer Cher's guest stints on the episodes [...] "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] and [...] "A.I.: Artificial Insemination". McDonough wrote that the cameos made by Cher [...] "made sense", and that the latter [...] "has an ability to laugh at herself that Madonna has never exhibited." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald said Will & Grace had been [...] "guilty of some pretty poor stunt casting" [...] and included Madonna as a primary example.

And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody.

[...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E
