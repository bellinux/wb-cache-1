The subjects of the study were 175 students of Pondok Pesantren Nasyrul Ulum Pamekasan, consist of 96 boys and 79 girls. Data were collected by scales of emotional <b>intelligent,</b> spiritual <b>intelligent,</b> <b>and</b> pro-social behavior. The data analysis used multiple regression analysis and then correlations. Results of multiple regression analysis showed that the emotional <b>intelligent</b> <b>and</b> spiri-tual <b>intelligent</b> have a significant relation with prosocial behavior. The result of correlation analyses between either emotional intelligence or spiri-tual intelligence with prosocial behavior showed a positive correlation signify-cantly. Variables of emotional <b>intelligent</b> <b>and</b> spiritual <b>intelligent</b> give effect-tive contribution toward prosocial behavior about 55, 1 %...|$|R

5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} <b>and</b> <b>intelligent</b> with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Massenet was {{regarded}} by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted <b>and</b> <b>intelligent</b> products of the Belle Époque.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism <b>and</b> <b>intelligent</b> design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E

He was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, which led him to {{restrain}} the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.|$|E
5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, <b>and</b> <b>intelligent</b> design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} set during the Elizabethan era (15581603). The {{principal}} character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), is the great-grandson {{of the original}} Black Adder, {{and is now a}} member of the London aristocracy. Unlike his forefather, he is both dashing <b>and</b> <b>intelligent,</b> although he is still scheming and cynical in his outlook. The series follows his attempts to win the favour of the childish Queen Elizabeth I (Miranda Richardson). As before he is aided, and often hindered, by two less-than-intelligent sidekicks, his servant Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny), heir to the Duchy of Northumberland, with whom Blackadder has a grudging friendship.|$|E

Her rise to power is aided by the historic birth of three dragons, hatched from eggs given to her as wedding gifts. The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her bloodline and her legitimate claim to the throne, but also devastating weapons of war.|$|E

Le Gris was an able, amiable <b>and</b> <b>intelligent</b> man and soon {{became one of the}} new Count's favourites. When Count Pierre moved his court to Argentan, Le Gris lent him 3,000 livres and, in reward, was confirmed as Seigneur of Exmes and given a valuable estate at Arnou-le-Faucon. As Le Gris rose in his lord's esteem, the poorer Carrouges was frequently overlooked, resulting in a deterioration in their friendship which was only worsened by the death of Carrouges' wife and son in 1380, severing the men's family ties.|$|E
5|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Villa {{is regarded}} by pundits {{as one of}} the best forwards of his generation, and one of the best Spanish strikers of all-time. An opportunistic, versatile and well-rounded player, Villa is naturally right-footed, but an accurate and powerful finisher with either foot, due to his ambidexterity, both inside and outside the area, despite his lack of height or physicality; he is also a set piece and penalty kick specialist. Villa is a quick, agile, and mobile team player, with excellent technique and dribbling skills, who is also known for his work-rate <b>and</b> <b>intelligent</b> offensive movement, as well as his ability to either create space for teammates or make attacking runs into the area. Due to his vision and passing ability, he is also capable of dropping deep to link up play with midfielders, and of creating chances and providing assists for teammates, which has allowed him to be deployed as a supporting forward, as an attacking midfielder or as a winger throughout his career, in addition to his more common role as a centre-forward.|$|E
5|$|However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul {{basketball}} coach Ray Meyer, who saw {{potential in the}} bright <b>and</b> <b>intelligent,</b> but also clumsy and shy, freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, {{because at the time}} it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.|$|E
