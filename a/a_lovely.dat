5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> ovation {{from their}} supporters {{and it was the}} same at Yeovil last year. He got <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
5|$|Having finally embraced film-making, Gielgud {{appeared}} in six films in 1967–69. His most substantial role was Lord Raglan in Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade. His other roles, in films including Michael Anderson's The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) as a fictional pope and Richard Attenborough's Oh! What <b>a</b> <b>Lovely</b> War (1969) as Count Leopold Berchtold, were cameo appearances in character roles.|$|E
5|$|Last year I decided I'm {{not doing}} music until I'm excited again, then this {{came along and}} also I did end up making another record which I'll release at some point. It's just being mastered, it's <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> album; I didn't write this one, this is old songs and I have to sort out my situation- I don't want the same problem as before.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Vidya Balan came with Sarkar's prior work {{experience}} {{with her in}} three music videos. Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested {{for six months and}} only then they were sure of her acting abilities. Saif once said that he was not convinced of Vidya's abilities, since Parineeta was to be her first film. He instead hoped to work with established actresses like Aishwarya Rai or Rani Mukherjee. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of Lalita, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance. Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> character to portray made Vidya accept the role of Lalita.|$|E

5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot see such <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> thing every day, to which he replies: Indeed! indeed! clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly behind the screen.|$|E
5|$|The six {{warehouse}} workers win $950,000in {{a lottery}} pool, and quit in a celebratory fashion of {{running through the}} office, making a mess and mooning the staff. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) was originally part of the pool but stopped when he was promoted, and falls into a depression, unable to find any motivation to work and further dismayed when his ex-wife's response to him not winning is {{to ask for the}} phone number of his pool-winner friend Glenn. Everyone else speculates how they would spend a hypothetical lottery score, with Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) ultimately deciding to fuse their two main ideas into one for <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> brownstone located in the great outdoors.|$|E

5|$|Deighton {{authored}} two television scripts, {{the first}} of which was Long Past Glory in 1963; he also wrote a film script, Oh! What <b>a</b> <b>Lovely</b> War (1969). His long-held interest in cooking—his mother had been a professional chef and instilled a love for cuisine in her son—led to an illustrated cookery column in the Sunday newspaper, The Observer, for two years. The work was collected into two later books, Len Deighton's Action Cookbook and Où est le garlic (both 1965); he subsequently wrote several other cookery books. Deighton has produced several other works of non-fiction, including a study of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a history of the airship, Second World War military history and a short e-book about James Bond.|$|E
5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and {{is confined to}} the couch for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean his room and while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his things. At school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up pulling his prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off of her seat and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign exchange program. They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown a picture of <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> château {{in the heart of}} France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E

60|$|The less abrupt declivities of {{the rock}} are covered with grass, and afford food for a few sheep, who scamper about the heights, and seem to have {{attained}} the dexterity of goats in clambering.

60|$|He {{stood up}} in the phaeton, and by this means he could see over the hedge. Margery still sat listlessly in the same place; there was not <b>a</b> <b>lovelier</b> flower in the field.
