But in this study, this is not possible. These findings are but the bases for the discovery of further possibilities of study in the field of public opinion. Therefore,instead of statements, this conclusion is suggesting a series of questions which may open the doors upon untouched fields of study.; The concluding step of this thesis classified zones as to their degree of mobility. What would be theresults if these areas were contrasted with other zones such as zones of transition; zones of economic levels; and cultural and racial groups?; In these zones of high mobility, are the residents mostly transients or do they own their homes? <b>Are</b> <b>these</b> <b>zones</b> a part of a larger area of disintegration?

30|$|In this study, {{we found}} a zone of {{distinct}} north dipping high reflection strengths at depths of 21 – 30  km (X = − 20 to 0, Y = − 35 to 3), which we call the S wave reflector. We calculated the averaged value and standard deviation of reflection strengths using the data for all the blocks, where reflection strengths were obtained. Then, {{we found that the}} reflection strengths in the S wave reflector are within one standard deviation (σ) from the mean value. Katsumata (2010) reported the depth of the Moho and the Conrad discontinuities beneath the Japanese islands. According to Katsumata (2010), the Conrad discontinuity exists at depth of 15 – 20  km in this district. Therefore, it is thought that the high reflection strengths zone is not the Conrad discontinuity. We also found small zones of high reflection strengths at depths of 32 – 34  km (R 3), 28 – 32  km (R 4) and 32 – 35  km (R 5). Katsumata (2010) estimated the depth of the Moho discontinuity is deeper than 34  km near <b>these</b> <b>zones.</b> Since <b>these</b> <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> basically located deeper than the Moho discontinuity and the extents of <b>these</b> <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> limited in small portions, it <b>is</b> likely that <b>these</b> <b>zones</b> do not reflect the Moho discontinuity but heterogeneities in the crust.|$|R
