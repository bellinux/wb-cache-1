The Civil War period film Shenandoah (1965) and the western family film The Rare Breed fared better at the box office; the Civil War movie, with strong antiwar and humanitarian themes, was a hit in the South.|$|E
25|$|The second room {{houses the}} Topkapı Dagger. The golden hilt is ornamented with three large emeralds, {{topped by a}} golden watch with an emerald lid. The golden {{scabbard}} is covered with diamonds and enamel. In 1747, the Sultan Mahmud I had this dagger made for Nader Shah of Persia, but the Shah was assassinated {{in connection with a}} revolt before the emissary had left the Ottoman Empire's boundaries. This dagger gained more fame <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the heist depicted of the film Topkapi. In the middle of the second room stands the walnut throne of Ahmed I, inlaid with nacre and tortoise shell, built by Sedekhar Mehmed Agha. Below the baldachin hangs a golden pendant with a large emerald. The next displays show the ostentatious aigrettes of the sultans and their horses, studded with diamonds, emeralds and rubies. A jade bowl, shaped like a vessel, was a present of Czar Nicholas II of Russia.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{is similar}} to the {{conversation}} poems created by Coleridge, including Dejection: An Ode. The poems were not real conversations as there is no response to the narrator of the poem, but they are written as if there would be a response. The poems seek to have a response, though it never comes, and the possibility of such a voice though absence is a type of prosopopoeia. In general, Coleridge's poems discuss the cosmic as they long for a response, and it is this aspect, not a possible object of the conversation, that forms the power of the poem. Wordsworth took up the form in both Tintern Abbey and Ode: Intimations of Immortality, but he lacks the generous treatment of the narrator as found in Coleridge's poems. As a whole, Wordsworth's technique is impersonal and more logical, and the narrator is placed in the same position <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the conversation. The narrator of Wordsworth is more self-interested and any object beyond the narrator is kept without a possible voice and is turned into a second self of the poet. As such, the conversation has one of the participants lose his identity {{for the sake of the}} other and that individual represents loss and mortality.|$|E

25|$|After Morgoth's defeat, his {{lieutenant}} Sauron gradually rallied many of Morgoth's {{servants to}} his own cause, and during the Second Age established himself {{in the land of}} Mordor. Sauron lacked the raw power and malice of his master, but he seduced many to his allegiance with lies and false promises. In the Second Age, Sauron repeatedly used his fame among Men as Morgoth's erstwhile lieutenant to portray himself as Morgoth's representative and thus gain the allegiance of his former master's worshippers. Similarly, in Númenor following his capture, Sauron became very powerful by seducing Ar-Pharazôn to the worship of Melkor, establishing a Cult in which it was only natural that, as Melkor's foremost former disciple, he became high priest. This cult exploited the Númenórean fear of death by claiming that human sacrifice to Melkor would grant the Men of Númenor immortality. In actuality, by turning away from Eru and the Valar they only dwindled more rapidly. Sauron used this religion among his means of encouraging Ar-Pharazôn's invasion of Valinor, which resulted in the destruction of Númenor by Eru. By the Third Age Sauron came more often to propound himself, rather than Morgoth, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> worship for his servants and subjects, but in his pride also portrayed himself as Morgoth returned when it was more convenient for him to do so.|$|E

O'Hara became such good friends with Anna Lee during the shooting that she later named her daughter Bronwyn after Lee's character. The film was lauded by the critics, and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture. Both O'Hara and co-star Walter Pidgeon, who played the minister, were praised for their performances, with Variety writing that [...] "Maureen O'Hara splendid <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> his unrequited love, who marries the mine owner's son out of pique".|$|E
500|$|Caligari and German Expressionism heavily {{influenced}} the American film noir {{period of the}} 1940s and 50s, both in visual style and narrative tone. Noir films tended to portray everyone, even the innocent, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> suspicion, a common thread in Caligari. [...] The genre also employs several Expressionistic elements in its dark and shadowy visual style, stylized and abstract photography, and distorted and expressive make-up and acting. Caligari also influenced films produced in the Soviet Union, such as Aelita (1924), and The Overcoat. Observers have noted {{the black and white}} films of Ingmar Bergman bear a resemblance to the German films of the 1920s, and film historian Roy Armes has called him [...] "the true heir of Caligari". Bergman himself, however, has downplayed the influence of German Expressionism on his work. Caligari has also affected stage theatre. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the film's use of the iris-in has been mimicked in theatrical productions, with lighting used to single out a lone actor.|$|E

500|$|Peking {{opera and}} its stylistic devices have {{appeared}} in many Chinese films. [...] It often was used to signify a unique [...] "Chineseness" [...] in contrast to sense of culture being presented in Japanese films. [...] Fei Mu, {{a director of the}} pre-Communist era, used Peking opera in a number of plays, sometimes within [...] "Westernized", realistic plots. [...] King Hu, a later Chinese film director, used many of the formal norms of Peking opera in his films, such as the parallelism between music, voice, and gesture. [...] In the 1993 film Farewell My Concubine, by Chen Kaige, Peking opera serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> pursuit for the protagonists and a backdrop for their romance.

500|$|The dolphin's {{search for}} food is {{aided by a}} form of sonar known as echolocation: it locates objects by {{producing}} sounds and listening for the echos. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam {{in front of the}} dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an [...] "echoic image" [...] or sound picture of their targets.|$|E
