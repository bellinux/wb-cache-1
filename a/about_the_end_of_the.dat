5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war.

5|$|Saved {{from death}} by his cousin Gavril Radomir, the Bulgarian Emperor, in 976, Ivan Vladislav murdered him in October 1015 and seized the Bulgarian throne. Due to the desperate {{situation}} of the country following the decades-long war with the Byzantine Empire, and {{in an attempt to}} consolidate his position, he tried to negotiate truce with the Byzantine emperor Basil II. After the failure of the negotiations he continued the resistance, attempting unsuccessfully to push the Byzantines back. During his period of rule, Ivan Vladislav tried to strengthen the Bulgarian army, reconstructed many Bulgarian fortresses and even carried out a counter-offensive, but he died at the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1018. After his death his widow, Empress Maria, the Patriarch and most of the nobility finally surrendered to Basil II, who soon suppressed the last remnants of resistance and brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 French Open Men's singles {{semifinal}} between world No. 2 Novak Djokovic {{and world}} No. 3 Roger Federer was a historic encounter that brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest winning streak in almost 30 years. Djokovic entered the match undefeated {{for the first}} five months of the year having gone 41–0 with a total winning streak of 43 matches (his last loss had come against Federer at the World Tour Finals). It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer. Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011, however, Federer shocked many by taking the first two sets. Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade and it was clear that if the match went to a fifth set {{it would have to be}} continued the next day. Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5–4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker.|$|E

5|$|Like most film {{adaptations of}} Dick's works, {{many aspects of}} his story were changed in their {{transition}} to film, such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Northern Virginia. The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film's action scenes. The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton's, {{and that of the}} three pre-cogs. In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased. Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively. The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts. Anderton's future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog's mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film's ending also differs from the short story's. In Dick's story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization. Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a punch card machine to interpret the precogs' visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.|$|E
5|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, {{after leading}} the United States {{through much of}} the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt had {{suffered}} from polio since 1921 and had helped found and strongly supported the March of Dimes to fight that crippling disease, so the ten-cent piece was an obvious way of honoring a president popular for his war leadership. On May 3, Louisiana Representative James Hobson Morrison introduced a bill for a Roosevelt dime. On May 17, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. announced that the Mercury dime (also known as the Winged Liberty dime) would be replaced by a new coin depicting Roosevelt, to go into circulation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. Approximately 90 percent of the letters received by Stuart Mosher, editor of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association), were supportive of the change, but he himself was not, arguing that the Mercury design was beautiful and that the limited space on the dime would not do justice to Roosevelt; he advocated a commemorative silver dollar instead. Others objected that despite his merits, Roosevelt had not earned a place alongside Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, the only presidents honored on the circulating coinage to that point. As the Mercury design, first coined in 1916, had been struck for at least 25 years, it could be changed under the law by the Bureau of the Mint. No congressional action was required, though the committees of each house with jurisdiction over the coinage were informed.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{gain insight}} into {{decisions}} made in general practice <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> life. DESIGN [...] Study I: interviews with 405 physicians. Study II: analysis of death certificates with data obtained on 5197 cases in which decisions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> life may have been made. Study III: prospective study with doctors from study I: questionnaires used to collect information <b>about</b> 2257 deaths. <b>The</b> information was representative for all deaths in the Netherlands. RESULTS [...] Over two fifths of all patients in the Netherlands die at home. General practitioners took fewer decisions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> life than hospital doctors and doctors in nursing homes (34 %, 40 %, and 56 % of all dying patients, respectively). Specifically, decisions to withhold or withdraw treatment to prolong life were taken less often. Euthanasia or assisted suicide, however, was performed in 3. 2 % of all deaths in general practice compared with 1. 4 % in hospital practice. In {{over half of the}} cases concerning pain relief or non-treatment general practitioners did not discuss the decision with the patient, mostly because of incapacity of the patient, but in 20 % of cases for "paternalistic" reasons. Older general practitioners discussed such decisions less often with their patients. Colleagues were consulted more often if the general practitioner worked in group practice. CONCLUSION [...] Differences in work situation between general practitioners and hospital doctors and differences between the group of general practitioners contribute to differences in the number and type <b>of</b> decisions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> life {{as well as in the}} decision making process...|$|R
