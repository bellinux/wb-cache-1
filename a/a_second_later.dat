5|$|Johnson was loaned {{out to the}} Belgian club Royal Antwerp in January 2004 {{where he}} made 11appearances, scoring five goals, {{including}} a 20-yard strike on his debut against Heusden-Zolder. In July 2004, he was sent on loan to Championship-side Coventry City for the 2004–05 season {{in order to gain}} first-team experience. He scored on his Coventry debut in a 2–0 victory against Sunderland on 7 August 2004, before he scored <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>later</b> that month in a 4–1 defeat of Nottingham Forest. Johnson did not score again until October, when he scored three times in four games, but they proved to be his last goals of the season. He finished his stay with Coventry with 26appearances.|$|E
25|$|Several factors came {{together}} for Frazier in this fight. He was 27 {{years old and}} at his boxing peak physically and mentally, Ali, 29, was coming back from a three-year absence but had kept active. He had had two good wins, including a bruising battle with Oscar Bonavena, whom Ali had defeated by a TKO in 15 rounds. Frazier worked on strategy with coach Eddie Futch. They noted Ali's tendency to throw a right-hand uppercut from a straight standing position after dropping the hand in preparation to throw it with force. Futch instructed Frazier to watch Ali's right hand and, at the moment Ali dropped it, to throw a left hook {{at the spot where}} they knew Ali's face would be <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>later.</b> Frazier staggered Ali in the 11th round and knocked down Ali in the 15th in this way.|$|E

25|$|Gordon {{has participated}} in the Race of Champions three times, {{including}} a Nations Cup-winning drive with Team USA's Jimmie Johnson and Colin Edwards at the 2002 event in Gran Canaria. Prior to the ROC, Gordon competed in an ROC America event, losing to Kenny Bräck after crashing. Afterwards, Gordon defeated Johnson by one sixteen-hundredth of <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>Later</b> in the day, Gordon rode with rally driver Marcus Grönholm around the course, both eventually flipping. In the ROC's first round, Gordon (2:03.03) lost to 2002 CART champion Cristiano da Matta, but in round two, Gordon (1:53.47) defeated Formula One's Fernando Alonso. In the semi-finals, Gordon (1:53.20) won against CART driver Sébastien Bourdais, and in the finals, Gordon (1:53.87) triumphed against European Touring Car Championship driver Fabrizio Giovanardi. He was slated to run it again in 2004 against seven-time F1 World Champion Michael Schumacher but was sidelined by the flu, and Casey Mears took his place. In 2005, Gordon competed in the Race of Champions event again, this time held in Paris, France, where he was partnered with motocross racer/X Games winner Travis Pastrana.|$|E
500|$|Martin Cross, {{writing in}} The Guardian, said the race {{provided}} [...] "a thrilling finish and renewed interest from the public", Christopher Dodd in The Independent called the race [...] "stupendous, a titanic struggle of will", while Rachel Quarrell of The Daily Telegraph declared Oxford's victory as [...] "epic" [...] {{and suggested that}} [...] "there {{will never be a}} better Boat Race." [...] Simon Barnes of The Times described the finish: [...] "At the finishing line, the bobble of the Oxford bow was inches in front, <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>later,</b> it was inches behind.

500|$|To {{give the}} astronauts {{experience}} {{with how the}} LM would fly on its final landing descent, NASA commissioned Bell Aircraft to build two Lunar Landing Research Vehicles, later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV). Nicknamed the [...] "Flying Bedsteads", they simulated the Moon's one-sixth of Earth's gravity by using a turbofan engine to support the remaining five-sixths of the craft's weight. On May 6, 1968, about 100feet (30m) above the ground, Armstrong's controls started to degrade and the LLTV began banking. He ejected safely (later analysis suggested {{that if he had}} ejected half <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>later,</b> his parachute would not have opened in time). His only injury was from biting his tongue. Even though he was nearly killed, Armstrong maintained that without the LLRV and LLTV, the lunar landings would not have been successful, as they gave commanders valuable experience in the behavior of lunar landing craft.|$|E

[...] The captain acknowledged. At 21:32:49, Klotz radioed the controller, informing him that the flight had [...] "just ah lost two engines and...we need priority please." [...] The controller instructed the flight to fly southwest to intercept the localizer. Klotz acknowledged this. The flight crew selected the ILS. At 21:33:04, the controller informed the flight that they were fifteen miles from the outer marker and cleared them for an ILS approach on runway 22L. Klotz acknowledged. That was the final radio transmission from Flight 52. Caviedes asked if the ILS had been selected. Klotz replied, [...] "It is ready on two" [...] at 21:33:23. One second later, the CVR stopped recording. At 21:34:00, the controller tried to radio the flight, asking, [...] "You have enough fuel {{to make it to}} the airport?"

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] <b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>later,</b> a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!", and then [...] "Give it to me!"

2500|$|The {{final version}} of the Fokker Eindecker, the Fokker E.IV, came with two lMG 08 [...] "Spandau" [...] machine guns and this {{armament}} became standard for all the German D-type scouts starting with the Albatros D.I. From the appearance of the Sopwith Camel and the SPAD S.XIII in mid 1917 right through to the end of gun synchronization in the 1950s a twin gun installation was the international norm. Having the two guns firing simultaneously would obviously not have been a satisfactory arrangement; the guns needed to both fire at the same point on the propeller disc, which means that one would fire a tiny fraction of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>later</b> than the other. This is why early gears designed for a single machine gun needed to be modified in order to control two guns satisfactorily.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first officer}} {{called for the}} arming of the {{spoilers}} one second after touchdown, and the commander armed them half <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>later.</b> Two seconds later the first officer called [...] "no spoilers" [...] as the spoiler indicator light had not switched on. He then verified the hydraulic pressure and that the switch was set correctly. Meanwhile, the commander had switched the thrust levers from flight idle to ground idle, and six seconds after touchdown activated the wheel brakes. From 12.8 seconds after touchdown various screeching sounds can be heard from the tires. The braking took place nominally until halfway down the runway. From this point the pilots reported that nominal retardation did not occur. The commander attempted to use the brake pedals to apply full braking, without effect. He then moved the brake lever from green to yellow and subsequently emergency brake, disconnecting the anti-lock. Witnesses observed smoke and spray emitted from the landing gear.|$|E

2500|$|As {{currently}} accepted, {{the species}} was first scientifically described by John Whitchurch Bennett in 1830 {{based on the}} holotype specimen taken from the south coast of Sri Lanka. He named this new species Scomber heberi, placing it in the mackerel genus which {{at that time was}} a common genus for placing carangid fishes. The origin of the specific epithet is unclear, with it possibly named after someone or relate to the German word Heber, meaning [...] "lob". With the creation of the genus Caranx, the species was transferred there, where it has remained. There is some confusion over a species described by Peter Forsskål in 1775 under the name Scomber sansun and later transferred to Caranx sansun. This species is still listed as valid by some authorities, although a 1968 review of the taxon by J.L.B. Smith failed to find the holotype and suggested a new name with holotype be introduced to replace it; Caranx williamsi. This name was sunk into C. heberi by William Smith-Vaniz in a major review, indicating C. sansun also should be sunk. Despite this, the name remains valid amongst some authorities. <b>A</b> <b>second,</b> <b>later</b> independent description of the fish by Georges Cuvier produced the name Caranx sem, which became common throughout the literature. Probable synonymy with C. heberi was recognized by Henry Fowler in 1905 ...|$|E
2500|$|We flew at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, and I found myself higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. I kept the throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I realized that I was in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>later,</b> I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E
