5|$|The two {{go ahead}} with their plans to meet Alex, who brings along his friend, Junior (Chaddha) to the hotel. The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an {{argument}} between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four {{head back to the}} hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to leave later that night. Alex notices the guitar and later forces Sahil to play for him, to which Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks even more impressed with Sahil's artistry. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do not talk <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> had happened.|$|E
25|$|Operation Banquet was a British plan to {{use every}} {{available}} aircraft to repel a threatened German invasion in 1940 or 1941. During the Second World War, in May 1940, the Air Ministry realised that beyond the normal reserves of the Royal Air Force (RAF), {{it may be necessary}} to throw everything into a last-ditch battle for British liberty. To this end, the Air Ministry planned to use just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could fly. On 17 May 1940, an Air Ministry meeting outlined a series of ambitious plans to make use of various aircraft in the event of an invasion.|$|E
25|$|Recreational {{fishing is}} done for {{pleasure}} or sport, and not for profit or survival. Just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard {{with the intent to}} catch a fish. Usually some form of fishing tackle is brought on board, such as hooks, lines, sinkers or nets. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, kayaks, rafts, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs. Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing.|$|E

50|$|Peter Gabriel {{has said}} that the song is about a {{relationship}} in which the woman is sophisticated, bright, cultured, and knows everything <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> and <b>that</b> the man knows nothing <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> except, he does know about the woman, and she doesn't know much about herself.|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid, since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing. Just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisherman periodically climbs aboard {{with the intent to}} catch a fish. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, kayaks, rafts, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs.

500|$|The Killing Joke is a {{story about}} Batman and the Joker; it isn't <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you're ever going to {{encounter}} in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived. So there's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah, it was something that I thought was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance. It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.|$|E
500|$|Captive oscars may be fed {{prepared}} {{fish food}} designed for large carnivorous fish: crayfish, worms, and insects (such as flies, crickets and grasshoppers). Feeding live foods {{may increase the}} rate of growth but also may cause endoparasites. Poultry and/or mammalian flesh, including beefheart, should not be fed long term as these fatty foods will contribute to fatty liver disease. Since these fish eat fruit in the wild, items such as melons, oranges, and other fruits can also be used as a type of food. Just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> falls into the water would be eaten by oscars. Live feeder fish can be given, but fish such as goldfish and rosy red feeder minnows should not be fed. These contain an enzyme (thiaminase) within their flesh which binds vitamin B1, leading to deficiency. Most fish eaten by A. ocellatus in the wild are relatively sedentary catfish, including Bunocephalus, Rineloricaria, and Ochmacanthus species. The species uses a suction mechanism to capture prey, and has been reported to exhibit [...] "laying-on-side" [...] death mimicry in a similar fashion to Parachromis friedrichsthalii and Nimbochromis livingstonii. The species also has an absolute requirement for vitamin C, and develops health problems in its absence.|$|E

500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from {{what we did in}} The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E
2500|$|One noted potter from Tonalá is Jorge Wilmont. While his {{background}} {{is in the}} Tonalá tradition, {{he has been in}} the forefront of innovation of the craft. So many of his innovations have been adopted by so many potters in the area that just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> departs from tradition shows Wilmot's influence. [...] Today, Wilmot lives in San Pablo del Monte in Tlaxcala, where he advises potters from there and the neighboring state of Puebla.|$|E

2500|$|The Anderson {{had been}} {{acquired}} by Daniel Bachhelder Jackson (1833–1895) who was organizing the Washington Steamboat Company. Starting in about 1890, Eliza Anderson was laid {{up on the}} Duwamish River during the financial crises of the early 1890s, and would have rotted away there except for the discovery of gold in the Yukon Territory. [...] Gold seekers were willing to book passage on just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> floated, and the owners of various dubious craft seized their chance. [...] By this time, Anderson had been tied up for quite some time, and had been functioning not as a steamboat but a roadhouse and gambling hall.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{took the}} title from {{a passage in}} Paradise Lost where Adam says to Eve that their {{expulsion}} from Paradise [...] "will prove no sudden but a slow pac'd evil,/ A Long Day's Dying to augment our pain," [...] and {{with the exception of}} the old lady Maroo, what all the characters seem to be dying of is loneliness, emptiness, sterility, and such preoccupation with themselves and their own problems that they are unable to communicate with each other <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> really matters to them very much. I am sure that I chose such a melancholy theme partly because it seemed effective and fashionable, but I have no doubt that, like dreams generally, it also reflected the way I felt about at least some dimension of my own life and the lives of those around me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After touring {{for nearly}} two years, the Wallflowers took a short break before {{returning}} to the studio to record their third album, (Breach). [...] Dylan approached the songwriting process differently this time than he had for the Wallflowers' two previous albums, explaining that he didn't want to avoid the subject of his personal life, as he had done in the past: [...] "(Breach) was the first record that I realized that it's necessary and I have a right to write <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I want to write about. [...] I'm not going to dance around these subjects anymore [...] [...] [...] I don't have any interest in writing songs that are defensive or that address anything that don't come naturally to me but I also realized that I needed to stop this nonsense of pretending that hiding any of this information counts to anybody; it just doesn't really matter anymore." ...|$|E

50|$|Though Bancroft {{had worked}} for Franklin and Deane, he was unenthusiastic about American independence, and the {{possibility}} of a French war against Britain alarmed him.

5000|$|But that, {{all this}} aside, {{there is another}} problem: that with all its wonderfulnesses, the book—even better plotted (and still better plotable)—does not have a reason; it's a {{brilliant}} exercise in invention, but unlike CATCH 22 and MOTHER KISSES and V and the others, it isn't really <b>about</b> <b>anything.</b> And <b>that's</b> something no one can do <b>anything</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Figgis {{encouraged}} the lead actors to experience their characters' ordeals first-hand by extensive research. He told Film Critic: [...] "It {{was just a}} week and a half of rehearsal. A lot of conversations. A lot of communication in the year before we made the film. Reading the book. I {{encouraged the}}m [...] to do their own research, which they wanted to do anyway, and then ultimately the three of us got together and just started talking...talking about anything, not necessarily about the film or the script, <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> came up". Cage researched by binge drinking in Dublin for two weeks and had a friend videotape him so he could study his speech. He also visited hospitalized career alcoholics. He said [...] "it was one of the most enjoyable pieces of research I've ever had to do for a part." [...] Shue spent time interviewing several Las Vegas prostitutes.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike fashion-focused {{magazines}} and television shows, fashion blogs {{are able to}} be updated more frequently, keeping up to date with the new and up-and-coming fashion trends. [...] Not only are fashion blogs easier to access, many fashion blog readers (interviewed in Swedish fashion management study) stated that fashion blogs are far more personable and are more 'up to date' on both local and foreign trends. [...] These blogs are granting unlimited access to the fashion world to anyone that has a connection to a computer. Karen Kay also stated that, “These days, before a designer’s runway show has even finished, you can bet your bottom dollar that someone in the audience, or better still, backstage, has recorded every silhouette, signature shoe, styling detail and sulking supermodel, then uploaded it onto the internet for style watchers across the globe to enjoy”. The interviewed Swedish fashion blog readers, stated above, had also stated that fashion blogs had helped share and promote new trends to a much greater extent than other fashion mediums. [...] Unlike mainstream {{magazines and}} newspapers, which are constricted to what they write, blogs have the ease of writing <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> interests author(s), allowing for a more broad spectrum of focused fashion trends.|$|E
