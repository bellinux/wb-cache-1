5|$|A global {{strategy}} {{to stem the}} crisis was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the <b>Amphibian</b> Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail <b>amphibian</b> declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The <b>Amphibian</b> Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for <b>amphibian</b> conservation. <b>Amphibian</b> Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama <b>Amphibian</b> Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E

5|$|However, {{since this}} initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in <b>amphibian</b> populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of studies that monitored <b>amphibian</b> populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in <b>amphibian</b> populations are truly global in nature.|$|E

5000|$|... "Herp" [...] is a vernacular {{term for}} non-avian {{reptiles}} and <b>amphibians.</b> It {{is derived from}} the old term [...] "herpetile", with roots back to Linnaeus's classification of animals, in which he grouped reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> together in the same class. There are over 6700 species of <b>amphibians</b> and over 9000 species of reptiles. In spite of its modern taxonomic irrelevance, the term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of non-avian reptiles and <b>amphibians,</b> and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and <b>amphibians.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{decline in}} <b>amphibian</b> populations {{is an ongoing}} mass {{extinction}} of <b>amphibian</b> species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in <b>amphibian</b> populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are {{known as one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity, and several causes are believed to be involved, including disease, habitat destruction and modification, exploitation, pollution, pesticide use, introduced species, and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of <b>amphibian</b> declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on extinction rates suggest that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the background extinction rate and the estimate goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European <b>amphibian</b> species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining <b>amphibian</b> populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amphibian</b> skin is {{permeable}} to water. Gas exchange {{can take}} place through the skin (cutaneous respiration) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising {{to the surface of}} water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds. To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of <b>amphibian</b> have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some <b>amphibian</b> toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect. The main poison-producing glands, the paratoids, produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.|$|E
40|$|BOX. Recommendations for {{preventing}} transmission of Salmonella from reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> to humans • Pet store owners, health-care practitioners, and veterinarians should provide information to owners and potential purchasers of reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> {{about the risk}} for acquiring salmonellosis from their pets. • Persons should always wash their hands {{with soap and water}} after handling reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> or their cages. • Persons at increased risk for infection with serious complications from salmonellosis (e. g., children aged < 5 years and immunocompromised persons) should avoid contact with reptiles and <b>amphibians.</b> • Reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> should be kept out of households with children aged < 5 years or immunocompromised persons. Families expecting a new child should give away their pet reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> away before the infant arrives. • Reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> should not be kept in child-care centers. • Reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> {{should not be allowed to}} roam freely throughout the house. • Reptiles and <b>amphibians</b> should be kept out of kitchens and other food-preparation areas to prevent contamination. Kitchen sinks should not be used to bathe pets or to wash their dishes, cages, or aquariums. If bathtubs are used for these purposes, they should be thoroughly cleaned afterward...|$|R

5|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} <b>amphibian</b> populations, {{including}} population crashes and mass localized extinction, {{have been noted}} since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and <b>amphibian</b> declines are thus perceived {{to be one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity. In 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds, mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.|$|E

5|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} for extinction of amphibians at the K–Pg boundary. A study of fossil vertebrates across the K–Pg boundary in Montana concluded that no species of <b>amphibian</b> became extinct. Yet {{there are several}} species of Maastrichtian <b>amphibian,</b> not included {{as part of this}} study, which are unknown from the Paleocene. These include the frog Theatonius lancensis and the albanerpetontid Albanerpeton galaktion; therefore, some amphibians do seem to have become extinct at the boundary. The relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} die offs was the chytrid, climate change {{played a pivotal role}} in the extinctions.

50|$|Some {{characteristics}} of <b>amphibians</b> {{that are more}} likely to be susceptible to the disease are the lack of various developed microbiota that live and breed on the dermis of the species as well the underdeveloped immune system in specific <b>amphibians.</b> Species that tend to breed in flowing water which washes away the microbiota from the skin of <b>amphibians</b> {{are more likely to}} become infected. Organizations across the world have tried to implement rules and regulations for the transportation of <b>amphibians</b> across borders to prevent the continued decline of <b>amphibians</b> however progress has been slow. To add to the slow progress, the only cure that exists for chytrid fungus is found within laboratories for <b>amphibians</b> in captivity. Because of this, there is no known way for eradicating the disease in the wild.|$|R

5|$|Fungi have a {{worldwide}} distribution, and grow {{in a wide}} range of habitats, including extreme environments such as deserts or areas with high salt concentrations or ionizing radiation, as well as in deep sea sediments. Some can survive the intense UV and cosmic radiation encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for {{a worldwide}} decline in <b>amphibian</b> populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its <b>amphibian</b> host.
