First, it briefly summarizes the history of auditing throughout the world and in the Czech Republic. It analyses the meaning and objectives of the statutory audit and explains the triangular relationship between the auditor, management of the entity and its owners. The description of a typical course of <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement</b> is accompanied by cautionary advice for intricate aspects of acceptance of an audit engagement and the preparation of engagement letter. Attention is paid to materiality levels used during the statutory audit and to the expression that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the entity. Different types of auditor's report are distinguished and a variety of errors frequently made not only by users of financial statements from the common public but also by experts participating in management of audited entities is mentioned as well.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 ’s {{the number of}} {{corporate}} stand-alone reports produced by various organisations worldwide has increased considerably (Kolk, 2004; Owen, 2006). It is argued that introducing an assurance statement with the stand-alone report may contribute to enhancing {{the credibility of the}} reported information (FEE, 2002; Dando and Swift, 2003; ACCA and AccountAbility, 2004). This thesis reports on a multi-level analysis of assurance statements attached to stand-alone reports that were produced by the UK FTSE 100 companies during the reporting years 2000 - 2004. Drawing on a research instrument (which itself has been informed by previous literature, namely O’Dwyer and Owen, 2005) as well as the most recent assurance guidelines and standards (such as FEE, 2002; GRI, 2002, AA 1000 AS, 2003; and ISAE 3000, 2004), this thesis examines the extent to which assurance statements disclose information about crucial elements of the <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement,</b> the amount of disclosure as well as factors associated with the information disclosed. In this context, particular attention is given to issues of independence of the assurance provider; the methodology used to conduct the assurance engagement; the degree to which stakeholders have been engaged and their issues taken account of within the assurance process; and assurance results (namely presentation of the assurance opinion, findings and recommendations). The research results suggest that, despite the increased amount and quality of information disclosed within the assurance statements over the years, engagement of stakeholders and taking adequate account of their issues within the assurance process is still lacking compared to other dimensions of assurance. In the absence of generally accepted stand-alone reporting criteria and assurance standards for this type of reporting, various assurance approaches have emerged and these correspond {{to the nature of the}} assurance provider (for example, accountancy, consultancy and certification body). The FTSE 100 companies (in almost in two-thirds of the conducted engagements) rely most heavily on consultancy firms for assurance and as a result, this approach dominates UK assurance practice. As a consequence, there are noticeable variations in the assurance methodologies, results of the assurance engagements (findings, opinions and recommendations) and shape of the assurance statements over the study. There are also changes that emerge over time and these are most strongly associated with the standards that are used to govern the <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement</b> and also the type of information being assured. These findings raise concerns about whether it is possible to harmonise assurance practice of the corporate stand-alone reports. This thesis concludes with some practical implications for the assurance of stand-alone reports, as well as recommendations for future research...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present an {{overview}} of fraud, including concepts, trends, and controls to in turn, develop an effective assurance work plan {{as well as a}} fraud-prevention proposal to a potential client. When KPMG collected data from 348 of their company fraud investigations in 2011, an average of 87 percent were male (3). Around thirty-two percent of fraudsters usually worked in a finance role which gave them access to assets and financial statements. According to Donald Cressy’s research, it takes all three elements to be considered fraud: a triangle of motivation, opportunity, and rationalization. However, in the 2004 CPA Journal, David T. Wolfe and Dana R. Hermanson discussed the addition of another element from their research to create a fraud diamond, which also includes the individual’s capacity. Compared to public companies, fraud occurs more frequently in privately owned companies. Nearly 40 percent of victim organizations in the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ 2012 study were privately owned while 28 percent were publicly traded. Furthermore, fraud {{is more likely to be}} detected by individuals in the internal or external audit setting or an anonymous tipline. These concepts are explained further in sections of the <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement</b> team plan and fraud-prevention proposal to a small business owner. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to continue and extend previous studies in evaluating the extent to which current assurance practices promote transparency and accountability to stakeholders. This is carried out by conducting an empirical analysis of the content of assurance statements accompanying a sample of non-financial reports short-listed for the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) U. K. Sustainability Reporting Award and the CERES-ACCA Sustainability Reporting Award from 2006 to 2008. The findings of this study show that several new trends in social, environmental and sustainability assurance can be observed. Firstly, accountants tend to limit their intended readership to management only and state a disclaimer for other potential readers. This diminishes the transparency and stakeholder accountability of the reporting. Secondly, there is even stronger evidence that management has the control over the scope of the <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement</b> and over what information gets publicly disclosed. The evidence is shown in the fact that in many assurance statements prepared by accountants, only selected parts of the reports are being assured, with no indication that it is not management who selects these parts. Finally, the recent practices of assurance engagements represented by the sample in this study have not improved the transparency and stakeholder accountability of social, environmental and sustainable reporting. Similar to the two previous studies, we assert that a generally accepted standard is needed to promote assurance statements that add meaningful values to the reliability of social, environmental and sustainability reporting...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{has a low}} {{prevalence}} of both social and environmental reporting, and assurance. However, {{while the number of}} reporters in New Zealand has continued to rise, the amount of assured reporters has been declining. This thesis seeks to understand why assurance practice is declining, what the causal factors are, and why New Zealand appears to be incongruent with rising levels of international assurance practice. It also aims to discover what might drive increased assurance adoption within New Zealand in the future. Through utilising a pilot study of the current trends in New Zealand social and environmental reporting and assurance over a nine year period, the extent of assurance adoption decline is documented. New Zealand's assurance providers, and the country's non-assured, formerly assured, and currently assured organisations are interviewed regarding their position on assurance adoption. Benefits and barriers to assurance, stakeholder use and need for assurance, material differences between New Zealand and international practice, whether assurance is poised to increase in the future, and what will potentially drive assurance in the future are investigated. This thesis discovers several barriers to assurance adoption including: cost, lack of perceived internal and external value, lack of pressure from stakeholders, difficulties surrounding the <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement,</b> under-developed reporting, and assurance having a diminishing value over time. The benefits identified were not as strong as the barriers in most cases. Internal benefits were generally perceived to be greater than the external benefits, as organisations noted questionable credibility enhancement. Overall, a lack of drivers for assurance exists. Lack of stakeholder pressure is the key overriding barrier halting assurance adoption. An increase in assurance adoption could eventuate if increased societal awareness and desire for disclosures, pressure from export markets, and a change in presentation and communication of disclosures occurred...|$|E

40|$|The well-institutionalised {{notion of}} audits put forth that {{information}} subjected to independent examination by third parties potentially contribute to better quality information for decision making (towards more sustainable companies?). The presence of different assurance providers offering {{a myriad of}} services {{in the name of}} “sustainability assurance” led to concerns about their quality and comparability and as a consequence a call for standards to regulate these services. This study analyses how standards by the accountancy profession interplay with hard law to regulate <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements</b> on sustainability reports in Sweden. Sustainability <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements</b> by the accountancy profession are performed according to RevR 6, developed based on international standards representing the accountancy profession’s commercial logic and conceptual understanding of <b>assurance.</b> These <b>engagements</b> are however potentially “supervised” by The Supervisory Board of Accountants (RN) whose role could apply by default due to the arguable over-inclusive definition of “audit business” in the Auditors Act. As RevR 6 only serve as “guidance material” to legal institutions, these engagements are supervised according to the legal audit concept and the auditors’ role as professional trustees. The fragmentation of regulatory systems, within which sustainability <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements</b> operate leads to legal uncertainty and systemic challenges. It is crucial for legal institutions to better deal with the lack of clarity through regulatory conversations or other means to better coordinate or steer the emergence of regulatory initiatives by private organisations in these new areas of “audit like” services as it clarifies the role assurance services can play in the drive towards sustainable companies...|$|R

However, how such teams are composed or the values that these teams bring to the <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement</b> process, and how reliance is established on the work performed by such teams has been left uncovered. This research sought to fill this gap, and hence, contributed to providing an understanding surrounding this issue. Semi-structured interviews with auditors from the Big Four Audit firms, engaged with performing sustainability assurance was conducted. The findings revealed that the engagement of multi-disciplinary teams, comprising both financial accountants and sustainability specialists from various disciplines, was necessary in ensuring quality assurance work performance. Firstly, the in-depth knowledge of sustainability subject matters possessed by the sustainability experts, enabled the questioning of the correctness of sustainability items reported by the clients. Secondly, sustainability experts were valuable in the planning stage of the engagement, in identifying client risk areas. Thirdly, sustainability expert involvement, enabled the winning of work contracts. Additionally, the engagement of multi-disciplinary teams was revealed to be valuable to the client firms. Firstly, the sustainability experts assisted clients in identifying the most valuable issues to report to their stakeholders. Secondly, due to the expert’s knowledge and experience, it enabled them to inform clients on high reporting levels. Finally, sustainability experts provided clients with valuable feedback that aids {{the improvement of the}} client processes, and the management of risks. The establishment of reliance on the work performed by the teams, requiring an accountant to signoff every engagement work performed by the team, as required by the applicable assurance standards, was partially supported by this study.

40|$|Globally, the {{provision}} of accommodation is dominated by family run businesses (Getz and Carlsen, 2005). Family businesses in the tourism and hospitality industry are significant in terms of numbers, economic value, and longevity. The visions and goals of the owners {{are different from those}} of other entrepreneurs, in the tourism and hospitality industry (Carland, Hoy, Boulton and Carland, 1984). However, scant academic research on family run hotels has been published. Since 1980 service quality has been a significant issue within tourism and hospitality, following the pattern set by the manufacturing industries (Johns, 1996). Hayes, Ninemeier and Miller (2011) argued that service quality {{is an important factor in}} customers’ perceived experience of hotel operations; thus, a better understanding of customer expectations within tourism and hospitality is potentially valuable for both practitioners and researchers. This is particularly true in Thailand, where tourism is a primary source of national income. Therefore, the overall aim of this research project is to develop a quality assurance model enabling Thai family run hotels to identify strengths and opportunities to improve their practices aligned with their motivations. Phase One of the research critically appraised the visions and goals of Chiangmai family run hotels. Phase Two examined the business environment of the hotels in terms of the implementation of quality assurance principles. In order to ascertain their customer expectations, Phase Three comprised of administering modified SERVQUAL questionnaire to their international guests. The results to the first phase revealed that family run businesses dominate the hotel sector in Chiangmai. These enterprises are motivated by three factors: lifestyle, concerning with their descendants, and keeping the business modest. Phase Two data identified a low level of quality <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement</b> in these family run hotels. Based on their own perceptions of the quality required, these hotel operators employ an inside-out approach; they design and communicate service specification via social media without investigating customer expectations.

40|$|Recent {{growth in}} {{sustainability}} reporting has {{been followed by}} growth in sustainability reporting assurance. Although sustainability reporting and its assurance are both still voluntary in many countries around the world, like New Zealand, several organisations have already disclosed sustainability reports publicly and also engaged in the assurance process. The aim of this research project is to explore {{the current state of}} sustainability reporting assurance in New Zealand listed companies. The intention is to discover the motivations for, and barriers to, assurance engagement; identify the preferred assurers; and introduce the influential factors for improving the quality of sustainability reporting assurance statements. Mono and multiple methods are implemented in this exploratory research. The research design is divided into four sequential phases. The first phase considers information about the current status of sustainability reporting assurance. The second phase analyses sustainability reporting assurance statements published by companies listed on NZX through content analysis. The last two phases investigate sustainability managers’ and sustainability assurers’ viewpoints about several aspects of sustainability reporting assurance through one-on-one online semi-structured interviews. Using agency theory, signalling theory and stakeholder theory, this research provides insights into motivations for, and barriers to, sustainability reporting <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement</b> from the perspectives of the sustainability assurers and two groups of sustainability reporting organisations – those that have not yet engaged, and those that have already engaged, in the assurance process. The results highlight the characteristics of the preferred sustainability assurers. This research also identifies that while the quality of sustainability reporting assurance statements is increasing, there is still considerable room for improvement. iv A number of potential limitations including subjectivity apply to this research which uses a qualitative approach on a small population of New Zealand listed companies. Despite these limitations, this research still provides some valid insights about sustainability reporting assurance in a voluntary environment. In particular, this research extends previous studies to add to sustainability reporting assurance knowledge by collating the results of several data gathering and data analysis techniques, which examine that area comprehensively. This research provides broader insights into the terms of sustainability reporting assurance since it considers all types of internal and external sustainability assurance as well as two groups of reporting organisations. The findings of this research will practically benefit organisations; sustainability assurers; New Zealand authorities, legislators and standard setters; and other stakeholders by introducing the characteristics of best practice for sustainability reporting assurance in a voluntary sustainability reporting and assurance environment...|$|E
40|$|As {{stakeholders}} start {{holding companies}} {{accountable for the}} non-financial impacts of their operations, it is increasingly recognised that the parties to whom companies are accountable extends beyond shareholders to include other stakeholders as well. Around the world, companies are responding to stakeholder demands by voluntarily reporting on their corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. Unscrupulous companies may however, be tempted to use green-wash to make false claims relating to their CSR performance in order to reap the associated benefits. This information risk may be ameliorated through the independent assurance of CSR disclosures, enhancing the confidence of stakeholders in its veracity. Reporting companies usually voluntarily obtain independent assurance on their CSR performance. However, in South Africa, independent CSR assurance is a regulatory requirement for all JSE-listed companies, albeit on an ‘apply or explain’ basis. This thesis, which utilises a mixed methods research approach incorporating both qualitative and quantitative components, seeks to identify and understand {{the characteristics of the}} emerging independent CSR assurance phenomenon. In this regard, the empirical component of the study was conducted in three phases: in the first phase companies’ CSR disclosures and assurance reports are examined; in the second phase survey responses from companies are reviewed; and in the third phase interviews with CSR assurors are analysed. In this thesis, the extent to which companies provide independent assurance on their CSR disclosures is established; the providers of independent CSR assurance are identified; the reasons that companies select certain CSR assurance providers are explored; the reasons that companies provide independent assurance on their CSR disclosures are determined; the CSR assurance practices of the various CSR assurors are reviewed and compared; and the primary standards and/or frameworks used in CSR assurance engagements are identified. A conclusion is reached that although independent CSR assurance is a de facto mandatory requirement for JSE-listed companies, only 26 % of the companies had their CSR disclosures independently assured. Despite its de facto mandatory nature, the study found that South African CSR assurance practices remain largely unregulated, resulting in a diversity of CSR assurors; utilising various assurance approaches, standards and practices. In this thesis, it is argued that these inconsistencies undermine the purpose of CSR assurance and reduce stakeholder confidence. It is accordingly proposed that the identified deficiencies could be addressed through the regulation of CSR reporting and assurance. An oversight/regulatory body should be established to prescribe the competencies that CSR assurors should possess; to develop appropriate CSR <b>assurance</b> <b>engagement</b> standards; and to clearly articulate the scope that CSR assurance engagements should cover; with which all CSR assurors should comply.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{assurance}} on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has increased due to growing concerns {{about climate change}} {{and the introduction of}} new legislation and emissions trading schemes in many countries. GHG <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements</b> necessitate the involvement of practitioners from accounting and non-accounting disciplines to form multidisciplinary teams (MDTs). Focusing on training intervention, this thesis investigates whether two training techniques drawn from the educational and cognitive psychology literature, analogical encoding and collaborative learning, are effective in improving individual and MDT performance in conducting a complex analytical procedures task commonly completed in GHG <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements.</b> Analogical encoding is a technique that facilitates encoding of knowledge by comparing two worked examples simultaneously whereas collaborative learning refers to a technique that encourages learners to work together to facilitate discussion and understanding when learning new tasks. The thesis employs a between-subjects experiment using postgraduate students (as surrogates for novice practitioners) to examine the research hypotheses. The study finds that for complex tasks such as the analytical procedures task, a combination of analogical encoding and collaborative learning techniques leads to the highest learning outcomes for individuals and teams. At the individual level, these results suggest that the combination of the two techniques allows simultaneously the reduction in cognitive load, facilitation of deep processing, and development of knowledge structures during learning thereby facilitating improved performance. At the team level, the combined techniques facilitate team member familiarity and sharing of workload, resulting in enhanced process gains. These processes enable team members to perform effective and efficient hypothesis generation and objective evaluation of hypotheses (i. e., less biased towards the inherited hypothesis), which in turn increases the likelihood that they will select the correct causal hypothesis. An analysis was also conducted on the role of team member cognitive structures (i. e., the manner in which knowledge that is important to team functioning is mentally organised, represented, and distributed within the team) and reveals that the two training techniques do not affect all measures of team member cognitive structures and these constructs do not mediate all the relationships between team training inputs and team performance...|$|R
40|$|Non-state {{actors have}} been {{increasingly}} engaged in regulation, operating and setting rules outside of, and parallel to, existing legal institutions. These “alternative to legal rules” have been increasingly influential in domestic law and policy, with growing evidence of them penetrating legal, professional, {{as well as}} social orders. This thesis adopts the case of sustainability assurance to analyze regulation through standards by the accountancy profession, in an area outside its core competence. The thesis focuses on how sustainability assurance standards by non-state actors are developed at the international level, and with the case of Sweden, how standards in this area are developed and used at a national level. This thesis has drawn on the applied socio-legal perspective, which enables looking beyond the ontological rule model used in traditional legal research. The analysis had been conducted using multi-paradigms to capture the context, in which sustainability assurance standards were drafted and applied; the developments in the contents of standards; and the dynamic interaction between the two, in regulating sustainability assurance. Empirical evidence shows the presence of polymorphous actors that brought competing concepts and regulatory logic into the space. The patterns of influence in the regulatory space highlight the normative challenges of decentred regulation. The empirical observations of standards in action provided insights on how standards work as a regulatory instrument, its properties and inherent limitations. Findings show that the scope, linguistic structure and character of standards affect how and who interprets the standard. The analysis of the Swedish case led {{to the conclusion that the}} distribution of discretion in a multi-levelled regulatory regime depended on the choices exercised by standard setters at each level. At the international level, the AA 1000 AS by AccountAbility remains the only international standard drafted specifically to guide sustainability assurance. Unless national sustainability assurance standards are available, assurance providers from the accountancy profession continue to apply ISAE 3000. Sustainability <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements</b> performed by the accountancy profession in Sweden are guided by RevR 6. RevR 6 (2006) was aligned with ISAE 3000 that represents the accountancy profession’s conceptual understanding of assurance. The amorphousness of RevR 6 (2006) allowed engagements to suit practical circumstances and assurance providers to customise the scope of the <b>assurance</b> to each <b>engagement.</b> Sustainability <b>assurance</b> however, is potentially supervised by the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants, based on the legal concept of an audit.

An empirical {{analysis of the}} Italian context To create value the internal auditing (IA) functions should define a strategy {{taking into account the}} characteristics of the external and internal environment and the expectations of the IA stakeholders. It does not exist a "one best way" to create value, but the IA strategy should be defined and implemented considering the spe- cific contexts in which the IA functions operate. This is the main finding that emerges from the empirical analysis the authors have carried out in cooperation with the Italian Institute of Internal Auditors involving 78 CAEs (Chief Audit Ex- ecutives). Other important research findings show that the IA function performs more the <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements</b> than the consulting activities. Moreover there is a growing use of audit software, data analytics and data mining tools to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of IA process and finally the IA carries out a wide range of auditing activities to meet the various expectations of an increasing num- ber of stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Internationally, the {{escalating}} {{number of cases}} levelled against auditors {{and the costs of}} defending such actions has led to the auditing profession calling for measures to reduce their liability burden. Relatively few measures have been taken by the auditing profession by way of adapting the disclosure contained in the audit report to mitigate their litigation risk. This study examines whether the issuance of an audit opinion with a going concern related 'emphasis of matter' paragraph or work practices disclosure has any effect on potential litigants' likelihood of pursuing litigation against the auditor. An analysis of 69 responses from advanced law students and 18 practitioners working in corporate liquidation demonstrate that a modified (but not qualified) audit report effectively acts as a 'red flag' and reduces potential litigants' propensity to initiate litigation. However, work practices disclosure did not significantly alter potential litigants' inclination to recommend litigation. Despite this finding, respondents (particularly liquidators) indicated that work practices disclosure was an important factor in their litigation decision. These results suggest that further investigation into how to effectively disclose the work done on audit and <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements</b> is needed. This has implications for standard setters and the auditing profession, especially considering recent changes in the disclosure contained in audit and assurance reports.

40|$|Sustainability {{reporting}} and assurance of sustainability reports {{have been used}} by organizations in an attempt to provide accountability to their stakeholders. A better understanding of current practices is important to provide a base for comparative and trend analyses. This paper aims to consolidate and provide information on sustainability reporting, assurance of sustainability reports and types of assurance providers. Another aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a descriptive analysis of these practices for a global sample, comparing results with previous studies, and suggesting opportunities for future research. To accomplish these objectives, a literature review was performed, an analysis of the organizations included in the Fortune Global 500 2010 was completed, and results were presented and consolidated by country. These results demonstrate that all organizations analysed provided some type of information in relation to their social or environmental performance in their official website. The percentage of organizations issuing a sustainability report has been increasing in the last few years. However, the percentage of organizations assuring their sustainability report has stagnated. Types of <b>assurance</b> <b>engagements</b> include those performed by accountants and non-accountants, and new practices have emerged, namely the 'mixed approach' and the 'stakeholder or specialist review'. The analysis also shows that the practices of issuing sustainability reports and having them assured have become a world-wide phenomenon, occurring in developed, and emerging economies around the world. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} has evolved to encompass environmental, social and governance issues regarding corporate behaviour. For {{the last few}} years, stakeholders have begun putting pressure on companies to report on sustainability issues. Several national and international regulations and standards have been adopted to guide companies in their reporting. To ensure the accuracy and comparability of non-financial data needed for the stakeholders' decision making process, there is an increasing preference for the external assurance of sustainability reporting. The internationally recognized CSR report assurance standards are the International Standard on <b>Assurance</b> <b>Engagements,</b> ISAE 3000, and AccountAbility's AA 1000 Assurance Standard (AA 1000 AS). This study focuses {{on the evolution of}} corporate sustainability reporting, using two non-financial indicators: ESG reporting, and Assurance of ESG reporting. The data for the study is based on content analysis of both CSR reports and corporate websites, courtesy of Sustainalytics. We assessed the evolution of the two indicators from June 2010 to February 2014, for 50 listed European companies and 50 American ones. The comparative approach illustrates the different evolutions of sustainability in Europe and the USA, emphasising the need for stronger regulations and guidelines in the USA, similar to those already implemented in European Countries. For the selected time period, US companies are shown to be worse reporters than European ones, having a negligible number of reports externally verified...|$|R

Starting with a self-evaluation followed by a cross-sparring with critical friends, this new approach has proven successful in initiating change.

The approach has been developed in an ERASMUS+ project involving eight European universities called QAEMP (Quality Assurance and Enhancement Market Place) ...|$|R
