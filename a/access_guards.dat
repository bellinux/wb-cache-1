40|$|ABSTRACT – Uniframe is an {{approach}} that facilitates the interaction of heterogeneous software components. In a Uniframe framework, the entire working of the integrated system is transparent. While logic programming language like Prolog {{can be used to}} express the fact that the system resources will depend on the <b>access</b> <b>guards</b> and the policies developed to govern them, the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) is used to validate properties of the proposed system so that the behavioral aspects of the system implemented with access properties does not interfere with the component interactions at any level. This aspect of dynamicity is significant {{because of the fact that}} in an integrated system, as the components interact to execute an user command the access behavior should not interfere with the interfacing base of the components that have been pre-designed in a specific fashion by the system integrator. The research proposed in this paper will focus on the fact to verify the performance of the system using TLA after the access characteristics are partially implemented. The whole of the system performance will not be monitored and tested instead a portion of the proposed model will be taken and used for implementing TLA...|$|E

40|$|Passwords are an {{ubiquitous}} {{and critical}} component of many security systems. As the information and <b>access</b> <b>guarded</b> by passwords become more necessary, we become ever more dependent upon the security passwords provide. The creation and management of passwords is crucial, and for this we must develop and deploy password policies. This paper focuses on defining and modeling password policies for the entire password policy lifecycle. The paper first discusses a language for specifying password policies. Then, a simulation model is presented with a comprehensive set of variables and the algorithm for simulating a password policy and its impact. Finally, the paper presents several simulation results using the password policy simulation tool...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{deterministic}} parallel programming models with strong safety guarantees are emerging, but similar support for nondeterministic algorithms, such as {{branch and bound}} search, remains an open question. We present a language together with a type and effect system that supports nondeterministic computations with a deterministic-by-default guarantee: nondeterminism must be explicitly requested via special parallel constructs (marked nd), and any deterministic construct that does not execute any nd construct has deterministic input-output behavior. Moreover, deterministic parallel constructs are always equivalent to a sequential composition of their constituent tasks, even if they enclose, or are enclosed by, nd constructs. Finally, in the execution of nd constructs, interference may occur only between pairs of <b>accesses</b> <b>guarded</b> by atomic statements, {{so there are no}} data races, either between atomi...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} power of three types of access to {{unambiguous}} computation: nonadaptive access, fault-tolerant <b>access,</b> and <b>guarded</b> <b>access.</b> (1) Though for NP {{it is known that}} nonadaptive access has exponentially terse adaptive simulations, we show that UP has no such relativizable simulations: there are worlds in which (k + 1) -truth-table access to UP is not subsumed by k-Turing access to UP. (2) Though fault-tolerant access (i. e., "l-helping" access) to NP is known to be no more powerful than NP itself, we give both structural and relativized evidence that fault tolerant access to UP suffices to recognize even sets beyond UP. Furthermore, we completely characterize, in terms of locally positive reductions, the sets that fault-tolerantly reduce to UP. (3) In <b>guarded</b> <b>access,</b> Grollmann and Selman's natural notion of access to unambiguous computation, a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine asks questions to a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine {{in such a way that}} the nondeterministic machine never accepts ambiguously. In contrast to <b>guarded</b> <b>access,</b> the standard notion of access to unambiguous computation is that of access to a set that is uniformly unambiguous [...] even for queries that it never will be asked by its questioner, it must be unambiguous. We show that these notions, though the same for nonadaptive reductions, differ for Turing and strong nondeterministic reductions...|$|R
