5|$|At Mulder's apartment, Scully {{announces that}} because of Mulder's odd behavior, she {{realized}} Mulder's body contains Morris Fletcher. Scully demands {{to know how to}} restore Mulder to his own body. Mulder's informant calls again and Scully forces Fletcher to take the call and set up a meeting. Mulder, Joanne, Fletcher and Scully arrive at a bar in Rachel, Nevada, where Mulder's informant is revealed to be General Wegman. Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried to merely disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a flight data recorder in <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag.</b> Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's bathroom and argue about the flight data recorder. As they argue, General Wegman enters the bathroom and discovers the two. Mulder meets with General Wegman to discuss the UFO. Wegman believes that now that Fletcher knows Wegman's identity, when restored to his own body, Fletcher will turn him in. Wegman explains that he hoped that Mulder could explain whether aliens actually exist; apparently the craft are simply given to the military without knowing where they are from or how they work.|$|E

25|$|Firm kiwifruit ripen after a {{few days}} to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster {{ripening}} occurs when placed in <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> with an apple, pear, or banana. Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator. If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Cast in {{the role}} of Davros was Michael Wisher, who had {{previously}} appeared in several different roles on Doctor Who and had provided Dalek voices in the serials Frontier in Space, Planet of the Daleks and Death to the Daleks. Wisher based his performance as Davros on the philosopher Bertrand Russell. In order to prepare for filming under the heavy mask, Wisher rehearsed wearing <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> over his head. Friedlander's mask was cast in hard latex, with only the mouth revealing Wisher's features; make-up artist Sylvia James shaded the mask's tones and blackened Wisher's lips and teeth to hide the transition.|$|E

She blew <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> to fake a shot. Poirot claims to suspect Ruth because he {{suspected}} Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess, and he had no evidence against Ms Lingard. After everyone leaves and Ms Lingard stays alone in the room, she asks Poirot not to tell Ruth that she is her real mother. Poirot agrees as Ms Lingard is terminally ill, and does not reveal anything to Ruth who wonders why Ms Lingard committed the murder.|$|E
50|$|The Brown <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Test was <b>a</b> type {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in the United States. <b>A</b> brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> {{was used as a}} way {{to determine whether or not}} an individual could have certain privileges; only individuals with a skin color that is the same color or lighter than <b>a</b> brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> were allowed. The test was used in the 20th century within many social institutions such as African-American sororities, fraternities, and churches. In addition, brown <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> were used in multi-racial social events. The term is also used in reference to larger issues of class and social stratification within the African-American population. The Brown <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Test arose from the practice of discrimination based on skin color.|$|R

5000|$|From 1900 {{until about}} 1950, [...] "paper bag parties" [...] {{are said to}} have taken place in neighborhoods of major American cities with a high {{concentration}} of African Americans. Many churches, fraternities, and nightclubs used the [...] "brown paper bag" [...] principle as a test for entrance. People at these organizations would take <b>a</b> brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> and hold it against a person's skin. If a person was lighter or the same color as the bag, he or she was admitted. People whose skin was not lighter than <b>a</b> brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> were denied entry.|$|R
500|$|On the September 16 {{episode of}} SmackDown, as Rhodes was ridiculing the audience, DiBiase {{disguised}} {{himself as a}} fan by wearing <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> on his head before attacking Rhodes, turning into a fan favorite. DiBiase then challenged Rhodes for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Night of Champions, but was unsuccessful. In a YouTube video published on September 22, DiBiase introduced his new gimmick to hold tailgating parties with fans just before WWE events, terming those who tailgated with him as the [...] "DiBiase Posse"; DiBiase also acknowledged that mimicking his father's rich gimmick [...] "didn't really work out".|$|E
500|$|She entered The Factory with Warhol, who complimented {{her on her}} {{appearance}} as she was uncharacteristically wearing makeup. Morrissey told her to leave, threatening to [...] "beat the hell" [...] out of her and throw her out otherwise. The phone rang and Warhol answered while Morrissey went to the bathroom. While Warhol was on the phone, Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through both lungs, his spleen, stomach, liver, and esophagus. She then shot art critic Mario Amaya in the hip. She tried to shoot Fred Hughes, Warhol's manager, in the head but her gun jammed. Hughes asked her to leave, which she did, leaving behind <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> with her address book on a table. Warhol was taken to Columbus–Mother Cabrini Hospital, where he underwent a five-hour, successful operation.|$|E
500|$|Solanas's {{role as a}} cult {{figure was}} {{solidified}} {{with the publication of}} the SCUM Manifesto and her shooting of Andy Warhol. Harding explained that, by declaring herself independent from Andy Warhol, after her arrest she [...] "aligned herself with the historical avant-garde's rejection of the traditional structures of bourgeois theater", and Harding explained that her anti-patriarchal [...] "militant hostility... pushed the avant-garde in radically new directions." [...] Harding believed that Solanas's assassination attempt on Warhol was its own theatrical performance. At the shooting, she left on a table at the Factory <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> in which she carried a gun, her address book, and a sanitary napkin. Harding stated that leaving behind the sanitary napkin was part of the performance, and called [...] "attention to basic feminine experiences that were publically [...] taboo and tacitly elided within avant-garde circles." ...|$|E

Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, Sports Illustrated interviewed Ward, and he said:"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who started it.

500|$|Cody Rhodes {{reformed}} his {{alliance with}} Ted DiBiase on the May 20 episode of SmackDown, and the duo {{went on to}} feud with Sin Cara and Daniel Bryan. In August, Rhodes attacked DiBiase after DiBiase lost a match to Orton, ending their alliance. On the September 16 episode of SmackDown, DiBiase disguised himself {{as a member of}} the audience by wearing <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> – part of Rhodes's gimmick – to allow him to attack Rhodes. This led to DiBiase unsuccessfully challenging Rhodes for Rhodes's Intercontinental Championship at Night of Champions. Rhodes and Orton spent much of the latter part of 2011 feuding with each other. Following his match with Rhodes, DiBiase introduced a new gimmick in 2011; known as the [...] "DiBiase Posse", DiBiase held tailgating parties with fans prior to the start of WWE events. In August 2013, DiBiase announced his departure from WWE after opting not to re-sign. In May 2016 Cody Rhodes announced his departure from WWE.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Davros {{was designed by}} Nation to have created the Daleks in his image, and to also be a [...] "spokesperson" [...] for the Daleks as {{he felt it was}} [...] "boring" [...] listening to Daleks giving speeches. The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with no body but a [...] "green, dome-like head" [...] which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros' mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher's face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive. [...] The cast and crew regarded Davros' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; they thought he was a statue at first. When sitting in Davros' Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> over his head that only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the [...] "disorienting" [...] situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face. Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes {{in the top of the}} bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue.|$|E
