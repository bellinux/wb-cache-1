Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty.

5|$|Although much {{is known}} of Little's {{investment}} activities in his adult life, {{little is known about}} his early years. Jacob Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 17, 1794. The son of a successful local shipbuilder and of Quaker origin, Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age. In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk in the store of Jacob Barker, a highly successful financier, merchant, and politically well-connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall. Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $700 he had accrued over the length of his employment. He bought a small office in the basement of <b>a</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>Street</b> building, which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years, before moving out of his old office to a new one {{in the basement of the}} old exchange building in 1834, from which he opened a brokerage—the start of his investment career.|$|E
