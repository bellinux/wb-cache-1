5|$|The family evolved {{approximately}} 52 {{million years}} ago during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene eras. Liliaceae are widely distributed, mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> are insect pollinated. Many Liliaceae are important ornamental plants, widely grown for their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs. Some species are poisonous if eaten and can have adverse health effects in humans and household pets.|$|E
25|$|Other moths (Noctuids, Geometrids, Pyralids, for example) fly {{slowly and}} {{settle on the}} flower. They do not require as much nectar as the fast-flying hawk moths, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> tend to be small (though they may be {{aggregated}} in heads).|$|E
25|$|A. thaliana can {{complete}} its entire lifecycle in six weeks. The central stem that produces flowers grows after about three weeks, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> naturally self-pollinate. In the lab, A. thaliana may be grown in Petri plates, pots, or hydroponics, under fluorescent lights or in a greenhouse.|$|E

25|$|Moringa has {{numerous}} {{applications in}} cooking throughout its regional distribution. The fruits or seed pods, known as drumsticks, are a culinary vegetable {{commonly used in}} soups and curries. The leaves are also commonly eaten with many culinary uses, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> are featured in some recipes as well.|$|E
25|$|The flowers {{often have}} five {{generally}} fused sepals and five free petals. They are generally hermaphrodite, {{and have a}} short hypanthium, usually cup shaped. There are normally ten stamens and one elongated superior ovary, with a curved style. They are usually arranged in indeterminate inflorescences. Fabaceae are typically entomophilous plants (i.e. they are pollinated by insects), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> are usually showy to attract pollinators.|$|E

25|$|Post-1945 Stepney again {{underwent}} {{change as}} {{large numbers of}} refugees from war-torn Europe moved in. Shops began selling previously unheard of foods such as salami or artichokes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> in often tiny front gardens were replaced by vegetables. Again, {{the number of children}} increased and second creek and the small number of spare allotments became their playgrounds, complete with re-enactments of battles fought far away. Houses changed colour, copying those found Greece and Italy and the streets resounded with voluble Italian, Greek and ironically - German.|$|E
25|$|This section {{contains}} the cushion irises or royal irises, {{a group of}} plants noted for their large, strongly marked flowers. Between 30 and 60 species are classified in this section, depending on the authority. Compared with other irises the cushion varieties are scantily furnished with narrow sickle-shaped leaves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> are usually borne singly on the stalks; they are often very dark and in some almost blackish. The cushion irises are somewhat fastidious growers, and to be successful with them they must be planted rather shallow in very gritty well-drained soil. They should not be disturbed in the autumn, and after the leaves have withered the roots should be protected from heavy rains until growth starts again naturally.|$|E
25|$|Post-production {{took place}} in Munich and {{required}} nine months to complete, concluding {{in the third quarter}} of 2006. Film editor Alex Berner was present at all the shooting locations and was on set with Tykwer. Berner also cut dailies as filming progressed which, according to Tykwer, saved a lot of time later. Tykwer said they had to work this way due to the film's tight schedule (the European release dates had already been locked). On every night of filming, Tykwer and Griebe would take screenshots from the dailies and make notes for the film laboratory on what sort of tone and palette they wanted, and the level of brightness and contrast they wanted for the prints. A digital intermediate was used for the film. About three months was spent grading the film. Digital grading tools were used to improve the color of the lavender fields because the film crew had arrived a week early <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> were not in full bloom. In the scene where Grenouille murders the plum girl, selective coloring was used to take the tone of the dead body's flesh from its natural color to a pale white color.|$|E

500|$|Drosera anglica {{flowers in}} the summer, sending up peduncles [...] long bearing several white flowers which open individually. Like other sundews, the flowers have five sepals, petals, and stamens. The petals for this species are 8–12mm long, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> have {{branched}} 2-lobed styles. The odorless, nectar-less flowers do not rely on insect pollinators for pollination, rather setting seed well through self-pollination (autogamy).

[...] Artists have closely studied the correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals, even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times.

500|$|Xerochrysum 'Diamond Head' was {{a natural}} form {{collected}} around Diamond Head in New South Wales, where it is quite common on bluffs and cliffs.

The foliage is green and rough <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> are 3cm in diameter and yellow in colour with an orange disc. It makes an ideal plant for rockeries, and strikes easily from cuttings during the spring growing period.|$|E

In addition, notable recordings of the song {{have been made by}} Odetta, Judy Collins, Stevie Wonder, The Four Seasons, The Barbarians, and Chad and Jeremy. Other artists who have recorded the song include Glen Campbell (1965), The Beau Brummels (1966), The Lettermen (1966), Kenny Rankin (1967), Melanie (1968), Gene Clark (1984), Les Fradkin (2007), Bob Sinclar (2009), Jack's Mannequin (2012), <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Flowers</b> of Hell (2012).

500|$|Aiphanes {{species are}} pleonanthic—they flower {{repeatedly}} {{over the course}} of their lifespan—and monoecious, meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers. In Aiphanes, male and female flowers are borne together on the same inflorescence. [...] Usually only a single inflorescence is borne at each node, although A.gelatinosa often bears then in groups of three at a single node. [...] The inflorescence usually consists of a main axis consisting of a peduncle and a rachis. [...] The rachis bears rachillae, which are smaller branches which themselves bear the flowers, while the peduncle is the main stalk connecting the rachis with the stem of the plant. [...] In some species there is second-order branching—the rachillae themselves are branched <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> are borne on these branches.|$|E
500|$|Matlock was {{replaced}} on bass by Rotten's friend and self-appointed [...] "ultimate Sex Pistols fan" [...] Sid Vicious, despite {{not being able}} to play bass.

He was also credited with introducing the pogo dance to the scene at the 100 Club. John Robb claims it was at the first Sex Pistols residency gig, 11 May 1976; Matlock is convinced it happened during the second night of the 100 Club Punk Special in September, when the Pistols were off playing in Wales. In Matlock's description, Rotten wanted Vicious in the band because [...] "nstead of him against Steve and Paul, it would become him and Sid against Steve and Paul. He always thought of it in terms of opposing camps".|$|E
