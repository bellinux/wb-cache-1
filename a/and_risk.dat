The {{aim of this}} work is to analyze the benefits <b>and</b> <b>risks,</b> <b>and</b> based on them create a procedure to quantify the benefits of open data in public sector. The work is divided into four main parts. The first deals with basic terminology a reader interested in open data problematics needs to know. The second part is devoted to performing {{an analysis of the}} examined studies. Based on the conducted analysis, the particular approaches <b>and</b> <b>risks</b> are then divided into individual groups. The third part examines current approaches to determining the value of open data. I deal in more detail with BOUDICA model in this section. In the last part an approach to quantification of the benefits <b>and</b> <b>risks</b> of open data in public sector is proposed. For this I use the results obtained from the analysis of the examined studies. A part of this proposal is also a determination of recommendations that are necessary to quantify the benefits <b>and</b> <b>risks</b> of open data in public sector according to this method. The main asset of this work lies in a proposal of a potential method to quantify the benefits <b>and</b> <b>risks</b> of open data in public sector.

Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies.
