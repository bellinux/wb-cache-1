40|$|Both {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) and mannitol inhibit gibberellic acid-induced α-amylase production in barley aleurone layers. The {{effect of the}} osmotic solution is on enzyme synthesis rather than α-amylase secretion. The inhibition of α-amylase synthesis {{does not appear to}} be mediated via an indirect effect on respiration or protein synthesis. Rather it seems that the osmotic solutions reduce the extent of proteolysis of the stored <b>aleurone</b> <b>grain</b> protein thus making available less substrate for new protein synthesis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} germination-induced ultrastructural {{changes in}} wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Arthur) aleurone cells. Seeds imbided for 4 hours in water contained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or ER-like membranes as vesicles or as short segments of membrane {{associated with the}} spherosomes {{on the periphery of}} aleurone grains. Aleurone cells incubated between 8 and 10 hours contained abundant ER membranes mainly associated with the nuclear envelope and, to a lesser extent, with the spherosomes surrounding the <b>aleurone</b> <b>grain.</b> The membranes located {{on the periphery of the}} nucleus occurred as regions of stacked cisternae. When aleurone cells were analyzed by morphometry, the increase in ER during incubation was found to be greater than 2 -fold. During the same incubation period, other organelles did not change significantly. The early increase in ER was not affected by gibberellin incubation. Thus, the rapid proliferation of ER observed during the early stages of germination in aleurone cells of wheat is not likely to be controlled directly by gibberellin...|$|E
40|$|Although {{aleurone}} {{grains of}} certain oilseeds (e. g. peanuts) are exceedingly sensitive to aqueous solutions, {{it has been}} reported that aleurone grains maintain their integrity when homogenized in an aqueous solution containing 15 % Carbowax 6000 (PEG- 6000). Presumably this substance acts as an osmotic agent. We have been unable to confirm this result using microscopic and chemical studies. However, we found that PEG- 6000 acts as a protein precipitant; therefore, it is suggested that the pellet obtained upon centrifugation of the homogenate is mostly protein precipitate rather than intact aleurone grains. Many oilseeds (e. g., cottonseeds, peanuts, squash) possess aleurone grains which are extremely sensitive to aqueous media (2, 5, 6). In 1961, Altschul et al. (7) alleged that <b>aleurone</b> <b>grain</b> integrity was maintained in macerates of peanut seeds prepared in aqueous solutions of sucrose or Carbowax PEG- 6000 (polyethylene glycol, M. W. 6000). This information was of keen interest to us because of its potential application to our studies with cottonseeds. However, in our experience, neither sucrose nor Carbowax preserved the integrity of cottonseed aleurone grains...|$|E

In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the endosperm, which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via double fertilization. It is usually triploid, and is rich in oil or starch, and protein. In gymnosperms, such as conifers, the food storage tissue (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a haploid tissue.

40|$|Structural {{changes in}} {{endosperm}} cells of germinating castor beans were examined and complemented with a cytochemical analysis of staining with diaminobenzidine (DAB). Deposition of oxidized DAB occurred only in microbodies {{due to the}} presence of catalase, and in cell walls associated with peroxidase activity. Seedling development paralleled the disappearance of spherosomes (lipid bodies) and matrix of aleurone grains in endosperm cells. 6 to 7 days after germination, a cross-section through the endosperm contained cells in all stages of development and senescence beginning at the seed coat and progressing inward to the cotyledons. Part of this aging process involved vacuole formation by fusion of <b>aleurone</b> <b>grain</b> membranes. This coincided with an increase in microbodies (glyoxsomes), mitochondria, plastids with an elaborate tubular network, and the formation of a new protein body referred to as a dilated cisterna, which is structurally and biochemically distinct from microbodies although both apparently develop from rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In vacuolate cells microbodies are the most numerous organelle and are intimately associated with spherosomes and dilated cisternae. This phenomenon is discussed in relation to the biochemical activities of these organelles. Turnover of microbodies involves sequestration into autophagic vacuoles as intact organelles which still retain catalase activity. Crystalloids present in microbodies develop by condensation of matrix protein and are the principal site of catalase formerly in the matrix.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{relating to}} ultrastructure studies of angiosperm embryos up to seed maturity is reviewed. Ultrastructural {{changes in the}} cotyledon of the embryo of Capsella bursa-pastoris from the torpedo stage of embryogenesis to the mature seed are described. A revised classification of the developmental stages of the embryo is devised which recognises 11 stages, of which the final 8 stages are examined in the present study: the earlier 3 stages have already been studied by others. Particular reference is made {{to the development of}} the chloroplast. The chloroplasts increase in number, size, starch content and lamellar complexity as the embryo develops up to the mature-green stage, after which starch disappears abruptly. The deterioration and disruption of chloroplast lamellae begin after mature-green stage and are completed in the ivory-white and dry cotyledons. Some organelles (Golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus) are recognizable in the dry cotyledon while other organelles are poorly defined or missing. The cotyledon develops storage tissue with numerous oil bodies and protein bodies in each cell. A single type of protein grain (<b>aleurone</b> <b>grain)</b> is formed within vacuoles. Oil bodies begin to appear from torpedo stage onward and reach a maximum in the ivory-white cotyledon. Ribosomes are dispersed freely in the cytoplasm. Literature on the effect of light and darkness in chloroplast morphogenesis in higher plants is reviewed. Development of the etioplast is studied in the embryos and leaves of whole plants subjected to darkness. Etioplasts of the embryo in the ovule contain large crystalline prolamellar body after 3 days dark treatment. Plastids of leaves subjected to darkness do not form prolamellar bodies but instead an extensive development of very variable, irregularly-shaped, stroma lamellae with characteristic ring- or cup-shaped or looped lamellae. The extensive development of the abnormal lamellar system with such peculiar arrangement is hitherto unknown in the plastids of normal higher plants. The transformation of the etioplast into chloroplast under illumination is investigated utilising embryo culture techniques as it was not practicable to observe such development in embryos from whole plants. The problem of excessive accumulation of starch in plastids was encountered but solved by reducing the sucrose concentration in the growth medium to 0. 5 % from the 2 % used by others. A 1 % sucrose concentration in the growth medium gives overall maximum growth of the embryo. After 4 days in darkness the etioplasts of cultured embryos contain well-formed crystalline and concentric prolamellar bodies. Treatment with 3 hours of continuous illumination with white light of low intensity completes the transformation of etioplast into chloroplast. Preliminary studies on the effect of light of different wavelengths on the etioplast transformation are also presented. Etioplasts in cultured embryos show typical protuberances of the jacket which are regarded as peripheral reticulum. The possibility of the formation of mitochondria from such protuberances is noted. Some novel structures developed in plastids are reported. Two types of tubules, distinct from the tubules forming prolarnellar bodies, are produced in the embryo. They appear as rows of small circular tubules and a group of long parallel tubules. The production of tubules, possibly the result of a reaction to the changed environmental conditions, are regarded as a sign of degeneration rather than a normal stage of development. Another novel structure reported in the etioplasts consists of a complex network of intermingled lamellae. It is concluded that the use of embryo culture technique in relation to experimental morphogenesis of organelles offers a promising field of study which will contribute also to our knowledge of embryo physiology and development. <p...|$|E

Heavy metal transporters {{belonging to the}} P 1 B-ATPase subfamily of P-type ATPases are key players in cellular heavy metal homeostasis. In this study we investigated the properties of HvHMA 1, which is a barley orthologue of Arabidopsis thaliana AtHMA 1 localized to the chloroplast envelope. HvHMA 1 was localized to the periphery of chloroplast of leaves and in intracellular compartments of <b>grain</b> <b>aleurone</b> cells. HvHMA 1 expression was significantly higher in grains compared to leaves. In leaves, HvHMA 1 expression was moderately induced by Zn deficiency, but reduced by toxic levels of Zn, Cu and Cd. Isolated barley chloroplasts exported Zn and Cu when supplied with Mg-ATP and this transport was inhibited by the AtHMA 1 inhibitor thapsigargin. Down-regulation of HvHMA 1 by RNA interference {{did not have an}} effect on foliar Zn and Cu contents but resulted in a significant increase in grain Zn and Cu content. Heterologous expression of HvHMA 1 in heavy metal-sensitive yeast strains increased their sensitivity to Zn, but also to Cu, Co, Cd, Ca, Mn, and Fe. Based on these results, we suggest that HvHMA 1 is a broad-specificity exporter of metals from chloroplasts and serve as a scavenging mechanism for mobilizing plastid Zn and Cu when cells become deficient in these elements. In grains, HvHMA 1 might be involved in mobilizing Zn and Cu from the <b>aleurone</b> cells during <b>grain</b> filling and germination...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between barley grain dormancy and gibberellic acid (GA 3) responsiveness of aleurone layers has been investigated. Barley (Hordeum distichum L. cvs Triumph and Kristina) grains were matured under defined conditions in a phytotron.

Aleurone layers isolated from grains of long-day Triumph plants secreted more α-amylase {{and had a}} higher responsiveness to GA 3 as measured by α-amylase secretion. Storage of the grains increased both the percentage of germination and the responsiveness of the aleurone to GA 3. Use of different sterilization methods to break dormancy confirmed the correlation between germination percentage and aleurone layer GA 3 responsiveness. The response of embryoless Triumph grains to GA 3 was {{lower than that of}} the isolated aleurone layers, suggesting a role of the starchy endosperm in regulating the GA 3 response of the <b>aleurone</b> layer. <b>Grains</b> of the cultivar Kristina harvested from short day- and long day-grown plants lacked dormancy, and their isolated aleurone layers had a similar responsiveness to GA 3 as measured by α-amylase secretion.

We made a comprehensive assessment on this, analysing Zn, Fe and phytic acid in whole grains and processed brown, white and cooked rice obtained from six cultivars raised with Zn applied through soil and/or foliar supply at different phenological stages of the crop and measuring Zn bioavailability in cooked rice. Pathways for Zn enrichment (27. 4 – 92. 6 % over control) by Zn fertilization with different application protocols and cultivars were elucidated. Such enrichment of Zn was associated with depletion in Fe (6. 5 – 29. 4 %) and phytic acid (14. 8 – 30. 4 %). However, the loss of Zn on processing of rice grains increased on Zn fertilization (12. 6 – 28. 7 mg kg− 1) because of a preferential allocation of applied Zn into bran and <b>aleurone</b> of the <b>grains.</b> Despite such loss, application of Zn caused a net increase in Zn bioavailability (52. 2 % over control) in the cooked product.
