In order to investigate the effect of double pulsing, the steel was exposed to single and various double pulse RSW schedules. The first current pulse was applied to create the weld nugget, while the second current pulse generated a secondary weld nugget and annealed or (partial) re-melted the primary weld nugget, depending on {{the magnitude of the}} current. The effect of the second current pulse on the weld nugget and heat-affected zone characteristics was investigated using optical microscopy and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA).

40|$|Thermal {{histories}} {{derived from}} apatite fission-track data are remarkably consistent irrespective of tectonic setting and overall rate of cooling. Rapid cooling through the partial <b>annealing</b> <b>zone</b> is typically followed by slower cooling, and such histories {{can only be}} explained by systematic errors in the experimentally derived annealing rates {{used to determine the}} thermal histories, or a consistent geotherm shape characterized by a relatively low geothermal gradient in the uppermost crust. Differences between the cooling paths characterizing individual tectonic settings indicate that geotherm shape influences the cooling histories. This suggests that crustal geotherms, especially those in orogenic belts, are characterized by a shallow zone of high permeability, allowing the rapid transfer of heat by fluid advection, perhaps together with a near-surface zone affected by enhanced heat loss due to topographic effects. The influence of such controls on cooling histories must be considered prior to using thermochronology data to constrain denudation histories...|$|E

T(w) is always lower than T(aKw) both of which define the temperature range in which abnormal grain growth occurs continuously during <b>zone</b> <b>annealing</b> without the "nucleation" of new coarse grains.

Additionally, the age and geochemistry of the Palaeogene igneous rocks (i. e. Surdulica granodiorite and dacitic volcanic rocks) were determined by the LA-ICPMS U–Pb geochronology of zircons and geochemical analysis of main and trace elements in whole-rock samples. Three major cooling stages have been distinguished from the late Early Cretaceous to the Oligocene. The first stage represents rapid cooling through the partial <b>annealing</b> <b>zones</b> of zircon and apatite (300 – 60 °C) during the late Early to early Late Cretaceous (ca. 110 –ca. 90 Ma).

The ∼ 100 million year cooling difference between the innermost and outermost blocks indicates they were subjected to very different exhumation pathways. Track length histograms and inverse model results also suggest that significant differences in thermal histories are present over very short horizontal distances. In conjunction with the offshore geological evidence, the AFT data and models strongly suggest that the innermost zones of the MTFC underwent between 2 and 4 km of structurally controlled net vertical rock column uplift/subsidence following latest Cretaceous time, and potentially much of the Tertiary as well. The up-to-the-east down-to-the-west relative offset at the Norwegian margin is interpreted in terms of a flexed, nearly broken lithospheric plate architectural model for late Mesozoic and Tertiary Scandes mountain building, whose driving force was likely dominanted by erosionally induced loading/unloading at the margin. © 2004 Elsevier B.

In this regard, cylindrical specimens were cut out from welded joints of Strenx® 960 MC and Strenx® Tube 960 MH, were examined by tensile test. The hardness values of specimens’ cross section were measured. Using correlations between hardness and strength, initial material properties were obtained. The same size specimen with different zones of material same as real specimen were created and defined in finite element method (FEM) software with commercial brand Abaqus 6. 14 - 1. The loading and boundary conditions were defined considering tensile test values. Using initial material properties made of hardness-strength correlations (true stress-strain values) as Abaqus main input, FEM is utilized to simulate the tensile test process. By comparing FEM Abaqus results with measured results of tensile test, initial material properties will be revised and reused as software input to be fully calibrated {{in such a way}} that FEM results and tensile test results deviate minimum.

40|$|The present {{invention}} discloses {{the process}} of supplying high pressure (e. g., 30 atmospheres) CO that has been preheated (e. g., to about 1000 ° C.) and a catalyst precursor gas (e. g., Fe(CO) 5) in CO that is kept below the catalyst precursor decomposition temperature to a mixing zone. In this mixing zone, the catalyst precursor is rapidly heated to a temperature that results in (1) precursor decomposition, (2) formation of active catalyst metal atom clusters of the appropriate size, and (3) favorable growth of SWNTs on the catalyst clusters. Preferably a catalyst cluster nucleation agency is employed to enable rapid reaction of the catalyst precursor gas to form many small, active catalyst particles instead of a few large, inactive ones. Such nucleation agencies can include auxiliary metal precursors that cluster more rapidly than the primary catalyst, or through provision of additional energy inputs (e. g., from a pulsed or CW laser) directed precisely at the region where cluster formation is desired. Under these conditions SWNTs nucleate and grow according to the Boudouard reaction.

40|$|Four {{different}} {{models for the}} laser surface hardening, laser cladding, laser fusion welding and deep penetration welding are presented in this paper. They are able to predict the results of treatment and, partly, also to estimate those process parameter values which yield the desired results. From such process modells even equivalent heat sources may be derived {{which can be used}} for the calculation of thermal stresses and distortions by means of commercial finite element software packages. The laser hardening simulation tool GEOPT of the IWS consists of a data base to be evaluated by means of an included optimisation algorithm which is able to solve systems of non-linear equations and inequalities. This data base contains a lot of numerical results describing the relationship between process parameters, characteristical temperature field data and geometry parameters of hardening and <b>annealing</b> <b>zones.</b> Thus even inverse problems may be solved by GEOPT within a few seconds. The laser cladding process is modelled by the IWS software LAVA. First the interaction between laser beam and powder jet is simulated. From the resulting energy and mass flow densities acting on the substrate surface the bead geometry and the temperature field are calculated in a self-consistent manner. Recommendations are given how to correct the process parameter values in order to achieve prescribed results. Calculation times amount to a few minutes per simulation run on a standard PC. The weld seam shape in laser fusion welding is strongly influenced by the thermocapillary fluid flow. The latter depends very sensitively on the surface temperature gradients and the contents of surface active impurities such as oxygen or sulphur. This opens a possibility to enlarge the penetration depth of the melt and/or to reduce the required power input. Such effects can be simulated by means of the program MELTFLOW of the IOF. The software tool DC-LASIM of the DaimlerChrysler AG has been developped for the simulation of the deep penetration laser beam welding processes. Within the scope of a joint project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research this software was combined with the FEM software package ANSYS to form a 'welding simulation tool' with the aim to facilitate welding stress computations.

Using a lot of stored solutions of the heat diffusion equation as well as a simple model of transformation kinetics and enclosed thermophysical data for common iron base materials, the personal computer program GEOPT calculates within about one second the required processing parameter values from a user defined set of conditions for the laser induced temperature field and/or the desired hardening and <b>annealing</b> <b>zone</b> geometries. The physical and mathematical foundations of the program, its possibilities and limits of application, possible sources of errors or inaccuracies, and a series of characteristic examples of application are discussed, concerning especially the hardening of edges and the influence of workpiece geometry, the opt imization of the laser track pattern (track shape and distance), predete on of the expected hardness, and applications to beam shaping and beam scanning. GEOPT is recommended for preestimating the realizability and economical efficiency of laser hardening for a concrete task, for the determination and optimization of the processing parameter values, the predetermination of results to be expected, and for obtaining a graphical overview over functional relations...|$|E
40|$|We present new zircon fission-track (ZFT) {{data from}} Variscan granitoid {{bodies in the}} Veporic (footwall unit) and Gemeric (hangingwall unit) thick-skinned nappe sheets of the Central Western Carpathians. All samples show Late Cretaceous to {{earliest}} Paleogene cooling ZFT ages, which contribute to constraining the low-temperature exhumation history of the Vepor-Gemer Belt. Four granite samples from {{the western part of}} the Gemericum near the contact with the underlying Veporicum provided central ZFT ages between 70. 4 Ã‚Â± 5. 4 and 74. 7 Ã‚Â± 5. 6 Ma. One sample from this area shows an older age of 87. 7 Ã‚Â± 5. 9 Ma, possibly owing to its higher structural position. One remoter sample from the SE part of the Gemeric Unit has 61. 7 Ã‚Â± 3. 4 Ma central ZFT age, which probably reflects exhumation associated with a younger compressional tectonic event in that area. One sample from the centre of the Veporic metamorphic core complex yielded a cooling age 64. 9 Ã‚Â± 4. 8 Ma. However, most of these samples exhibit an internal age scatter pointing to complex cooling and exhumation history influenced by a slow passage through the zircon partial <b>annealing</b> <b>zone</b> and/or reheating brought about by the Cretaceous Rochovce granite intrusion. In spite of this, the acquired ages generally match the exhumation trend of the Veporic metamorphic core complex...|$|E
40|$|Apatite fission-track thermochronology {{is applied}} to 31 samples from various {{components}} of the uppermost tectonic unit of the Island of Crete, Greece. This unit {{is one of several}} that presently lie in the hanging wall to a major extensional detachment fault that juxtaposes rocks metamorphosed at high pressure and low temperature during the Late Oligocene- Early Miocene below against rocks that lack any Oligo-Miocene metamorphism. The data reveal a phase of accelerated Middle Miocene denudation that can be linked to erosion between ca [...] 17 Ma and II Ma [...] The discovery of the base of a denuded apatite partial <b>annealing</b> <b>zone</b> limits the total amount of denudation during this time period to ca [...] 4 km. This implies a mean denudation rate of ca, 650 rnIm. y. Apatite fission-track ages ofup to ca [...] 30 Ma and shortened confined tracks from high-grade metamorphic rocks of the uppermost tectonic unit require that no significant denudation of these rocks occurred during accretion of the other Cretan tectonic units in the Oligocene I Early Miocene. This information means that significant re-evaluation of previous tectonic models of the post-Eocene tectonic development of the Cretan segment of the Hellenic Subduction Zone is required. It is proposed that the Hellenic Subduction Zone has acted as a retreating plate boundary since at least the Late Eocene. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cold swaged and {{annealed}} {{samples of}} INCOLOY MA 956 (UNS S 67956) were investigated using light optical microscopy (LOM), {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), and Vickers microhardness testing. The as-received oligocrystalline material presented a strong -texture parallel to the longitudinal direction of the bar. This texture results from secondary recrystallization promoted by <b>zone</b> <b>annealing.</b> The microstructure in the deformed state {{was found to be}} very inhomogeneous. Deformation bands were observed in all grains. The extent of deformation banding varied from grain to grain in terms of morphology and spacing. The deformation substructures were found to be very different in each grain. A sharp -fiber texture was developed during plastic deformation becoming more pronounced with increasing strain. Intense recovery during annealing has been observed in this alloy. Recrystallization did not change the texture significantly...|$|R
40|$|Doping {{profiles}} in proton and helium co-implanted and <b>annealed</b> n-type float <b>zone</b> silicon wafers are analyzed {{by means of}} spreading resistance measurements. After annealing at sufficiently high temperatures and/or long-enough duration, the hydrogen-related donor profiles known from proton implantations are significantly enhanced by the helium irradiation. The resulting profile shape exhibits a strong resemblance to the radiation damage distribution of the co-implantation. By increasing the ultimately introduced num-ber of hydrogen related donors without varying the available amount of hydrogen, it is shown that the donor profile resulting from proton implantation and annealing {{is limited by the}} defect species and the implanted hydrogen is supplied in surplus. The maximum of the additionally induced donor distribution by the he-lium implantation shows a different dependency on the fluence compared to the donor maximum induced by mere proton irradia-tion. The diffusion of protons through the irradiated layer during annealing is impacted by the He-irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Glass/Mo, Mo foil, glass/Mo/In, and glass/Mo/Cu stacked layers were selenized {{in closed}} vacuum tubes by {{isothermal}} and/or two-temperature <b>zone</b> <b>annealing</b> in Se vapors. The selenization process was studied dependent on Se vapor pressure, temperature and time. Samples were selenized from 375 to 580 °C for 30 and 60 minutes. The applied Se pressure was varied between 130 and 4. 4 ⋅ 103 [*]Pa. The increase of MoSe 2 film thickness {{was found to}} depend on the origin of Mo. MoSe 2 thickness dL on Mo-foil was much higher than on sputtered Mo layers, and it depended linearly on time and as a power function dL~PSe 1 / 2 on Se vapor pressure. The residual oxygen content in the formed MoSe 2 layers was much lower in the two-zone selenization process. If Mo was covered with Cu or In before selenization, these were found to diffuse into formed MoSe 2 layer. All the MoSe 2 layers showed p-type conductivity...|$|R
