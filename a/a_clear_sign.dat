5|$|The new {{constitution}} came into force on 24 September 1993, and Sihanouk was reinstated as the King of Cambodia. A permanent coalition government was formed between FUNCINPEC, CPP {{and a third}} political party, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP). In turn, Sihanouk made Ranariddh and Hun Sen First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively. Shortly after that, Sihanouk left for Beijing, where he spent several months for cancer treatment. In April 1994 Sihanouk returned, and the following month called the government to hold new elections so that the Khmer Rouge could be co-opted into the government. Both Ranariddh and Hun Sen rejected his suggestion, but Sihanouk pressed on, and further proposed a national unity government consisting of FUNCINPEC, CPP, and the Khmer Rouge headed by him. Again, both prime ministers rejected Sihanouk's proposal, arguing that Khmer Rouge's past intransigent attitude made the proposal unrealistic. Sihanouk backed down, and expressed frustration that Hun Sen and Ranariddh had been ignoring him. As both Norodom Sirivudh and Julio Jeldres, his younger half-brother and official biographer, respectively, saw it, this was <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>sign</b> that the monarchy's ability to exert control over national affairs had diminished, at least vis-a-vis the prime ministers.|$|E

30|$|To {{outline the}} {{clinical}} {{usefulness of the}} five-line sign, we should consider that normal interlobular fissures feature regular morphology, smooth appearance, and uniform thickness. The MIP-rendered five-line sign has smooth lines and clear gaps and can, therefore, {{be used as the}} referencing object for other planar structures in the lung. Certain pulmonary pathological features, such as the pleural tail sign [14 – 16], represented a form of thickened septa [15]; the five-line sign revealed by MIP reconstruction suggested that it was a relatively smooth and regular plane, {{and it is difficult to}} determine using multiplanar or thin-section reconstruction. As we observed that most nodules with the pleural tail sign had an unclear or absent five-line sign, we speculated that the plane was rough and irregular; only a small number of nodules with the tail <b>sign</b> showed <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> five-line <b>sign</b> by MIP rebuilding, but these lines were thicker and denser than those of normal interlobular fissures. Simultaneously, it was noticed in our limited experiments that the tumour was at an advanced stage in most of the cases of lung cancer in which the five-line sign was unclear or absent, and relapse and metastasis usually occurred after resection [17]; whereas a small number of peripheral lung cancers with <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> five-line <b>sign</b> were at an earlier stage and no recurrence and metastases occurred following resection; these patients survived for more than 5 years disease-free [17]. In addition, a doubling time exceeding 800 days was observed in several tumours with <b>a</b> barely <b>clear</b> five-line <b>sign</b> and without experiencing being resected surgically. That implied character of indolent growth of those lung cancers with five-line sign. The cases of lung cancer mentioned involved almost completely solid nodules. Recent clinical studies reported the pleural tail sign or pleural indentation as having different clinical effects [16, 18, 19]; parts of these investigations focused upon pulmonary adenocarcinomas appearing as sub-solid nodules or ground-glass nodules [18, 19]. Other scholars have applied volume rendering reconstruction technique to predict whether the lung cancer invades the visceral or parietal pleura [20]. Anyhow, the authors of this article attempted to investigate the five-line sign of peripheral lung cancer through MIP reconstruction and to evaluate the effect of the five-line sign on staging and prognosis in peripheral lung cancer, especially when represented as a solid nodule; we consider that it would be worth carrying out further investigation on the basis of the large number of cases accumulated. This is the reason why we explored the five-line sign of the normal interlobular fissures using MIP reconstruction.|$|R

At the 1999 elections Keadilan formed a coalition with the DAP and the PAS known as the Alternative Front (Barisan Alternatif). The result of this was that the PAS won a number of Malay seats from UMNO, but many Chinese voters disapproved of this unnatural alliance with the Islamist PAS, causing the DAP to lose many of its seats to the MCA, including that of its veteran leader, Lim Kit Siang.

During the course of the battle, according to Długosz, the national banner slipped out of Marcin's hand and fell to the ground, but it was quickly picked up and saved from destruction by the Polish army's most valiant knights, which further motivated the Poles to strive for victory over the Teutonic Knights.|$|E
500|$|According to the literature, {{it appears}} that the {{majority}} of free Athenians owned at least one slave.
