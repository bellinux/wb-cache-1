500|$|After the Distant Worlds II {{concert in}} Stockholm, the {{additional}} pieces performed {{were added to}} the setlist, and for every concert afterward different songs out of that rotation have been chosen for each performance. [...] "Kiss Me Goodbye" [...] from Final Fantasy XII was played at the June 18, 2010 Detroit show, though it was not officially added to the general setlist. It was played again at the April 1, 2011 concert in New York City, which featured an expanded setlist over two concerts. In April 2011 Square Enix announced that the concert series was expected to run for at least three more years. Uematsu has said that he prefers for the tour to add arrangements of older pieces from the series, as he feels that they are what fans are more interested in; he and Roth intend to continue to add more arrangements to the setlist. He was hesitant for pieces from Final Fantasy XIII and XIV to be added, as he did not feel that they had been <b>around</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> build a strong following like the older songs.|$|E
500|$|On January 22, 2011, Spears tweeted {{from the}} video shoot, {{saying it was}} [...] "an {{incredible}} experience" [...] and would [...] "be {{one of the best}} videos I have ever done." [...] On February 2, 2011, accusations came from TMZ.com that Åkerlund had decided to use a dance double for Spears when it seemed like she had not rehearsed her moves enough. Both her representatives and the director denied the rumors, and Åkerlund commenting, [...] " [...] been great throughout the entire process. [...] I've been <b>around</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> know when an artist gives it their all, and to me it doesn't get better than this. This video is gonna be fucking awesome! It's all Britney." [...] Her manager Larry Rudolph later confirmed that a body double was actually used, but only for the scenes in which Spears fights herself. The fight scene was choreographed by Steven Ho. He commented that Spears incorporated the moves learned during rehearsals, but also incorporated [...] "her own flavor", by adding a small shuffle of steps in her heels. The length of the dresses also presented a problem, and there were discussions about shortening the trains for safety issues. They were later added as 'weapons', as Ho explained, [...] "as if they were sharp blades, giving Britney reason to jump and evade around them." ...|$|E

Unfortunately, Carlton mostly pitched ineffectively — except for seven shutout innings {{in a game against}} the Pittsburgh Pirates, in which he also hit a 3-run homer, for his only win as a Giant. Overall, he went 1-3 with a 5.10 ERA in six games for the Giants, hanging <b>around</b> just <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> collect his 4,000th strikeout (against Eric Davis), before announcing his retirement.|$|R

The plane lost an engine over the Rockies so they landed at Wright-Patterson AAF, Dayton, Ohio, and the photos were taken on by train to Washington, D.C.|$|R

One way that online communities work on retention is through the use of entry barriers and initiation rituals because making it difficult to join should increase their commitment.

40|$|Background: The HIV {{pandemic}} {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges facing humanity, and generations may be wiped out if effective prevention, treatment, and care are not in place. Case reports: A total of 3 families are presented. In the first 2, the children represented the third generation in their families to be infected with HIV and probably had mother-to-child transmission of the disease. The children in the third family were HIV negative. The mothers and grandmothers in all the families were infected with HIV. Risky sexual behavior involving multiple sexual partnering was recorded among them, some of whom had died from AIDS-related illness. This has serious implications in the care of the infected and affected children as they had been made vulnerable by their circumstances. Conclusion: HIV/AIDS has been <b>around</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> now <b>to</b> cross generations as shown in the reported cases, which resulted in serious health and socioeconomic effects in the affected families...|$|R

50|$|Before Lamoine {{received}} its name, {{the town of}} Arup, Washington, was platted and filed on Nov. 20, 1905, by the immigrant farmer Nels P. Nelson (1861-1935). Arup was named after Aarup (spelled with two as), a town near Skydebjerg, Denmark, where he was born. Nelson was anticipating the railroads running through the newly formed Arup, but in 1909 the Great Northern Railway bypassed it and went through Withrow instead. That sealed the town’s fate, and like many upstart towns during the early 1900s, Arup was never <b>around</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> build a future.
