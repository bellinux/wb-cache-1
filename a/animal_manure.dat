5|$|The Celts practiced {{advanced}} {{agriculture and}} favored fertile lands; they {{brought with them}} and disseminated the inventions, including a variety of tools, and other achievements of La Tène culture. Celtic farmers used plows with iron shares and fertilized fields with <b>animal</b> <b>manure.</b> Their livestock consisted of selected breeds, especially sheep and large cattle. The rotational querns that they invented had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever. Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons. The ceramic shops used the potter's wheel and produced with great precision (especially the Tyniec group) baked, thin walled, painted vessels, {{one of the best}} in Europe. Domed bilevel furnaces were used, the pots being placed on a perforated clay shelf, with the hearth underneath. Glass and enamel were produced, gold and semi-precious stones were processed for jewelry.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the mineral composition of manure and vermicomposite from castrated and intact cattle. The earthworm utilized was Eisenia foetida and the time for vermicomposite establishment was about 40 days. The experimental design was completely randomized in factorial scheme 2 x 2, two manure types (manure and vermicomposite) and two sexual conditions (castrated and intact). The <b>manure</b> from castrated <b>animals</b> presented higher nitrogen (26. 6 vs 22. 7 g/kg) and calcium (31. 9 vs 24. 0 g/kg) contents compared to intact animals, but both castrated and intact presented similar potassium content. The vermicomposite from castrated <b>animals</b> <b>manure</b> was higher on nitrogen (26. 2 vs 23. 9 g/kg), potassium (18. 0 vs 15. 0 g/kg) and calcium (33. 6 vs 31. 2 g/kg) than entire. The vermicomposite from castrated and intact <b>animals</b> <b>manure</b> presented higher concentration of phosphorus (10. 9 vs 8. 9 g/kg) and magnesium (7. 1 vs 6. 2 g/kg) than manure. The <b>manure</b> from castrated <b>animals</b> was higher for phosphorus (10. 4 vs 9. 5 g/kg) and magnesium (7. 1 vs 6. 2 g/kg) contents than entire. It might be concluded that vermicomposite is higher on minerals than manure and that castrated <b>animal’s</b> <b>manure</b> is better than intact <b>animals</b> <b>manure</b> and earthworms increase minerals from endogenous origin on the vermicomposite...|$|R
25|$|Agriculture biomass, {{including}} {{agricultural wastes}} and <b>animal</b> <b>manure,</b> produce approximately 30 {{million metric tons}} of dry material per year that could be massively and decisively used, inter alia, for generating bioenergy and {{improve the quality of}} life in rural Egypt. Unfortunately, this resource remain terribly underutilized.|$|E
25|$|Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) are {{typically}} applied to farmland as commercial fertilizer, <b>animal</b> <b>manure,</b> or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from crop residues, irrigation water, wildlife, and atmospheric deposition. Farmers can {{develop and implement}} nutrient management plans to reduce excess application of nutrients and reduce the potential for nutrient pollution.|$|E
25|$|Spring was {{the rainy}} season; farmers took {{advantage}} of this to bring fallow ground back into production. They practised biennial crop rotation, alternating {{from year to year}} between fallow and cultivated. Attempts to introduce triennial crop rotation with legumes in the third year, ran into problems due to the poor Greek soil, lack of power, and absence of mechanization. The Greeks did not use <b>animal</b> <b>manure,</b> possibly due to the low number of cattle. The only soil additive was weeds ploughed back into the ground after fields came out of fallow.|$|E
40|$|Compost {{is made by}} {{recycling}} {{organic materials}} such as yard trimmings, wood chips, food scraps, and <b>animal</b> <b>manures</b> in a controlled process. The process employs microorganisms to transform the raw materials {{so that they are}} no longer recognizable. Quality compost is thoroughly decomposed and pathogen-free. The possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms in compost is a major challenge for compost producers. Composted <b>animal</b> <b>manures</b> can be used in many beneficial products, but they must be properly processed. The most important conditions with respect to sanitization are: the composting process must be thorough; the composting process must be complete; and, the finished compost must not be reinoculated with pathogens...|$|R
5000|$|Leguminous {{green manures}} such as clover and vetch contain nitrogen-fixing {{symbiotic}} bacteria in root nodules that fix atmospheric nitrogen {{in a form}} that plants can use. This performs the vital function of fertilization. If desired, <b>animal</b> <b>manures</b> may also be added.|$|R
30|$|In this perspective, the {{composting}} process has a big applicability potential in agriculture for being a low-cost investment and for presenting high efficiency and speed at the nutrient cycling process of several organic wastes (Lim et al. 2016). It is estimated that in each year, {{a third of all}} food produced in the world to human consumption is lost or wasted before being consumed (FAO 2011). Besides this, the agricultural sector produces high amounts of <b>animal</b> <b>manures,</b> and frequently does not reused. According to Cordell et al. (2009), on the 2000 s, more than 7 million tons of phosphorus were released annually in the environment through <b>animal</b> <b>manures,</b> likely to cause serious environmental problems.|$|R
25|$|Biofilms {{have become}} {{problematic}} in several food industries {{due to the}} ability to form on plants and during industrial processes. Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, <b>animal</b> <b>manure,</b> and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment. The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat flow across a surface and increase surface corrosion and frictional resistance of fluids. These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and overall loss of products. Along with economic problems biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due {{to the ability to}} make the food more resistant to disinfectants As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year. Biofilms have been connected to about 80% of bacterial infections in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted <b>animal</b> <b>manure</b> or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 UK {{researchers}} {{developed a}} genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli (E.Coli), which could transform glucose into biofuel gasoline {{that does not}} need to be blended. Later in 2013 UCLA researchers engineered a new metabolic pathway to bypass glycolysis and increase the rate of conversion of sugars into biofuel, while KAIST researchers developed a strain capable of producing short-chain alkanes, free fatty acids, fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (ACP)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-CoA pathway in vivo. It is believed that in the future it will be possible to [...] "tweak" [...] the genes to make gasoline from straw or <b>animal</b> <b>manure.</b>|$|E
30|$|The study {{evaluated}} dried manures and manure ashes as {{alternative products}} from <b>animal</b> <b>manures,</b> and determined {{the dynamics of}} soil nitrogen availability indices and organic carbon release in some soils amended with dried manures and ashes under laboratory incubation, screen-house and field experiments.|$|R
5000|$|Bacteria and nitrates: These {{contaminants}} {{are found}} in human and animal wastes. Septic tanks or large numbers of farm animals can also cause bacterial and nitrate pollution. Both septic systems and <b>animal</b> <b>manures</b> must be carefully managed to prevent private well contamination.|$|R
40|$|Rural {{and urban}} {{communities}} and farms {{have at least}} one problem in common: the accumulation of various organic wastes. Farms produce wastes such as <b>animal</b> <b>manures,</b> and crop residues such as straw, corn cobs, hay stack bottoms and spoiled silage. In Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s towns and cities, the organic wastes include sewage sludge, paunch manure from slaughter houses, and garbage originating from household foods and paper. Some of these organic wastes are associated with the nuisances of flies, odors and dust. Fresh <b>animal</b> <b>manures,</b> paunch manure, sewage sludge and garbage are favorite breeding places for flies. Flies are attracted to odors and moisture. As these wastes dry and become free of odors, they do not attract flies and are no longer breeding places. Many large communities bury their garbage and sewage sludge wastes in landfills. This is a costly burden to taxpayers that can result in ground water contamination. Accumulations of dry manure in feedlots or animal confinement facilities results in serious dust problems...|$|R

50|$|In {{intensive}} {{agricultural land}} use, <b>animal</b> <b>manure</b> {{is often not}} used as targeted as mineral fertilizers and thus the nitrogen utilization efficiency is poor. <b>Animal</b> <b>manure</b> can become a problem in terms of excessive use in areas of intensive agriculture with high numbers of livestock and too little available farmland.|$|E
50|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>manure,</b> such as chicken {{manure and}} cow dung, {{has been used}} for centuries as a {{fertilizer}} for farming. It can improve the soil structure (aggregation) so that the soil holds more nutrients and water, and therefore becomes more fertile. <b>Animal</b> <b>manure</b> also encourages soil microbial activity which promotes the soil's trace mineral supply, improving plant nutrition. It also contains some nitrogen and other nutrients that assist the growth of plants.|$|E
30|$|Hence, {{in order}} to predict the net {{mineralization}} of nitrogen in <b>animal</b> <b>manures,</b> transformation of nitrogen from organic into inorganic form and immobilization processes need to be understood (Saka et al. 2017) since these processes are mediated through microbial activities and could be biochemical (Vel and Swarnam 2013).|$|R

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>manures</b> have {{economic}} value as plant nutrient sources and as amendments for soils whose physical properties {{can be improved}} by adding organic matter. Their value as fertilizer per metric ton applied is generally inverse to their water and carbon contents. Plant nutrient concentrations in <b>animal</b> <b>manures</b> are highly variable, thereby introducing uncertainty into meeting plant nutrient needs for crop production. Where manure has been applied for several years, however, little or no additional fertilizer phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are needed for crop production. <b>Animal</b> <b>manures</b> were ranked in decreasing order as to replacement fertilizer value (dollars) as follows: broiler litter; hen litter; hen droppings; beef feedlot, swine and dairy solid manures; poultry slurry; and other classes of livestock manure slurries. Storage conditions and degree of dilution mainly determine the fertilizer value of liquid manure. Liquid manures have little potential {{economic value}} as fertilizer outside the farm where produced. Relative efficiencies of manure nitrogen (N) as compared to commercial fertilizer N range from less than 30 % to greater than 100 %. Manure N applications that are immediately incorporated have produced yields equal to those produced by fertilizer N for many different crops. The representative plant nutrient contents selected from the literature suggest that replacement fertilizer value can exceed waste management costs, thus changing manure from a waste to a resource...|$|R

30|$|Poultry manure {{is rich in}} nutrients; therefore, it is {{beneficial}} for crop production and also improves the structural stability of the soil (Duong 2003). To correctly balance the compost to provide better conditions for microbes to fasten the decaying process, the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio {{must be taken into}} account. Further, the successful composting of <b>animal</b> <b>manures,</b> which are usually rich in nitrogen (Zmora-Nahum et al. 2007), with materials having a high carbon content, such as sawdust (Zhang and He 2006) and wood chips (Adhikari et al. 2008), has been reported. Lignocellulosic agricultural and forestry by-products such as pine shavings and sawdust are commonly used as bulking agents in composting with <b>animal</b> <b>manures</b> (Bernal et al. 2009). These products are common and easily available from woodworking companies in South Korea. An appropriate combination of waste materials is important for attaining high temperatures as it yields a suitable combination of carbon and nitrogen for the growth and activity of the microbial population (Singh and Kalamdhad 2012).|$|R
