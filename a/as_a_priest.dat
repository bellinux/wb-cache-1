5|$|Bachelot {{was born}} in Saint-Cyr-la-Rosière, Orne, France on February 22, 1796. In 1806, he left home for Paris, where he {{enrolled}} in the Preparatory Seminary of Picpus to pursue priesthood. In 1813, he professed at the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, taking the name Alexis. He studied at the Irish College in Paris before being ordained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> in 1820. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest,</b> he initially served as the College's rector and later led the preparatory seminary at Tours.|$|E
5|$|Chesney {{was elected}} to the See of Lincoln on 13 December 1148, by his cathedral chapter, {{apparently}} without outside interference. He was consecrated by Theobald of Bec at Canterbury Cathedral on 19December, the day after his ordination <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout the film, Father John is {{warned that}} his role <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> comes with boundaries, {{and that he}} should not become {{personally}} involved with the congregants or try to solve their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the elder}} Symeon's advice, {{he left for}} the nearby Monastery of St. Mammas in Constantinople, which was {{described}} as run down, both physically and spiritually. During his time at St. Mammas he continued to follow Symeon the Studite's guidance. Within three years after moving to St. Mammas, Symeon was tonsured as a monk, ordained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest,</b> and elected as the abbot of the monastery. He spent the next twenty-five years as abbot of St. Mammas, attracting many monks and clergy with his reputation for learning and sanctity.|$|E
5|$|He {{also carried}} out studies on {{education}} and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition. Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of evolutionism in the natural and social sciences. In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively critical {{of the influence of}} religion. These views gained him some critics, as he was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> who had abandoned religion.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Foliot (c. 1155– 7 August 1234) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford. Related somehow to his {{predecessor}} at Hereford, he served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> and papal judge {{as well as}} being an unsuccessful candidate as Bishop of St David's in Wales. In 1219, he was appointed Bishop of Hereford. During his time in office, he mostly attended to ecclesiastical duties, but did occasionally serve as a royal administrator. He helped found a hospital and a priory, and died in 1234 after a months-long illness.|$|E

5|$|In 1525 or 1526, Gérard {{withdrew his}} son from the Collège de Montaigu and {{enrolled}} {{him in the}} University of Orléans to study law. According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest.</b> After {{a few years of}} quiet study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was intrigued by Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies. During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, a necessity for studying the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|It was Ranulf who ordained Thurstan, the archbishop-elect of York, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> in 1115, {{although}} Thurstan had to {{wait for}} consecration as bishop for another four years. Ranulf attended the Council of Reims in 1119 held by Pope Callixtus II. In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate to England, visited Durham to investigate charges against the bishop. Medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with Ranulf's niece, and after sleeping with the girl, took no action on the charges against Ranulf. The story is unlikely to be true.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} zealous {{member of}} the Plymouth Brethren, Henson {{was not allowed to}} go to school until he was fourteen, and was largely self-educated. He was {{admitted}} to the University of Oxford, and gained a first-class degree in 1884. In the same year he was elected as a Fellow of All Souls, where he began to make a reputation as a speaker. He was ordained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> in 1888.|$|E

5|$|To the consternation of Hamond {{and some}} other parishioners, the bishop delayed issuing an {{instruction}} forbidding Davidson to preach. When Hamond locked the Morston church against him, the rector preached to a large congregation on the grass outside the church. In August, Davidson's licence to minister <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> was revoked; his last service was morning worship at Stiffkey on 21 August 1932, when around 1,000 people congregated outside the church. That afternoon he demanded the Morston church keys from Hamond, who sent him away by turning him round and administering a substantial kick. Hamond was later fined for this assault.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbert, was {{the teacher}} and {{intimate}} friend of Alcuin, whose poem on the saints and prelates of the Church of York, Versus de Patribus Regibus et de Sanctis et Pontificibus Ecclesiæ Eboracensis, is the principal source of information concerning Æthelbert's life. He was a kinsman of his predecessor Ecgbert, who was brother to Eadberht, King of Northumbria. Æthelbert's family placed him in a monastery as a young child, {{where he was a}} pupil in the school founded at York by Ecgbert. Ecgbert ordained Æthelbert <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> put him in charge of the school.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Louis de Barth Walbach (November 1, 1764 – October 13, 1844), {{commonly}} known as Louis de Barth, was a Roman Catholic priest in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Born and raised in Alsace, he emigrated {{with his family to}} the United States during the French Revolution. He spent {{the rest of his life}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> there, mostly at Conewago Chapel in rural Pennsylvania. After the Bishop of Philadelphia died in 1814, de Barth temporarily led the diocese as apostolic administrator until a new bishop arrived in 1820. After several years at a German-speaking Baltimore parish, he retired to Washington, D.C., in 1841 and died there three years later.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey (c.1152– 12 December 1212) was {{an illegitimate}} son of Henry II, King of England, who became bishop-elect of Lincoln and {{archbishop}} of York. The identity {{of his mother}} is uncertain, but {{she may have been}} named Ykenai. Geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173, though he was not ordained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> until 1189. In 1173–1174, he led a campaign in northern England to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half-brothers; this campaign led to the capture of William, King of Scots. By 1182, Pope Lucius III had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be consecrated as bishop; he chose to resign and became Chancellor instead. He {{was the only one of}} Henry II's sons present at the king's death.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey's {{ordination}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> {{took place}} at Southwell on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported {{by most of the}} York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when Giovanni d'Anagni, the papal legate, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Theodore's background; he is {{recorded}} as being born a Roman, {{and the son of}} Photios I of Constantinople, who was the Patriarch of Constantinople. His brother Theodosius (or Theosius) was also a bishop. He was ordained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> by Stephen V. The exact dates of his papal reign are unknown, but modern sources generally agree that he was pope for twenty days during December 897. Flodoard, a tenth-century French chronicler, only credited Theodore with a twelve-day reign, while in his history of the popes, Alexis-François Artaud de Montor listed Theodore's reign as being twenty days, from 12 February to 3 March 898.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious about living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest.</b> In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
