With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E

The services are administered through the ADO, {{with the head of}} each service (the Chief of Navy, Chief of Army and Chief of Air Force) and the service headquarters being responsible for raising, training <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> combat forces. The Chiefs are also the CDF's principal advisor on matters concerning the responsibilities of their service and form the Chiefs of Service Committee chaired by the CDF and also includes the Vice Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Joint Operations.|$|E
5|$|A {{final element}} in {{creating}} <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> the Athens musical culture was the University of Georgia Lamar Dodd School of Art. The {{great majority of}} Athens' musicians and their fan base {{were associated with the}} University's liberal arts curriculum, and the School of Art, rather than the music department, was the area where the creative and musical alliances that later defined the scene began forming in the 1970s. Michael Stipe of R.E.M. was an art major (although he did not graduate), and the Art School incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe, founding member and drummer for Pylon. The cinematographer for the documentary film Athens GA: Inside/Out was Jim Herbert, an art school professor. Herbert went on to direct music videos for a number of Athens bands, including 14 for R.E.M.|$|E
5|$|He later {{published}} {{two articles}} in the National Urban League's journal, , that discussed the difficulties faced by African-American mineworkers. His work in this field also addressed his concern about blacks and their white counterparts. Harris examined race prejudice of blacks by white workers. Meanwhile, Harris taught at West Virginia State University, a small historically black public college in Institute, West Virginia. During this year, he began a long <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> friendship with V. F. Calverton. He taught for a year, before he shifted directions and took the position {{as director of the}} Minneapolis Urban League. As director, he prepared a detailed report titled The Negro Population in Minneapolis: A Study of Race Relations dealing with the living conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Harris described the physical and socio-economic conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis in 1926.|$|E

5|$|Races over short distances, or sprints, {{are among}} the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games {{featured}} only one event, the stadion race, which was a race {{from one end of}} the stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused around athletes reaching <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights was the {{penultimate}} {{engagement of}} the 1832 Black Hawk War, fought between the United States state militia and allies, and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk. The battle {{took place in}} what is now Dane County, near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. Despite being vastly outnumbered <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> heavy casualties, Black Hawk's warriors managed to delay the combined government forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River. This reprieve was temporary; when the militia finally caught up with the fleeing band it resulted in the Bad Axe massacre {{at the mouth of the}} Bad Axe River.|$|E

They fought to establish defensive positions {{so as not to}} be pinned down by very heavy enemy fire, while treating their wounded, and worked to free the pilot's body from the downed helicopter. With the detainees loaded on trucks, the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site. Unable to find it amongst the narrow, winding alleyways, the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire. The convoy had to return to base after suffering numerous casualties, <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> substantial damage to their vehicles.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} of two Chinooks designated the Rotary Wing Group operated in Afghanistan during 2006 to 2007 and 2008 to 2013. The initial detachment arrived at Kandahar International Airport in March 2006, and was tasked with supporting the Australian Special Forces Task Group in the country. The upgrades the helicopters had received proved successful, and {{allowed them to}} operate in combat alongside other Coalition CH-47s. After the Special Forces Task Group was withdrawn in September 2006 the helicopters remained {{in the country and}} were used to support Coalition forces, with a particular emphasis on the Australian units located in Urozgan Province. The detachment was withdrawn to Australia in February 2007, and did not deploy again until February 2008. During this period all six helicopters received upgrades, which included new engines and blue force tracker equipment. During subsequent years the detachment was withdrawn to Australia during the Afghan winters, and redeployed each spring. By the end of the final rotation on 14 September 2013 the helicopters had flown more than 6,000 hours in combat and transported almost 40,000 personnel. Preparing for <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> the Rotary Wing Group rotations absorbed most of C Squadron's resources throughout this period, and Chinooks were rarely available for other Army training or operational tasks.|$|E
5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E
5|$|With {{assistance}} from Kyle Busch, Harvick took over fifth {{place on the}} following lap. Afterward, Edwards became the leader, after passing Truex, Jr. On lap 105, Jamie McMurray passed Truex, Jr. to move into second. David Ragan passed Kahne for the tenth position eleven laps later. Having led 86 of the first 124 laps, Edwards was finally passed on lap 125. Truex, Jr. moved into first position, and by the same lap Almirola had slipped to tenth. Marcos Ambrose spun sideways on lap 135, causing the fourth caution of the race. The front runners subsequently made pit stops. At the lap 139 restart, Truex, Jr. was the leader, ahead of Edwards, Harvick, and Johnson. One lap later, Montoya and Joey Logano collided, which resulted in Logano spinning sideways <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> major damage. At the lap 143 restart, Edwards was leader, after passing Truex, Jr. before the previous caution. On the following lap, Johnson fell to fifth, as Harvick moved to third. During lap 145, Kyle Busch took third away from Harvick. Two laps later, Truex, Jr. reclaimed the lead from Edwards.|$|E
