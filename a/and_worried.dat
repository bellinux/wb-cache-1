5|$|At {{the close}} of the third season, The Wire was still {{struggling}} to maintain its ratings and the show faced possible cancellation.

40|$|Anxiety <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> are not {{necessarily}} psychopathological reactions. Anxiety is a basic physiological and affective response to the perception of danger. Worry {{is an effort to}} deal with the perceived threat at an intellectual level.

50|$|Measures of {{rumination}} <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> {{have also}} demonstrated high correlations, {{above and beyond}} that of symptom measures of anxiety and depression (r=.66; Beck & Perkins, 2001). Rumination <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> overlap in their relationships to anxiety and depression, although some studies do indicate specificity of rumination to depression <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> to anxiety. Rumination {{has been found to}} predict changes in both depression and anxiety symptoms and individuals with major depression have been reported to engage in levels of worry similar to individuals with GAD. As a whole, these studies suggest that rumination <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> are related not only to each other, but also each is related to symptoms of both depression and anxiety.|$|R

5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Though Ziegfeld {{anticipated}} {{opening his}} new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat, the epic {{nature of the}} work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> about the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs Ol' Man River and Mis'ry's Comin' Around), Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita, a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When Rio Rita proved to be a success, Show Boats Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E
5|$|Building a {{complete}} deployment {{would have been}} extremely expensive, {{on the order of}} the total yearly budget of the Department of Defense. Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, felt the cost could not be justified <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> it would lead to a further nuclear arms race. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building a lightweight defense against very limited attacks. When the People's Republic of China exploded their first H-bomb in 1967, I-67 was promoted as a defense against a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its original form, ended.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{was nearly}} broke <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> {{constantly}} about leaving {{his wife a}} suitable {{amount of money to}} live on. Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend Mark Twain, understanding how bad Grant's financial condition was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking. Because of the summer heat and humidity, his doctors recommended that he move upstate to a cottage at the top of Mount McGregor, offered by a family friend.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated the importance of examining the relationships between personality and psychopathology (Krueger 2 ̆ 6 Tackett, 2006). The present investigation sought to further develop this literature. More specifically, the following study examined the links between neuroticism, experiential avoidance, <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> The focus {{of the current study}} was to replicate and extend previous findings on neuroticism, experiential avoidance, <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> In addition, a novel mediational model was tested to determine if experiential avoidance is the pathway through which the relationship between neuroticism <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> is transmitted. Results of the study regarding the primary hypotheses were mixed. While experiential avoidance, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> neuroticism were all positively correlated as predicted, experiential avoidance did not predict worry after controlling for neuroticism. In addition, experiential avoidance was not found to mediate the relationship between neuroticism <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Supplementary analyses found that anxiety, stress, depression, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> experiential avoidance were all significantly positively correlated with one another. In addition, it was found that experiential avoidance increased the prediction of a worry after controlling for the effects of anxiety, stress, and depression, and experiential avoidance mediated the relationship between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Clinical <b>and</b> theoretical implications, strengths and limitations, and future directions for research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how cognitive determinants and emotional determinants, in particular fears <b>and</b> <b>worries,</b> relate to STI testing behaviour. A {{survey was conducted}} online among 906 participants aged 16 to 26 years who completed a digital questionnaire about sexuality, sexual health, STI testing behaviours and cognitive and emotional factors potentially influencing testing behaviours. The cognitive factors were specified by an extended health belief model (HBM) and encompassed perceived risk and severity of STIs, perceived {{pros and cons of}} STI testing, and perceived behavioural control over STI testing behaviour. Emotional factors referred to fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> about STIs <b>and</b> STI testing. All cognitive variables of the extended HBM, as well as fears <b>and</b> <b>worries,</b> were found to be univariately associated with STI testing behaviour. In multivariate analysis, perceived behavioural control was found to add to HBM variables. As predicted the relation between fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> <b>and</b> STI testing was mediated by cognitive variables, but only the combination of extended HBM variables reduced the association between fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> <b>and</b> STI testing behaviour to non-significance; individual cognitive variables did not significantly mediate this association. Results {{of this study suggest that}} emotions influence cognitions in explaining STI testing behaviour. Fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> affect threat perception as well as evaluation of the behaviour, suggesting that threat appraisal and coping appraisal are intricately related and may not work in parallel as suggested by classic social cognitive models. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed...|$|R

Relative weights analysis indicated that perceived conditional risk of appearance consequences <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> about health consequences were the most important variables in the model. Consideration of appearance consequences may aid in motivating smokers to try quitting...|$|R
5|$|Regardless of such initiatives, Romania {{tended to}} give little {{attention}} to the potential of recruitment in Russia, as many decision-makers were still uncertain about the devotion of Transylvanians and Bukovinans, <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> that they might be welcoming Austro-Hungarian spies into army ranks. Additionally, probably half of the 120,000 men excluded themselves from the pool of recruits, as Austrian loyalists, invalids or men who had reason to fear Austria-Hungary's retaliation. Support from within Romania was therefore weak, and Russian obstruction still had a part to play, but in January the camp was visited by Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Gh. Pietraru of the Romanian Land Forces, on a mission to evaluate the recruitment project. The reversal of fortunes on the Romanian front had brought a Central Powers' invasion into southern Romania, and the Romanian military authority became pressured into finding new soldiers for the defensive action.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of writer-editor Stan Lee and artists/co-plotters such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Marvel began its own rise to prominence. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, The Fantastic Four #1 initiated a naturalistic style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons, who squabbled <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> about the likes of rent-money. In contrast to the straitlaced archetypes of superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and others complementing Lee's colorful, catchy prose, the new style became popular among college students who could identify with the angst and the irreverent nature of the characters such as Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Hulk during a time period of social upheaval {{and the rise of}} a youth counterculture.|$|E

Taft issued a tribute to the man he had appointed to the center seat, and waited <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> if he would be White's successor. Despite widespread speculation Taft would be the pick, Harding made no quick announcement. Taft was lobbying for himself behind the scenes, especially with the Ohio politicians who formed Harding's inner circle.|$|E

5|$|Despite Arévalo's anti-communism, the U.S. was {{suspicious}} of him, <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> {{that he was}} under Soviet influence. The communist movement did grow stronger during Arévalo's presidency, partly because he released its imprisoned leaders, and also through {{the strength of its}} teachers' union. Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo's support of the Caribbean Legion. The Legion was a group of progressive exiles and revolutionaries, whose members included Fidel Castro, that aimed to overthrow U.S.-backed dictatorships across Central America. The government also faced opposition from within the country; Arévalo survived at least 25 coup attempts during his presidency. A notable example was an attempt in 1949 led by Francisco Arana, which was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana's supporters and a force led by Arévalo's defense minister Jacobo Árbenz. Arana was among those killed, but details of the coup attempt were never made public. Other sources of opposition to Arévalo's government were the right-wing politicians and conservatives within the military who had grown powerful during Ubico's dictatorship, as well as the clergy of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|Kruger {{and others}} in the Transvaal {{government}} disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency, <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts—to the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State. After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the cast of House were not established actors, with many having primarily only worked with Obayashi on his commercials and independent films. During the two-year waiting period to start filming House, Obayashi created several commercials and began casting the seven girls from models who were in his commercials. The most experienced members of the main cast were Kimiko Ikegami and Yōko Minamida. Obayashi was friends with Minamida who he filmed in commercials for Calpis. Ikegami was mostly working television and theater at the time <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> that taking {{the role of the}} older woman would {{have a negative effect on}} the roles she would be subsequently offered, but still agreed to play the part. The country music singer Kiyohiko Ozaki, who plays Mr. Togo in the film, was cast because he was friends with Obayashi through their shared hobby of horseback riding. Other roles were filled by members of the crew and their families; for example, Nobuhiko Obayashi's daughter Chigumi plays the little girl, and the film's production designer plays the shoe maker.|$|E
