Morphological variations among these materials were investigated. Some of the local genotypes were determined to be <b>accessions</b> increasing variations. A cluster diagram obtained from the morphological descriptors produced ten main sub-cluster groups of tomato <b>accessions</b> at a coefficient of 0. 15. <b>Accessions</b> were put into cluster groups based on certain qualities unique. It was observed that 86 out of 88 tomato <b>accessions</b> under study were distinct <b>accessions.</b> G 80 and G 83 were recorded similar (94 %) <b>accessions</b> in all <b>accessions.</b> Similarity coefficient values among the 88 <b>accessions</b> ranged from - 0. 11 to 0. 94. <b>Accessions</b> with similar quantitative and qualitative morphological characters appeared well grouped in the same cluster. These <b>accessions</b> are considered as important genetic resources in tomato breeding studies...|$|R
40|$|Seed protein {{profiles}} of 19 <b>accessions</b> representing 7 {{sections of the}} genus Arachis were studied using SDS-PAGE. The general profile showed appreciable homology between these taxa, supporting their classification based on morphology and cross-compatibility relationships. The <b>accessions</b> of section Arachis showed much variation, thus confirming inferences from earlier studies. Variation between <b>accessions</b> of a species is limited. <b>Accessions</b> of the sections Ambinervosae and Caulorhizae formed one cluster and <b>accessions</b> of sections Erectoides and Procumbensae formed another, while the representative <b>accessions</b> of sections Triseminalae and Extranervosae formed two independent clusters. Using the percentage of dissimilarity in electrophoretic bands as a statistical genetic distance between <b>accessions,</b> section Arachis (containing the cultivated groundnut, A. hypogaea) is phylogenetically closest to section Erectoides followed by Procumbensae, Ambinervosae, Caulorhizae, Triseminalae and Extranervosae, respectivel...|$|R
