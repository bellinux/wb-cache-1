40|$|This paper {{analyses}} five hurricanes {{that occurred}} in the period 1600 to 1800. These examples were identified during a systematic search in the General Archive of the Indies (AGI) in Seville. The research combined the expertise of climatologists and historians in order to optimise the search and analysis strategies. Results demonstrate the potential of this archive for the assessment of hurricanes in this period and show some of the difficulties involved in the collection of evidence of hurricane activity. The documents provide detailed descriptions of <b>a</b> <b>hurricane's</b> impacts and allow us to identify previously unreported hurricanes, obtain more precise dates for hurricanes previously identified, better define the area affected by <b>a</b> given <b>hurricane</b> and, finally, better assess <b>a</b> <b>hurricane's</b> intensity...|$|R
