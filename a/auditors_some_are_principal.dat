40|$|Abstract The {{current study}} has been {{designed}} and implemented {{with the goal of}} examining organizational characteristics using a heuristic model that helps distinguish auditors in terms of the acceptance of dysfunctional behaviors. This conceptual model is consisted of parameters including locus of control, acceptance of dysfunctional behavior, mandatory rotation, organizational commitment and auditor performance. Data were collected using Smith's standardized questionnaire, which was validated through the use of the factor analysis as well as the viewpoints of experts. The research was a descriptive correlational study whose data were analyzed using the structural equation model. The statistical population included all audit executives (senior auditors, audit supervisors and senior audit supervisors) with the audit firms of the official auditors associations of Tehran and Shiraz (including private audit firms as well as the Audit Organization). The sampling method was the simple random sampling which covered 620 <b>auditors.</b> <b>Some</b> 250 questionnaires <b>were</b> distributed finally. The collected date were primarily calculated with the SPSS software and analyzed by the confirmatory factor analysis to verify proper parameters and omit poor parameters. Also, the LISREL software was employed to find the optimal path through the variables.

New disciplines and approaches, following the example of ecology and urban forestry, are developing, in particular to assess the ecosystem services provided by vegetation in urban areas. The objective {{of this study is to}} enumerate and characterize the largest number of these services studied over the past decade. We have accordingly selected 170 articles according to pre-established criteria and created a table of the data from this selection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the beliefs, attitudes, and {{practices}} of principals with regard to equity and inclusion specific to hiring teachers from diverse backgrounds. A qualitative design and narrative analysis guided this study. Twelve principals and vice-principals from six high schools in one school district in Ontario participated in the study by answering questions on a self-completion web questionnaire. The findings were analyzed using four categories with regard to hiring diverse teachers: 1) current understanding of diversity in the school community; 2) current practices for diversity hiring; 3) beliefs and attitudes for diversity hiring and existing barriers; 4) solutions and future learning opportunities. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. The overall themes that emerged from the data were: a) valuing the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion; b) not valuing diversity and providing rationale for not considering diversity and equity. The findings revealed that <b>principals</b> <b>were</b> able to define diversity in their own words. However, principals did not always value diversity in teacher candidates in their hiring practices. The questions used by principals to interview teachers – based on those recommended by the school board’s interview questions – did not include questions that would elicit and support responses from teacher candidates with regard to teaching diverse students or that reveal the value of their own diversity. The findings revealed that there are various barriers due to biases, hiring attitudes and current practices. Finally, the findings revealed that <b>some</b> <b>principals</b> <b>are</b> resistant to additional learning and professional development activities, saying they see no barriers for diverse teacher candidates being hired. However, <b>some</b> <b>principals</b> <b>are</b> open to more training and learning opportunities and see professional development as a catalyst in bringing positive change with respect to hiring practices and valuing diversity.

Some buyers conduct their own audits or additional testing, while some buyers trust the results of third-party audits or inspections.

Audits are conducted under a proprietary standard, while food safety inspections are generally conducted within a legal framework. There have been many foodborne illness outbreaks linked to food processors that have passed third-party audits and inspections, raising questions about the utility of both. Supporters argue third-party audits are a way to ensure food safety in an era of dwindling economic resources. Critics contend that while external audits and inspections can be a valuable tool to help ensure safe food, such activities represent only a snapshot in time. This paper identifies limitations of food safety inspections and audits and provides recommendations for strengthening the system, based on developing a strong food safety culture, including risk-based verification steps, throughout the food safety system...|$|R
