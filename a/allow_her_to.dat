5|$|In early 2010, Salzgeber {{announced}} {{that she would be}} moving her base of training from the stables in Bad Worishofen where she had been located since she graduated from college. The new facilities, nearby in Blonhofen, Bavaria, offered more room and extensive natural therapy facilities, including aquatherapy, acupuncture, osteopathy, and homeopathics.

50|$|Another {{member of}} the Administration Bureau. <b>Her</b> ability <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> detect any lie from a person's spoken words and works {{similarly}} to a synesthesia as she can see 'colors' from a person's speech which <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> determine if they're telling the truth or not.|$|R
50|$|Dockwise Vanguard is semi-submersible <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> lift ships or rigs {{out of the}} water, and {{to place}} them into water. When her ballast tanks are flooded, her deck lies up to 16 m below the surface, <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> handle deep draught cargoes. Loads can then be floated above her, and her ballast tanks emptied <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> lift and {{transport}} cargoes up to 110,000 tonnes, 50% more than the Blue Marlin. She can also be loaded from a dockside, and large cargoes loaded by skidding them on tracks.|$|R

5|$|She {{was opened}} to the public on Trafalgar Day, 21 October 1971.

5|$|In 1957, McClintock {{received}} {{funding from}} the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of maize in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of maize through chromosomal changes, and being in South America would <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> work on a larger scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various races of maize. After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study The Chromosomal Constitution of Races of Maize, leaving their mark on paleobotany, ethnobotany, and evolutionary biology.|$|E

After airing more than 100 MTV Unplugged specials, MTV wanted {{to bring back the}} series, in order to expose them to a younger generation. The channel recruited various mainstream and popular artists to perform as part of the series, including Perry, who particularly expressed interest in the idea as it would <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> showcase herself as an artist and share the stories behind her songs.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November, Thunderer {{was sold}} for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow & Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in draught to enter their {{scrapyard}} in Blyth {{and so was}} partially stripped down at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth harbour entrance on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, {{she went back to}} Rosyth to be further lightened, as her draught was still too deep to <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E

Quinn is responding to Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's side of her car.|$|E
5|$|Selznick {{observed}} {{that she had}} shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused to <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> join Olivier in Pride and Prejudice (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then {{at the peak of}} his success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.|$|E

The girl received several vessels of intoxicating drinks and she sang and bade her friends farewell.|$|E

5|$|Though Olga {{repeatedly}} asked Tsar Nicholas II to <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> divorce, {{her brother}} refused on religious and dynastic grounds; he believed marriage was {{for life and}} that royalty should marry within royalty. When their brother, Grand Duke Michael, eloped with his mistress, Natasha Wulfert, the Tsar and Olga were scandalized {{along with the rest}} of society. Natasha was a commoner who had been divorced twice, and one of her former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky. Michael was banished from Russia, and the likelihood of the Tsar ever granting Olga's divorce, or permitting her to marry a commoner, looked remote.|$|E
5|$|Warrior {{was heavily}} {{damaged by the}} German shells, which caused large fires and heavy flooding, {{although}} the engine room crew - of whom only three survived - kept the engines running for long enough to <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> withdraw to the west. She was taken in tow by the seaplane tender HMS Engadine who took off her surviving crew of 743.

He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 {{he was able to}} tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to <b>allow</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.|$|E
