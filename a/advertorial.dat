25|$|In recent years, the <b>advertorial</b> emerged. Advertorials {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{recognized as an}} opposite-editorial which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. Advertorials commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, {{a new form of}} laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a press release than of an objective news story. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and <b>advertorial</b> content.|$|E

500|$|Marcus {{used his}} public-relations skills once again when Dallas was labeled [...] "City of Hate" [...] {{following}} the November 22, 1963, assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy. An early supporter of Kennedy's {{run for the}} presidency, Marcus had tolerated the closing of several customers' accounts when he announced {{his support for the}} candidate in the 1960 elections. In fact, he had cautioned that Kennedy's visit be reconsidered in light of the city's earlier poor reception of Adlai Stevenson and Vice-President Lyndon Baines Johnson. In Kennedy's memory, Marcus arranged to have 500 hand-typeset and bound copies printed of Kennedy's scheduled speech at the Dallas Trade Mart, of which the first copy went to Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline. The following New Year's Day, 1964, Marcus took out a full-page <b>advertorial</b> in The Dallas Morning News titled, [...] "What's Right With Dallas?" ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in April 2014 and {{spanning}} into August, PewDiePie, {{along with}} his girlfriend Marzia Bisognin, began a marketing campaign for the Legendary Pictures film As Above, So Below. PewDiePie's videos for the marketing campaign included a miniseries featuring him participating in the [...] "Catacombs Challenge".

2500|$|Rage has {{previously}} had to censor and remove videos which have breached <b>advertorial</b> and editorial guidelines for ABC TV.
