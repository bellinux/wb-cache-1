5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born <b>again</b> <b>before</b> the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost.

In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E
