They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, {{and asked if he}} could protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm more than a few deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial force of <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|Fitch {{attended}} Chadron State College {{for three}} years, {{then transferred to}} Northwestern University; but this was during World War II, and his studies were interrupted by being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1943. After he had completed basic training, the Army sent him to Carnegie Institute of Technology for training under the Army Specialized Training Program. Under this program, some 200,000 soldiers attended colleges for intensive courses. Fitch was in the program {{for less than a}} year before the manpower requirements of the war became too great, and the Army terminated the program. Most of the soldiers in the ASTP were posted to combat units, but Fitch was one of <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> ASTP soldiers who joined the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), which provided much-needed technicians to the Manhattan Project.|$|E

25|$|Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni {{arrived in}} Jerusalem {{with the intent}} to {{surround}} and besiege its Jewish community. He moved to Surif, a village to the southwest of Jerusalem, with his supporters—around a hundred fighters who were trained in Syria before the war and who served as officers in his army, Jihad al-Muqadas, or Army of the Holy War. He was joined by <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> young villagers and Arab veterans of the British Army. His militia soon had several thousand men, and it moved its training quarters to Bir Zeit, a town near Ramallah. Its zone of influence extended up to Lydda and Ramleh, where Hasan Salama—a veteran of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine—commanded 1,000 men and coordinated, with al-Husayni, a plan of disruption and harassment of road traffic.|$|E
25|$|In 1825, he {{left for}} his second Canadian and third Arctic expedition. The goal this time was {{the mouth of the}} Mackenzie River from which he would follow the coast westward and {{possibly}} meet Frederick William Beechey who would try to sail northeast from the Bering Strait. With him was John Richardson who would follow the coast east from the Mackenzie to the mouth of the Coppermine River. At the same time, William Edward Parry would try to sail west from the Atlantic. (Beechey reached Point Barrow and Parry became frozen in 900 miles east. At this time, the only known points on the north coast were <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> miles east from the Bering Strait, the mouth of the Mackenzie, Franklin's stretch east of the Coppermine, and a bit of the Gulf of Boothia which had been seen briefly from land.) Supplies were better organized this time, in part because they were managed by Peter Warren Dease of the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E
25|$|Amos {{started off}} with a special one-off show at The Jazz Cafe in London on December 2, 2009 in {{promotion}} for the album. Entry to the concert required a wristband handed out at the HMV store at 150 Oxford Street starting at 8:00 AM {{on the day of}} the performance. An estimated 400 people waited outside in the rain for a chance to see Amos perform. The free show was solo-based, with Amos accompanied only by her piano. On December 8, 2009, Amos held a private invitation-only set in which <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> music insiders and personnel gathered at Spin Magazine's office headquarters as part of their SPINHouse Live series. On December 9, 2009 WNYC, due to popular demand, moved their show to the Jerome L. Greene Performance Space and dedicated its one-hour show to a special concert by Amos, followed by an interview. On December 11, 2009 at 3:00pm Amos gave a free live concert via Livestream, followed by an interview, both of which were watched by over 4,000 visitors.|$|E

500|$|The musical {{style of}} Trans-Europe Express was {{described}} by AllMusic as melodic themes which are [...] "repeated often and occasionally interwoven over deliberate, chugging beats, sometimes with manipulated vocals" [...] and [...] "minimalism, mechanized rhythms, and crafted, catchy melodies". Hütter has commented on the minimalist nature of the album, stating that [...] "If we can convey an idea {{with one or two}} notes, it is better than to play <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> notes". The first side of Trans-Europe Express has three songs. The song [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] has been described as containing deadpan vocals with lyrics that speculate how stars look at themselves in a looking glass. Hütter and Schneider have described the song as autobiographical. The third track [...] "Showroom Dummies" [...] {{was described by}} Allmusic as [...] "bouncily melodic in a way that most of Trans-Europe Express isn't" [...] and with lyrics which are [...] "slightly paranoid". The idea for the song came from Flür and Bartos being compared to showroom dummies in a British concert review. Some versions of the song contain a spoken introduction starting with a count-in of [...] "eins zwei drei vier" [...] as a parody of the band Ramones who started some songs with a quick count-in of [...] "one two three four". The second side of Trans-Europe Express is a suite with [...] "Trans-Europe Express" [...] continuing through to [...] "Metal on Metal" [...] and [...] "Franz Schubert" [...] before closing with a brief reiteration of the main theme from [...] "Europe Endless". Allmusic described the musical elements of the suite as having a haunting theme with [...] "deadpan chanting of the title phrase" [...] which is [...] "slowly layered over that rhythmic base {{in much the same way}} that the earlier [...] "Autobahn" [...] was constructed". The song's lyrics reference the album Station to Station and meeting with musicians Iggy Pop and David Bowie. Hütter and Schneider had previously met up with Bowie in Germany and were flattered by the attention they received from him. Ralf Hütter was interested in Bowie's work as he had been working with Iggy Pop, who was the former lead singer of The Stooges; one of Hütter's favorite groups.|$|E
2500|$|However Raymond Mentzer {{points out}} that Protestants [...] "could be as bloodthirsty as Catholics. Earlier Huguenot rage at Nimes (in 1567) led to... the {{massacre}} of <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> Catholics, mostly priests and prominent laymen, {{at the hands of}} their Protestant neighbours. Few towns escaped the episodic violence and some suffered repeatedly from both sides. Neither faith had a monopoly on cruelty and misguided fervour".|$|E
2500|$|The Crimean-Nogai raids into Russia aimed {{especially}} at the capture of [...] slaves, {{most of whom were}} exported to the Ottoman Empire. The raids were an important drain of the human and economic resources of both countries. They largely prevented the settlement of the [...] "Wild Fields" [...] – the steppe and forest-steppe land that extends from <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> miles south of Moscow to the Black Sea.

2500|$|Their live shows, fed {{by their}} improvisational {{approach}} to music, made the Grateful Dead different from most other touring bands. While most {{rock and roll}} bands rehearse a standard show for their tours that is replayed night after night, city after city, the Grateful Dead never did. As Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, [...] "We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than {{off a piece of}} paper." [...] They maintained this operating ethic throughout their existence. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> songs.|$|E
2500|$|As long as {{the initial}} {{assumptions}} in the estimate are reasonable quantities, the result obtained will give an answer within the same scale as the correct result, and if not gives a base for understanding why this is the case. For example, if the estimate tells you there should be <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> tuners but the precise answer tells you there are many thousands then you know {{you need to find}} out why there is this divergence from the expected result. First looking for errors, then for factors the estimation didn't take account of - Does Chicago have a number of music schools or other places with a disproportionately high ratio of pianos to people? Whether close or very far from the observed results, the context the estimation provides gives useful information both about the process of calculation and the assumptions that have been used to look at problems.|$|E
2500|$|Beekeepers in Japan {{attempted}} to introduce western honey bees (Apis mellifera) {{for the sake}} of their high productivity. European honeybees have no innate defense against the hornets, which can rapidly destroy their colonies. Although a handful of Asian giant hornets can easily defeat the uncoordinated defenses of a honeybee colony, the Japanese honeybee (Apis cerana japonica) has an effective strategy. When a hornet scout locates and approaches a Japanese honeybee hive, she emits specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the Japanese honeybees detect these pheromones, <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> gather near the entrance of the nest and set up a trap, keeping the entrance open. This permits the hornet to enter the hive. As the hornet enters, a mob of hundreds of bees surrounds it in a ball, completely covering it and preventing it from reacting effectively. The bees violently vibrate their flight muscles {{in much the same way}} as they do to heat the hive in cold conditions. This raises the temperature in the ball to the critical temperature of [...] In addition, the exertions of the honeybees raise the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ball. At that concentration of CO2, they can tolerate up to , but the hornet cannot survive the combination of high a temperature and high carbon dioxide level. Some bees do die along with the intruder, much as happens when they attack other intruders with their stings, but by killing the hornet scout, they prevent it from summoning reinforcements that would wipe out the entire colony.|$|E
