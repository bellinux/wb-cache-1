40|$|The {{study of}} {{economic}} models has generated deep interest in exploring {{the complexity of}} our society. The primary {{purpose of this article}} is to study the chaotic dynamical behavior of an economic growth model describing capital accumulation presented by Bohm and Kaas in [3]. To start with, we use the techniques of symbolic dynamics to explore several properties, with the explicit computation of two topological invariants, which are associated with the discrete dynamical system in consideration. The analysis of these results allows us to understand the dynamics of the economical model and to distinguish different scenarios of complexity, namely in situations of isentropic dynamics. Finally, we show that the chaotic behavior arising from the discrete model can be controlled without changing its original properties and the dynamics can be turned into a desired <b>attracting</b> <b>time</b> periodic motion (a stable steady state or a regular cycle). The orbit stabilization is illustrated by a analytical control technique. This study tends to integrate and interrelate different methods in order to illustrate how our understanding of economic models can be enhanced by the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{economic}} systems has generated deep interest in exploring {{the complexity of}} chaotic motions in economy. Due to important developments in nonlinear dynamics, {{the last two decades}} have witnessed strong revival of interest in nonlinear endogenous business chaotic models. The inability to predict the behavior of dynamical systems in presence of chaos suggests the application of chaos control methods, when we are more interested in obtaining regular behavior. In the present article we study a specific economic model from the literature. More precisely, a system of three ordinary differential equations gathering the variables of profits, reinvestments and financial flow of borrowings in the structure of a firm. Firstly, using results of symbolic dynamics, we characterize the topological entropy and the parameter space ordering of kneading sequences, associated with one-dimensional maps that reproduce significant aspects of the model dynamics. The analysis of the variation of this numerical invariant, in some realistic system parameter region, allows us to quantify and to distinguish different chaotic regimes. Finally, we show that complicated behavior arising from the chaotic firm model can be controlled without changing its original properties and the dynamics can be turned into the desired <b>attracting</b> <b>time</b> periodic motion (a stable steady state or into a reg- ular cycle). The orbit sabillization is illustrated by the application of a feedback control technique initially developed by Romeiras et al. [1]. This work provides another illustration of how our under- standing of economic models can be enhanced by the theoretical and numerical investigation of nonlinear dynamical systems modelled by ordinary differential equations...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the existence, the {{asymptotic}} behavior and stability in Lp and Lp, 32 < p ≤, for solutions to the steady state 3 D Navier–Stokes equations with possibly very singular external forces. We show that under certain smallness conditions of the forcing term there exists solutions to the stationary Navier–Stokes equations in Lp spaces, and we prove the stability of these solutions. Namely, we prove that such small steady state solutions <b>attract</b> <b>time</b> dependent solutions with large initial velocity driven by the same forcing. We also give non-existence results of stationary solutions in Lp, for 1 ≤ p ≤ 32...|$|R
