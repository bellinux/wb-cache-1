Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced.

This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the primary component being a Lambda Boötis star, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements. 25 Serpentis, positioned <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot B-type giant and an A-type main-sequence star.

5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|In Proposition 45 of his Principia, Newton applies his theorem of {{revolving}} orbits {{to develop}} a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets. Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis {{is defined as the}} line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two apses. For illustration, the long axis of the planet Mercury is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally no more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, oblateness in the attracting body, general relativistic effects, and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.|$|E

In probe parcels the more and more precise labour quality demands require mechanization of experiments. A solution is offered to mechanization of distributing fertilizer on probe parcels. A new plot fertilizer distributor was designed and built. I outline here the principle of working of the plot fertilizer. The unevenness of spreading {{of each type is}} significantly influenced by the tilt of the cone-belt dispenser from vertical position. A test-bench was collected to measure the aberrations. The measurement proves that only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>degree</b> deviation results in significant change in the unevenness of dispensing...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a high {{polarization}} of the nuclear spins in an ensemble of 3 He atoms are theoretically investigated.

As a consequence, the macroscopic properties of gaseous, liquid or solid 3 He at low temperatures may be significantly altered. Several examples of these changes are briefly discussed in this article : modifications of the transport properties of gaseous 3 He at <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>degree</b> Kelvin, of the liquid-vapour and liquid-solid phase diagram, etc...|$|R
5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> below the freezing point. Major snowfalls {{can result from}} nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E
