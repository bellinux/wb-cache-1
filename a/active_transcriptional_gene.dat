40|$|The two-component {{regulatory}} system, {{composed of}} virA and virG, is indispensable for transcription of virulence genes within Agrobacterium tumefaciens. However, virA and virG are insufficient to activate transcription from virulence gene promoters within Escherichia coli cells, indicating {{a requirement for}} additional A. tumefaciens genes. In a search for these additional genes, we have identified the rpoA gene, encoding the α subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), which confers significant expression of a virB promoter (virBp) ::lacZ fusion in E. coli {{in the presence of}} an <b>active</b> <b>transcriptional</b> regulator virG <b>gene.</b> We conducted in vitro transcription assays using either reconstituted E. coli RNAP or hybrid RNAP in which the α subunit was derived from A. tumefaciens. The two forms of RNAP were equally efficient in transcription from a ς 70 -dependent E. coli galP 1 promoter; however, only the hybrid RNAP was able to transcribe virBp in a virG-dependent manner. In addition, we provide evidence that the α subunit from A. tumefaciens, but not from E. coli, is able to interact with the VirG protein. These data suggest that transcription of virulence genes requires specific interaction between VirG and the α subunit of A. tumefaciens and that the α subunit from E. coli is unable to effectively interact with the VirG protein. This work provides the basis for future studies designed to examine vir gene expression as well as the T-DNA transfer process in E. coli...|$|R

The data presented here suggest that in human cells, bidirectional transcription is an endogenous gene regulatory mechanism whereby an antisense RNA directs epigenetic regulatory complexes to a sense promoter, resulting in RNA-directed epigenetic gene regulation.

40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of chromatin can {{be subject to}} extensive remodeling in plant somatic cells in response to developmental and environmental signals. However, the mechanisms controlling these dynamic changes and their functional impact on nuclear activity are poorly understood. Here, we determined that light perception triggers a switch between two different nuclear architectural schemes during Arabidopsis postembryonic development. Whereas progressive nucleus expansion and heterochromatin rearrangements in cotyledon cells are achieved similarly under light and dark conditions during germination, the later steps that lead to mature nuclear phenotypes are intimately associated with the photomorphogenic transition in an organ-specific manner. The light signaling integrators DE-ETIOLATED 1 and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 maintain heterochromatin in a decondensed state in etiolated cotyledons. In contrast, under light conditions cryptochrome-mediated photoperception releases nuclear expansion and heterochromatin compaction within conspicuous chromocenters. For all tested loci, chromatin condensation during photomorphogenesis does not detectably rely on DNA methylation-based processes. Notwithstanding, the efficiency of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> silencing may be impacted during the transition, as based on the reactivation of transposable element-driven reporter genes. Finally, we report that global engagement of RNA polymerase II in transcription is highly increased under light conditions, suggesting that cotyledon photomorphogenesis involves a transition from globally quiescent to more <b>active</b> <b>transcriptional</b> states. Given these findings, we propose that light-triggered changes in nuclear architecture underlie interplays between heterochromatin reorganization and transcriptional reprogramming associated {{with the establishment of}} photosynthesis...|$|R

25|$|Transposon {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> silencing targeting transposons. <b>Transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> silencing is {{a product}} of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including hemophilia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|R
40|$|In humans, T-cells {{accomplish}} {{expression of}} MHC-II molecules through induction of CIITA upon activation. Here {{we show that}} CIITA promoter accessibility in T-cells is epigenetically regulated. In unstimulated T-cells, CIITA-PIII chromatin displays relative high levels of repressive histone methylation marks (3 Me-K 27 -H 3 and 3 Me-K 20 -H 4) {{and low levels of}} acetylated histones H 3 (Ac-H 3) and H 4 (Ac-H 4). These repressive histone marks are replaced by histone methylation marks associated with <b>transcriptional</b> <b>active</b> <b>genes</b> (3 Me-K 4 -H 3) and high levels of Ac-H 3 and Ac-H 4 in activated T-cells. This is associated with concomitant recruitment of RNA polymerase II. In T-leukemia cells, devoid of CIITA expression, similar repressive histone methylation marks and low levels of acetylated histone H 3 correlated with lack of CIITA expression. This in contrast to CIITA expressing T-lymphoma cells, which display high levels of Ac-H 3 and 3 Me-K 4 -H 3, and relative low levels of the 3 Me-K 27 -H 3 and 3 Me-K 20 -H 4 marks. Of interest was the observation that the levels of histone acetylation and methylation modifications in histones H 3 and H 4 were also noted in chromatin of the downstream CIITA-PIV promoter as well as the upstream CIITA-PI and CIITA-PII promoters both in normal T-cells and in malignant T-cells. Together our data show that CIITA chromatin in T-cells expressing CIITA display similar histone acetylation and methylation characteristics associated with an open chromatin structure. The opposite is true for T-cells lacking CIITA expression, which display histone modifications characteristic of condensed chromatin. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{amphibian}} oocytes, most lateral {{loops of}} the lampbrush chromosomes correspond to <b>active</b> <b>transcriptional</b> sites for RNA polymerase II. We show that newly assembled {{small nuclear ribonucleoprotein}} (RNP [snRNP]) particles, which are formed upon cytoplasmic injection of fluorescently labeled spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), target the nascent transcripts of the chromosomal loops. With this new targeting assay, we demonstrate that nonfunctional forms of U 1 and U 2 snRNAs still associate with the <b>active</b> <b>transcriptional</b> units. In particular, we find that their association with nascent RNP fibrils is independent of their base pairing with pre–messenger RNAs. Additionally, stem loop I of the U 1 snRNA is identified as a discrete domain that is both necessary and sufficient for association with nascent transcripts. Finally, in oocytes deficient in splicing, the recruitment of U 1, U 4, and U 5 snRNPs to transcriptional units is not affected. Collectively, these data indicate that the recruitment of snRNPs to nascent transcripts and the assembly of the spliceosome are uncoupled events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRNA {{interference}} is a conserved {{mechanism by}} which double-stranded RNA is processed into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that can trigger both post-transcriptional and <b>transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> silencing. In fission yeast, the RNA-induced initiation of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> silencing (RITS) complex contains Dicer-generated siRNAs and is required for heterochromatic silencing. Here we show that RITS components, including Argonaute protein, bind to all known heterochromatic loci. At the mating-type region, RITS is recruited to the centromere-homologous repeat cenH in a Dicer-dependent manner, whereas the spreading of RITS across the entire 20 -kb silenced domain, {{as well as its}} subsequent maintenance, requires heterochromatin machinery including Swi 6 and occurs {{even in the absence of}} Dicer. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that RNA interference machinery operates in cis as a stable component of heterochromatic domains with RITS tethered to silenced loci by methylation of histone H 3 at Lys 9.

We have previously demonstrated promoter-targeted siRNA induce TGS in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type- 1 (HIV- 1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which profoundly suppresses retrovirus replication via heterochromatin formation and histone methylation. Here, we examine subcellular co-localization of Ago proteins with promoter-targeted siRNAs during TGS of SIV and HIV- 1 infection. Analysis of retrovirus-infected cells revealed Ago 1 co-localized with siRNA in the nucleus, while Ago 2 co-localized with siRNA in the inner nuclear envelope. Mismatched and scrambled siRNAs were observed in the cytoplasm, indicating sequence specificity. This is the first report directly visualizing nuclear compartment distribution of Ago-associated siRNA and further reveals a novel nuclear trafficking mechanism for RITS-like components involving the actin cytoskeleton.
