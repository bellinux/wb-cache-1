2500|$|Pure {{water has}} a pH close to 7 (neither {{alkaline}} nor acidic). Sea water can have [...] pH values {{that range from}} 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer {{and the influence of}} contaminant inputs (acid rain). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in pipe fittings. [...] Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid (carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>water</b> (above pH 7.0) {{does not necessarily mean that}} lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide a geochemical {{investigation}} on 34 groundwater samples in the Mt.

The present study includes the first data on the abundance and mobility of minor and trace elements and the thermodynamic considerations on water–rock interaction processes in order to evaluate the conditions of alkali basalt weathering by waters enriched in magma-derived CO 2. The results highlight the occurrence of two hydrofacies: bicarbonate alkaline-earth and <b>alkaline</b> <b>waters</b> deriving from low-temperature leaching of volcanic rocks of Mt. Vulture, and bicarbonate-sulfate-alkaline waters (high-salinity waters) related to prolonged water circulation in alkali and feldspathoids-rich pyroclastic layers interbedded with clay deposits. The Al-normalized relative mobility (RM) of metals in Vulture's aquifer varies over a wide range (10 − 1 < RM < 104), confirming that the basalt weathering is not a congruent and isochemical process. Chemical equilibrium studies show that the bicarbonate alkaline-earth and <b>alkaline</b> <b>waters,</b> having a short interaction with silicate minerals, plot very close to the kaolinite–smectite stability boundary, whereas the high-salinity waters fall in the stability field of smectite and muscovite because of prolonged interaction with alkali and feldspathoids-rich pyroclastic layers. Overall, for the bicarbonate alkaline-earth and <b>alkaline</b> <b>waters,</b> the release of toxic metals in solutions is related to the spatial variation of host-rock geochemistry, the high-salinity waters, collected near urban areas, show values higher than legal limits for Ni and As, likely as a consequence of anthropogenic contribution...|$|R
