5|$|Sotomayor was {{appointed}} by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 {{as one of the}} founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years. There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure. Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. <b>A</b> <b>stickler</b> for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E

25|$|Nureyev {{was above}} all <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for {{classical}} technique, and his mastery {{of it made}} him a model for {{an entire generation of}} dancers. If the standard of male dancing rose so visibly in the West after the 1960s, it was largely because of Mr. Nureyev's inspiration.|$|E
25|$|He was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for decency. On {{entering}} politics {{he accepted}} the official code of conduct of the Communist Party from which he never deviated. He lived in a two-room quarter at the Western Court, {{and walked to the}} Lok Sabha until he became a minister. Subsequently also he led a simple life and shunned many of the facilities he was entitled to. When he was minister, he never allowed the official car to enter the airport tarmac for him after a flight. Instead he used the airline bus to reach the terminal.|$|E

Hermes has a wife, LaBarbara, and a 12-year-old son, Dwight.|$|E
25|$|Cadwaladr was {{subsequently}} posted {{to a hospital}} in Scutari, Turkey, a hospital being run by Florence Nightingale. Cadwaladr worked there for some months, but there were frequent clashes between the two; they came from very different social backgrounds and were a generation apart in age (31 years). Nightingale was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for rules and bureaucracy, some of which she set up; indeed, she was also famed as a statistician. Cadwaladr often side-stepped regulations to react more intuitively to the ever-changing needs of the injured soldiers. Whilst Nightingale subsequently acknowledged Cadwaladr's work and the progress that she made against the unhygienic conditions, the two fell out {{to such a degree that}} Cadwaladr, by now aged over 65, moved by choice from the hospital, nearer to the frontline at Balaclava. Here, apart from her nursing work and her supervision of the camp kitchens, she again gained notoriety for her fight with bureaucracy to ensure that necessary supplies got through. Nightingale visited Balaclava twice and, on seeing the changes brought about by Cadwaladr's methods, gave her the credit she was due.|$|E
500|$|In 1915, Earp {{visited the}} set of {{director}} Allan Dwan's movie, The Half-Breed, starring Douglas Fairbanks. In his autobiography, Dwan recalled, [...] "As was the custom in those days, he [...] was {{invited to join the}} party and mingle with our background action." [...] Earp became friends with William Hart and later Tom Mix, the two most famous movie cowboys of their era. Hart was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for realism in his depictions of Western life, and may have relied on Earp for advice. Earp later frequently visited the sets of movie director John Ford, whose movies starred Harry Carey.|$|E

50|$|Mills was <b>a</b> great <b>stickler</b> {{for small}} farms, almost cottier allotments; {{he did not}} see that any single bodily labour can effect but very little unless in combination, and that {{extensive}} projects employ most labour, and produce the largest results. A thick mist long clouded the human vision on that and similar points, and is not yet dispelled.|$|R
500|$|He was a stocky, compact man and {{a strong}} driver of the ball, playing most of his cricket as an opening batsman. He was a patient batsman and {{was known for his}} solid defence, but he was able to score quickly when required. In Sydney in 189798, he scored 160 in 165minutes, {{including}} 30 boundaries to assist his team in defeating the English. He was the first man to score 500runs in a Test series and was also the first to score three centuries in a series. His captaincy was disciplinarian in nature but his teammates respected his broad cricket knowledge. Even tempered with a strong personality, he was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for fair play on the field. His teammates gave him the nickname [...] "Paddy" [...] due to a supposed resemblance to the Australian boxer, Frank [...] "Paddy" [...] Slavin.|$|E
500|$|Somewhat {{forgotten}} today, Carl Locher (1851–1915) {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} visitors to Skagen. Holgen Drachmann, who had taught him before he attended the Royal Academy, persuaded him to go there in 1872. Especially interested in marine painting, Locher adopted a realist impressionistic approach, influenced by the time he spent with Léon Bonnat in Paris during the 1870s. <b>A</b> <b>stickler</b> for perfection, especially in his drawings, his works cover the transition from sailing ships to steamships and from the original Skagen to the evolving tourist destination. His paintings include , 1888, [...] (1892) [...] and above all [...] (c. 1890) which depicts the horse-drawn carriage which until the railway reached Skagen in 1890 was the way travellers arrived there from Frederikshavn. In 1910, Locher built a house overlooking the beach at Skagen Østerby where he painted until he died of heart trouble in 1913.|$|E

500|$|Groves was {{promoted}} to major on 1 July 1940. Three weeks later, he became special assistant for construction to the Quartermaster General, Major General Edmund B. Gregory. The two men {{had known each other}} a long time, as Groves' father was a close friend of Gregory's. At this point, the US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. The enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. Newspapers began publishing accounts charging the Construction Division with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency. Groves, who [...] "had a reputation as a doer, a driver, and <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for duty", was {{one of a number of}} engineer officers brought in to turn the project around. He was tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress.|$|E
500|$|Collier {{served under}} Brown from 1946 to 1953, {{a period in}} which the team won all four titles in the AAFC before moving to the National Football League (NFL) in 1950. That season the Browns {{captured}} the NFL title and then reached but lost the following three championship games. Collier's coaching style was the opposite of Brown's; Brown was a disciplinarian whose stern nature and aloofness often brought him into conflict with players, while Collier was a friendly, warm man whose patience and studiousness endeared him to players. [...] "Everything had to be perfect; he was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> on perfection – but at the same time, he had great patience," [...] Browns quarterback Otto Graham said in 2007. After the 1946 season, Brown asked Collier to analyze every play run by the offense, and Collier came up with a detailed breakdown of why each play succeeded or failed. This was the genesis of an annual grading system Collier developed to evaluate players' performance. The Browns used it for many years.|$|E
500|$|The {{son of a}} United States Army chaplain, Groves {{lived at}} various Army posts during his childhood. In 1918, he {{graduated}} fourth in his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point and was commissioned into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 1929, he went to Nicaragua {{as part of an}} expedition to conduct a survey for the Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal. Following the 1931 Nicaragua earthquake, Groves took over Managua's water supply system, for which he was awarded the Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit. He attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1935 and 1936; and the Army War College in 1938 and 1939, after which he was posted to the War Department General Staff. Groves developed [...] "a reputation as a doer, a driver, and <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for duty" [...] and in 1940 he became special assistant for construction to the Quartermaster General, tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress. In August 1941, he was appointed to create the gigantic office complex for the War Department's 40,000 staff that would ultimately become the Pentagon.|$|E

500|$|He was {{regarded}} worldwide as an arbiter of men's fashions. He made wearing tweed, Homburg hats and Norfolk jackets fashionable, and popularised {{the wearing of}} black ties with dinner jackets, instead of white tie and tails. He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs {{from side to side}} in preference to the now normal front and back creases, and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar, created for him by Charvet. <b>A</b> <b>stickler</b> for proper dress, he is said to have admonished Lord Salisbury for wearing the trousers of an Elder Brother of Trinity House with a Privy Councillor's coat. Deep in an international crisis, Salisbury informed the Prince that it had been a dark morning, and that [...] "my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance." [...] The tradition of men not buttoning the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to Edward, who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth. His waist measured 48inches (122cm) shortly before his coronation. He introduced the practice of eating roast beef and potatoes with horseradish sauce and yorkshire pudding on Sundays, a meal that remains a staple British favourite for Sunday lunch. He was not a heavy drinker, though he did drink champagne and, occasionally, port.|$|E
500|$|Ballantyne {{never visited}} the coral {{islands of the}} South Pacific, relying instead on the {{accounts}} of others that were then beginning to emerge in Britain, which he exaggerated for theatrical effect by including [...] "plenty of gore and violence meant to titillate his juvenile readership". His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened; <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for accuracy he resolved that in future, whenever possible, he would write only about things he had personal experience of. Ballantyne wrote The Coral Island while staying in {{a house on the}} Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife. According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman, The Island Home. He also borrowed from John Williams' Narrative of Missionary Enterprises (1837), to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The Coral Island with Williams' book open in front of him, so similar is the text. Edmond describes the novel as [...] "a fruit cocktail of other writing about the Pacific", adding that [...] "by modern standards Ballantyne's plagiarism in The Coral Island is startling".|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
