As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations. While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, [...] "It {{seems to me that there}} <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> you can do when listening to any new work.

When Leslie explains it is too late, Ken warns them the festival may become cursed, although he privately tells the documentary crew that [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> [...] know about white people: they love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses."

2500|$|There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> {{to which}} I am devoted: {{absolute}} academic and spiritual freedom, and {{the subordination of}} the state to the interests of the individual; expressed in other forms, the furthering of conditions in which the individual can develop to the best of his ability—as far as it is possible with a full understanding of the fetters imposed upon us by tradition; and the fight against all forms of power policy of states or private organizations. This means a devotion to principles of true democracy. I object to teaching of slogans intended to befog the mind, of whatever kind they may be. (letter from Boas to John Dewey, 11/6/39) ...|$|E
