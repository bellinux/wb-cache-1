40|$|The {{reported}} scanning (SEM), transmission (TS), and freeze-etching (FE) electron microscopic {{studies have}} agreed in confirming that in thalassaemic erythrocytes, previously incubated with brilliant cresyl blue (BCB), the unpaired <b>alpha</b> <b>chains</b> precipitate {{in the central}} portions of the cell whereas excess beta chains locate in the submembranous regions. This {{is due to the}} fact that beta chains, possessing two thiols instead of only one (as in <b>alpha</b> <b>chains),</b> are more liable to bind to similar groups contained in the inner red cell leaflet. Less soluble <b>alpha</b> <b>chains</b> tend to form inter-chain bridges and thus precipitate centrally.

40|$|Absence of laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> {{leads to}} a severe form of {{congenital}} muscular dystrophy (MDC 1 A) associated with peripheral neuropathy. Hence, future therapies should be aimed at alleviating both muscle and neurological dysfunctions. Pre-clinical studies in animal models have mainly focused on ameliorating the muscle phenotype. Here we show that transgenic expression of laminin <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>chain</b> in muscles and the peripheral nervous system of laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> deficient mice reduced muscular dystrophy and largely corrected the peripheral nerve defects. The presence of laminin <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>chain</b> in the peripheral nervous system resulted in near-normal myelination, restored Schwann cell basement membranes and improved rotarod performance. In summary, we postulate that laminin <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>chain</b> is an excellent substitute for laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> in multiple tissues and suggest that treatment with laminin <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>chain</b> may be beneficial for MDC 1 A in humans...|$|R

Mutations in the gene encoding laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> ? an extracellular protein prominently {{expressed in the}} neuromuscular system ? cause a severe neuromuscular disorder: congenital muscular dystrophy type 1 A (MDC 1 A). Currently, there is no treatment for MDC 1 A. Preclinical studies are {{the first step in}} testing genetic approaches for future gene therapy in humans. In the course of my research, I focused on a genetically manipulated mouse model of MDC 1 A, investigating whether the transgenic introduction of laminin ? 1 <b>chain</b> into laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> deficient tissues would prevent the development of disease symptoms. The overexpression of laminin <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>chain</b> greatly improved overall health and normalized the life span of laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> deficient animals.

2500|$|The {{classification}} of the [...] "A4" [...] antigens was complicated. The [...] "A4" [...] subset evolved to become D-region antigens, {{which was a}} large cluster of genes that encoded MHC class II. Several renamings occurred.

2500|$|The {{structure}} of proteins is traditionally {{described in a}} hierarchy of four levels. The primary {{structure of}} a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, [...] "alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-…". Secondary structure is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an α-helix or into a sheet called a β-sheet; some α-helixes {{can be seen in}} the hemoglobin schematic above. Tertiary structure is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The <b>alpha</b> <b>chain</b> of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the glutamate residue at position 6 with a valine residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in sickle-cell disease. Finally, quaternary structure is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.|$|E

40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} laminin (LM) <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> cause congenital muscular dystrophy. Here, {{we show that}} extraocular muscle (EOM) is spared upon complete LM <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> absence. The major LM chains in limb muscle basement membranes are alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2 and gamma 1 whereas alpha 2, alpha 4, beta 1, beta 2 and gamma 1 chains are expressed in EOM. Expression of LMoA chain mRNA is further increased in LM <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> deficient EOM. Mainly integrin alpha 7 X 1 subunit, which binds to laminin- 411, is expressed in EOM and in contrast to dystrophic limb muscle, sustained integrin OB expression is seen in LM <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> deficient EOM.

40|$|Laminins are {{important}} for basement membrane structure and function. The laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> is {{a major component of}} muscle basement membranes, and mutations in the laminin alpha 2 gene lead to congenital muscular dystrophy in humans and mice. Although the laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> is prominently expressed in testicular basement membranes, its role in testis has remained unclear. Here, we show that laminin alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 1, and gamma 3 chains are the major laminin chains in basement membranes of seminiferous tubules. In laminin alpha 2 chain-deficient dy(3 K) /dy(3 ASK) mice, lack of laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> led to concurrent reduction of laminin gamma 3 chain and abnormal testicular basement membranes. Seminiferous tubules of laminin alpha 2 chain-deficient dy(3 K) /dy(3 K) mice displayed a defect in the timing of lumen formation, resulting in production of fewer spermatides. We also demonstrate that overexpression of laminin <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>chain</b> in testis of dy(3 K) /dy(3 K) mice compensated for laminin <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>chain</b> deficiency and significantly reversed the appearance of the histopathological features.

40|$|A {{minigene}} {{version of}} the human gene for type II procollagen (COL 2 A 1) was prepared that lacked a large central region containing 12 of the 52 exons and therefore 291 of the 1523 codons of the gene. The construct was modeled after sporadic in-frame deletions of collagen genes that cause synthesis of shortened pro <b>alpha</b> <b>chains</b> that associate with normal pro <b>alpha</b> <b>chains</b> and thereby cause degradation of the shortened and normal pro <b>alpha</b> <b>chains</b> through a process called procollagen suicide.

A number of mice died shortly after birth. Microscopic examination of cartilage revealed decreased density and organization of collagen fibrils. In cultured chondrocytes from the transgenic mice, the minigene was expressed as shortened pro <b>alpha</b> 1 (II) <b>chains</b> that were disulfide-linked to normal mouse pro <b>alpha</b> 1 (II) <b>chains.</b> Therefore, the phenotype is probably explained by depletion of the endogenous mouse type II procollagen through the phenomenon of procollagen suicide...|$|R

Using a bovine alpha t 1 cDNA as a hybridization probe, we have isolated mouse cDNAs that encode <b>alpha</b> <b>chains</b> of two G proteins. One encodes a polypeptide of 377 amino acids (Mr 43, 856), identified as alpha s because it specifically fails to hybridize with any transcript in an alpha s-deficient S 49 mouse lymphoma mutant, cyc-; the other encodes a polypeptide of 355 amino acids (Mr 40, 482), {{presumed to be}} alpha i.

Sequence homologies with p 21 ras and elongation factor Tu identify regions of the <b>alpha</b> <b>chains</b> that form the site for GTP binding and hydrolysis.
