Payment <b>of</b> subside on <b>electricity</b> consumption, increase the consumption of this energy carrier and also increase environment pollution as a result. This paper analyzes the short-term and long-term impacts <b>of</b> removing <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> subsidies on environment pollution. To do so, the dynamic relation between electricity consumption and its price is estimated by using of an vector error correction model. The short – run and long – run price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> show the impact <b>of</b> increase in <b>electricity</b> price due to removing <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> subsidies, on its consumption and environment pollution in the short – and long run.
