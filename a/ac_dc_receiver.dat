50|$|Some AC/DC {{equipment}} {{was designed to}} be switchable to be able to operate off either 110 V AC (possibly with a voltage doubler) or 220-240V <b>AC</b> or <b>DC.</b> Television <b>receivers</b> were produced which could run off 240 V <b>AC</b> or <b>DC.</b> The voltage was not high enough to power some circuits, so energy was recovered during the flyback period from the primary of the line output transformer to provide a boosted HT (high tension) supply. In a typical vacuum tube colour TV set, the line output stage had to boost its own HT supply to between 900 to 1200 volts (depending on screen size and design). Transistor line output stages, although not requiring supply voltages above the rectified mains voltage, nevertheless still developed extra voltage over the normal supply rail to avoid complicating the power supply circuitry. A typical transistor stage would produce between 20 and 50 'extra' volts. Some details {{of the way in which}} the nominally 190 volts HT supply was boosted to nearly 500 volts in the 1951 Bush TV22 are described in a technical publication. AC/DC televisions were produced well into the color and semiconductor era (some sets were tube/semiconductor hybrids).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a hybrid AC/DC micro grid which will reduces {{the process of}} several reverse conversions in an individual <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> grid. The renewable sources such as wind generators, photovoltaic panels and fuel cell are connected to a hybrid grid. AC sources and loads are linked with <b>AC</b> grid and <b>DC</b> sources and loads are linked with DC grid. The proposed hybrid grid operates in a grid-tied or autonomous mode. Both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> networks are connected by a multi- bidirectional converter. This multi-bidirectional converter operates in parallel with <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> grid. Hence, demand over an individual grid can be coordinately controlled by multi-bidirectional converter. The co-ordination control algorithm at the bidirectional converter is proposed. Co-ordination control provides uninterrupted and smooth power transfer between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> link. A hybrid grid has modeled and simulated using the Simulink in the MATLAB. The simulation {{results show that the}} system can provides uninterrupted power, smooth power transfer between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> link and also manage the demand...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{is the way}} {{to capture}} green energy. This {{can be thought of as}} a recycling process where energy is converted from one form (here, non-electrical) to another (here, electrical). This is done on the large energy scale as well as low energy scale. The former can enable sustainable operation of facilities, while the latter can have a significant impact on the problems of energy constrained portable applications. Different energy sources can be complementary to one another and combining multiple-source is of great importance. In particular, RF energy harvesting is a natural choice for the portable applications. There are many advantages, such as cordless operation and light-weight. Moreover, the needed infra-structure can possibly be incorporated with wearable and portable devices. RF energy harvesting is an enabling key player for Internet of Things technology. The RF energy harvesting systems consist of external antennas, LC matching networks, RF rectifiers for <b>ac</b> to <b>dc</b> conversion, and sometimes power management. Moreover, combining different energy harvesting sources is essential for robustness and sustainability. Wireless power transfer has recently been applied for battery charging of portable devices. This charging process impacts the daily experience of every human who uses electronic applications. Instead of having many types of cumbersome cords and many different standards while the users are responsible to connect periodically to ac outlets, the new approach is to have the transmitters ready in the near region and can transfer power wirelessly to the devices whenever needed. Wireless power transfer consists of a <b>dc</b> to <b>ac</b> conversion transmitter, coupled inductors between transmitter and receiver, and an <b>ac</b> to <b>dc</b> conversion <b>receiver.</b> Alternative far field operation is still tested for health issues. So, the focus in this study is on near field. The goals of this study are to investigate the possibilities of RF energy harvesting from various sources in the far field, dc energy combining, wireless power transfer in the near field, the underlying power management strategies, and the integration on silicon. This integration is the ultimate goal for cheap solutions to enable the technology for broader use. All systems were designed, implemented and tested to demonstrate proof-of concept prototypes...|$|R

The control schemes for <b>AC</b> sub-microgrid and <b>DC</b> sub-microgrid are investigated {{according to the}} power sharing requirement and operational reliability. In addition, the key control schemes of interlinking converter with DC-link capacitor or energy storage, which will devote to the proper power sharing between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> sub-microgrids to maintain <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> side voltage stable, is reviewed. Combining the specific control methods developed for <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> sub-microgrids with interlinking converter, the whole hybrid AC/DC microgrid can manage the power flow transferred between sub-microgrids for improving on the operational quality and efficiency.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} fault ride-through (FRT) {{capability}} of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid during both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> network faults. In this investigation, commonly proposed FRT {{strategies for the}} distributed energy resources and <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> microgrids are implemented while the interlinking bidirectional converter is operated in power transfer mode. The investigations have shown that improvement in the AC network voltage is minimal during both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> network faults. However, the DC network voltage improves and rapidly recovers after both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> network faults. This is because while the AC network is relatively weak during the fault, the interlinking bi-directional converter tracks the pre-fault power reference following the fault clearance and assists with restoration of the DC bus voltage. However, this response could be detrimental if the hybrid AC/DC microgrid is operated in an islanded mode. Hence {{it is important to}} design a robust fault ride-through support scheme for the interlinking bi-directional converter in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid...|$|R
