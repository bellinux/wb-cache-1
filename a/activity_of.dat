5|$|In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of {{the complex}} is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein {{are present in the}} ring and are {{responsible}} for the <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the complex. In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this catalytic activity, meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of catalytic activity, the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the exosome in such organisms.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To explore whether {{persons with}} right- and {{left-sided}} cerebrovascular accidents differ significantly in mean impact of neurobehavioural impairments on {{ability to perform}} <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> daily living. Design and subjects: Retrospective study of data from 215 persons (103 right-sided, 112 left-sided cerebrovascular accident). The <b>Activities</b> <b>of</b> daily living-focused Occupation-based Neurobehavioral Evaluation {{was used to evaluate}} ability on an <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> daily living scale and the impact of neurobehavioural impairment on ability on another scale. Methods: To control for possible differences in <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> daily living ability between groups, analysis <b>of</b> covariance, with <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> daily living ability as a covariate, was used to test for a significant difference in impact of neurobehavioural impairments on <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> daily living ability between groups.

5|$|The LDL {{receptor}} gene {{is located}} on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form. A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> LDL receptor (LDLR).
