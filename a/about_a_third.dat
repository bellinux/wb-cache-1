5000|$|There are {{at least}} two {{distinct}} songs sung by this species. One consists of an initial note, followed by three or so repeated notes at <b>an</b> interval of <b>about</b> <b>a</b> major <b>third</b> above. The second song consists of an initial note, a second a whole step lower, and <b>a</b> <b>third</b> note, repeated two or three times, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> minor <b>third</b> below that. This second song is commonly described by use of mnemonics with the cadence of [...] "Po-or Sam Peabody, Peabody, Peabody" [...] (or [...] "O-oh sweet Canada, Canada, Canada") The rhythm is very regular, and the timbre could be described as pinched. These musical intervals are only approximate; to a human ear the song often sounds out of tune. The repeated note will often change in pitch very slightly, contributing to this effect.|$|R
