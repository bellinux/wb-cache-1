5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Collingwood and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Collingwood fired a total of 52 armour-piercing, capped and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a sub-lieutenant commanding the forward turret during the battle <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open on the turret roof during a lull in the action.|$|E

He also refused to authorize construction of a prison in Concord, and signed legislation allowing women to vote for members of local school committees.|$|E

25|$|Ball's tenure saw City {{narrowly}} avoid relegation by finishing 20th in 1991–92 and 19th in 1992–93. In December 1992, {{part of the}} floodlights failed {{with just}} six minutes left in City's home FA Cup game against Swansea City. The Grecians were losing 2-1 at the time, and when the referee tried to restart the match with {{only half of the}} floodlights working, City fans invaded the pitch <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> goalmouth. Once they were removed, the match restarted once more, only for the floodlights to fail one minute later; after which the match was abandoned. City lost the rescheduled match 5-2. City again made the headlines at the end the 1992–93 season, this time for all the wrong reasons. In the penultimate game of the season, City needed a win against Port Vale to avoid relegation. City were leading 1-0, but referee Bob Hamer awarded Port Vale a controversial penalty in stoppage time. The penalty was converted and, after the final whistle, City supporters invaded the pitch, the referee was knocked to the ground and one of the linesmen was assaulted. Manager Alan Ball also ran onto the pitch to remonstrate with Hamer and had to be pulled away by his backroom staff.

500|$|Powerful winds {{added to}} the {{destruction}} by damaging or leveling numerous churches and houses that managed to remain out of the flood's reach. The hurricane's cumulative force wrecked at least 100 homes on Cedar Key, and damaged or destroyed every building on nearby Atsena Otie Key. A fire broke out during the storm and reduced two large Cedar Key hotels to mounds of coquina. [...] When the storm abated, streets were strewn with piles of debris, including trees, roofs, railroad ties, and boats. A large ship called the Luna Davis was tossed ashore <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of Cedar Key's business district for weeks after the storm. Interests in shellfish harvesting took a significant blow, as the hurricane ruined oyster beds and carried most fishing boats out to sea.

In Garran's view a clause proposed at the convention, which allowed for tariffs against international trade while ensuring free trade domestically (the predecessor to the final section 92 of the Constitution of Australia), [...] "expressed the terms on which New South Wales was prepared to face the lion." ...|$|E
