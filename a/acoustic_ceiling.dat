500|$|The {{ground floor}} houses a 300-seat {{auditorium}} which {{also serves as}} a reading space when not in use for performances. Library CEO Judith Hare stated that the space would complement a recording studio, geared toward young people, planned elsewhere in the library: [...] "people can make their own music... but also they’ll have a place to perform as well." [...] In 2012 the auditorium was named Paul O’Regan Hall following a $1 million donation by the O’Regan family in honour of the late businessman and philanthropist. Government funding only covered the cost of the building, so donations will go toward expanding the book collection and purchasing new computers and special equipment. The hall is fitted with stowable seats, <b>acoustic</b> <b>ceiling</b> baffles, a video screen, and professional sound and lighting installations.|$|E
500|$|The three {{finished}} interior floors {{have been}} renovated, modernized, and updated since the original construction. [...] One step in modernization occurred in 1965, when an elevator {{was installed in}} the building. [...] Among various renovations, {{the second and third}} floors were updated around 1980. [...] Currently, the first floor has carpeting, fluorescent lighting, and <b>acoustic</b> <b>ceiling</b> tiles. [...] The north and south facades now have modern glass doors that form vestibules at the entrances. [...] The hallway ceilings have been molded with stenciling.

[...] One such scene includes a painting of the original courthouse surrounded by paintings of tablets representing each of the county's four townships, each with local scenes.|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{served for}} four years as the chief {{engineer}} under guitarist and producer Atkins. Porter became the engineer big-name artists wanted to work with, and he was influential in creating the Nashville sound. Record producer Owen Bradley once asked Atkins how he got his sound, and Atkins said, [...] "it was Bill Porter." [...] He recorded more than 579 records that charted—49 were top 10, 11 were number one, and 37 were certified gold records. Most were recorded at what is now RCA's Studio B in Nashville, where Porter {{was responsible for the}} sound. (At the time, there was only one studio, with no letter designation. In 1964, a more modern studio was added to the building, and the earlier one became known as [...] "Studio B".) The studio's acoustics were problematic, with resonant room modes creating an uneven frequency response. To lessen the problem, Porter took $60 from the studio's petty cash and bought [...] fiberglass <b>acoustic</b> <b>ceiling</b> panels which he and Tommy Strong, his assistant engineer, cut into triangles and hung from the ceiling at varying heights; these were called [...] "Porter Pyramids".|$|E
50|$|Quattro Pro {{shipped in}} the final quarter of 1989. The Borland main office was near the {{epicenter}} of the Loma Prieta earthquake and the building was severely damaged when large and heavy air conditioners on the roof of Borland's main building were thrown upward by the quake, and came crashing down upon the glulam beams running {{across the top of the}} building. The beams were damaged to the point where they required injections of epoxy in order to make them sturdy enough to support the building again. In addition, the sprinkler system was triggered. The building was closed for months. All the computers were removed, placed on the tennis courts, washed down (<b>acoustic</b> <b>ceilings</b> rained gray mush onto everything when the sprinklers ran) and dried with hair dryers. Those that booted up were put to work. Quattro Pro finished final quality assurance testing and was sent to manufacturing from those computers running on the tennis courts in the (fortunately) sunny and dry autumn weather.|$|R

40|$|The {{patients}} in the Intensive Care Units are often exposed to excessive levels of noise and activities. They can suffer from sleep disturbance, especially at night, but they are often too ill {{to cope with the}} poor environment. This article investigates the acoustic environment of typical intensive care wards in the UK, based on long period nocturnal measurements, and examines the differences between singlebed and multibed wards, using statistical analysis. It has been shown that the acoustic environment differs significantly every night. There are also significant differences between the noise levels in the singlebed and multibed wards, where <b>acoustic</b> <b>ceilings</b> are present. Despite the similar background noises in both ward types, more intrusive noises tend to originate from the multibed wards, while more extreme sounds are likely to occur in the single wards. The sound levels in the measured wards for each night are in excess of the World Health Organization′s (WHO) guide levels by at least 20 dBA, dominantly at the middle frequencies. Although the sound level at night varies less than that in the daytime, the nocturnal acoustic environment is not dependant on any specific time, thus neither the noisiest nor quietest period can be determined. It is expected that the statistical analysis of the collected data will provide essential information for the development of relevant guidelines and noise reduction strategies...|$|R
50|$|When {{built in}} 1867, the school housed four classrooms, {{two on the}} west side of each level, with stairwells, coatrooms, and other {{facilities}} on the east side. On the second floor this plan is still in place, with wainscoted plaster walls, blackboards, and original door and window surrounds. On the first floor, the wall between the two classrooms was removed in the 1920s to accommodate town meetings, and a suspended <b>acoustic</b> tile <b>ceiling</b> was added in the 1970s. The cupola is a reconstruction of the original, also made in the 1970s, and houses a bell originally hanging in the South Dennis Graded School.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is the study of wide rooms’ <b>{{acoustic}}</b> false <b>ceilings.</b> In order to improve indoor acoustic comfort, it is possible to install an <b>acoustic</b> false <b>ceiling.</b> Many technical solutions are used to improve the inner room quality in terms of reverberation time and speech intelligibility. Restaurants and dining halls often can have acoustic problems caused by uncontrolled background disturbing noise. Indoor comfort can be seriously impaired in crowded rooms with many speakers, such as in restaurants and dining halls: the background noise produced by people talking damages the speech intelligibility level. If the speaker cannot be heard by his listener, he will speak louder. The speaker’s increasing voice power will gradually intensify the background noise producing a domino effect (cocktail party effect). In this case study we show the use of a brand new textile false ceiling system. This solutionhas just been installed in the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (Lausanne) new restaurant (1800 m 2) that can host 800 people. The innovative textile system, designed for this project, is composed of an aluminium structure within a shaped rock wool panel, enfolded by stretched EPS “acoustically transparent” fabric. This system, suspended from the ceiling and held by metallic lateral supports, improves the room acoustic quality, creating a nice dynamic effect as well. The installation of this system began in July 2014 and was completed in April 2015. We used the CATT-Acoustic software to analyse the room acoustic behaviour, the reverberation time and speech intelligibility...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNew office {{buildings}} use the thermal {{capacity of the}} structural mass to provide thermal comfort (TABS). The technique of TABS provides stable thermal conditions in rooms and {{is perceived to be}} a long-term energy efficient solution. A priori, this kind of technique is not compatible with traditional <b>acoustic</b> <b>ceilings,</b> covering a room from wall to wall. If the room acoustics is neglected and does not meet the current acoustic standards, this has often enormous impact on the discomfort, cognitive function, absenteeism, satisfaction, the physical well-being as well as the emotional well-being of the occupants. How can we quantify the acoustic and thermal impact of free hanging acoustic solutions on slab's cooling capacity? How does this finding stay in line with new parameters written in the international standard ISO 3382 - 3 and target values of the upcoming new German guideline VDI 2569 ?The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show the acoustic and thermal tests that have been conducted (6 rooms – Free hanging units (FHU) and baffles), the set-up used (3 timeframes combining 4 scenarios 30 %, 45 % and 60 % coverage with FHU & baffles), the measurement methods and gives data to encourage dialogue and coordination between the acoustician and other building engineering disciplines. The results are giving a clear indication of a much lower impact of high ceiling coverage rates than assumed. In other words, the impact of the users’ behavior on the thermal conditions by e. g. window opening is critical and coverage rates below 60 % became secondary...|$|R

Over time, George began to roll a lot of these functions into what was referred to as the multi-use theatre, and that’s really George’s invention, wherein technology was used to vary <b>acoustics,</b> move <b>ceilings,</b> to do all of these things with moving architecture, changing the physicality of the space itself.”—Yale School of Drama Allumni Magazine, 2010-11 ...|$|R
50|$|Still, {{playing at}} the Civic was no picnic. The site had been created as a multi-use facility, {{including}} for basketball games, and its <b>acoustic</b> tile <b>ceilings</b> and hardwood floors did nothing to enhance the instruments’ sound quality. But Rick Larsen, facilities manager for the Civic, was determined to make it work. In three phases, he and his crew, with the advice of acoustician Red Wetherill, installed an acoustic wall behind the orchestra, acoustic panels for the back wall (which came from the old Fox Theater), and acoustic “clouds” that came from Davies Hall in San Francisco. All together, the installations greatly improved the musical richness. The gift of a permanent Steinway piano in 2006 took the Symphony performances up another notch.|$|R
