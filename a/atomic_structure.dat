5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of the {{chemical}} elements in the first row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of <b>atomic</b> <b>structure.</b> In a quantum mechanical description of <b>atomic</b> <b>structure,</b> this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E

40|$|Cryo-electron {{microscopy}} (Cryo-EM) is {{a powerful}} technique to produce 3 -dimensional density maps for large molecular complexes. Although many <b>atomic</b> <b>structures</b> have been solved from cryo-EM density maps, {{it is challenging to}} derive <b>atomic</b> <b>structures</b> when the resolution of density maps is not sufficiently high. Geometrical shape representation of secondary structural components in a medium-resolution density map enhances modeling of <b>atomic</b> <b>structures.</b> We compare two methods in producing surface representation of the β-sheet component of a density map. Given a 3 -dimensional volume of β-sheet that is segmented from a density map, the performance of a polynomial fitting was compared with that of an iterative Bézier fitting. The results suggest that the iterative Bézier fitting is more suitable for β-sheets, since it provides more accurate representation of the corners that are naturally twisted in a β-sheet...|$|R
5|$|Francium's {{ability to}} be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its {{relatively}} simple <b>atomic</b> <b>structure,</b> has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the noble gases aided {{in the development of}} a general understanding of <b>atomic</b> <b>structure.</b> In 1895, French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine, the most electronegative element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of <b>atomic</b> <b>structure.</b> Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus, and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the octet rule, which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.|$|E

5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of <b>atomic</b> <b>structure</b> explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|In principle, an <b>atomic</b> <b>structure</b> {{could be}} {{determined}} from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This {{is an example of}} constructive interference.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates how the {{topology}} of a dynamical network affects its robustness against exogenous disturbances. We consider Laplacian-based network dynamics, and we {{adopt the}} H 2 system norm {{to measure the}} robustness of the network against disturbances. For networks arising from the composition of <b>atomic</b> <b>structures,</b> we provide a closed-form expression of the robustness against disturbances, and we identify optimal composition rules. Specifically, we show that networks consisting of multiple <b>atomic</b> <b>structures</b> are less robust than each isolated part, and that robust structures arise by interconnecting nodes of the atomic components with highest degree. Finally, we describe an algorithm {{for the design of}} robust composite networks...|$|R

5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the <b>atomic</b> <b>structure</b> of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or {{serve as the basis for}} designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E
5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time resolved crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full <b>atomic</b> <b>structure</b> of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E

He became a full professor in 1952 and {{was the director of}} Nevis Laboratories from 1951 to 1954 and again from 1957 to 1961. He worked with his student Val Fitch on studies of muonic atoms, atoms where an electron is replaced by a muon. After 1965, he worked on turning the Nevis synchrotron into a meson facility. When a reporter rang in 1975 to inform him that he had won the Nobel Prize in Physics, he initially thought that it was for his work on muonic atoms. Several hours passed before he discovered that it was for his was for his work on <b>atomic</b> <b>structure,</b> the Nobel Prize being shared with Bohr and Mottelson.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a set of}} multiresolution visualization and docking {{procedures that}} we {{refer to as the}} Situs package. The package was developed to provide an efficient and robust method for the fitting of <b>atomic</b> <b>structures</b> into low-resolution data. The current release was optimized specifically for the visualization and docking of single molecules. A novel 3 D graphics viewer, volslice 3 d, was developed for the package to provide an immersive virtual reality environment for measuring and rendering volumetric data sets. The precision of single-molecule, rigid-body docking was tested on simulated (noise-free) low-resolution density maps. For spatial resolutions near 20 A typically arising in electron microscopy image reconstructions, a docking precision on the order of 1 A can be achieved. The shape-matching score captured the correct solutions in all 10 trial cases and was sufficiently stringent to yield unique matches in 8 systems. Novel routines were developed for the flexible docking of <b>atomic</b> <b>structures</b> whose shape deviates from the corresponding low-resolution shape. Test calculations on isoforms of actin and lactoferrin demonstrate that the flexible docking faithfully reproduces conformational differences with a precision < 2 A if <b>atomic</b> <b>structures</b> are locally conserved...|$|R
