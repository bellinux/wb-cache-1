This brief analyzes the potential effects of an increase in debit card fees or in bank account fees by using the results of the 2008 and 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC). The main findings are that: 1) consumers with the least <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> education (less than a high school diploma), the lowest annual income (below $ 25, 000), and the youngest age (under 25 years) consider cost {{to be the most important}} payment characteristic. It is probable that these consumers would be most affected by an increase in debit card fees, and most likely to change their payment behavior in response; 2) the cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> seems to be an important factor affecting consumer payment decisions: consumers who rated the cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards as low relative to the cost of other payment methods were significantly more likely to adopt and to use debit cards; 3) credit cards were viewed as the closest substitute for debit cards. If the cost <b>of</b> using <b>debit</b> cards rises, consumers are more likely to substitute credit cards for some <b>of</b> their <b>debit</b> card transactions; 4) consumer reaction depends on the type of fee increases: an increase in the cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards specifically is expected to have a greater effect on debit card use than a broader increase in the cost of maintaining bank accounts; and 5) an increase in the one-time cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> card setup could lead to a substantial decrease in the rate <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> adoption.

50|$|This is {{a special}} type of purchase. The item or good is {{transferred}} as normal, but the purchaser uses a <b>debit</b> card instead <b>of</b> money to pay. A debit card contains an electronic record of the purchaser's account with a bank. Using this card, the seller is able to send an electronic signal to the buyer's bank for the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the purchase, and that <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money is simultaneously debited from the customer's account and credited to {{the account of the}} seller. This is possible even if the buyer or seller use different financial institutions. Currently, fees to both the buyer and seller for the use <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards are fairly low because the banks want to encourage the use <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards. The seller must have a card reader set up in order for such purchases to be made. Debit cards allow a buyer to have access to all the funds in his account without having to carry the money around. It is more difficult to steal such funds than cash, but it is still done. See also skimming and shoulder surfing.|$|R

This interaction captures the network effects as ACTVPOS is expected to increase when the number of merchants served by the acquirer increases or the number <b>of</b> total <b>debit</b> cards increases. The exclusion restriction for ICTVDC corresponds to the annual debit card fee and the network effects shown by the interaction term of the merchant acceptance in the network and the number of cards issued by the bank.
