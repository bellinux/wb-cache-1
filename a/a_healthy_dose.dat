The review concluded: [...] "The book is sometimes predictable and psychologically simplistic, but Dickinson {{comes across as}} a triumphant survivor. Her willingness to recognize her own flaws makes it easy to relate to her positive message and should inspire readers searching for solutions to career and personal conflicts."

Square-shouldered Toshi donned leather and metal, looking like a character out of the anime Gundam. Taiji dolled up in perfect, pretty glam. Pata's sleepy, backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark, as hide forever goaded the audience. And Yoshiki was a paradox all his own, bewtichingly effeminate one moment — and a full-force, wrist-breaking (literally) hurricane in concert the next."

He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear just walking in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks.

[...] The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness, where bears are plentiful, amused him, though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene. His final rating of the film was an [...] "F." [...] DVD Verdict's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together. He derided the scenes in which the bear would make a swiping motion, and the scene would cut to show a character flying through the air: [...] "I don't know how the bear mastered the art of jujitsu in the wild, but it comes in handy when four teenagers snuff your cub and they need <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of comeuppance."

40|$|Introduction: This article {{seeks to}} clarify if gender-based {{differences}} {{occur in the}} pharmacokinetics of metoprolol in the elderly patients. There {{are a series of}} physiologic changes that occur in the elderly ranging from decreased hepatic blood flow to increased adiposity causing higher plasma concentrations at therapeutic doses as compared to the healthy young population. Methods: Population pharmacokinetic modeling were performed using MONOLIX and Monte-Carlo simulations were conducted using MATLAB. The data was based from a previously published dataset where elderly patients, having multiple comorbidities, were administered a 50 mg dose of metoprolol. Results: Metoprolol was modeled using a one-compartment model and resulted in the following population pharmacokinetic parameters: volume of distribution, V= 38 L (CV= 155 %), clearance rates, CL-Men= 105 L/hour and CL-Women= 59. 1 L/hour (38 %), time lag, Tlag= 0. 469 hour (CV= 17 %), and the absorption rate constant, Ka= 0. 235 hr- 1 (CV= 23 %). Conclusion: Gender stratified doses resulting in an equivalent systemic metoprolol exposure in geriatric patients have been identified. Metoprolol doses resulting a similar AUC in <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> young male administered 50 mg tablet were 15 mg for geriatric women and 25 mg for geriatric men. Further, Metoprolol doses of 25 mg for geriatric women and 50 mg for geriatric men resulted in an equivalent AUC to <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> young males <b>dosed</b> with a 100 mg tablet. A 15 mg Metoprolol tablet may need to be compounded to account for the gender differences in Metoprolol pharmacokinetics...|$|R

[...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons}} of the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra.

I would also like clarification on whether that was actually Dean Winchester under the influence of The Mark, because last I checked The Mark made you hyper-aggressive like an animal, not a slut-shaming douchebag. Dean wasn't a demon when he made those comments, so I'm a little confused. Hopefully, The Darkness lives up to my already-high hopes and we get a really excellent eleventh season of Supernatural. Or, it could get bogged down in the execution of so many massive and far-reaching plot threads, and lose grip of many of the storylines, like what happened this season.
