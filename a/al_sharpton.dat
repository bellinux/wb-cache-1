5|$|On March 15, 1999, the Congressman {{was arrested}} {{along with two}} other {{prominent}} African-American leaders (civil rights activist <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and former Mayor David Dinkins), for protesting the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant to the United States from Guinea, by four white and Hispanic New York City police officers. The involved officers were later acquitted by a mixed-race jury.|$|E
5|$|Jackson was speculated as a {{potential}} candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004, but declined to run and instead became one of Barack Obama's early supporters. He endorsed Howard Dean for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, joining Al Gore in saying Dean was the most likely candidate in the primary to beat Bush. The endorsement was a bitter blow to the hopes of candidate <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> who had hoped for endorsements from both Jackson and his father.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, Rashid Johnson exhibited The Evolution of the Negro Political Costume in December 2004. He presented replicas of three outfits worn by African-American politicians. He included a late 1960s dashiki worn by Jesse Jackson, a 1980s running suit worn by <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> in the '80s and a business suit worn by then United States Senator-elect Barack Obama. The presentation, which invited inspection, was as likely to evoke humorous response to the Jackson dashika as well as critical commentary about the presentation of political attire.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the staff}} of The Political Cesspool {{organized}} a rally at the Tennessee area known as Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, {{has been the subject}} of a longtime controversy for honoring Confederate soldiers and ideals. The park had been criticized earlier by a black Shelby County official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and The Political Cesspool staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route.|$|E
5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E
5|$|As {{de facto}} racial {{segregation}} increased, so did tensions between {{residents of the}} northeast {{and members of the}} predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and {{had been shot in the}} back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back, and that he was carrying a gun. A police officer testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell's jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.|$|E
25|$|Louima {{has since}} participated in anti-police {{brutality}} protests with <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> notably over the {{shooting death of}} Sean Bell in 2006, and on August 9, 2007, exactly 10 years after his attack. On the latter date, Louima was honored in New York City by the National Action Network (an organization founded by <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton),</b> at the House of Justice, for his resolve and helping others who have suffered from police brutality.|$|E
25|$|On December 10, 2003, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{announced}} {{the removal of}} its correspondents from the campaigns of Kucinich, Carol Moseley Braun and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sharpton {{has written}} or co-written three books, Go and Tell Pharaoh, with Nick Chiles, Al on America, and The Rejected Stone: <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and the Path to American Leadership.|$|E
25|$|At the New York Public Library in May 2007, Hitchens debated <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> on {{the issue}} of theism and anti-theism, giving rise to a memorable {{exchange}} about Mormonism in particular.|$|E
25|$|Some {{have noted}} the {{similarity}} between this incident and past shootings of unarmed people, such as Amadou Diallo and Ousmane Zongo. The family has designated <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> as their advisor.|$|E
25|$|West {{has been}} {{involved}} with such projects as the Million Man March and Russell Simmons's Hip-Hop Summit, and worked with such public figures as Louis Farrakhan and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> whose 2004 presidential campaign West advised.|$|E
25|$|While usually {{associated}} with the political right, Pat Robertson has endorsed environmental causes. He appeared in a commercial with <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> joking about this, and urging people to join the We Can Solve It campaign against global warming.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Nelson Mandela, the film featured cameos by Christopher Plummer (as the prison's Catholic chaplain), Peter Boyle (as a police officer), William Kunstler (as a judge), {{as well as}} activists <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale (as street preachers).|$|E
25|$|On April 21, the day Tunnell {{resigned}} as FDLE chief, more than 3,000 protesters staged a rally outside the Florida State Capitol, joined by Jesse Jackson and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> {{calling for the}} arrest of the guards and {{for changes in the}} state correctional system.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 2017, King marched with <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> in Washington D.C. for the Ministers March for Justice leading over 3,000 {{ministers to}} protest the {{policies}} of President Donald J. Trump. King was under major controversy when he agreed to meet with Trump in January 2017.|$|E
25|$|Mario Cuomo, Carl McCall, and Carter F. Bales {{were among}} the many people who started their careers in public service in the Lindsay administration. Rev. <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> {{has said that he}} still remembers Lindsay having walked the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem when these neighborhoods were doing poorly economically.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, Sharpton {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Matrix Media to produce and host a live two-hour daily talk program, but it never aired. In November 2005, Sharpton signed with Radio One to host a daily national talk radio program, which began airing on January 30, 2006, entitled Keepin It Real with <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton.</b>|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 2012, The show Morning Joe on MSNBC aired {{live from}} Fort Lee High School. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski joined Gov. Chris Christie, Rev. <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> Michelle Rhee, Harold Ford Jr., Howard Dean, Interim Superintendent of Fort Lee Schools (Steven Engravalle) and other invited guests to discuss New Jersey's {{education}} reform.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day of the disturbances, <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and Sonny Carson led a march. The marchers {{proceeded}} through Crown Heights, carrying antisemitic signs and an Israeli flag was burned. Rioters threw bricks and bottles at police; shots were fired at police and police cars were pelted and overturned, including the Police Commissioner’s car.|$|E
25|$|Finally Lieberman {{withdrew from}} the race without winning a single contest. In total popular vote he placed 7th behind the {{eventual}} nominee, Massachusetts senator John Kerry; the eventual Vice Presidential nominee, North Carolina Senator John Edwards; former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean; Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich; retired General Wesley Clark; and Reverend <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Chambers opened That Old Black Magic Book and Gift Gallery, a Westchester, New York {{gift shop}} {{featuring}} African American gift items, art, greeting cards and books. The works of over 50 artists and designers were {{featured in the}} store. A monthly book club sponsored by the shop featured readings by well-known authors, including Arthur Ashe, Nikki Giovanni, Bernice L. McFadden, the Rev. <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> and Iyanla Vanzant. The shop closed after 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Brawley's {{claims in}} the case {{captured}} headlines across the country. Public rallies were held denouncing the incident and racial tensions climbed. When civil rights activist Rev. <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> with attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, began handling Brawley's publicity, the case quickly took on an explosive edge. At {{the height of the}} controversy in June 1988, a poll showed a gap of 34 percentage points between blacks (51%) and whites (85%) {{on the question of whether}} she was lying.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Obama, Edwards, and Kerry addresses, there were also speeches from former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, former Vice-President and 2000 Presidential nominee Al Gore, New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, former candidate <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> and Presidential Advisory Counsel on HIV/AIDS Denise Stokes. Ron Reagan, son of Republican President Ronald Reagan, also spoke at the Convention, blaming Bush's hijacking of his father's legacy for his switch in support to the Democrats.|$|E
25|$|The {{race for}} the 2008 presidential {{nomination}} began in earnest after the 2006 midterm elections. Between November 2006 and February 2007, eight major candidates opened their campaigns-Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Barack Obama, Bill Richardson, and Tom Vilsack-joining Mike Gravel, who had announced his candidacy in April 2006. Potential candidates John Kerry, Al Gore, Russ Feingold, Evan Bayh, Tom Daschle, Wesley Clark, Mark Warner, and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> reportedly considered running but ultimately declined to seek the nomination. Vilsack dropped out in February 2007.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} making the comments, Imus issued a public apology. By that time, however, there were various calls for his dismissal, {{particularly}} from {{civil rights activists}} Jesse Jackson and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> who threatened to protest both CBS Radio and MSNBC (which aired a video simulcast of the program), and to boycott companies who advertised on the program. WFAN offered its hosts and listeners a sounding board for their own feelings and comments, which were both for and against his dismissal. Chris Russo, in particular, expressed his disappointment at Imus for waiting two days before retracting his comments.|$|E
25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Barron ran for {{the city}} council. He {{attacked}} the incumbent, East New York councilmember Priscilla Wooten, for supporting Mayor Rudy Giuliani, saying her politics were out of date {{and she did not}} take enough initiative for neighborhood and community development. Barron was endorsed by black leaders David Dinkins and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> but he ended up losing to Wooten. Barron ran again in 2001, when term limits prevented Wooten from running. He defeated her son, Donald Wooten, and became City Councillor for the 42nd District. Barron was re-elected in 2005 and 2009, each time with over 85% of the popular vote.|$|E
25|$|Tawana Glenda Brawley (born 1972) is an African-American {{woman from}} Wappingers Falls, New York, who gained notoriety in 1987–88 for falsely accusing four white men of having raped her. The charges {{received}} widespread national attention {{because of her}} age (15), the persons accused (including police officers and a prosecuting attorney), and the state in which Brawley was found after the alleged rape. She {{was found in a}} trash bag, with racial slurs written on her body and covered in feces. Brawley's accusations were given widespread media attention in part from the involvement of her advisers, including the Reverend <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani's {{opponent}} in 1997 was Democratic Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger, who had beaten <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> in the September 9, 1997 Democratic primary. In the general election, Giuliani once again had the Liberal Party {{and not the}} Conservative Party listing. Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city. Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life {{in the city and}} 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{maintained}} his innocence {{up to his}} execution. In the 20 years between his conviction and execution, Davis and his defenders secured support from the public, celebrities, and human rights groups. Amnesty International and other groups such as National Association for the Advancement of Colored People took up Davis's cause. Prominent politicians and leaders, including former President Jimmy Carter, Rev. <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> Pope Benedict XVI, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former U.S. Congressman from Georgia and presidential candidate Bob Barr, and former FBI Director and judge William S. Sessions called upon the courts to grant Davis a new trial or evidentiary hearing. In July 2007, September 2008, and October 2008, execution dates were scheduled, but each execution was stayed shortly before it was to take place.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, King founded an {{organization}} called Realizing the Dream, which has been absorbed into The King Center under King as president. CEO Dexter King had accused Martin of establishing the foundation to make money off their parents' legacy that {{should go to the}} King Center. On April 4, 2008, the fortieth anniversary of his father's death, King and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> led a march around Memphis, Tennessee. There, he visited the Lorraine Hotel {{for the first time since}} his father's death, and placed a wreath where he stood before being shot. As he spoke to those who participated in the march, King called for them to continue his father's fight and promoted Realizing the Dream, which he said sought to eliminate poverty.|$|E
25|$|On October 12, 2007, Nas {{announced}} that his next album {{would be called}} Nigger. Both progressive commentators, such as Jesse Jackson and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> and the conservative-aligned news channel Fox News were outraged; Jackson called on entertainers to stop using the epithet after comedian Michael Richards used it onstage in late 2006. Controversy escalated as the album's impending release date drew nearer, going {{as far as to}} spark rumors that Def Jam was planning to drop Nas unless he changed the title. Additionally, Fort Greene, Brooklyn assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries requested New York's Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli to withdraw $84,000,000 from the state pension fund that has been invested into Universal and its parent company, Vivendi, if the album's title was not changed. On {{the opposite side of the}} spectrum, many of the most famous names in the entertainment industry expressed a sense of trust in Nas for using the racial epithet as the title of his full-length LP. Nas's management worried that the album would not be sold by chain stores such as Wal-Mart, thus limiting its distribution.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, the Senate {{unanimously}} {{passed the}} bill without amendment on July 20, 2006 by a 98–0 vote. However, {{in an unprecedented}} event for a bill that passed unanimously out of committee, Senators of only one political party, Republicans, signed onto the bill's Senate committee report, and the report was not filed until six days after the bill's passage. The Senate report differed in significant ways from the House report, and in their own statement, Senate Democrats objected to parts of the Senate report that they believed highlighted evidence that could jeopardize the bill's constitutionality. The day after the committee report was filed, President George W. Bush signed the bill in a morning ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on July 27, 2006, one year {{in advance of the}} 2007 expiration date. The audience at the signing ceremony included family members of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, the reverends <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and Jesse Jackson, NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, and other civil rights leaders.|$|E
25|$|That year in October, Farrakhan {{convened a}} broad {{coalition}} {{of what he}} and his supporters claim to have been one-million men in Washington, D.C., for the Million Man March. The count however fell far below the hoped-for numbers. The National Park Service estimated that approximately 440,000 were in attendance. Farrakhan threatened to sue the National Park Service because of the low estimate from the Park Police. Farrakhan and other speakers called for black men to renew their commitments to their families and communities. The event was organized by {{a wide variety of}} civil rights and religious organizations and drew men and their sons from across the United States of America. While Farrakhan was the keynote speaker, many distinguished African American intellectuals addressed the throng including: Maya Angelou; Rosa Parks; Martin Luther King III, Cornel West, Jesse Jackson and Benjamin Chavis. In 2005, together with other prominent African Americans such as the New Black Panther Party leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, the activist <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> Addis Daniel and others, Farrakhan marked the 10th anniversary of the Million Man March by holding a second gathering, the Millions More Movement, October 14–17 in Washington D.C.|$|E
25|$|Obama, {{having a}} Caucasian mother and Kenyan {{father of the}} Luo ethnic group, became the first African American {{as well as the}} first bi-racial {{president}}. Although he may have been the first black president to win an election, Obama was not the first African American to run for president. Shirley Chisolm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol Moseley Braun, Alan Keyes, and <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> all at some point were in the process for presidential nomination. The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President; all other tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984). Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 (John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting Senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 (Franklin D. Roosevelt/Henry A. Wallace). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major party candidates was either the incumbent President or Vice-President.|$|E
