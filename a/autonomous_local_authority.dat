50|$|The vestry of {{the parish}} was {{entrusted}} with various civil administrative functions from the 17th century. Unusually the parish was divided between the Highgate (upper) side and the Hornsey (lower) side, and separate vestry officers appointed for each side. After 1837 the civil administration changed. The Hornsey vestry established a Public Health and Drainage committee in1851; this committee only had a short life as it was replaced, in 1854, with a Highways Board, and a full Local Board was established in 1867. The Local Board {{gave way to the}} Urban District Council in 1894/5 which governed the Parish until 1903, when it became obtained Borough status. By this time South Hornsey had separated and become an <b>autonomous</b> <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> from Hornsey, which had become part of the Poor Law Union of Edmonton.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the center}} of the County of Toulouse and the {{regional}} parlement, Toulouse is often considered the [...] "capital" [...] of Languedoc. On maps (both ancient and modern) showing the provinces (i.e., gouvernements) of France in 1789, it is always marked as such. However, the intricate entanglement of administrations and jurisdictions permitted Montpellier to also claim that distinction. In the 18th century, the monarchy clearly favored Montpellier, a city much smaller than Toulouse, with less history, and with fewer <b>autonomous</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> such as Toulouse's parlement and capitoulate.|$|R

As with many large parishes in the north of England, Deane was divided into the ten townships of Horwich, Halliwell, Heaton, Rumworth (where Deane Parish Church is situated), Westhoughton, Over Hulton, Middle Hulton, Little Hulton, Farnworth and Kearsley. Under provisions of the Poor Relief Act 1662, the ten townships became separate <b>autonomous</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> replacing the civil parish of Deane as the main unit of local administration, although the ecclesiastical parish still remained under the authority of the vicar of Deane.|$|R
25|$|The area of Oaxaca {{has been}} divided into small {{entities}} since far {{back into the}} pre-Hispanic period. Much {{of the reason for}} this is the highly mountainous geography, although the occupation of the area by numerous ethnicities is a factor as well. The area resisted large scale Spanish domination through the colonial era, and maintained local traditions and customs better than other areas of Mexico. Even today, the state has far more municipalities and semi <b>autonomous</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> than any other state in the nation. Oaxaca is divided into 570 municipalities, about one-quarter of the total of the country. Many of the municipalities of the state had been ill-defined from colonial times until the 1990 INEGI survey which delineated them with exact coordinates. The most populated municipality is the capital, followed by San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec and Juchitán de Zaragoza. There is also a system of thirty districts to group municipalities.|$|R

40|$|Spain is to {{be commended}} for the notable {{progress}} made in development co-operation since the last Peer Review. Important achievements include the adoption of a comprehensive Law on International Development Co-operation and a four-year Master Plan (2001 - 2004), improved annual plans, and reinforced or new co-ordinating bodies. The purpose of the reform was to enhance consistency and coordination within the diverse Spanish aid system, which includes many ministries, <b>autonomous</b> regions, <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> and civil society organisations. A significant achievement of the new policy is that it establishes poverty reduction as the overarching goal in development co-operation. Gender equality and environment are also determined as mainstreaming priorities. Spain seeks to focus its poverty reduction efforts on basic social needs and a new micro-finance programme is an important addition. Spain has a comparative advantage in its assistance to Latin America with strong linguistic, historical, and cultural ties. Spain has had recent experience of building a democratic state and can add value by sharing lessons-learned with partner countries in innovative and risk-taking areas of good governance. In this respect, it can conduct dialogue with developing countries in areas that are difficult for other donors. Major activities through institutional development include judicial reform, decentralisation, tax administration, and police force training. These are areas in which Spain could take on a lead role in pursuing a sector approach with other donors [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Public {{administration}} {{is an area}} with particularly social impact over all members of society. In the <b>autonomous</b> administrative <b>authorities,</b> <b>local</b> councils have important responsibilities {{in the organization of}} local community life. Within these councils several specialized committees operate and those that have the highest volume of activity are usually economic and legal committee. Their role is to filter out under a particular form, the specific procedure being the approval of local initiatives in the field of specific activity, namely economic and financial and legal. The effects of this operation need to be reflected in the adoption of decisions that meet not only the initiator's intentions, but also {{the point of view of}} local elected officials who are specialized in a particular area and reunited within the previous committees. ...|$|R
40|$|The Finnish {{health care}} system is a mixture of public and private services. Its {{governance}} and funding is highly decentralized. Contrary to governmental policies and expectations, <b>autonomous</b> decisions by <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and service providers associated with lack of information models and common technical standards have led to a broad spectrum of one-off ICT –systems with little tech-nical and semantic interoperability. National strategies to overcome these challenges have prompted initiatives to create sharable electronic health records (EHR) by supporting a collection of federated interoperable repositories with regional middleware ser-vices. In the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa an established regional eHealth network (RHIN) connects 24 public hospitals, 29 municipal health centers (primary care) and two private health care clinics. There are 7. 500 end-users, information from 1, 4 million citizens and 40 million links to EPRs. Migration to a national eHealth network (NHIN) provid-ing a platform for delivery of a longitudinal view on pa-tient’s relevant health records (summary care record) will assist care integration between providers and improve the safety and quality of healthcare.

40|$|In {{the light}} of the theory for the optimal {{taxation}} and the practice in several federal and unitary states a conceptual frame of the distribution of tax responsibilities between central and <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> is outlined. A differentiation between the decentralization of taxation policy (the power to determine the tax basis and stakes) and of tax administration (tax collection) is made. On this basis the possible solutions for Bulgaria have been worked out and formulated. The conclusion has been drawn that the strengthening of taxation autonomy of the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> is the main goal of the reform in the local finances but the appropriate taxes are few and are with restricted income potential. Optimization of the estate taxes and their complementation with local taxes on rents and local tax on patents is proposed. The income potential of these <b>autonomous</b> <b>local</b> taxes is not that big (especially in small municipalities) which grounds the necessity of a semi-autonomous tax on personal incomes as well as of significant central state aiding, e. g. redistribution of tax income between the municipalities. ...|$|R

We will make an explanatory analysis of the design of the environmental tax system in Spain and how the double concurrency works in our country, in order to compare with Denmark, which leads the system of environmental taxation in Europe and globally, and thus understand what are the differences and why they have generated in this field. To conclude the study, we will present possible changes that could be made in the future to try to solve this problem.
