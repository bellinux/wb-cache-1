500|$|Forage {{conversion}} to milk with Shetland ewes is excellent, {{second only to}} Lleyn ewes in the UK. Because of the Shetland ewe's forage conversion efficiency, lamb growth is fast. A good Shetland ewe on adequate forage can wean off 150% of her body weight in purebred twins by fall. Some ewes wean singles nearly as big as themselves. A heavier Shetland ewe at 80 lbs (36 kg) can wean 60 lb (27 kg) purebred twins. What makes the Shetland ewe an optimal maternal base for grassfed lamb production is her prowess in producing hybrid market lambs: take the same ewe and breed her to, for example, a Leicester, Texel, Charollais or Berrichon ram, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> on the same pasture management system. In some flocks, ewes can wean off pairs of 90 lb (40 kg) twins at only 120-150 days old- each crossbred lamb weighing more than their dam.|$|E
500|$|Author Joley Wood {{compared}} [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] to {{an alternate}} reality game, {{in analyzing the}} effects of watching the television program Lost on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality.

In , [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a nerd.

Lisa's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by Turner's [...] as yet another example of her conflict with corporations throughout the series. Like O'Brien, Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa's questions about existentialism, self-absorption, and consumption. In , the authors discuss Lisa's level of anger displayed in the episode, noting that in this particular case her anger gave her the wherewithal both to confront social injustice, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> mind clear for critical thinking. Mark Demming of Allmovie noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason, while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode.|$|E
