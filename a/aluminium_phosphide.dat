A low noise charge sensitive preamplifier(CSP) with a novel local feedback is designed and characterised. The CSP shows a better noise performance than commercially available CSP such as the CoolFet 250. The CSP is also characterised for APD dark current of up 4 μA and the CSP is found to behave well for such relatively high dark current.
