His intention was to allow the non-combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River.|$|E
5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended {{the house to}} be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had {{no need for the}} house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2010, {{there are}} 18rest areas {{operating}} along the A3 motorway, and additional rest areas are planned along the existing {{sections of the}} route. Legislation provides for four types of rest areas, designated as types A through D.

5|$|Crocodylomorphs are {{abundant}} in the Mussentuchit deposits, being represented largely by teeth. The largest known teeth have been referred to the Pholidosauridae; they are broad with rounded bases, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> bear longitudinal ridges. These large crocodilians would have been capable of preying upon at least juvenile Eolambia at the water's edge. The abundance of juvenile Eolambia specimens in the lakeside fossil material supports this hypothesis; larger Eolambia would have been invulnerable to crocodilians. Smaller crocodilian teeth are also present, with two distinct morphotypes: an ovoid form bearing ridges, which {{has been referred to}} two different species of Bernissartia; and a compressed, triangular form bearing heavy ornamentation, which has been attributed to the Atoposauridae. However, given the uniform small size of these teeth, and the co-occurrence of these morphotypes in some crocodilians, they may belong to the same species.|$|E
5|$|Festivals, both {{national}} and Islamic, are celebrated in Marrakesh {{and throughout the}} country, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are observed as national holidays. Cultural festivals of note held in Marrakesh include the National Folklore Festival, the Marrakech Festival of Popular Arts (in which a variety of famous Moroccan musicians and artists participate), and the Berber Festival. The International Film Festival of Marrakech, which aspires to be the North African version of the Cannes Film Festival, was established in 2001. The festival, which showcases over 100 films {{from around the world}} annually, has attracted Hollywood stars such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Susan Sarandon, Jeremy Irons, Roman Polanski and many European, Arabic and Indian film stars. The Marrakech Bienniale was established in 2004 by Vanessa Branson as a cultural festival in various disciplines, including visual arts, cinema, video, literature, performing arts, and architecture.|$|E

Sixty per cent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war. Richard Overy gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 per cent died or were killed, a total of 3.6million. Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were sent to the Gulag upon being checked by the NKVD.|$|E

Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon after arrival in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers. Promoted from private that day, Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to post.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{who could}} leave their body in spirit during sleep were called burkudzäutä among the Ossetians of the Caucasus, {{and they were}} called mazzeri in parts of Corsica. The burkudzäutä, mounted on animals or {{household}} objects, flew on a night between Christmas and New Year to burku, {{the land of the}} dead described as a great meadow. There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudzäutä would fall sick after the return, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would die. The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other in spirit on the night between 31July and 1August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer more deaths during the next year.|$|E

5|$|Karnataka {{also has}} {{a special place in}} the world of Indian {{classical}} music, with both Karnataka (Carnatic) and Hindustani styles finding place in the state, and Karnataka has produced a number of stalwarts in both styles. The Haridasa movement of the sixteenth century contributed significantly to the development of Karnataka (Carnatic) music as a performing art form. Purandara Dasa, one of the most revered Haridasas, is known as the Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha ('Father of Karnataka a.k.a. Carnatic music'). Celebrated Hindustani musicians like Gangubai Hangal, Mallikarjun Mansur, Bhimsen Joshi, Basavaraja Rajaguru, Sawai Gandharva and several others hail from Karnataka, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have been recipients of the Kalidas Samman, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan awards. Noted Carnatic musicians include Violin T. Chowdiah, Veena Sheshanna, Mysore Vasudevachar, Doreswamy Iyengar and Thitte Krishna Iyengar.|$|E
5|$|Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) {{until the}} female lays eggs {{at the start}} of the nesting season, which is around the {{beginning}} of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to await the moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch, replacement clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} groups of Black Hebrews, the Church of God and Saints of Christ, was founded in Kansas in 1896, but it {{retained}} elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God. Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure {{similar to that of}} the Black church. He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.|$|E

After Orde Wingate was killed in a crash in March 1944, it was decided to break up the remaining Chindit formations <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were to be converted into airborne infantry battalions. The 1st King's was converted to become the 15th (King's) Parachute Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and joined the 77th Indian Parachute Brigade attached to the 44th Indian Airborne Division where it remained {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The {{blockade}} set by Grenville {{was initially}} {{some distance from}} the town, and did not prevent Blake from sending and receiving messages. The besieging army was reinforced soon after with Goring's infantry and artillery units, and so, with a large force, the attackers closed in on the town, establishing entrenchments within musket-shot of Taunton's defences. Command of the siege passed to Berkeley, though Grenville's troops often failed to follow the new commander's orders, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> deserted. Despite Grenville's retirement from the battle due to injury, he and Berkeley clashed; Grenville complained to the Prince of Wales that Berkeley was conducting the siege badly, while Berkeley claimed that Grenville had given his men orders to desert. These disagreements led Hopton, by now the commander of the Royalist forces in the West Country, to be given command of the siege.|$|E
