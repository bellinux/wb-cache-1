We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids. Because the site of sphingolipid synthesis overlaps the localization of IBV M, we asked whether perturbation of sphingolipids affected localization of IBV M. Short-term treatment with two inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis {{had no effect on}} localization of IBV M or other Golgi markers.

Critical amino acids for attachment of M 41 spike are present within the N-terminal residues 19 – 69, which overlap with a hypervariable region in the S 1 gene.

40|$|The recent {{finding that}} the E 1 glycoproteins of murine coronaviruses contain only O-linked {{oligosaccharides}} suggested that this unusual modification might be a distinguishing feature of coronaviruses and might play {{an essential role in}} the life cycle of this family of viruses. To examine these possibilities, we analyzed the oligosaccharide moieties of the membrane proteins of the <b>avian</b> coronavirus <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> virus. In addition, we determined the effect of inhibiting the glycosylation of these proteins on viral maturation and infectivity. <b>Infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> virus virions contain nine proteins. Four of these proteins, GP 36, GP 31, GP 28, and P 23, are closely related structurally and appear to be homologous to the E 1 proteins of murine coronaviruses. We found that the oligosaccharides of GP 31 and GP 28 could be removed with endoglycosidase H and that neither of these glycoproteins was detectable in tunicamycin-treated cells. These two results indicated that GP 31 and GP 28 contain N-linked oligosaccharides. Therefore, O-linked oligosaccharides are not a universal feature of the small coronavirus membrane glycoproteins. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation of all of the viral glycoproteins but did not inhibit production of virions by <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> virus-infected cells. The virions released by these cells contained only the three non-glycosylated viral proteins P 51, P 23, and P 14. These particles were not infectious. Therefore, it appears that glycosylated <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> virus polypeptides are not required for particle formation.

40|$|<b>Avian</b> {{coronavirus}} <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> virus (IBV) is the causative {{agent of}} chicken <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> an acute, highly contagious viral respiratory disease. Replication of IBV in Vero cells causes extensive cytopathic effects (CPE), leading to {{destruction of the}} entire monolayer {{and the death of}} infected cells. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during acute IBV infection and the underlying mechanisms. The results show that both necrosis and apoptosis may contribute to the death of infected cells in lytic IBV infection. Caspase-dependent apoptosis, as characterized by chromosomal condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase- 3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, was detected in IBV-infected Vero cells. Addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK to the culture media showed inhibition of the hallmarks of apoptosis and increase of the release of virus to the culture media at 16 h postinfection. However, neither the necrotic process nor the productive replication of IBV in Vero cells was severely affected by the inhibition of apoptosis. Screening of 11 IBV-encoded proteins suggested that a 58 -kDa mature cleavage product could induce apoptotic changes in cells transiently expressing the protein.
