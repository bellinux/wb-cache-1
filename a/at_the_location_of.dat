5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and building a large hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen and building a small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building a large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E

5|$|At Omaha Beach, {{parts of}} the Mulberry harbour are still visible, {{and a few of}} the beach {{obstacles}} remain. A memorial to the American National Guard sits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> a former German strongpoint. Pointe du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place. The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer. A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the American airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église. Two German military cemeteries are located nearby.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Freyr sees Gerðr from a distance, becomes deeply lovesick {{at the sight}} of her shimmering beauty, and has his servant Skírnir go to Jötunheimr (where Gerðr and her father Gymir reside) to gain her love. In the Poetic Edda Gerðr {{initially}} refuses, yet after a series of threats by Skírnir she finally agrees. In the Prose Edda, no mention of threats are made. In both sources, Gerðr agrees to meet Freyr at a fixed time <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> Barri and, after Skírnir returns with Gerðr's response, Freyr laments that the meeting could not occur sooner. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Gerðr is described as the daughter of Gymir and the jötunn Aurboða.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 17 of Skáldskaparmál, the jötunn Hrungnir is {{in a rage}} and, while {{attempting}} to catch up and attack Odin on his steed Sleipnir, ends up at the doors to Valhalla. There, the Æsir invite him in for a drink. Hrungnir goes in, demands a drink, and becomes drunk and belligerent, stating that he will remove Valhalla {{and take it to}} the land of the jötunn, Jötunheimr, among various other things. Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection, and subsequently he can't be harmed while in Valhalla. After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> Griotunagardar, resulting in Hrungnir's death.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the opinion}} of Mearns and White who {{investigated}} the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area. Bill Jurens points {{out that there was}} no magazine of any kind <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the break and that the location of the break just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates {{at the edge of the}} break only reflects their last position, not the direction that they first moved.|$|E
5|$|Should a new tunnel be built, {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} run next to the Oslo Tunnel. One proposal from the National Rail Administration calls for a separate commuter train station to be built underground, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> Oslo Bus Terminal, {{within walking distance of}} OsloS. This proposal involves the line connecting to the existing route before reaching Nationaltheatret. The lobby organisation Norsk Bane have called for a line to run further north, and serve Majorstuen, where there is a major metro and tramway hub. Norsk Bane also call for the tunnel to be built for higher speeds, and state {{that it is necessary to}} build high-speed rail to Bergen and Stavanger. Combined with a new line from Drammen to the tunnel, it would allow travel time from Drammen and Oslo to be reduced to 18 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The American modernist poet Hart Crane {{was born}} in nearby Garrettsville, Ohio in 1899. His {{adolescence}} was divided between Cleveland and Akron before he moved to New York City in 1916. Aside from factory work {{during the first world}} war, he served as reporter to The Plain Dealer for a short period, before achieving recognition in the Modernist literary scene. A diminutive memorial park is dedicated to Crane along the left bank of the Cuyahoga in Cleveland. In University Circle, a historical marker sits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> his Cleveland childhood house on E. 115 near the Euclid Ave intersection.

The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The San Carlos Convent, the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.|$|E
