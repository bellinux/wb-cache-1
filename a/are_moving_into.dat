He again goes behind Avon's back, giving up half of Avon's most prized territory to a rival named Proposition Joe {{in exchange for a}} share of his supply. Avon, unaware of the arrangement, assumes that Joe and other dealers <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> <b>into</b> his territory simply because the Barksdale organization has too few enforcers. He contracts a feared assassin named Brother Mouzone. Stringer deals with this by tricking his old adversary Omar into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one. Seeking revenge, Omar shoots Mouzone but, realizing Stringer has lied to him, calls 9-1-1. Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore, and Stringer (now with Avon's consent) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue to}} {{consider}} is {{the freedom of the}} migrants. Some scholars have questioned whether these workers <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> <b>into</b> a state of “unfreedom”. Recruitment into circular migration may involve false promises and deception, leading to forced labor and debt bondage. Migrants have varying degrees of control concerning the choice and circumstances of migration, thus making the distinction between voluntary and forced migration unclear. Once in their destination country, migrants are sometimes met with abusive treatment, inadequate nutrition, poor lodging, and insufficient food. These factors are unlikely to bring a worker back to that area, thus discouraging circular migration. This dishonest recruitment leads {{to the question of whether}} the migrants are marginalized. Circular migrants are marginal in the area of destination in the sense that their true home is back in their home area, and they do not plan on living in the host area permanently.|$|E
