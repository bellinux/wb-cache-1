Aqua-Sim is based on NS- 2, {{one of the most}} widely used network simulators, and it follows object-oriented design style and all network entities are implemented as classes. Aqua-Sim effectively simulates the attenuation of underwater acoustic channels and the collision behaviors in long <b>delay</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>networks.</b> Moreover, Aqua-Sim supports three-dimensional network deployment and provides a rich set of basic and advanced protocols. Through several case studies, we show that Aqua-Sim can “reproduce ” the real world with high fidelity and flexibility. I...|$|R
40|$|In room <b>acoustic</b> modeling, Feedback <b>Delay</b> <b>Networks</b> (FDN) {{are known}} to {{efficiently}} model late reverberation due to their capacity to generate exponentially decaying dense impulses. However, this method relies on a careful tuning of the different synthesis parameters, either estimated from a pre-recorded impulse response from the real acoustic scene, or set manually from experience. In this paper we present a new method, which still inherits {{the efficiency of the}} FDN structure, but aims at linking the parameters of the FDN directly to the geometry setting. This relation is achieved by studying the sound energy exchange between each delay line using the acoustic Radiance Transfer Method (RTM). Experimental results show that the late reverberation modeled by this method is in good agreement with the virtual geometry setting...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a new 16 -channel parallel <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> line (PADL) array for real-time photoacoustic tomography (PAT). The PADLs were directly fabricated from single-crystalline silicon substrates using deep reactive ion etching. Compared with other <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> lines (e. g., optical fibers), the micromachined silicon PADLs offer higher acoustic transmission efficiency, smaller form factor, easier assembly, and mass production capability. To demonstrate its real-time photoacoustic imaging capability, the silicon PADL array was interfaced with one single-element ultrasonic transducer followed by one channel of data acquisition electronics to receive 16 channels of photoacoustic signals simultaneously. A PAT image of an optically-absorbing target embedded in an optically-scattering phantom was reconstructed, which matched well with the actual size of the imaged target. Because the silicon PADL array allows a signal-to-channel reduction ratio of 16 : 1, it could significantly simplify the design and construction of ultrasonic receivers for real-time PAT...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{localization}} critically {{depends on}} detection {{of differences in}} arrival time of sounds at the two ears (<b>acoustic</b> <b>delay).</b> The fundamental mechanisms are debated, but all proposals include a process of coincidence detection and a separate source of internal delay that offsets the <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> and determines neural tuning. We used in vivo patch-clamp recordings of binaural neurons in the Mongolian gerbil and pharmacological manipulations to directly compare neuronal input to output and to separate excitation from inhibition. Our results cannot {{be accounted for by}} existing models and reveal that coincidence detection is not an instantaneous process, but is instead shaped by the interaction of intrinsic conductances with preceding synaptic activity. This interaction generates an internal delay as an intrinsic {{part of the process of}} coincidence detection. The multiplication and time-shifting stages thought to extract synchronous activity in many brain areas can therefore be combined in a single operation. status: publishe...|$|R
