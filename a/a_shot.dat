5|$|Billy Smith of the New York Islanders {{became the}} first goaltender to score an NHL goal on November 28, 1979, when he was given credit {{following}} an own goal. Ron Hextall of the Philadelphia Flyers became the second goalkeeper to score, {{and the first to}} score by taking <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> Martin Brodeur has scored the most NHL goals by a goaltender, with two in the regular season and one in the playoffs. The most recent goal credited to a goaltender was awarded to Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes on October 19, 2013, scored via <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> on goal.|$|E
5|$|Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay {{as he and}} Denis Compton {{attempted}} to establish themselves. He was hurried by the pace of Lindwall and Johnston, making many last-moment movements to either hit the ball or withdraw from <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

50|$|Taken in turns, {{each player}} has {{a choice to}} either shoot for the ball with the lowest point value (a free shot); or, select any other ball (<b>a</b> penalty <b>shot).</b> On {{choosing}} <b>a</b> free <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> player must proceed with <b>a</b> continuation <b>shot,</b> and the free ball remains out of the game. Any ball may be nominated and selected as the ball 'on' for the continuation shot; which, after being pocketed, must be re-spotted. Missing either the free shot or the continuation shot ends the player's innings. However, if the player elects to shoot <b>a</b> penalty <b>shot,</b> the penalty ball is re-spotted and the next shot taken must be <b>a</b> free <b>shot.</b> In contrast to free or continuation <b>shots,</b> missing <b>a</b> penalty <b>shot</b> {{is not only the}} end of an innings but also a foul.|$|R

Casey received a yellow card at the 57th minute and was later replaced by Pedro Ribeiro. In the 88th minute, Raymon Gaddis won the ball and took <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> that was deflected. Ribeiro took <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> but it lacked power. In stoppage time, Vincent Nogueira had another close shot that struck the post and ricocheted dangerously close to the goal before being cleared.|$|E

50|$|Some styles {{used with}} the 180-degree rule can elicit an emotion or create a visual rhythm. By moving the camera closer to the axis for <b>a</b> {{close-up}} <b>shot,</b> it can intensify a scene when paired with <b>a</b> long <b>shot.</b> When the camera is moved further away from the axis for <b>a</b> long <b>shot</b> after <b>a</b> close-up <b>shot,</b> it may provide {{a break in the}} action of the scene.|$|R

It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E
50|$|Where {{the camera}} is placed in {{relation}} to the subject can affect the way the viewer perceives the subject. There are a number of camera angles, such as <b>a</b> high-angle <b>shot,</b> <b>a</b> low-angle <b>shot,</b> <b>a</b> bird's-eye view and a worm's-eye view. A Viewpoint is the apparent distance and angle from which the camera views and records the subject.|$|R

5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> for over five minutes.|$|E

50|$|The {{technique}} {{is often used}} to follow a subject that would otherwise leave the frame (ergo, it is often called <b>a</b> following <b>shot),</b> such as <b>an</b> actor or vehicle in motion. In this spirit, any conveyance, including via a motorized vehicle, like a car, may also be used to create <b>a</b> tracking <b>shot.</b> <b>A</b> handheld or Steadicam mounted camera following a similar trajectory is called <b>a</b> tracking <b>shot</b> as well. While the core idea is that the camera moves parallel to its subject, <b>a</b> tracking <b>shot</b> may move in a semi-circular fashion, rotating around its subject while remaining equidistant.|$|R

According to him, if she was killed, he would go free. Raynor made the decision right there and blocked <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> from Tychus, intended for Kerrigan, and he shot his friend dead.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Miller was out {{for four}} in the first innings, not {{offering}} <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> to an inswinger. In the second innings, Miller's first ball was a hat-trick ball from English captain Norman Yardley; he survived a loud leg before wicket appeal and then hit a six into the grandstand, {{on his way to}} 74. Australia declared at 7/460, 595runs ahead. Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409runs.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its thick frontal armour, {{flanking}} manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements. Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> wrist <b>shot</b> is <b>a</b> type {{of hockey}} shot that {{involves}} using arm muscles (especially {{those in the}} wrist and forearm) to propel a puck forward from the [...] side of the blade of a hockey stick. Generally, when the puck is <b>shot</b> in <b>a</b> similar manner using the [...] side of the blade, it {{is referred to as}} <b>a</b> backhand <b>shot.</b> The power of <b>a</b> wrist <b>shot</b> comes from lower body strength more than arm strength. The advantage of <b>a</b> wrist <b>shot</b> over <b>a</b> slap <b>shot</b> is the minimal amount of setup required, creating an element of surprise. Moreover, <b>a</b> wrist <b>shot</b> is far more accurate than <b>a</b> slap <b>shot.</b> Conversely, the reliance on wrist and forearm muscles to propel the puck causes the wrist shot to be less powerful than the slap shot, though this is not true for all players, even those with [...] "big shots". Transfer of bodyweight and the flex of a hockey stick are also key factors for <b>a</b> wrist <b>shot.</b> Weight should shift from the back leg to the front leg for maximum power. The flex of a stick is also key for <b>a</b> powerful wrist <b>shot.</b> Applying energy and weight onto your stick gives a whip like motion and thus provides your shot with even more power. The lower the flex number on a hockey stick, the more bend the stick creates.|$|R

5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands they want to use, the {{decision}} should be made {{of what they want}} to do. <b>A</b> <b>shot</b> should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves can go to the ball faster.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{replaced}} Edmílson, who {{had picked}} up an injury in the first half, with Andrés Iniesta {{for the second half}} in an effort to equalise.

5|$|Before {{the second}} half, no substitutions {{were made by}} either teams as Galatasaray kicked-off the match. During the third minute, Vieira picked Parlour, but his shot hit {{the outside of the}} goal. Galatasaray almost scored the opening goal, when Okan Buruk played in Hakan Şükür, whose shot hit the right post. Arsenal {{attempted}} to strike, with Sylvinho passing Hagi, and finding Henry, who in turn put in a cross for Keown, only for his shot to go over. Later throughout the match, Parlour sent a long ball into the Galatasaray midfield, but no Arsenal player was there to pick up the ball. A free-kick was given to Bergkamp after a foul on Overmars, which was cleared with a Popescu header. Galatasaray attempted an attack on the counter – Capone gave the ball to Hagi, who lost his balance while preparing to take <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> After receiving a pass, Hagi put in a wide cross for Şükür, but he was denied <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> on target after a clearance. Arsenal had another chance, when Henry snatched the ball from Korkmaz, and entered the penalty area, only to see his shot to go off target.|$|E
