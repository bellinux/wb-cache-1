I address whether communication value improves in the post-ISA 700 by hand-collecting <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> content and demographic data from premium-listed London Stock Exchange and Irish Stock Exchange listed companies. Using content analysis measures, readability and tone, as proxies for communication value, I find that in the post-ISA 700 period: 1) <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> readability improves and 2) <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> tone changes with a higher occurrence of negative and uncertain words.
