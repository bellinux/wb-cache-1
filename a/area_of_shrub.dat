40|$|The western Ordos Plateau {{is a key}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrub</b> {{diversity}} and a National Nature Reserve of endangered shrub species in north-west China. Desert expansion is becoming the most important threat to these endangered species. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of sand burial on the dynamics of the shrub community. This study aims to investigate how the shrubs as a community and as different individual shrubs respond to the disturbances caused by the desert expansion. The approach used by this study is to separate the seed-dispersal strategy from the sand-burial forces that are involved in structuring the shrub communities at different disturbance stages. Four communities for different disturbance stages were surveyed by using 50 × 50 m plots. The individual shrubs were classified into coloniser and successor groups at the seed-dispersal stage and strong and weak sand-burial tolerance groups at the sand-expansion stage. We employed spatial point pattern analysis with null models for each community to examine the seed-dispersal strategy and sand-burial forces affecting community distribution patterns. At the seed-dispersal stage, the interactions between the colonisers and the successors showed significant positive correlation at a scale of 0 - 1 m and significant negative correlation at a scale of 2 m; significant negative correlations between the groups with strong and weak sand-burial tolerance in the early stage of sand expansion at scales of 3 - 6 m, and significant positive correlation in the later stage of sand expansion at a scale of 13 m, were found. Seed-dispersal strategy is a reasonable mechanism to explain the shrub community pattern formation in the earlier stages, whereas sand burial is the primary reason for the disappearance of shrubs with weak sand-burial tolerance, this irreversible disturbance causes homogenisation of the community structure and produces aging populations of shrub species. This has an important influence on the succession direction of desert shrub communities...|$|E

This is not possible for any place to be so located, if Moerheb is Morfe. On the other hand, the relationship to Kinver fits well with the minster being at Kidderminster. In that case, the wood of Moerheb would be a predecessor of Kidderminster Heath (now Devil's Spittleful and Rifle Range Nature Reserve and Habberley Valley).|$|R
40|$|Much {{of the low}} Arctic {{is covered}} with shrub tundra. Snowmelt energy {{exchange}} under shrub canopies is strongly influenced by the transmission of shortwave radiation through the canopy and the reflectance from snow under the canopy. Tundra shrub canopies are distinctive {{in that they are}} partially buried in winter and become exposed during snowmelt as snow depth decreases. The objectives of this study were to measure and model shortwave radiation reflection and extinction by one such dynamic heterogeneous deciduous shrub canopy over a melting snowcover. Observations were made in tundra <b>shrub</b> canopies <b>of</b> varying height in the mountains of the Yukon Territory, Canada. Measurements were taken over the course of spring snowmelt, during which solar elevation was low to moderate and the fractional <b>area</b> <b>of</b> exposed <b>shrub</b> overlying snow increased three-fold. <b>Shrubs</b> shaded most <b>of</b> the snow surface at low solar elevation angles, therefore a large component of shortwave radiation never reached the snow surface but was extinguished by the shrub canopy. At higher solar angles there was greater direct shortwave transmission to the snow surface between shrubs. A simple model was developed to incorporate this changing shade factor contribution to the overall shortwave transmissivity <b>of</b> <b>shrub</b> canopies. The model simulates both the landscape-averaged (areal) transmission and reflection of shortwave radiation, and results indicate that areal transmissivity and reflection can be up to 0. 70 and 0. 61 lower, respectively, relative to that simulated by a two-stream approximation in which no shadows are cast. A simple parameterization of this shaded landscape fraction is then proposed with which to integrate into hydrological and land surface models, for the purpose of simulating more accurately the melt rate and atmospheric fluxes in other <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrub</b> tundra...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} {{determinant of}} mosquito-borne pathogen transmission is the {{spatial distribution of}} vectors. The primary vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in Illinois are Culex pipiens Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex restuans Theobald. In urban environments, these mosquitoes commonly oviposit in roadside storm water catch basins. However, use of this habitat is inconsistent, with abundance of larvae varying significantly across catch basins at a fine spatial scale. Methods We tested the hypothesis that attributes of the biotic and abiotic environment contribute to spatial and temporal variation in production of mosquito vectors, characterizing the relationship between terrestrial vegetation and aquatic chemistry and Culex abundance in Chicago, Illinois. Larvae were sampled from 60 catch basins from June 14 to October 3, 2009. Density <b>of</b> <b>shrubs</b> and 14 tree genera surrounding the basins were quantified, as well as aquatic chemistry content of each basin. Results We demonstrate that the spatial pattern of Culex abundance in catch basins is strongly influenced by environmental characteristics, resulting in significant variation across the urban landscape. Using regression and machine learning techniques, we described landscape features and microhabitat characteristics of four Chicago neighborhoods and examined {{the implications of these}} measures for larval abundance in adjacent catch basins. The important positive predictors of high larval abundance were aquatic ammonia, nitrates, and <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrubs</b> <b>of</b> height Culex during the fruit-bearing periods and early senescent periods in August and September. Conclusions This study identifies environmental predictors of mosquito production in urban environments. Because an abundance of adult Culex is integral to efficient WNV transmission and mosquitoes are found in especially high densities near larval habitats, identifying aquatic sites for Culex and landscape features that promote larval production are important in predicting the spatial pattern of cases of human and veterinary illness. Thus, these data enable accurate assessment of regions at risk for exposure to WNV and aid in the prevention of vector-borne disease transmission. </p...|$|R

Altogether, 44 samples (polygons) were inspected along the BR- 020 highway (Formosa, Goiás to Luis Eduardo Magalhães, Bahia direction), covering three land use classes (pasture, agriculture/forestry, and urban spread). The results indicate a rate of success for SIAD of 79 %, with most alerts occurring on <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrub</b> Cerrado (11 %) and Cerrado woodland (88 %). In general, these areas were converted due to the expansion of agriculture (47 %) and pasture (29 %), predominantly in Bahia and Goias, respectively.

All paired unburned reference sites were adjacent to burned stands in similar <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrub</b> cover based on remotely sensed pre-fire conditions visible on aerial photographs. They were also located opposite fuel breaks (bulldozer-lines, dirt roads, or paved roads) to minimize the potential for fuel differences between burned and unburned vegetation at the time of each fire. Originally, over 20 unique sites that had burned were identified in the study area from aerial photography but, after ground-truthing each site in July and August of 2006, only seven were selected for this study. Sites were dismissed from the study if they lacked suitable unburned reference vegetation (i.e., unburned vegetation adjacent to burned vegetation {{did not appear to be}} separated by a fuel break so differences in fuel between the two areas may have existed at the time of fire). Other reasons for dismissal were recent grazing history (based on sightings of livestock, the presence of trails and ruts indicative of livestock, drinking troughs, scat, and browsed vegetation within large fenced-in areas), and irregular soil type (based on NRCS soils maps or percent sand, silt, and clay analyses [Steers 2008]). Lastly, because of the strong precipitation gradient in the study area, additional sites adjacent to Cabazon and Palm Springs were removed to minimize climatic variation. All sites are assumed to be exposed to similar levels of precipitation and nitrogen deposition based on regional analyses (Rao et al. 2011).|$|R
