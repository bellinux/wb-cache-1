40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore why audit assistants leave the <b>audit</b> <b>profession.</b> By {{including}} both the perceptions held by audit assistants that left the <b>audit</b> <b>profession</b> and the perceptions of audit assistants still working in the <b>audit</b> <b>profession,</b> this study aims to explore how determinants of job satisfaction are associated with decisions to leave the <b>audit</b> <b>profession.</b> Design/methodology/approach - To explore the association between determinants of job satisfaction and decisions to leave, a survey was developed based on a literature review of determinants of job satisfaction. The survey was sent to both current and former Swedish audit assistants. The subsequent analysis was based on 231 complete surveys, of which 78 were from former audit assistants. Findings - The main finding of this study is that there is a negative association between the choice to leave the <b>profession</b> and <b>audit</b> assistants perceptions of the profession and between the choice to leave and work-life balance. Another finding was thatmet expectations and Big 4 were found to be positively associated with career change. Originality/value - By approaching both current and former audit assistants, this study contributes to the literature on audit employee turnover by exploring determinants of actual career change, rather than turnover intentions. It also contributes by identifying and testing a variable not previously used as a determinant of job satisfaction, namely, perceptions of the <b>audit</b> <b>profession...</b>|$|R

50|$|Auditor {{independence}} is {{commonly referred to}} as the cornerstone of the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> since it is the foundation of the public’s trust in the accounting profession. Since 2000, a wave of high profile accounting scandals have cast the profession into the limelight, negatively affecting the public perception of auditor independence.|$|E
50|$|Programming {{independence}} essentially {{protects the}} auditor’s ability {{to select the}} most appropriate strategy when conducting an audit. Auditors must be free to approach {{a piece of work}} in whatever manner they consider best. As a client company grows and conducts new activities, the auditor’s approach will likely have to adapt to account for these. In addition, the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> is a dynamic one, with new techniques constantly being developed and upgraded which the auditor may decide to use. The strategy/proposed methods which the auditors intends to implement cannot be inhibited in any way.|$|E

40|$|Extant {{knowledge}} on gender and auditing overwhelmingly relies on evidence gathered from a limited group of Anglo-Saxon countries. It is widely admitted, however, that gender issues {{are affected by}} the institutional contexts of the investigation. The Anglo-Saxon settings, we contend, embrace a number of idiosyncratic, institutional characteristics that advise caution in the generalizability of results. Our study addresses the role of gender in Spanish audit practice during the period 1942 to 1988. The environment of the Spanish <b>audit</b> <b>profession</b> witnessed the peaceful transition from a dictatorship to a full-fledged democracy as well as the emergence of a free market economy from a system characterized by stiff economic autarchy and an overriding intervention of the state in the economy. We found that the dominant role of the state in Spanish society affected the structure of the <b>audit</b> <b>profession</b> and made impossible the emergence of an autonomous project. In particular, our findings reveal that the <b>audit</b> <b>profession</b> did not have an independent strategy about the role of women at work, but mimicked the attitudes deployed by the state during our observation period. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} (1) country-level financial accounting standards and <b>audit</b> <b>profession</b> development and (2) firm-level tax evasion.

This database includes firms both with and without externally audited financial statements. After controlling for corruption, economic development, rule of law, and other firm, local, and country-level variables I find that firms in countries with more rigorous financial accounting standards and a more developed <b>audit</b> <b>profession</b> evade less tax and that this effect is stronger when firms have externally audited financial statements and thus are more directly influenced by the financial accounting standards and level of <b>audit</b> <b>profession</b> development in their country.

5000|$|The Internal <b>Auditing</b> <b>profession</b> evolved {{steadily}} {{with the}} progress of management science after World War II. It is conceptually similar in many ways to financial auditing by public accounting firms, quality assurance and banking compliance activities. While some of the audit technique underlying internal auditing is derived from management consulting and public accounting professions, the theory of internal auditing was conceived primarily by Lawrence Sawyer (1911-2002), {{often referred to as}} [...] "the father of modern internal auditing"; and the current philosophy, theory and practice of modern internal auditing as defined by the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) of the Institute of Internal Auditors owes much to Sawyer's vision.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} {{of computer technology}} into accounting systems changed the way data was stored, retrieved and controlled. It is believed that the first use of a computerized accounting system was at General Electric in 1954. During the time period of 1954 to the mid-1960s, the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> was still auditing around the computer. At this time only mainframe computers were used and few people had the skills and abilities to program computers. This began {{to change in the}} mid-1960s with the {{introduction of}} new, smaller and less expensive machines. This increased the use of computers in businesses and with it came the need for auditors to become familiar with EDP concepts in business. Along with the increase in computer use, came the rise of different types of accounting systems. The industry soon realized that they needed to develop their own software and the first of the generalized audit software (GAS) was developed. In 1968, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) had the Big Eight (now the Big Four) accounting firms participate in the development of EDP auditing. The result of this was the release of Auditing & EDP. The book included how to document EDP audits and examples of how to process internal control reviews.|$|E
50|$|The {{profession}} began a {{long process}} to revise the PAA Act in the early 1990s and this process will came to fruition in 2005 when the <b>Auditing</b> <b>Profession</b> Act (Act 26 of 2005) was promulgated (the Act commenced on 1 April 2006). The process has been upset by a spate of international and local corporate failures, {{with the result that}} governments worldwide saw the need for regulation of auditors to be tightened up and became more involved in the process.Another issue that still requires the profession and SAICA's contribution is that of Transformation. The Thuthuka project, an initiative by SAICA to promote skills development and transformation in the CA profession, was launched in the Eastern Cape in 2002 and it was expanded to Limpopo and Kwazulu-Natal in 2004. This programme is providing education support to African learners and students, and seeks to uplift communities while benefiting the CA profession. To regulate SAICA’s efforts going forward, the Institute has now implemented a system whereby leadership issues are identified by the SAICA Board and delegated to the secretariat, so that each day SAICA adds a little more to its history.Confusion often arises regarding the differing roles and responsibilities of SAICA and the IRBA the Public Accountants and Auditors Board (PAAB). It is important to understand the roles of the two bodies.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{worldwide}} spate of financial scandals, society has lost much of its confidence in the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> because of a growing perception that the profession does not act in the public interest. Ineffective regulation {{is one of the key}} factors detracting from the value of the audit function, thereby undermining public confidence in the profession as a whole. The opportunity has been grasped in South Africa, as in some other countries, to make changes to the regulatory mechanisms of the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> in an effort to restore trust in the profession. In this article the regulation of the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> in South Africa, according to the <b>Auditing</b> <b>Profession</b> Act, 2005, (implemented in April 2006), is evaluated against the factors that are of importance to an effective and creditable regulatory system with reference to the regulation of the profession in some other English speaking countries with which the South African <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> has historical and professional ties. It appears that those factors that are important to a regulatory system are to a large degree addressed by the regulation of the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> in South Africa.

40|$|The Enron debacle and {{the role}} of Andersen in that context has damaged the {{reputation}} of the <b>audit</b> <b>profession,</b> and especially that of Big 4 accounting firms. In the aftermath of Enron, audit firms were more than ever scrutinized by various categories of financial-statement users. This period of high scrutiny and public distrust in the <b>audit</b> <b>profession</b> definitely increased the threat of litigation for alleged audit failures and thus the auditor’s business risk. One strategy for auditors to manage this increased business risk is to report more conservatively. In this paper we examine for a large sample of U. S. companies whether their auditors reacted defensively to the public trust crisis by issuing (ceteris paribus) more modified opinions following the collapse of Enron and Andersen. We find that this is clearly the case for Big 4 auditors, but not for non-Big 4 auditors...|$|R

40|$|Financial scandals {{worldwide}} {{have led}} to an <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> crisis. Society has lost confidence in the profession because of a growing perception {{that it does not}} act in the public interest, but in its own interest only. The way in which the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> is regulated may impact positively or negatively on the value of the audit function. Consequently there is danger that the profession may lose its very reason for existence. Conversely, the profession has an opportunity to re-invent itself, and by so doing, regain the trust of society. The South African <b>auditing</b> <b>profession,</b> as elsewhere, has begun to recognise this situation as an opportunity to introduce changes to the regulation of the profession. These regulations are the key to society’s willingness to trust the outcome of the audit process. While the current regulations are obviously flawed, it is believed that, once revised, society may regain confidence and trust in the profession and its services. To this end the Draft <b>Auditing</b> <b>Profession</b> Bill, 2004 was published in November 2004. In this thesis the profession’s regulations, including the Draft <b>Auditing</b> <b>Profession</b> Bill, 2004, are evaluated in terms of factors that are central to an effective and credible regulatory system. The burning issues involving the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> are also identified in this study, and evaluated. In comparison with changes already made in other countries, it appears that those important regulatory system factors and the key public interest issues of credibility and trust are inadequately addressed by the proposed <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> regulations. The fundamental reasons for this failure are the proposed composition and financing of the regulator and associated bodies. Hence, in this study a normative framework for regulating the <b>auditing</b> <b>profession</b> in South Africa is proposed in an effort to regain society’s trust.
