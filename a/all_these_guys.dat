500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{experience}} of making Che, Soderbergh {{has said that he}} now wishes that he had not made the film and remarked, [...] "Literally I'd wake up and think, 'At least I'm not doing that today.'" [...] The director blamed piracy for the film's financial failure and felt that [...] "It's a film that, to some extent, needs the support of people who write about films. If you'd had <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> running around talking in accented English you'd [...] your head taken off".|$|E
500|$|American {{pop singer}} Britney Spears guest {{starred in the}} episode as herself. According to Scully, she was {{seventeen}} to eighteen {{years old when she}} recorded her lines, and [...] "She {{was a lot of fun}} to work with. She was a fan of the show, and she was willing to do all the lines. It was all the people around her that were crazy, the management and all that. We originally had her introduce herself [...] as 'I'm teenage songbird Britney Spears.' And she recorded a few takes and they were fine. And suddenly, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> come rushing in [...] 'She can't say songbird.' [...] what's wrong with songbird? And they were somehow convinced that it was some sort of slam or an insult." [...] The staff members were therefore forced to change her opening line to [...] "I'm teen sensation Britney Spears." ...|$|E
500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 9, 2012, in an {{interview}} with Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Belafonte expressed dismay that many political leaders in the United States continue to oppose the policies of President Obama even after his re-election: [...] "The only thing left for Barack Obama to do is to work like a third-world dictator and just put <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> in jail. You’re violating the American desire." ...|$|R
500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care. But now that there are <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something." [...] Hayes also said, [...] "To the bronies, I say, I think My Little Pony is awesome, so more power to you".|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Haggard dispelled {{the notion}} that Parsons was any kind of outlaw, telling Mark Rose, [...] "He was a pussy. Hell, {{he was just a}} {{long-haired}} kid. I thought he was a good writer. He was not wild, though. That's what's funny to me. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> running around in long hair talking about being wild and Rolling Stones.

2500|$|Amos derived the album's {{title from}} the Hawaiian volcano goddess, Pele, with the [...] "boys" [...] {{representing}} {{the men in}} her life. [...] "First I wanted to sacrifice <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> to the volcano goddess and roast them like marshmallows, then I decided {{they gave me a}} really wonderful gift," [...] Amos said of the title. Amos herself has described the album as a novel, as a [...] "story of the descent of a woman to gain her passion and gain her compassion," [...] chronicling a woman's self-discovery in a male-dominated world, looking for fragments of herself and being suppressed. Songs such as [...] "Blood Roses," [...] "Caught a Lite Sneeze", [...] "Hey Jupiter," [...] "Doughnut Song" [...] and [...] "Putting the Damage On" [...] deal directly with the aftermath of a break-up and a woman's reflection on the failed relationship.|$|E

We can't bank on the rah-rah boys that wear eye-glasses and condescend to like us, cause they think we ain't entirely too dirty for 'em to associate with, and <b>all</b> <b>these</b> writer <b>guys</b> and so on. That's where you got {{to hand it to}} the street-corner shouters." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lorely {{was raised}} by her mother in the Los Angeles {{metropolitan}} area. Lorely's first experiences with music were listening to her father's cassette tapes of The Beatles and Pet Shop Boys. She now resides in Brooklyn, NY. Much of her album Me addresses the hardships she faces living in Brooklyn: [...] "I hate the rats, I hate the rent, I hate <b>all</b> <b>these</b> shitty <b>guys,</b> I hate capitalism. ... I am getting cat-called in the street, just being a woman walking and I should just {{be able to walk}} down the street, you know." ...|$|R
2500|$|Stipe {{wrote the}} lyrics of Monster in character. This, {{according}} to biographer Dan Buckley, [...] "set the real Stipe {{at a distance from}} the mask adopted for each song." [...] The album dealt with the nature of celebrity and [...] "the creepiness of fandom as pathology". Buck said the album was a reaction to the band's popularity. He added, [...] "When I read the lyrics I thought, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are totally fucked up. I don't know who they are, because they're not Michael. I would say that this was the only time where he's done characters that are creepy, and I don't know if anyone got that. He was getting out his things by acting out these parts that are not him." [...] The band noted {{that at the end of}} certain songs, they left blank choruses where Mills and Berry would traditionally sing harmonies so fans could sing along.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{themes of}} fornication, drug addiction, prostitution, violence, and murder, Porgy and Bess {{proved to be}} {{difficult}} to cast. Many black actors felt the story did nothing but perpetuate negative stereotypes. Harry Belafonte thought the role of Porgy was demeaning and declined it. So many performers refused to participate in the project that Goldwyn actually considered Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson and singer Clyde McPhatter for major roles. [...] Only Las Vegas entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. expressed interest in appearing in the film, and arranged to audition for a role during a party at Judy Garland's home. Ira Gershwin's wife Lee was present and, horrified by Davis' vulgarity, implored Goldwyn, [...] "Swear on your life you'll never use him." [...] The producer, who sneeringly called Davis [...] "that monkey," [...] assured her he would not cast him and offered the role of Sportin' Life to Cab Calloway instead. When Calloway declined, Davis had Frank Sinatra and some of his associates pressure Goldwyn, who finally announced to Davis, [...] "The part is yours. Now will you get <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> off my back?" ...|$|E

[...] When auditioning for that role, {{he told the}} producers, [...] "Look, I play <b>all</b> <b>these</b> tough <b>guys</b> and thugs and strong, complex characters.

5000|$|Starting on May 23, 2014, Black Tide {{departed}} {{on their}} Rise Again Tour, {{in support of}} the Bite the Bullet (EP), with support from Threat Signal, Affiance, and Hatchet. Gabriel Garcia had the following to share about the upcoming headlining tour: “I can’t wait to hit the road and bust this tour out. I’ve been driving around Miami blasting Hatchet <b>all</b> week. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> are killer. We want to invite them to share our tour bus, but shit could get crazy. This is a kick ass bill, four high-energy live acts and the fans are gonna be blown away. A good time will be had by all. I may even announce our new record label on the last night of the tour.” ...|$|R
5000|$|James Keach later recalled, [...] "Everyone told me, 'You can't get <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> together; family devotion is one thing, {{but this}} is Hollywood.' We decided to prove how serious we were by having a group picture taken. We did it at midnight in a {{recording}} studio where Keith was cutting some numbers.

2500|$|After {{the verdict}} was read to the court, Denis Collins, {{a member of the}} jury and a {{journalist}} who has written for The Washington Post and other newspapers, spoke to the press. According to Collins, some in the jury felt sympathy for Libby and believed he was only the [...] "fall guy". Collins said that [...] "a number of times" [...] the jurors asked themselves, [...] "what is [...] doing here? Where is Rove and <b>all</b> <b>these</b> other <b>guys.</b> I'm not saying we didn't think Mr. Libby was guilty of the things we found him guilty of. It seemed like he was, as Mr. Wells [...] put it, he was the fall guy." ...|$|R
50|$|Roger Corman said {{he wanted}} an unknown to play the lead.My demands were -- I felt -- not {{difficult}} in Hollywood. I wanted an actress who was beautiful and had a great figure. Because we economized {{on the amount of}} cloth we used in the costume... I wanted a tall actress. She does a lot of martial arts. I couldn't have a 5-foot-1 actress beating up <b>all</b> <b>these</b> big <b>guys.</b> So I wanted a tall, beautiful woman with a good figure, who was a good actress but I wasn't looking for Meryl Streep, just a good actress. I figured this would be pretty easy in Hollywood. It turned out to be incredibly difficult. I've never seen so many beautiful bad actresses in my life.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to release, {{the track}} was played during Mobys Area:One summer festival in 2001. It was {{announced}} as Morning Views lead single in June that year. Guitarist Mike Einziger noted that [...] "Wish You Were Here" [...] {{was one of}} the last songs written for Morning View and that [...] "the content is about being happy living for the moment and not looking forward to the future as some event." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd also elaborated on its meaning: [...] "The song wasnt specifically about a person. It was about me acknowledging a very brief moment in my life and in my experience with <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> in making this record. In that moment, I wish that I had somebody to go, I love you, man. I was wishing that there was someone there to share that moment with." ...|$|R

I think a crime book that doesnt do this is pure pornography." [...] Jack Olsen, quoted in the New York Times, 1993 ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what, my guys just {{do a great}} job on pit road, they really do," [...] Edwards said. [...] "Darian never loses his cool ever. He played the game {{perfectly}} with pit strategy. Then at the end, truly, once we got into Turn 1 on the final restart, I was like, I got this thing. I got better tires than <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> Kurt (Busch) was unbelievable on old tires. Then I thought, Denny is mine, he's a sitting duck. He drove the wheels off of that thing. He really hung on with those tires that he had." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Girls Like Girls" [...] {{is written}} by Kiyoko herself, Owen Thomas and Lily-May Young; with {{production}} handled by James Flannigan. The {{concept of the}} song is based around writing about subjects {{that may not be}} in the spotlight. She told US Weekly [...] "I loved the idea of how <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> always are stealing other guys’ girls and I was like, ‘There’s no female anthem for a girl stealing another guy's girl,' and that is the coolest thing ever, Like Girls' has become a universal video that brings out different kinds of emotions for different kinds of people." ...|$|E
50|$|Parker Ito {{was one of}} 30 or so unestablished {{artists that}} was {{discovered}} by the notorious art-flipper Stefan Simchowitz. Simchowitz met Ito in 2009, alongside Jon Rafman and Artie Vierkant, claiming “In <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> I identified {{the makings of a}} movement.” When Simchowitz first purchased work by Parker he was still a student at CCA and had a day job painting oil derricks. By February 2014 Ito's work was able to sell in a London auction for $93,594, well above the estimated high of $25,000. And in a July auction for over 80,000. Since Ito’s relationship with Simchowitz however, Ito {{has been the subject of}} much skepticism. His following 13 auction results averaged at $30,000 per piece or had works unsold. Prior to his work entering the auction market, Ito actively distanced himself from Simchowitz recognizing that he did not want to participate in a market-driven art system—one that views artwork primarily as a commodity. He is represented by Nelson Harmon and Liv Barrett, of Château Shatto and José Freire of Team Gallery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{success of}} this song owes {{a lot more to}} the {{perseverance}} of Robert Stigwood than he has previously been given credit for. [...] "We had quite a hard time at getting the Bee Gees played. We weren't all totally convinced that Stigwood was picking the right song to plug, {{but at the end of}} the day, he was a forceful character. <b>All</b> of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> were... Chas Chandler (manager of Jimi Hendrix) was the same, Kit Lambert (manager of The Who) was the same. They all argued their case with passion, you know, they lived it, they were like that," [...] conceded Polydor's Alan Bates. When the Disc & Music Echo reported [...] "widespread rumours" [...] that this song had been written by Lennon and McCartney, Robin countered with, [...] "Rubbish! We've always written our own songs. I've been writing since I was ten, before Lennon and McCartney were even on stage. People can say what they like. If they don't believe us, they can ask The Beatles." ...|$|R
5000|$|Seymour said: [...] "On {{this record}} when I {{started working with}} Matt and Sean, we had songs that were {{the basis of the}} record realised. I sent them out to <b>all</b> <b>these</b> A&R <b>guys</b> and record company stiffs that I had known over the years and got {{absolutely}} no reply. I followed up with phone calls and theyd say they werent interested or werent signing anything. I realised that because of the digital age you make your own records in the back garden and do a lease deal. It is a real drag but thats what you have to do. You {{have to come up with}} the money yourself to get Pro-Tools and the good speakers for your spare room. It is part of the DJ culture but a lot of kids who dont have money dont get money thrown at them anymore. It means the ones coming up the ranks are predominantly middle-class to upper-class kids." ...|$|R
5000|$|Branstool made {{a return}} to the news in 2011 as an {{opponent}} of new legislation to curb collective bargaining. “An individual worker who does his 40 hours or whatever, it’s hard for him to represent himself alone, and this is a way that he can do that - and sometimes they need leaders,” Branstool said. “Other elements of our society, whether it’s the pharmaceutical companies, the banks, the insurance companies, payday lenders, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> have people looking after their interests. And this is a way that working people have a chance to look after theirs.” ...|$|E

The house erupted when Geyer led Hunter {{onto the stage}} where he joined in for his signature tune for what became his last stage appearance. Todd described the concert [...] "Marc sang, maybe for the last time, that song. These musicians' incredible generosity was so phenomenal.

From 1971 to 1988 {{he was a}} regular {{contributor}} to the satiric magazine National Lampoon, occasionally using the pseudonyms Francis Hollidge and Bob Monhegan. He came to National Lampoon, he recalled, through O’Donoghue, who had joined the magazine [...] "and called me up almost right away to do a piece called “Tarzan of the Cows”.

In a 2002 interview, DeMatteis said, [...] "I really loved the two years on Spectacular Spider-Man that I wrote with Sal Buscema drawing. Talk about underrated! Sal {{is one of the}} best storytellers and a wonderful collaborator. I loved that run." [...] Buscema worked for rival DC Comics, including penciling Batman, Superman, and Superboy stories, and inking the Creeper, Wonder Woman, and other characters' stories in 1997-1999. He recalled, [...] "The short time I worked for DC, they were giving me <b>all</b> <b>these</b> young <b>guys</b> that could hardly hold a pencil in their hands, and asking me to 'tweak it.'
