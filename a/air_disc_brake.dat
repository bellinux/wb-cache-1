40|$|Today’s product {{requirements}} demand an ever increasing functionality {{for the same}} space and usually {{the same number of}} components. Thereby, the quality, reliability and robustness of these products should be preserved or even be increased. This target conflict cannot be solved without compromises. The research community between the Institute of Machine Components (IMA), University of Stuttgart, and the Knorr-Bremse Systeme für Nutzfahrzeuge GmbH is seeking for new solutions for these challenges. The new approaches for designing robust and reliable products are being implemented directly in a current development project of an innovative <b>Air</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Brake</b> (ADB). With “Systematic Method for Axiomatic Robustness-Testing” (SMART), reliability methods and the basic concept of Robust Design methodology are related to the Taguchi Method. SMART is based on three phases: System, Parameter and Tolerance Design; accordingly, the sample phases of VDA (Association of German Automotives) are used as milestones. In the System Design, SMART focuses on the decreasing complexity according to the functional dependences of the DPs, thus precluding early random failures. In the Parameter Design phase, SMART gives the developer an approach for modeling an adaptive simulation model (SIM-SMART). This model also enables the simulation of random and possible fatigue failures in addition to the nominally robust DPs. In the early stage of product development, reliability predictions are possible. In the iterative Tolerance Design phase, the final tolerance limits for robust and reliable products are defined with consideration of compromises in terms of costs, quality and technical feasibility. With the application of SMART, a design concept {{of a new generation of}} an ADB with less complexity is created. The extensive functions for flexible function studies are modeled with the objective of SIM-SMART. Accordingly to this model, parameter studies for determination of the nominal adjustment levels can be performed and their random and fatigue failures modeled. In conclusion, more accurate reliability test strategies are recommended using the definition of tolerance limits. The cost aspect and technical feasibility are also taken into account. So far, SMART has not been added to the iterative Tolerance Design phase. With this paper, the method is not only extended to this phase, but also sufficiently validated. In addition, SMART can predict and analyze random failures. With its three coherent and iterative phases, it is an as yet unpublished and unimplemented approach for designing even more robust and reliable products. Robust Design Methodology and reliability methods are fundamental building blocks for products with high quality requirements. SMART presents an approach to support the designing of robust, reliable, highly functional and innovative ADB...|$|E

Because of numerous advantages in comparison to a traditional <b>air</b> block <b>brake,</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{are more and more}} often utilized in passenger carriages and other railway vehicles. Stable and constant – in the whole speed range – coefficient of friction µ, with the value: µ = 0. 35 is a basic advantage of <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> systems [7]. Attempt to increase train speed, triggers application of greater braking power i. e. braking systems rapidly absorbing and dispersing stored heat energy. For stimulation of cooling processes of friction set (<b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> and friction pad), discs with ventilation canals shaped by various vanes, are used. Thanks to such solution discs take off about 40 % [4] of heat generated during braking. However, natural ventilation causes losses of energy for rotation of the disc during ride with switched off brakes, which is especially important for trains with little frequency of brakings and in cases when the profile of the track does not stimulate long-lasting braking. This article presents selected issues of operational use of rail <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> such us total resistance generated by <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> divided into resistance of disc inertia as mass in rotational motion and resistance generated by disc’s ventilator, and influence of blocked ventilation canals on braking process...|$|R

All Mark VIIs featured a power deck-lid release (through an interior mounted button) and electric pull-down, in which the trunk lid was partially lowered by hand, and then automatically pulled down about an inch by a motor mounted inside the trunk latch. All models were now installed with Ford's Keyless Entry System, and an automatic dimming high-beam module. This worked via a sensor located adjacent to the rear-view mirror, and sensitivity could be adjusted by a dial located on the dashboard.|$|R

50|$|Although the Monaro {{name had}} survived into 1977 as the HX Monaro GTS sedan, the coupé {{configuration}} {{was no longer}} in production and Holden decided to delete the Monaro name altogether from the new Holden HZ range. With the development of Radial Tuned Suspension, Holden transformed the bland characteristics of their full-size sedans and introduced a sporting variant called simply Holden GTS. Released on 5 October 1977, this HZ variant featured a four headlight grille, front and rear <b>air</b> dams, four-wheel <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> sports wheels and a 4.2-litre V8 engine as standard equipment. The optional 5.0-litre V8 became standard in June 1978. But, with the November 1978 introduction of the new mid/full-size VB Commodore sedan and its availability with V8 engine power, the days of the HZ series appeared numbered. Production of the GTS ceased in December 1978, an estimated 1,438 having been built.Ultimately, the VB Commodore proved very popular in both six-cylinder and V8 form, such that all full-size HZ Holden passenger cars were phased out of production in 1980. Remnants of the H-series lived on in the Holden WB series commercial vehicle range and in the revamped Statesman WB sedans until 1985.|$|R
