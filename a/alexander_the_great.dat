5|$|Farewell Great Macedon (also {{known as}} <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> in the script's early stages) was a six-part story pitched for Season 1 and {{was written by}} Moris Farhi. In the story, the Doctor and his companions are framed for murder {{as part of a}} {{conspiracy}} to kill <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> and must pass a number of trials, including walking on hot coals, to gain the trust of his bodyguard Ptolemy. The script was published by Nothing at the End of the Lane in October 2009. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Assyrian Empire, Erbil {{was first}} {{controlled}} by the Medes and then incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire before it became part of the empire of <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> after the Battle of Gaugamela, which was fought near Erbil in 331 BC. Subsequently, after the partition of <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Empire by his generals (known as Diadochoi), the city was called Arabella or Arbela and {{it was part of the}} Hellenistic Seleucid Kingdom. After the 1st c. BCE, the Roman and Parthian Empire fought over control of Erbil, or Arbira as it was known in that period. After the 1st c. AD, Arbela became an important Christian centre. During the Sassanid period, Erbil was the seat of a satrap (governor). In 340 AD, Christians in Erbil were persecuted and in 358, the governor became a martyr after he converted to Christianity. A Nestorian school was founded in Erbil by the School of Nisibis in c. 521. During this period, Erbil was also the site of a Zoroastrian fire temple.|$|E
5|$|All of modern-day Turkey was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire {{during the}} 6th century BC. The Greco-Persian Wars started when the Greek city {{states on the}} coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule in 499 BC. The {{territory}} of Turkey later fell to <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> in 334 BC, which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization in the area.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (an {{ancestor}} of <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great,)</b> who was allied to the Persians and present in their camp, secretly rode to the Greek camp {{with a warning}} that the Persians had decided to attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued {{a challenge to the}} Spartans to fight a special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined. Some historians have called these stories improbable.|$|E

5|$|In 59BC, when he {{was four}} years old, his father died. His mother married a former {{governor}} of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus. Philippus claimed descent from <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great,</b> and was elected consul in 56BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar.|$|E
5|$|Loring Danforth, a {{professor}} of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great,</b> but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Macedonian rulers also {{sponsored}} {{works of}} architecture outside of Macedonia proper. For instance, following his {{victory at the}} Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), PhilipII raised a round memorial building at Olympia known as the Philippeion, decorated inside with statues depicting him, his parents Amyntas III of Macedon and Eurydice I of Macedon, his wife Olympias, and his son <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great.</b>|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the council}} {{had the right to}} speak freely, and {{although}} there is no direct evidence that they voted on affairs of state, {{it is clear that the}} king was at least occasionally pressured to agree to their demands. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> acted as prosecutor in the trial and conviction of three alleged conspirators in his father's assassination plot (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great,</b> the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire, but it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends.|$|E
5|$|Music {{was also}} {{appreciated}} in Macedonia. In {{addition to the}} agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, {{one of the main}} markers of a true Greek city in the empire of <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> was the presence of an odeon for musical performances. This was the case not only for Alexandria in Egypt, but also cities as distant as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Notable arms {{attributed}} to biblical figures include {{the arms of}} Jesus based on the instruments of the Passion, and the shield of the Trinity. Medieval literature attributed coats of arms to the Nine Worthies, including <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great,</b> Julius Caesar, and King Arthur. Arms were given to many kings predating heraldry, including Edward the Confessor and William I of England. These attributed arms were sometimes used in practice as quarterings {{in the arms of}} their descendants.|$|E
