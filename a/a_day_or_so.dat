5|$|Stretching {{between the}} Pfullendorf heights {{and the village}} lies a flat, wide plain, marshy in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small {{tributary}} stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at {{the northern end of}} this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> later. Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest within <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E

5|$|The Stanley Cup {{championship}} team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup including the team's parade, days with sponsors and <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> with each player {{and member of}} the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed their dogs to eat out of the Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> {{after the events}} of Escape from New York. Snake {{has been given a}} military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of Escape from New York shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E
5|$|John the Fearless accused Isabeau and Orléans {{of fiscal}} {{mismanagement}} and again demanded money for himself, in recompense {{for the loss}} of royal revenues after his father's death; an estimated half of Philip the Bold's revenues had come from the French treasury. John raised a force of 1,000 knights, and entered Paris in 1405. Orléans hastily retreated with Isabeau to the fortified castle of Melun, with her household and children <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> behind. John immediately left in pursuit, intercepting the party of chaperones and royal children. He took possession of the Dauphin, and returned him to Paris under control of Burgundian forces; however, the boy's uncle, the duke of Berry, quickly took control of the child at the orders of the Royal Council. At that time Charles was lucid for about a month and able to help with the crisis. The incident, that {{came to be known as}} the enlèvement of the dauphin, almost caused full-scale war, but it was averted. Orléans quickly raised an army while John encouraged Parisians to revolt. They refused, claiming loyalty to the King and his son; Berry was made captain general of Paris and the city's gates were locked. In October Isabeau became active in mediating the dispute, in response to a letter from Christine de Pizan and an ordinance from the Royal Council.|$|E

His support operations were usually 65 kilometres (40mi) ahead of the forward edge of the battlefield, with even reconnaissance aircraft pressed into service as bombers. Army units carried flares and Swastika flags to prevent friendly fire incidents. In the Battle of Hannut Richthofen's forces proved effective against French armour during the battle.

25|$|God-fearers are {{considered}} to be of significant importance to the popularity of the Early Christian movement. They represented a group of gentiles who shared religious ideas with Jews, to one degree or another. However, they were not converts, but a separate gentile community, engaged in Judaic religious ideas and practices. Actual conversion to Judaism would require adherence to all of the Laws of Moses, which includes various prohibitions (kashrut, circumcision, Sabbath observance etc.) which were generally unattractive to would-be gentile (largely Greek) converts. The rite of circumcision was especially unpopular in Classical civilization because it was the custom to spend an hour <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> exercising in the nude in the gymnasium and males {{did not want to be}} seen in public deprived of their foreskins.|$|E
