The law was ratified in the provincial legislature the same year, and credit unions rapidly spread to the other Anglophone provinces. The development tools used by the Antigonish Movement led by Coady injected a much stronger populist tone in credit union development, and these methods were spread widely in the developing world after World War II.|$|E

She was for a while married one of Salvator's physician colleagues, Victor Munteanu, and had a son by him, Dan Munteanu, who became a noted biologist.

In 2014, in response to Rhode Island’s having the highest statewide unemployment rate in the nation, the Cranston Public Library, Providence Public Library, and other organizations developed Rhode Island Adult Lifelong Learning (ALL) Access, a computer training and workforce development program offered through the libraries’ learning lounges, dedicated drop-in computer spaces staffed by an <b>adult</b> <b>educator</b> and volunteers. In the Spring of 2015, Cranston Public Library was named Library of the Year by the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Library and Information Studies for its contributions to public library service. In June 2015, Cranston Public Library was acknowledged by the Holocaust Education and Resource Center of Rhode Island (HERCRI) with a Mitzvah (or “Good Deeds”) Award in recognition of an ongoing collaboration between the two organizations. Cranston Public Library was also named a recipient of the 2016 LibraryAware Community Award for its efforts to bring library services to new immigrants moving into Cranston.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results from a comparative study of the qualification of <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> in the Nordic-Baltic region. The study involved Denmark, Estonia and Sweden. The rationale behind the study is a growing interest in adult education resulting from a focus on lifelong learning in the public and political agendas, internationally and nationally. According to {{the authors of the}} report, an increased interest in adult education generates an increased interest in the professionalisation of the adult education sector, and thereby in the qualification of those teaching adults: <b>adult</b> <b>educators.</b> Based on this belief, the study and hence the report looks into the role that the qualification of <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> plays in policy, learning opportunities for those interested in qualifying as <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> as well as adult educators’ status as professionals. Besides the formation of personal teaching, which is grounded in learning theory, theoretical principles and experiences from practice, the development of a professional identity plays a role in <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> becoming professionals. Similarly, so does the recognition of <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> as professionals by society at large. Methodologically, the study is based on document analysis. The documents selected for analysis have been: national and international research reports and articles; official descriptions of national education systems; and policy papers, laws and other legal documents dealing with adult education and/or the qualification of <b>adult</b> <b>educators.</b> The study shows that in all three countries, there has been an increase in the political interest in adult education and training. In 1993, an act on adult education and training was accepted in Estonia and updated in 2001 (Estonian Ministry of Education and Research, 1993). Four years later, in 1997, a huge reform of the adult education and training system was carried out in Sweden, and in 2000, a reform of adult and continuing education was launched in Denmark. The main drivers for the increased focus on adult education and training in all three countries seem to be the needs of the labour market, in light of globalisation and international competition as well as the Lisbon strategy. The study also shows that in spite of the increased focus on adult education and training and its importance, through out policy papers, {{there seems to be a}} lack of interest in the quality of the provision, in terms of education and learning processes, including the qualification of <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> in Denmark and Sweden. In Estonia, a professional qualification standard for <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> was accepted in 2004. Except for Estonia, thus, the question of qualification of <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> is practically absent in ongoing national, political debates with respect to adult education and training. In relation to the options for those interested in qualifying as <b>adult</b> <b>educators,</b> it is difficult to find courses or education programmes offering initial education and training. Instead, most courses and education programmes either offer in-service or a combination of initial and in-service education and training. Thus, there are few opportunities for <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> to acquire the professional knowledge and identity as <b>adult</b> <b>educators,</b> before entering the field. In addition, <b>adult</b> <b>educators,</b> to a high degree, develop their competencies as <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> through their work. Further, qualification requirements for teaching within adult education and training vary a lot, and are linked to the specific field of adult education. Within general adult education, in all three countries, the requirements are similar to those for teachers in primary and secondary schools with no demands on specific competences in teaching adults. Within vocationally oriented adult education and training, the situation is very similar to that within general adult education, as demands for pedagogical qualifications do not include specific competences in teaching adults. Liberal adult education in all three countries stands out as the least regulated sector in relation to required pedagogical qualifications for educators. Requirements within this sector are set by each employer. Being that an individual’s professional development is tantamount to a society’s recognition of his/her occupation as a professional one, it can be discussed whether <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> today are considered as being part of a real profession in the three countries. Based on the study, it can be concluded, that: <b>Adult</b> <b>educators</b> are absent within the policy discourse of adult education and training. <b>Adult</b> <b>educators</b> stand on the edge of a profession. <b>Adult</b> <b>educators</b> are self-taught professionals. These issues are worth further attention within both policy and research circles...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} study {{was in the}} field of adult education, focusing on the role of <b>adult</b> <b>educators.</b> Sixty four <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> in the Australian Capital Territory, {{from a wide range of}} institutions took part in the study. The educational orientation of the <b>adult</b> <b>educators,</b> on an andragogical-pedagogical continuum, was measured by The Educational Orientation Questionnaire, (Hadley, 1974). This test was based on Knowles, theory of andragogy "the art and science of helping adults learn" and its corollary, pedagogy, "the art of teaching children" (Knowles, 1985). The E. O. Q. tested adult educators' attitudes in six areas of education to discover the extent to which educators were more andragogical or pedagogical in their orientation. Four personality dimensions of <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> were measured by The Personal Style Inventory (Champagne and Hogan, 1979) - a test based on Jung's theory of psychological types. The data was analysed and four null hypotheses were tested. Two were rejected and two were accepted. The findings revealed that there was a statistically significant correlation at the. 01 level of significance, showing a definite relationship between two of the dimensions, extraversion-introversion and sensing-intuition, and the educational orientation of adult educators: extraversion and intuition with a more andragogical orientation and introversion and sensing with a more pedagogical orientation. The interpretation of these findings raised numerous questions and issues on the role of <b>adult</b> <b>educators</b> as well as recommendations for further research on the correlation of other variables with the educational orientation of <b>adult</b> <b>educators...</b>|$|R
