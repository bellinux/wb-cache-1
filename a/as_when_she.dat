5|$|When Kubo {{was asked}} to make a cover with a female {{character}} during Christmas, Kubo initially thought of using Rukia; he later changed to use Orihime Inoue as he thought Orihime was more suitable for such role. However, Kubo commented he previously made a Christmas illustration with Rukia, and that he received request by several fans wanting to see the image. In contrast to this, Kubo has found he liked Rukia more in the illustrations in which her face expresses pain such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> {{is going to be}} executed in the manga.|$|E

Kocianski credits this <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> {{fell in love with}} professional wrestling. She cites Bret Hart, Owen Hart, and Ted DiBiase as her favorite wrestlers. Kocianski attended Notre Dame High School in Elmira, where she played tennis and ran track. She was voted prom queen in her senior year.

25|$|Rabbi Meir {{taught that}} the Torah ordained that {{menstruation}} should separate a wife {{from her husband}} for seven days, because if the husband were in constant contact with his wife, the husband might become disenchanted with her. The Torah, therefore, ordained that a wife might be unclean for seven days (and therefore forbidden to her husband for marital relations) so that she should become as desirable to her husband <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first entered the bridal chamber.|$|E

Sheekman was now very successful. In the eight years since returning from New York, he had been on fourteen movies, mostly writing the screenplays. He wanted to try another play. For the next eighteen months, Stuart painted and Sheekman worked on his play.|$|E
25|$|Other recent policy {{initiatives}} adopted by many states of India, claims Guilmoto, attempt {{to address the}} assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support to girls and their parents. These policies provide conditional cash transfer and scholarships only available to girls, where payments to a girl and her parents are linked to each stage of her life, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> is born, completion of her childhood immunization, her joining school at grade 1, her completing school grades 6, 9 and 12, her marriage past age 21. Some states are offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls. Different states of India have been experimenting with various innovations in their girl-driven welfare policies. For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called Laadli scheme), which initial data suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Sharona Melly (Carole Boyd) - The bossy, bad-tempered Tourist Information {{officer from}} Series 9. She was also nicknamed 'Mrs Smelly' and 'Smelly Melly', {{due to her}} {{forename}} beginning with 'S', and appearing as 'Mrs S Melly'. She is highly suspicious of Bodger and believes that he is hiding something in his hotel, although she never actually finds out about Badger. She refuses to recommend Bodger's hotel to tourists because he accidentally covered her in mashed potato when she visited his B & B. She dislikes people having fun on the beach outside her office and {{will do anything to}} prevent it. She has a lot of trouble with China the dog, who is always hanging around her office. She often looks for quick ways to make money, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> attempts to catch a valuable bird and charge people to see it, and when she believes Bodger has won the lottery she buys him lunch and starts being nice to him in the hope that he will share some of his winnings with her.|$|E

25|$|Lancelot is Morgan's prime {{object of}} sexual desire but he {{consistently}} refuses her obsessive advances {{due to his}} great love of Guinevere, even as Morgan either courts, drugs, enchants and imprisons the knight on several occasions. One tale has Lancelot captured in Cart Castle (Charyot) by her and two other lustful enchantress, Queen Sebile (Sedile) and the unnamed Queen of Sorestan, each of whom wants to make him her lover, but he refuses to choose and escapes with a help {{of one of their}} maidservants, Rocedon. Sebile and Morgan are close companions, working their magic together, but they tend to fall into petty squabbles due to their rivalries and bad tempers, including a conflict between them when they both seduce Lancelot's brother Sir Hector de Maris in the late 13th-century Prophesies de Merlin; a resulting contest between them is won by Nimue with a help from Merlin. Their friendship is further tested when a quarrel over a handsome widower named Berengier (captured by Sebile after Morgan kidnapped his child) ends in a violent attack by Sebile that leaves Morgan half-dead; Morgan swears revenge, but their relationship is later restored as usual. Morgan's other allies in Prophecies include the opponents of chivalry such as Mark and Claudas, and she enlists the help of the latter in her failed attempt to eliminate the Lady of the Lake. Sometimes she is successful, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> sends Lucifer {{in the guise of a}} dragon against Sir Segurant.|$|E

She mocks Klingsor's mutilated condition by sarcastically inquiring if he is chaste (""), but she cannot resist his power. Klingsor observes that Parsifal is approaching and summons his enchanted knights to fight the boy. Klingsor watches as Parsifal overcomes his knights, and they flee.

Now, Marguerite Louise began humiliating Cosimo on every posible occasion, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> insisted on employing only French cooks as she claimed the Medici were out to poison her and when she branded Cosimo [...] "a poor groom" [...] in front of the Papal nuncio.|$|E

She also invited comment with her off-screen actions, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> kissed k.d. lang while presenting her with an award at a Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center function in early 1997.

For the most part, Angelou is able to get along well with whites, but she occasionally encounters prejudice, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> needs help from white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood. Hagen calls Angelou's descriptions of whites and the hopes for eventual equality in this book [...] "optimistic".

500|$|Washington {{also claimed}} that American University cut off {{contact with him}} after he punched Tomjanovich. However, {{this appears to be}} a {{misrepresentation}} of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: [...] "I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant." [...] John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight.

500|$|Stephanie Chamberlain in {{her article}} [...] "Fantasicing" [...] Infanticide: Lady Macbeth and the Murdering Mother in Early Modern England" [...] argues that though Lady Macbeth wants power, her power is ‚Äúconditioned on maternity‚Äù, which was a ‚Äúconflicted status in early modern England.‚Äù Chamberlain argues that the {{negative}} images of Lady Macbeth as a mother figure, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> discusses her ability to [...] "bash the brain of the babe that sucks her breast", reflect controversies concerning the image of motherhood in early modern England. In early modern England, mothers were often accused of hurting {{the people that were}} placed in their hands. Lady Macbeth then personifies all mothers of early modern England who were condemned for Lady Macbeth‚Äôs fantasy of infanticide. Lady Macbeth‚Äôs fantasy, Chamberlain argues, is not struggling to be a man, but rather struggling with the condemnation of being a bad mother that was common during that time.|$|E

In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|Distinctively, Jasmine is not Aladdins protagonist, a role held instead by title {{character}} Aladdin, while Jasmine herself occupies a secondary {{role as the}} film's love interest, consequently lacking significant character development. However, sometimes both characters are collectively referred to as protagonists, while Jasmine is sometimes identified as the film's [...] "female protagonist". The First Novels Club observed that Jasmine essentially [...] "ends up the same person <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> started." [...] Little is known about Jasmine's interests, hobbies and goals. The Art of the Princess and the Frog author Jeff Kurrti wrote that although [...] "Jasmine is less prominent as a heroine... she made decisions and {{was a little more}} strong-willed". Samantha Rullo of Bustle agreed that, despite her secondary role, Jasmine remains [...] "determined to live her life the way she wants to, rather than letting others make her decisions for her", and thus ranks among Disney's most rebellious princesses. Jasmine's personality continues to rank among Disney's [...] "strongest" [...] heroines because she is not concerned about wealth or social class, despite her opulent upbringing. Similarly, Jasmine is not interested in marrying someone who is capable of only offering her everything she already owns, opting for excitement and companionship instead.|$|E

500|$|After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated {{she would}} {{represent}} {{herself in the}} upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken wine glass, pushed her over a table, and pushed her into a bathtub when she was pregnant. Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we've got that agreement.

500|$|Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{said that}} the scene where Santana comes out to her {{grandmother}} only to be rejected was a [...] "powerful moment and Rivera delivered in a way equal to Chris Colfer and Mike O'Malley's scenes during Kurt's coming out". Bell also complimented the sequence, though she criticized the next scene for showing [...] "a happy, smiling Santana" [...] with no further explanation, and Canning and Kubicek were also unhappy with her abrupt change in mood, {{as if nothing had}} happened. VanDerWerff, though he called the coming-out scene [...] "a moment that's played with a sort of bracing honesty and moving empathy" [...] for what Santana was going through, stated that the [...] "Santana storyline {{has been one of the}} best things about the back half of season two and this front half of season three, and the scenes that should be its emotional crux are occurring in our imaginations", such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> comes out to her parents. Goldberg called the fact that Finn suffered no consequences for his outing of Santana [...] "a missed opportunity". Bell, however, thought that his telling Santana that [...] "he cares about her and doesn't want her to hold her feelings for women in anymore" [...] was [...] "one of the most touching scenes of the series", though Kubicek characterized Finn's statement that he cared for her because Santana [...] "was his first" [...] as creepy. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan derided the choice to perform [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] as [...] "poor comprehension of song lyrics", since Santana [...] "is a lesbian and not just [...] drunk girl who kissed another girl after drinking". VanDerWerff wondered why Santana was so happy during the song, since she had just experienced [...] "the sort of outrageous bigotry she'll have to put up with for the rest of her life".|$|E
500|$|Roger Catlin {{from the}} Hartford Courant {{said that the}} {{passages}} from the book were [...] "too dirty to quote here, even the funny ones". The Daily Beast said that [...] "the book is neither groundbreaking (save that it features a major star) nor particularly sexy [...] Sex is convincing only when it's playful, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> appears nude in a Miami pizzeria, chewing a slice while a baffled customer looks on. Elsewhere, she's simply undressed {{with no place to}} go". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post gave the book a mixed review by saying: [...] "Is Sex shocking? not really. Mostly because it's Madonna, and somehow we've come to expect this from her. Is Sex boring? surprisingly, yes". During her review of the book, British author Zo√´ Heller from The Independent wrote that it was [...] "the women who once saw Madonna as a witty feminist role model who have been most alarmist about her latest pornographic incarnation" [...] and that [...] "previously, they say, Madonna played with traditional images of feminine sexuality in a subversive, 'empowering' way. But now, with sado-masochism and rape fantasies, she has gone too far." [...] Calvin Tomkins, author and art critic for The New Yorker, wrote that [...] "unfortunately, the book is going to be mistaken for pornography". Vanity Fair deemed it [...] "the dirtiest coffee table book to ever be published". Caryn James from The New York Times was negative in her review stating that [...] "There is plenty here to offend the meek (whips and chains), the self-righteous (gay men and lesbians), not to mention the tasteful (a tacky and cluttered art design)". Vicki Goldberg from the same newspaper was also dismissive of the photography of the book saying that [...] "Unfortunately, not many of the images are very good photographically. Many are just pictures, or just porn". Writing for Spin magazine, Bob Guccione, Jr. gave the book a particularly unfavorable review: ...|$|E
