40|$|SummaryScreaming {{is arguably}} {{one of the}} most {{relevant}} communication signals for survival in humans. Despite their practical relevance and their theoretical significance as innate [1] and virtually universal [2, 3] vocalizations, what makes screams a unique signal and how they are processed is not known. Here, we use acoustic analyses, psychophysical experiments, and neuroimaging to isolate those features that confer to screams their alarming nature, and we track their processing in the human brain. Using the modulation power spectrum (MPS [4, 5]), a recently developed, neurally informed characterization of sounds, we demonstrate that human screams cluster within restricted portion of the acoustic space (between ∼ 30 and 150  Hz modulation rates) that corresponds to a well-known perceptual attribute, roughness. In contrast to the received view that roughness is irrelevant for communication [6], our data reveal that the acoustic space occupied by the rough vocal regime is segregated from other signals, including speech, a pre-requisite to avoid false alarms in normal vocal communication. We show that roughness is present in natural alarm signals as well as in artificial alarms and that the presence of roughness in sounds boosts their detection in various tasks. Using fMRI, we show that <b>acoustic</b> <b>roughness</b> engages subcortical structures critical to rapidly appraise danger.

The surface asperities on tooth surfaces are modeled as compact structural beam elements that radiate {{sound in the}} off-line of action after sliding impacts, against asperities of the meshing surface, occur. A linear time-varying (LTV) model of a spur gear pair (with slid-ing friction) is employed to calculate the instantaneous sliding velocity between pinion and gear teeth, which is then applied to the asperities as the initial condition. The transient sound field from the flexural motions of surface asperities (acoustically baffled along their axes), which are released from the cylindrical Hertzian contact zone in gear teeth, is computed. The modal superposition method is used for far and free field calcu-lations given the surface roughness and its (assumed) asperity distribution on the tooth profile. Typical sound pressure predictions show that the noise levels increase with operating speeds and surface roughness.

Two of these ridges are drowned early Holocene reefs of 5 ky and 7 ky uncorrected radiocarbon age respectively. In response {{to changes in}} environmental factors (hydrodynamic exposure, ambient light, etc.) the characteristics of benthic assemblages change. An acoustic bottom classification survey using QTCView 5 based on a 50 kHz transducer showed different acoustic classes on the shallow, nearshore hardground and the two deeper reeflines, which showed the same acoustic signature. Rubble beds inshore of the the third, deepest reef-line showed a mixed acoustic signature. Ground-truthing by divers utilizing traditional transect surveys showed that the differences in acoustic signature corresponded to different benthic assemblages: nearshore hardgrounds had low live cover (10 %) and were dominated by algae and hydrozoa, the two deeper reef lines had the same acoustic signature and similar benthic assemblages (25 - 50 % cover by tall sponges and gorgonians).

40|$|In recent years, many {{attempts}} have been made to develop automatic methods for segmentation of hydroacoustic remote sensing data acquired by multibeam echosounders (MBES) in order to generate quantitative estimates of the spatial distribution of seafloor relief, bottom type and composition. The majority of the segmentation methods presented so far have been based on image processing techniques, which assume implicitly the existence of an image. This limits their ability to unambiguously discriminate seafloor properties, as the primary observation of an MBES is not backscatter imagery or mosaics, but rather backscatter angular response. Mosaics are only projections of the original observations, with resulting loss of information. The method we are developing is fully automatic and attempts to segment the acoustic remote sensing data simultaneously in the image-textural space and in the angular-response space. The output of this automatic procedure is a thematic map, where the individual themes have boundaries defined at the mosaic image resolution, but still have sufficient angular coverage to allow for seafloor characterization. Angular Range Analysis (ARA) inversion is then applied to the average angular response of individual themes, generating estimates of the acoustic impedance, <b>acoustic</b> <b>roughness</b> and mean grain size of the seafloor within the theme. The technique described above is applied to a Simrad EM 1002 95 kHz MBES dataset acquired from a study area covering an offshore reef at Stanton Banks, UK.

Spatial patterns of the abundance of reef resources, {{but also of the}} processes that govern reef recovery after disturbance, need to be mapped at relevant scales to identify priority conservation measures. In this thesis I took important steps towards the construction of adequate tools for reef managers: towards creating maps of reef resilience. The first step comprised the accuracy enhancement of thematic maps to discriminate typical forereef habitats that differ in their structural complexity. The second step consisted of the creation of statistical models to predict spatial patterns of the density and biomass of several fish species including grazers. To date, fish species richness can be mapped but not the spatial patterns of abundance or biomass of key species of reef fish. Here, I demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} predict spatial patterns of the abundance of key species of grazers across large scales on Caribbean reefs by mapping their <b>acoustic</b> <b>roughness.</b> The third and fourth steps focused on improving our understanding of the process of parrotfish grazing on Pacific reefs.

40|$|Acoustic {{backscatter}} mosaics {{derived from}} multibeam and sidescan sonars {{are often used}} to estimate seafloor type and composition, which are important parameters {{in the description of}} benthic habitats. However, due to limitations of the mosaicking technique, backscatter mosaics are restricted in their capacity to unambiguously discriminate seafloor properties. A more adequate technique to characterize the seafloor is the analysis of backscatter angular response, since this response is an intrinsic property of the seafloor. Angular response analysis sometimes lacks spatial resolution, however, as this approach is limited to the swath width of the sonar. In this paper, we propose an approach to combine mosaicking and angular response analysis techniques in an attempt to take advantage of both the spatial resolution of the mosaic, and the angular resolution derived from the angular response analysis. The proposed method for analyzing the backscatter mosaic together with the backscatter angular response is applied to the acoustic backscatter acquired by a Simrad EM 1002 multibeam sonar (95 – 98 kHz) on Stanton Banks, to the west of Scotland. First, a normalized acoustic backscatter mosaic is prepared for the survey area. Then, visual interpretation of the mosaic produces areas on the seafloor with similar textural patterns that we call acoustic themes. Finally, the average backscatter angular response of all the backscatter samples that fall within the same acoustic theme, regardless of the acquisition line they belong to, is compared to a formal mathematical model that links acoustic backscatter observations to seafloor properties. The inversion of the model is accomplished with a constrained iterative method known as angular range analysis (ARA), which produces estimates of the same <b>acoustic</b> impedance, <b>roughness</b> and the mean grain size of the insonified area of the seafloor. The results of the ARA inversion are compared to bottom photographs acquired in the area delimited by the acoustic theme, showing a very good correlation. The ability to discriminate benthic habitats may therefore be improved using this approach...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{development}} of rail-head <b>acoustic</b> <b>roughness</b> on tangent track has been formulated. The model consists of a two-dimensional time domain wheel-rail interaction force calculation, with the normal force used as the input to a two-dimensional rolling contact and wear model. The possibility of multiple wear mechanisms arising from stress concentrations is considered by using a wear coefficient that can vary with the conditions at each point in the contact. The contact model is based on a variational technique, taking account of non-Hertzian and transient effects. A novel feature of the rolling contact model is the introduction of a velocity-dependent friction coefficient. In rolling contact this leads to a high frequency stick-slip oscillation in the slip zone at the trailing edge. Roughness development depends on the dynamics of the track. Roughness growth has often been linked to the pinned-pinned frequency and other resonances of the coupled track and vehicle system. Here the effect of different vehicle and track parameters on track dynamics, wear and roughness development has been examined. Rail dampers are studied as they change the dynamic response of the track. Results are presented in the form of roughness growth rate functions both for individual vehicle types and for mixed traffic. The model parameters match those at a site used for measurements of roughness development taken by Deutsche Bahn AG as part of the EU project Silence. The study shows {{that it is important to}} include non-Hertzian effects when studying roughness with wavelengths shorter than 100 mm. With a non-Hertzian contact model, no mechanism has been found for consistently increasing roughness levels. The model predicts that roughness wavelengths shorter than the contact length will wear away. Rail dampers are shown to reduce the pinned-pinned frequency and smooth the peaks and troughs in the track receptance. Rail dampers also reduce the dynamic wheel-rail interaction forces, especially around the pinned-pinned resonance, and shift the force spectrum to lower frequencies or longer wavelengths. However, rail dampers are not predicted to affect roughness growth rates significantly. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|A {{complete}} description of essential seafloor habitats requires {{the analysis of}} multiple properties acquired from the seafloor, the water column, and the surface properties. Nevertheless, one essential step in this analysis is the characterization of the seafloor substrates. There were attempts to accomplish this task through optical techniques, which offer the ability to provide very high-resolution (mm-scale) images of the seafloor, but the limited propagation of light in seawater severely restricts the seafloor area that can be covered. A more viable option are acoustic techniques, mainly multibeam echosounders (MBES), which offer the ability to cover broad areas with high spatial resolution and thus the ability to provide detailed maps of morphology and rugosity. Calibrated acoustic backscatter acquired by multibeam sonars {{can be used to}} provide estimates of the grain size and impedance (the product of sound speed and density) of the sea floor through the inversion of acoustic backscatter model that takes into account the angular dependence of backscatter (ARA – Fonseca and Mayer, 2007). The use of angular dependence for seafloor characterization is normally limited to “patches” of the seafloor that have dimensions on the order of the swath width of the sonar, thus constraining the spatial resolution of the characterization process. In order to surpass this limitation a “thematic” approach was developed to analyze seafloor backscatter data – however the thematic approach requires an a priori delineation of areas of the seafloor with common acoustic response. We present a new automatic approach for delineation of areas representing different acoustic facies. The technique is not directly dependent on the mosaic, the appearance of which is affected by the particular method of its construction (the mosaic is essentially an example of many-to-one mapping), and utilizes all the backscatter data available for the survey. Automatically determined boundaries derived using this approach correlate well with those obtained by manual procedures and available groundtruth data yet have much higher resolution. Thus, the new approach provides a rapid, unbiased and objective process for the high-resolution delineation of regions of the seafloor of common acoustic response which can then be input into an appropriate inversion model for seafloor characterization. In recent years, many {{attempts have been made to}} develop automatic methods for segmentation of hydro-acoustic remote sensing data acquired by multibeam echosounders in order to generate quantitative estimates of the spatial distribution of seafloor relief, bottom type and composition. The majority of the segmentation methods presented so far have been based on image processing techniques, which assume implicitly that the backscatter mosaic reflects all the available backscatter data. This limits their ability to unambiguously discriminate seafloor properties, as the primary observation of an MBES is not backscatter imagery or mosaics, but rather backscatter angular response. Mosaics are only projections of the original observations, with resulting loss of information. The method we are developing is fully automatic and attempts to segment the acoustic remote sensing data simultaneously in the image-textural space and in the angular-response space.

The latter requirement {{can be achieved by}} recycling cutting fluids, which is a costly solution, or by drastically reducing the amount of cutting fluids employed in the grinding process. This alternative was investigated here by varying the plunge velocity in the plunge cylindrical grinding of ABNT D 6 steel, rationalizing the application of two cutting fluids and using a superabrasive CBN (cubic boron nitride) grinding wheel with vitrified binder to evaluate the output parameters of tangential cutting force, <b>acoustic</b> emission, <b>roughness,</b> roundness, tool wear, residual stress and surface integrity, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the test specimens. The performance of the cutting fluid, grinding wheel and plunge velocity were analyzed to identify the best machining conditions which allowed for a reduction of the cutting fluid volume, reducing the machining time without impairing the geometric and dimensional parameters, and the surface finish and integrity of the machined components. La rectificación, proceso final de fabricación de una pieza, hace uso intenso de fluidos de corte con la finalidad de lubricación, refrigeración y remoción de astillas (imperfecciones). Sin embargo, estos fluidos son extremamente agresivos al medio. Con el avance tecnológico la tendencia mundial es producir piezas cada vez mas sofisticadas, con elevado grado de tolerancia geométrica, dimensional, con buen acabamiento superficial, con bajo costo y, principalmente, sin causar daños al medio. Para ello, al proceso de rectificación está intrínseco el reciclaje del fluido de corte, que se destaca por su costo. A través de la variación de la velocidad de avance en el proceso de rectificación cilíndrica externa del acero ABNT D 6, racionalizando la aplicación de dos fluidos de corte y usando una muela superabrasiva de CBN (nitruro de boro cúbico) con ligante vitrificado, se evaluaron los parámetros de salida fuerza tangencial de corte, rugosidad, circularidad, desgaste de la herramienta, la tensión residual y la integridad superficial a través de la microscopia electrónica de barrido (SEM) de las piezas de prueba. Con el análisis del desempeño fluido, muela y velocidad de inmersión se encontró las mejores condiciones de fabricación propiciando la disminución del volumen de fluido de corte, disminución del tiempo de fabricación sin perjudicar los parámetros geométricos, dimensionales, el acabado superficial y la integridad superficial de los componentes...|$|R
40|$|Boundary-layer {{receptivity}} {{and stability}} of Mach 6 flows over smooth and rough seven-degree half-angle sharp-tipped cones are numerically investigated. The receptivity of the boundary layer to slow acoustic disturbances, fast acoustic disturbances, and vortical disturbances is considered. The effects of three-dimensional isolated roughness on the receptivity and stability are also simulated. The results for the smooth cone show that the instability waves are generated in the leading edge region and that the boundary layer is much more receptive to slow acoustic waves than to the fast acoustic waves. Vortical disturbances also generate unstable second modes, however the receptivity coefficients are smaller {{than that of the}} slow <b>acoustic</b> wave. Distributed <b>roughness</b> elements located near the nose region decreased the receptivity of the second mode generated by the slow acoustic wave by a small amount. Roughness elements distributed across the continuous spectrum increased the receptivity of the second mode generated by the slow and fast acoustic waves and the vorticity wave. The largest increase occurred for the vorticity wave. Roughness elements distributed across the synchronization point did not change the receptivity of the second modes generated by the acoustic waves. The receptivity of the second mode generated by the vorticity wave increased in this case, but the increase is lower than that occurred with the roughness elements located across the continuous spectrum. The simulations with an isolated roughness element showed that the second mode waves generated by the acoustic disturbances are not influenced by the small roughness element. Due to the interaction, a three-dimensional wave is generated. However, the amplitude is orders of magnitude smaller than the two-dimensional wave...|$|R
40|$|In {{the seismic}} {{reflection}} method, {{it is well}} known that seismic amplitude varies with the offset between the seismic source and detector, and that this variation is the key to the direct determination of lithology and pore fluid content of subsurface strata. Based on this fundamental property, amplitude-versus-offset (AVO) analysis has been used successfully in the oil industry for the exploration and characterization of subsurface reservoirs. Multibeam sonars acquire acoustic backscatter over wide range of incidence angles, and the variation of the backscatter with the angle of incidence is an intrinsic property of the seafloor. With the necessary changes being made, a similar approach to seismic AVO analysis can applied to the acoustic backscatter. To illustrate this approach, AVO analysis was applied to a Simrad EM 3000 (300 kHz) multibeam sonar dataset from Little Bay, NH, and to a Simrad EM 300 (30 kHz) multibeam sonar dataset from Skjalfandi Bay, Iceland. The analysis starts with the backscatter time series stored in raw Simrad datagrams, which are then corrected for seafloor slope, insonification area, time varying and angle varying gains. Then, a series of AVO attributes (near, far, slope, gradient, fluid factor, product etc) are calculated from the stacking of a number of consecutive time series. Based on the calculated AVO attributes and the inversion of a modified Jackson et al (1986) acoustic backscatter model we estimate the <b>acoustic</b> impedance, the <b>roughness,</b> and consequently the grain size of the insonified area on the seafloor. In Little Bay, the estimated impedance and the grain size were compared to in-situ measurements of sound speed and to the direct analysis of grain size in grab samples, showing a very good correlation. In Skjalfandi Bay, the AVO attribute of fluid factor was calculated, which presented an estimate of the gas/fluid content in the sediment structure. The areas with high fluid factor anomalies correlated to regions that showed evidence of gas in seismic profiles...|$|R
40|$|The goal of psycho {{acoustic}} or subjective voice analysis, in a phoniater's everyday work, is {{to describe}} a subjective experience based on the physical parameters created {{in the process of}} phonation. The work was a clinical prospective study and the sample consisted of 80 people of both sexes, 40 people with benign and pseudo tumors of vocal cords and 40 people with malign tumors of vocal cords. All the patients were otorinolaringologically and phoniatrically examined. The subjective acoustic analysis was done with the patients pronouncing numbers from 1 to 10 in the comfortable zone. Afterwards, the quality of the voices was estimated in RBH scale. The subjective <b>acoustic</b> analysis found <b>roughness</b> in the voices of 87, 50 % patients in the first group and the most frequent value was Mod= 3 (intense roughness), 62, 50 % patients. Hoarseness was present in 90, 00 % cases, with largest value Mod= 2 (moderate hoarseness), 55, 00 % patients. In the second group, roughness existed in the voices of 70, 00 % patients, most often intense one (Mod= 3), 30, 00 % patients. Hoarseness existed in 95, 00 % cases, 45, 00 % with moderate (Mod= 2) and 35, 00 % with intense one. T test showed that there is a statistically significant difference between the strength of the roughness determined by the subjective acoustic analysis in the first and the second group, with p< 0, 01. The difference between the strength of the hoarseness in the first and the second group is also statistically significant, with p< 0, 01. All the growths on vocal cords irrespective of their nature change the characteristics of the voice, most of all its clearness. In cases of vocal cords tumors, by the subjective acoustic analysis, i. e. the perception of the psycho physiological characteristics of voice, a human ear can register pathological phenomena of the voice but cannot determine the character of the growth on the vocal cords...|$|R
