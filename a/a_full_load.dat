5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1944, 'D' Company {{left the}} {{battalion}} camp at Bulford in Wiltshire for RAF Tarrant Rushton in Dorset. The base was then secured and Howard briefed everyone on the mission, distributing photographs of the bridges and unveiling {{a model of the}} area. Glider pilot commander Staff Sergeant Jim Wallwork told Howard that with <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of men, ammunition, assault boats and engineers' stores his gliders would be dangerously overloaded. Howard decided to only take one assault boat per glider and leave behind two men from each platoon. At the last minute, Doctor John Vaughan replaced an injured man in one of the platoons.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a ship called Southern Isle was wrecked by {{the high}} surf. It had been sailing from Puerto Rico with <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of iron ore and, as it {{approached}} the hurricane, the vessel changed directions and slowed down. By October 5, winds were strong and the seas were moderately rough. Very quickly, the ship broke into two, which prevented any time to escape on lifeboats. By {{the day after the}} wreck, rescue boats and helicopters found seven people, one of whom later died from their injuries. Ultimately, 17people died in the event.|$|E

5|$|Serving as {{the convoy}} {{flagship}} for Convoy HX-50, Otranto departed New York on 25 September. Six days later, {{on the evening}} of 1 October, the ship accidentally rammed the French fishing schooner Croisine off Newfoundland while the latter was returning home to St. Malo with <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of cod. The fishing boat passed down the liner's port side and its masts destroyed some of the liner's lifeboats on that side. Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of the convoy, ordered the convoy to continue while Otranto stopped to rescue the 37 survivors. The derelict Croisine was now a menace to navigation and Davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening. The liner caught back up with the convoy by daybreak. The following day, the first death from the influenza pandemic occurred and the soldier was buried at sea. Only one other flu death aboard Otranto is recorded, but others may have occurred before she met her end.|$|E

25|$|In October, {{the first}} nine {{electric}} trams arrived in Nottingham and were assembled at Sherwood Depot.

25|$|Mount Royal {{was built}} by Alexander Watson in Victoria at Albion Iron Works (VMD). Watson {{designed}} her specifically for navigating the treacherous Skeena River.

25|$|During the 1960s, the Moskva-class {{helicopter}} {{carriers and}} the Kiev-class VSTOL aircraft carrying cruisers were constructed.

25|$|At about 6:00am on October 20, 1976, the George Prince was berthed at the East Bank landing, {{taking on}} vehicles. Her crew {{had been on}} duty all night and was due to get off duty at 7:00. She was facing upriver and took on <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of vehicles, {{consisting}} of 20 cars, 8 trucks, 6 motorcycles, and {{an unknown number of}} pedestrians. Of the passengers aboard, there is no accounting of people in vehicles versus pedestrians. About 20 people were crowded in a waiting room to avoid the pre-dawn chill.|$|E
25|$|Because Atlantis {{launched}} on time with <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of onboard consumables for its electricity-generating fuel cells, {{and due to}} power saving operations employed {{during the first three}} days, on Flight Day 4, NASA's managers approved a one-day mission extension. According to NASA, the mission was extended primarily to allow the crew spend more time on cargo transfers. CAPCOM Megan McArthur also notified commander Chris Ferguson that the Mission Management Team determined had decided not to do a Focused Inspection of the Atlantis's heat shield. The Damage Assessment Team had only found one tile ding along with four areas of minor damage to insulating blankets, said chairman Leroy Cain during the day's Mission Management Briefing aired on NASA TV.|$|E

25|$|Since her launch, the Minnie A. Caine was {{involved}} in transpacific lumber trade. She typically carried <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of lumber from Washington state or British Columbia to ports of Australia, Hawaii, Mexico, Chile, or Peru. Until the late 1910s, the economics of transpacific lumber trade heavily depended on the payment opportunities for return cargoes which typically included a load of coal from Newcastle, Australia to Honolulu where coal was in demand for the local sugar industry, followed by a load of sugar for San Francisco. Alternatively, a load of coal could be taken from Australia {{all the way to}} the Pacific Northwest; for example, in 1907 the Minnie A. Caine has brought coal to Nanaimo, British Columbia and loaded her next cargo of lumber in the same port.|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 1924, {{taking off}} at 3:58 A.M., Army test pilot First Lieutenant Russell Maughan left Mitchel Field, New York, in PW-8 24-204, {{modified}} with additional fuel and oil tanks, made a dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the US. Refueling five times, he landed at Crissy Field, San Francisco, California, at 9:46p.m., one minute before dusk, covering 2,670mi (4,297km) in 20 hours and 48 minutes. His flight time included four planned 30-minute stops at McCook Field, Ohio; Saint Joseph, Missouri; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Salduro Siding, Utah; and an unplanned stop in North Platte, Nebraska for additional fuel when a muddy field in Missouri {{did not permit}} him to take on <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load.</b> He also lost an hour at McCook to repair a broken fuel valve after an over-eager mechanic had over-torqued the valve, damaging it.|$|E
25|$|After shakedown, General M. M.

With <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of troops embarked, she then sailed 16 March for the Southwest Pacific, where she arrived San Pedro Bay, Philippines, 18 April. After shuttling troops from Allied bases along the northern coast of New Guinea to Luzon, she departed Manila 16 May and brought home returning veterans, arriving San Francisco 12 June. Once again departing San Francisco 28 June, she transported 3,000 troops and passengers to Fremantle, Australia; steamed to Calcutta, India, to embark passengers; then sailed via the Suez Canal to New York, where she arrived 3 September.|$|E

25|$|On {{the fifth}} day of the enquiry, {{managing}} director of Imperial Airways Colonel Frank Searle gave evidence that Imperial Airways pilots had absolute discretion to refuse to fly any aircraft if, in their opinion, the aircraft was unfit for flight for whatever reason. He stated that the petrol pipe supplied by Petro-Flex to Imperial Airways was of an armoured type, but that unarmoured pipes had been fitted to some aircraft taken over when Imperial Airways had been formed, and that spares from these companies were in stock and being used. Both armoured and unarmoured pipes had been approved {{for use by the}} Air Ministry. A representative from Petro-Flex corroborated Searle's evidence in respect of the type of piping supplied to Imperial Airways. Evidence was given that the flight from Lympne to Croydon was with the aircraft lightly loaded, and that the performance of the engine with a restricted fuel pipe would be different from that with <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load.</b> The Chief Engineer of D. Napier & Son gave evidence that Imperial Airways maintenance regime was of the highest standard. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Captain J. Cass Mason of St. Louis, Sultana left St. Louis on April 13, 1865, bound for New Orleans, Louisiana. On the morning of April 15, she was tied up at Cairo, Illinois when word reached the city that President Abraham Lincoln had been shot at Ford's Theater. Immediately, Captain Mason grabbed an armload of Cairo {{newspapers}} and headed south to spread the news, knowing that telegraphic communication with the South had been almost totally cut off because of the war. Upon reaching Vicksburg, Mississippi, Mason was approached by Lt. Col. Reuben Hatch, the chief quartermaster at Vicksburg. Hatch had a deal for Mason. Thousands of recently released Union prisoners of war that had been held by the Confederacy at the prison camps of Cahaba near Selma, Alabama, and Andersonville, in southwest Georgia, {{had been brought to}} a small parole camp outside of Vicksburg to await release to the North. The U.S. government would pay $5 per enlisted man and $10 per officer to any steamboat captain who would take a group north. Knowing that Mason was in need of money, Hatch suggested that if he could guarantee Mason <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of about 1,400 prisoners, Mason would guarantee to give Hatch a kickback. Hoping to gain much money through this deal, Mason quickly agreed to the offered bribe.|$|E
