30|$|This study applies linear programming-based DEA {{to assess}} the {{operational}} efficiency of individual attractions at theme parks. In consideration of an optimal DMU number, 15 attractions at Samsung Everland were chosen as DMUs.

Actual data for the input and output factors were collected, accounting for fixed cost, variable cost, qualitative factor, and quantitative factor. The results of the DEA showed that the most efficient DMUs were Peter Pan, Flying Elephant, and Flying Rescue whereas the most inefficient attraction was T Express. Global Village, Rolling X-Train, and Amazon Express also recorded relatively low efficiency levels. Further analysis showed that, to increase efficiency in the inefficient attractions, their installation cost and <b>annual</b> <b>repair</b> cost need to be reduced.|$|R

[...] The Book La Peche de la Morue a l'Ile Royale, 1713-1758, contains the following mention of the fishery at St. Esprit. “Resident fishermen certainly also had to maintain their own storehouses.

50|$|On 31 May, Capt. Murray {{reported}} that the Kundah pass, {{as it was then}} called, was open with a path down the slopes connecting with the roads on the Malabar plains. Sispara was known for some time as Murraypet. The route was so infested with elephants and tigers that the Collector of Malabar obtained sanction to purchase five large swivel mounted muskets (jingalls) and employ ten peons (foot soldiers) to shoot the beasts and protect the coolies. The track was very rough but the monsoon set in and later the Pioneers were diverted to widening the Coonoor ghat. Work was not resumed till 1836.In 1836 the track was so narrow that two people could not ride abreast along it. The principal obstacle was the 'ladder hill' near the middle of the descent, which was surmounted by steep zigzags at very acute angles. The Pioneers were camped at Walaghat, halfway down, in huts scattered through the jungle, the site being too steep and confined for any regular cantonment.The road was finished in 1838, with a gradient of one in nine. Bungalows for travellers were built at Sholakul, Walaghat, Sispara and Avalanche. The extraordinarily heavy rainfall at that end of the Kundahs necessitated large <b>annual</b> <b>repairs</b> in subsequent years. The trail was so steep that it was seldom used for laden cattle, and the climate was so severe and the shelter en route so insufficient that Europeans often could not get coolies to come with them to carry their baggage. The ghat thus failed to fulfill its high expectations. As early as 1841 it was declared to be 'rarely traversed except {{at the height of the}} dry season', and it was eventually abandoned. After 1857, the bungalow at Sispara was accidentally burnt down and was never rebuilt.|$|E

5000|$|Technology Archaeologists and Industrial Historians {{date the}} American Canal Age from 1790 to 1855 based on {{momentum}} and new construction activity, {{since many of}} the older canals, however limited later by locks that restricted boat sizes below the most economic capacities and well-behind later-developing technological capabilities, nonetheless continued on in service well into the twentieth century. In truth, the first legislation supporting canals in North America took place in the Province of Pennsylvania in 1762 with an effort to improve navigation on the Schuylkill River through Philadelphia, the largest city in North America and the surveying of a canal along the Schuylkill tributary Tulpehocken Creek which would eventually be built in 1828 as the Union Canal part of the omnibus Pennsylvania legislative package, the Main Line of Public Works, providing the only water route connecting the Susquehanna with the Delaware above the Potomac & Chesapeake Bay. [...] Pennsylvania had been foremost among the colonies in canal building, for it had surveyed as early as 1762 the first lock canal in America, from near Reading on the Schuylkill to Middletown on the Susquehanna.As energetic men all along the Atlantic Plain now took up the problem of improving the inland rivers, they faced a storm of criticism and ridicule that would have daunted any but such as Washington and Johnson of Virginia or White and Hazard of Pennsylvania or Morris and Watson of New York. Every imaginable objection to such projects was advanced—from the inefficiency of the science of engineering to the probable destruction of all the fish in the streams. In spite of these discouragements, however, various men set themselves to form in rapid succession the Potomac Company in 1785, the Society for Promoting the Improvement of Inland Navigation in 1791, the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company in 1792, and the Lehigh Coal Mine Companyin 1793. A brief review of these various enterprises will give a clear if not a complete view of the first era of inland water commerce in America. Archer B. Hurlbert (1920), Chapter III: [...] Next up there were numerous schemes and bills placed before the Pennsylvania assembly in the 1790-1816 time frame to improve navigation on both the Lehigh and the Schuylkill Rivers, which consumed public monies, but were little successful. Concurrently, the predecessor of the Erie Canal was begun in New York State and in New England, Connecticut and Massachusetts were looking at a few waterways needing better navigability. Not much happened The Lehigh Canal came about when the last of these licenses, awarded in 1816, expired in early 1818 with virtually nothing to show for the funds spent. This expiration allowed the state to give rights-of-way to the Lehigh Navigation Company in March 1818, founded by two disgruntled formerly enthusiastic backers of the Schuylkill Canal which was chartered in 1812 but like the earlier Lehigh River projects, languished lazily, only raising a small amount of new funds annually, and getting only a little amount of work done accordingly. Josiah White and partner Erskine Hazard needing fuel for their wire mill and nail factory at the falls of the Schuylkill fought this plodding method of incremental improvement for years. By 1855, canals were no longer the civil engineering work of first resort, for it was nearly always better - cheaper to build a railroad above ground than it was to dig a watertight ditch 6-8 feet (2-3 m) deep and provide it with water and make <b>annual</b> <b>repairs</b> for ice and freshet damages - even though the cost per ton mile on a canal was often cheaper in an operational sense, canals couldn't be built along hills and dales, nor backed into odd corners, as could a railroad siding.|$|E

40|$|Repair and {{maintenance}} costs represent {{a major part}} of the operating costs of farm machinery. Usually the estimation of these costs associated with the working age of the implement or the worked area by developing a mathematical model contains all cost elements. This model mainly uses for determining the elements which had the highest potential of reducing the total operating cost. Due to the differences in the operating conditions and also the differences in the periodical maintenance of farm machinery from one place to another, it makes necessary that, each area develop its own cost models. The objective of this paper is to develop a model to estimate repair {{and maintenance}} costs for seed drills. The field data collected by HADCO (Hail agricultural development company) for 42 seed drills will be used for this purpose. The data covered the period of 1987 - 1993. The recorded data included: the implement age in years, the working width in meters, the cost of spare parts used for each implement and the labor cost. Also, the worked area by each implement during the previous period in hectares. The results showed that, <b>annual</b> <b>repair</b> and maintenance costs decreased by increasing the average worked area using seed drill until 390 ha/year and then increasing. The mean <b>annual</b> <b>repair</b> and maintenance cost was 5925 SRlyear and was 15. 27 SRlha. Labor cost accounted 8 % while spare parts represent 92 % of annual R&M costs.

40|$|The use {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) reinforcement in concrete structures {{has been on}} the rise due to its advantages over conventional steel reinforcement such as corrosion. Reinforcing steel corrosion has been the primary cause of deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) structures, resulting in tremendous <b>annual</b> <b>repair</b> costs. One application of FRP reinforcement to be further explored is its use in RC frames. Nonetheless, due to FRP 2 ̆ 7 s inherently elastic behavior, FRP-reinforced (FRP-RC) members exhibit low ductility and energy dissipation as well as different damage mechanisms. Furthermore, current design standards for FRP-RC structures do not address seismic design in which the beam-column joint is a key issue. During an earthquake, the safety of beam-column joints is essential to the whole structure integrity. Thus, research is needed to gain better understanding of the behavior of FRP-RC structures and their damage mechanisms under seismic loading. In this study, two full-scale beam-column joint specimens reinforced with steel and GFRP configurations were tested under quasi-static loading.

A repairable mechanical system (as agricultural tractor) is subject to deterioration or repeated failure. In this study, the regression model was used to predict the failure rate of MF 399 tractor. The machine failure pattern was carefully studied and key factors affecting the failure rate were identified in five regions of Khouzestan province. The tractors grouped in four sub groups according to annual use hours and maintenance policies (corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance). Results showed that the majority of recorded failures were observed in the electrical system (20. 3 %) for each machine sub-group. Maximum and minimum <b>annual</b> <b>repair</b> and maintenance costs were related to other (tire, ring, ball bearing and operator seat) and brake system respectively.

The expected service life of business facilities is 15 years, but 70 % of those in urban areas have surpassed the 15 year service life as of the present 2014. Thus, the demand for urgent rehabilitation of such facilities is constantly increasing due to the aging and performance deterioration of the facilities’main finishing materials. Especially, the business facilities are being used for the lease of company office or private office, and such problems as aging and performance deterioration of the facilities could cause less competitive edge for leasing and real estate value depreciation for the O&M (Operation & Management) agent and the owner, respectively. Therefore, an effective planned rehabilitation as a preventive measure according to the standardized repair rate {{by the number of}} years after the construction is in need in order to prevent the aging and performance deterioration of the facilities(La et al. 2001). Nonetheless, domestic repair/rehabilitation standards based on the repair rate are mainly limited to apartment buildings and pubic institutions, resulting in impractical application of such standards to business facilities. It has been investigated and analyzed that <b>annual</b> <b>repair</b> rate data for each finishing material are required for examination of the applicability of the repair rate standard for the purpose of establishment of a repair plan. Hence, this study aimed at developing a repair rate computation model for finishin...|$|R
