Lost show runner Damon Lindelof said the fifth season of the show has [...] "flung major characters across decades, leaving them — and the audience — feverishly attempting to keep events straight and the end game in sight." [...] In [...] "The Variable", the viewers would get a few more pieces of the puzzle, Lindelof said, and added: [...] "We're not promising any big whiz-bang flash pyrotechnics, but it does serve as a companion piece to another memorable episode, last season's 'The Constant', in which Desmond endured vicious, turbulence-caused side effects from traveling in time." [...] Lindelof also commented that the fifth season is about the rules of time travel as explained by Daniel, and said, [...] "We've never done a flashback story for Daniel, so he's very mysterious. Some of those mysteries will be answered in this episode." [...] Since Lindelof and his show runner partner Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "The Constant", they thought the [...] "sister episode" [...] should be written by someone other than them, which led to Kitsis and Horowitz writing it.
