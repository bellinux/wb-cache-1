[...] Lindelof also commented that the fifth season is about the rules of time travel as explained by Daniel, and said, [...] "We've never done a flashback story for Daniel, so he's very mysterious. Some of those mysteries will be answered in this episode." [...] Since Lindelof and his show runner partner Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "The Constant", they thought the [...] "sister episode" [...] should be written by someone other than them, which led to Kitsis and Horowitz writing it.
