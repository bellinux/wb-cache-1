25|$|Through the decades, certain {{players have}} tended to {{dominate}} the game, but none more than its original star player, Joe Davis. Davis was world champion for twenty years, retiring unbeaten after claiming his fifteenth world title in 1946 when the tournament was reinstated after the Second World War. Davis was unbeaten in world championship play, and was only ever beaten four times in his entire life, with all four defeats coming after his world championship retirement and inflicted by his own brother Fred. He did lose matches in handicapped tournaments, but on level terms these four defeats were the only losses of his entire career. He was also world billiards champion. It is regarded as highly unlikely that <b>anyone</b> <b>will</b> ever dominate the game to his level again.|$|E

The perpetrators of the attack have not been caught, and Greater Manchester Police have conceded it is unlikely that <b>anyone</b> <b>will</b> be charged in connection with the bombing. The bombing has however been credited for starting the city's mass regeneration and turning Manchester into a modern British [...] "powerhouse" [...] city with above national average economic growth in the 20 years following the bombing.|$|E

This idea garners mixed reactions from the employees, but when Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) jokingly asks Andy what prizes he will offer for inordinately large numbers of points, he offers to tattoo whatever his co-workers would like on his butt in exchange for 5,000 points, not anticipating that <b>anyone</b> <b>will</b> be able to {{even come close to}} this number.|$|E

500|$|The Times {{said it was}} [...] "a very Sparksian {{undertaking}} – painstaking {{and slightly}} ludicrous – to make a musical about an art-house film director, with a very complicated plot, for the radio (even Rick Wakeman's King Arthur on Ice had something to look at)." [...] It said the orchestral arrangements by Ron Mael were [...] "great, actually, recalling the skyscraper bustle of Bernstein and the triumphant fanfares of Michael Nyman", and stated that [...] "the central concept – pursue your own idea of art, regardless of whether <b>anyone</b> <b>will</b> buy it – seems to be their rule of thumb, too. And you can't knock that." [...] The review by Stephen Dalton, also in The Times, found the [...] "modernist musical backdrop" [...] dominated by [...] "electro-orchestral fragments" [...] "less seductive" [...] and, [...] "despite plenty of arch and witty lyrics", regretted the scarcity of [...] "memorable melodies or fully realised songs". Dalton concluded that the work was [...] "not wholly successful, perhaps, but still an alluringly barmy and glamorous affair", and a [...] "fascinating folly from two enduringly inventive oddballs".|$|E

He stated his reason through his extended review; [...] "Kingdom Hearts has several 'theme songs' but the orchestrated version of 'Hikari' takes the cake with all {{the makings of a}} grand adventure. It resonates with the many themes of the games: friendship, teamwork, and adventure. 'Hikari' undoubtedly brings back wealth of memories for any fan of the franchise." [...] GameFAQs's editor Pierce Sparrow listed both [...] "Simple & Clean" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary" [...] at number two on their [...] "Top Ten Lyrical Songs for a Video Game". Sparrow stated: [...] "It was a little too difficult for me to choose just one of the songs, seeing as they have very similar qualities...

Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey as a non-religious Christmas icon since he does not discriminate against anyone. At home, Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey. While Kyle is brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet, spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's parents to blame Kyle for the mess. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned, dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him, leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition. Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman's face as he sings [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch" [...] in D Minor, and Kyle is blamed. He is sent to talk to guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey's coffee. Cartman, Stan and Kenny believe Kyle is insane and check him into a mental institution.|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether <b>anyone</b> <b>will</b> be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
