500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, [...] "From that version, [...] we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> great. I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite knows {{what to do with it}} anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E
500|$|... "So I {{head out}} there and he plays me the track <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> exactly like how {{you want it to}} sound: forward moving, interesting, light-hearted, heavy-hearted, fucking {{incredible}} sounding jam. It was kind of bare so I added some choir-sounding stuff and then thicked out the samples with my voice. That whole first week I was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'. We were just eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like, 'Fuck, {{this is going to be}} the festival closer.' I was like, 'Yeah, cool.' It kind of freaked me out." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{critic of}} the Beatles' output {{immediately}} post-Sgt. Pepper, Ian MacDonald found [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] "as unfocused and monotonous {{as most of the}} group's output of this period", adding that the song [...] "numbingly fails to transcend the weary boredom that inspired it". Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot considered it to be [...] "one of [...] least-memorable Beatles tracks … a song essentially about boredom – <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like it". Similarly unimpressed with Magical Mystery Tour, Tim Riley describes [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] as a song that [...] "goes nowhere tiresomely", with a vocal that [...] "sounds as tired and droning" [...] as the musical accompaniment.|$|E
500|$|After the game's release, a {{reviewer}} for Game Revolution praised its sound, {{saying that}} [...] "When you're {{in a crowded}} city, {{it sounds like a}} crowded city. Walk past a bar, and you'll hear the noise of the drunken patrons inside. Wander near a slave auction, and you'll hear the auctioneer calling. Go to a party in the festival hall, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> just like a party". The same reviewer also stated [...] "Planescape has just about the best sound I've ever heard in a game." [...] IGN gave the sound 8.5 out of 10 and noted that [...] "The game has fantastic speech and sound effects, but what's more impressive is the way they fade in and out depending on how close you're standing to them." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair outed {{the song}} as a [...] "heart-on-my-sleeve number", {{and called it}} the [...] "crux of the album". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt the song [...] "made Mariah likeable again" [...] and wrote [...] " [...] an {{inspirational}} ballad that's equal parts 'Butterfly' and 'Hero'." [...] A writer from the Sarasota Herald-Tribune compared it to Carey's debut single, [...] "Vision of Love", and called {{it one of the}} best cuts from The Emancipation of Mimi. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic gave the song a mixed review, criticizing the condition of Carey's voice, [...] "As good as those Wright-helmed cuts are, they are also the times that the mixes slip and don't hide the flaws in Mariah's voice, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> as airy, thin, and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Chick-a-dee-dee, ma'am, chick-a-dee-dee!'" [...] {{answered}} the {{bird in the}} same cheerful tone. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> as if he said, 'I shall be cared for. I'm not afraid.' ...|$|R

500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{minority}} of apparently more discerning listeners felt that Connotations {{was the right}} music for its time and place. Composer Arthur Berger states, [...] "I think [...] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write {{because he wanted to}} make a statement about the new Philharmonic Hall in New York—it wasn't going to be a temple of easy listening, as it were, but a place for serious music-making." [...] Minna Lederman Daniel, a music writer and editor of Modern Music magazine, told Copland, [...] "I think Connotations was the right place for the people and the occasion—indeed the only one properly related to them. It sounds a good deal like certain aspects of the building—big, spacious, clear, long-lined, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> very like you... To those familiar with your music, the characteristic, identifying moods are perfectly apparent. The special Copland eloquence is there." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of Ravel's piano {{music is}} {{extremely}} difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges. Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, [...] "A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing. It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit. Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> pale." [...] This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit [...] "Le gibet" [...] would [...] "bore the audience to death". Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing.|$|E

6000|$|He {{thrust his}} tiny tuft of beard between his teeth--a trick {{he had when}} perplexed or thoughtful. [...] "Ah!" [...] he exclaimed at last, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> like an indrawn breath of apprehension. [...] "Tell me more." ...|$|R
5000|$|We've {{been called}} a band that takes old music <b>and</b> makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> new. On this album Departure we take new music <b>and</b> make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> old.

500|$|In 1996 CMJ New Music Monthly wrote: [...] "His Red Headed Stranger was the Sgt. Pepper's {{of country}} music, the first record {{to follow a}} {{coherent}} theme instead of merely compiling radio singles". AllMusic described Red Headed Stranger as [...] "really elusive, as the themes get a little muddled and the tunes themselves are a bit bare. It's undoubtedly distinctive – <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> more distinctive {{with each passing year}} – but it's strictly an intellectual triumph and, after a pair of albums that were musically and intellectually sound, it's a bit of a letdown, no matter how successful it was". In 2003 it was included among the top 1,000 albums of Zagat Survey magazine, and was rated five stars out of five. The magazine wrote, [...] "Supporters (of the album) spread the gospel that it's just a quintessential outlaw recording, but perhaps the greatest country album ever with a spare style that changed the way C was played".|$|E
500|$|... "Man, {{there will}} be a time for Down. Matter of fact we had a meeting this past week, and I know Jimmy's gotta go do an Eyehategod tour in February. But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, Brian said: [...] "That {{was written}} inside Brother Studios in Santa Monica. At the end, where Dennis goes (sings) [...] "Find a ride", we put {{two of his}} voices on there, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> fan-tas-tic! Fuckin' fantastic from Dennis." ...|$|R
6000|$|Grace shivered as she answered: [...] "I {{have never}} heard <b>it</b> before, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> so unearthly--almost like a warning of some evil. But it is growing late, and you have far to go. I shall expect you at the crossing." ...|$|R
2500|$|Becker and Fagen met in 1967 at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. As Fagen {{passed by}} a café, The Red Balloon, he heard Becker {{practicing}} the electric guitar. In an interview, Fagen recounted the experience: [...] "I hear this guy practicing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> very professional <b>and</b> contemporary. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> like, you know, like a black person, really." [...] He introduced himself to Becker and asked, [...] "Do {{you want to be}} in a band?" [...] Discovering that they enjoyed similar music, the two began writing songs together.|$|R
500|$|Before the U2 360° Tour commenced, [...] "If God Will Send His Angels", [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own", and [...] "Drowning Man", a {{previously}} unplayed song from War, were rehearsed, as was [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing" [...] in the Perfecto mix style, while The Edge stated {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that [...] "Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)" [...] was also being considered. None of these were played during the first four legs of the tour. Willie Williams stated in his 27 June 2009 tour diary entry on U2.com that the band [...] "really wants [...] to work <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> great", {{but the rest of the}} setlist struggled due to the song's [...] "beautiful melancholy". In his 24 July 2009 entry, Williams noted that [...] "October" [...] and [...] "White as Snow" [...] were also being considered. [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] and [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] were rehearsed in an acoustic style, but performances during the tour were done by the full band. Before the third leg, [...] "Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World" [...] was also rehearsed.|$|E
500|$|Thom Jurek of Allmusic {{wrote that}} the album [...] "feels more like a band record than {{anything}} [...] done in decades". He praises Clarke's choice in bandmates, calling them [...] "prodigies in their own right" [...] but does not praise the whole album. He called [...] "Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu's Report" [...] a [...] "clumsy, failed attempt at summing up the music's history to date" [...] and that [...] "Bass Folk Song No. 6" [...] does not [...] "work [...] well" [...] {{as some of the}} other tracks but [...] "these are minor complaints on an otherwise fine recording". Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz commented that there [...] "are no radical departures" [...] on this album <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> as if Clarke is [...] "taking a victory lap here, revisiting past triumphs" [...] but that he [...] "still pull sounds out of his assortment of electric, acoustic and Alembic basses like nobody else, and [...] still slapping, plucking and thumbing his way through contemporary, fusion jazz, rock, funk and whatever else he puts his mind to".|$|E
500|$|In April 1970 Mercury joined guitarist Brian May {{and drummer}} Roger Taylor who had {{previously}} been in a band called Smile. In 1971 {{they were joined by}} bassist John Deacon. Despite reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name [...] "Queen" [...] for the new band. He later said, [...] "It's very regal obviously, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it." [...] At about the same time, he changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury. Mercury designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters.|$|E

500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{commented that}} Garbage's penchant for {{absorbing}} elements from various genres, skillfully crafting them together is more evident in this album, {{in how they}} [...] "approximate contemporary R with the sultry 'Androgyny', or the Minneapolis new wave bubblegum funk of 'Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),' or the bluesy PJ Harvey strut of 'Silence Is Golden.'" [...] This penchant is enhanced by an [...] "unabashedly pop coating, an element that Garbage clearly revel in, as well as should the listener." [...] He described it [...] "every bit as enticingly postmodern as their other albums, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> distinctly Garbage" [...] and although the fusion elements are perceptible, [...] "they seem less like magpies, more themselves, which means Beautiful Garbage is a more consistent record." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly observed Manson's continued [...] "aggressive bite" [...] complemented by [...] "throbbing tracks like 'Till the Day I Die' and 'Shut Your Mouth'", as well as exposing [...] "tender aspects" [...] in [...] "heartfelt" [...] and [...] "subdued" [...] songs like 'Cup of Coffee' and 'So Like a Rose'. He noted however that the band's [...] "experiments with sonic expansion yield more mixed results"; [...] "They thaw their sound by adding elements of trip-hop, which works for 'Cup of Coffee' and the first single, 'Androgyny' ... But on a record that's more self-consciously varied than 1998's Version 2.0 other attempts are gimmicky and less successful" ... Still, there's just enough to salvage from beautifulgarbage." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E
500|$|Based on 146 {{individual}} year-end top ten lists {{compiled by}} Metacritic, Yeezus {{was the most}} critically acclaimed album of 2013, appearing on 61 lists and being named first on 18 of them. In October 2013, Complex named Yeezus the sixth best hip hop album {{of the last five}} years. Yeezus was rated as album of the year by nine publications. Spin named it the best album of 2013, writing, [...] "Yeezus was a thorny tangram puzzle of boxy headbanger blats that exemplified a year of equally stripped-down, basal pleasures." [...] The A.V. Club named it the best album of 2013 saying [...] "It’s magnificent, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like absolutely nothing else." [...] Rolling Stone named it the second best album of 2013, comparing it in concept to Reed's polarizing 1975 album Metal Machine Music: [...] "No wonder the late, great Lou Reed embraced Yeezus, since it's basically the Metal Machine Music concept translated into futuristic hip-hop, all industrial overload and hypertense egomania and hostile vibes." [...] Exclaim! also named it the hip hop album of the year. NME named it the second best album of the year calling it [...] "his most sonically challenging album to date." [...] Stereogum, TIME and Complex also named Yeezus the best album of 2013. It was also nominated in two categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards including for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for [...] "New Slaves". West responded unfavorably to this due to not receiving more nominations. He then addressed the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at one of his concerts and referred to it as patronizing.|$|E
