2500|$|Seen as a [...] "machine of war," [...] the Mongol {{horse is}} an all-terrain, <b>all-weather</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{requiring}} little gas or maintenance and providing excellent mileage. [...] A warrior relied on his herd to {{provide him with}} staple foods of milk and meat; hide for bowstrings, shoes, and armor; dried dung {{to be used as}} fuel for his fire; hair for rope, battle standards, musical instruments and helmet decorations; milk also used for shamanistic ceremonies to ensure victory; and for hunting and entertainment that often served as military training. [...] If he died in battle, a horse would sometimes be sacrificed with him to provide a mount for the afterlife.|$|E
50|$|An {{enclosed}} driver's cab {{was available}} as option starting in 1953, making the Unimog a true <b>all-weather</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The LAV-25 is an all-terrain, <b>all-weather</b> <b>vehicle</b> with night capabilities. It is air {{transportable}} via C-130, C-17 Globemaster, and C-5 Galaxy. When combat loaded {{there are}} 210 ready rounds and 420 stowed rounds of 25 mm ammunition {{as well as}} 400 ready rounds and 1200 stowed rounds of 7.62mm. There are 8 ready rounds and 8 stowed rounds of smoke grenades. A supplementary M240G 7.62mm machine gun can be pintle-mounted at the vehicle commander's station in the turret. The LAV-25 is fully amphibious with a maximum of 3 minutes preparation.|$|E

Essex is notable for developing the first affordable mass-produced enclosed automobile in 1922. Because {{of the success of}} the inexpensive enclosed Essex Coach line, the American automobile industry shifted away from open touring cars in order to meet consumer demand for <b>all-weather</b> passenger <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Unmanned ground {{vehicles}} {{are one of}} the enlightening ideas that will shape our future by providing enhanced safety and improved mobility. Although the development of prototypes is still going on, we are now assisting to demonstrations that witness the real applicability of the early concepts. THE history of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) developed in the last 20 - 25 years. In fact, although the first ideas were born in the sixties, the level of maturity of the technology at that time did not allow to afford the original goal of implementing fully autonomous all-terrain <b>all-weather</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The first documented prototypes of automated vehicles were developed by a few groups in the military arena in the mid eighties. The initial stimulus that had triggered these innovative ideas had been provided by the military sector, who was eager to provide complete automation to its fleet of ground vehicles. It was not before the eighties that this interest was then transferred to the civil sector: governments worldwide launched the first projects which conveyed a large number of researchers over these topics. But the interest of the automotive industry in developing real products-and thus investing money in this new business- started to develop only when the feasibility studies were successfully over and the first prototypes were demonstrated. The test of autonomous vehicles on real roads in a real environment {{was one of the most}} important milestones in the history of unmanned ground vehicles. This happened in the mid-late nineties. We are now assisting to a flourishing of research initiatives oriented to intelligent vehicles. Anyway, due to many technological issues and legal considerations, full autonomy was not set as a goal: the automotive industry feels as its primary goal the need to equip vehicles with supervised systems and-more generally-ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) instead of automatic pilots. At the same time the research on UGVs then slowed down, since it was not felt as a primary strategic area of investment any more by neither industry nor governments...|$|R

5000|$|In 1970, a Subaru {{dealership}} {{received a}} special order {{request from the}} Tohoku Electric Power Company for Subaru to build an <b>all-weather</b> <b>vehicle</b> with 4WD, as the company was currently using jeeps that were open to the weather. The jeeps could not seal out the cold weather, {{and did not have}} adequate heaters for winter use. The 4WD traction was advantageous in traveling on poor roads, but the jeeps were of a 30-year-old design and something more modern was desired. A car with 4WD would be more comfortable. Tohoku Electric asked that the Subaru 1000 station wagon be converted from front-wheel drive to 4WD. Given the design of the drivetrain being used in Subarus of the time, it was considered relatively easy to simply attach a driveshaft {{to the back of the}} transmission and add a rear differential that powered the rear wheels. A transfer case was also installed so that the 4WD system could be disengaged with an additional gearshift lever installed next to the transmission gearshift.|$|E
